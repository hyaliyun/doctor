RESULTS: Of 614 patients (median age 69 years, (IQR 25) and 62% male), 381 (62%) had been discharged alive, 178 (29%) died and 55 (9%) remained hospitalized at censoring. Severe hypoxemia (aOR 4.25, 95%CI 2.36-7.64), leukocytosis (aOR 2.35, 95%CI 1.35-4.11), thrombocytopenia (aOR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.01, increase per 10x9 decrease), severe renal impairment (aOR 5.14, 95%CI 2.65-9.97), and low albumin (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.09, increase per g decrease) were associated with death. Forty percent (244) were from black, Asian and other minority ethnic (BAME) groups, 38% (235) white and for 22% (135) ethnicity was unknown. BAME patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities. Whilst the unadjusted odds of death did not differ by ethnicity, when adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities, black patients were at higher odds of death compared to whites (aOR 1.69, 95%CI 1.00-2.86). This association was stronger when further adjusting for admission severity (aOR 1.85 95% CI 1.06-3.24).

Development of vaccines can be the most prominent approach to prevent the virus to cause COVID-19 and hence will play a vital role in controlling the spread of the virus and reducing mortality. This study was conducted to review the current pipeline of vaccines in clinical trials for the COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a review of clinical trials of vaccines for COVID-19 using trial data obtained from the and World Health Organisation (WHO) registries and performed an analysis. We also assessed active vaccine development projects that had completed one clinical phase but were yet to start the next. Results: A total of 125 vaccines in 365 trials assessing the efficacy and safety for COVID-19: 36 vaccines in phase III, 49 in phase II, and 35 in phase I. As of June, 2021, there were 18 vaccines approved for COVID-19. Of these, seven approved by WHO, three by US FDA, and four by EMA. Among the approved vaccines, eight were inactivated, five were non-replicating viral vector, three were RNA, and two were protein subunit. Among the top five vaccines approved in most number of countries, Oxford/AstraZeneca AZD1222 approved in 115 countries, followed by Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 in 89 countries, Gamaleya Sputnik V in 68 countries, Moderna mRNA-1273 in 53 countries), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Ad26.COV2.S in 52 countries, and Sinopharm (Beijing) BBIBP-CorV in 53 countries. Conclusions: Emerging COVID-19 will continue to pose significant challenges to the global community.

They have been proposed to deliver an infrastructure-light, cost-economical solution giving results within half an hour. METHODS: LFDs were initially reviewed by a Department of Health and Social Care team, part of the UK government, from which 64 were selected for further evaluation from 1st August to 15th December 2020. Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). FINDINGS: 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics (orient Gene, Deepblue, Abbott and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test). All these LFDs have a viral antigen detection of >90% at 100,000 RNA copies/ml. 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1C6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20C0.48). Viral antigen detection/sensitivity across the sampling cohort when performed by laboratory scientists was 78.8% (156/198, 95% CI 72.4C84.3). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission. FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care. University of Oxford.

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the difference in postoperative pain between the two procedures, focusing on whether LESS was conducted with a non-expanding port (LESSnonex) or a port expanding (LESSex) within the incision. METHOD EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on LESS versus CLS for general abdominal procedures. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS A total of 29 RCTs with 2999 procedures were included. Pain (VAS 0-10) 6 h after surgery was significantly lower in the group where LESS was conducted with LESSnonex compared to CLS, WMD=-0.72 (- 1.10 to - 0.33). Pain 18-24 h was significantly higher in the group where LESS was conducted with LESSex compared to CLS, WMD = 0.38 (0.01-0.75). Wound-related complications were significantly more frequent in LESSex procedures compared to CLS, OR = 1.94 (1.03-3.63). CONCLUSION The present meta-analysis indirectly indicates that the type of access device that is used for an abdominal LESS procedure may contribute to the development of early postoperative pain as the use of a non-expanding model was associated with a more advantageous outcome. Direct randomized comparison of LESSnonex and LESSex is warranted to confirm if the use of expanding access devices generates more pain and wound complications.","output":"The use of expanding ports in laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery may cause more pain: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has dominated discussion and caused global healthcare and economic crisis over the past 18 months. Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) causes mild-to-moderate symptoms in most individuals.

Early identification by risk stratifying such patients who are at risk of severe complications of COVID-19 is of great clinical importance. Computed tomography (CT) is widely available and offers the potential for fast triage, robust, rapid, and minimally invasive diagnosis: Ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern (GGO with superimposed septal thickening), and consolidation are the most common chest CT findings in COVID pneumonia. There is growing interest in the prognostic value of baseline chest CT since an early risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 would allow for better resource allocation and could help improve outcomes.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: This observational study involved patients with T1D using the real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) Dexcom G6(?). Ambulatory glucose profile data from the 3-months before schools closure (November 26, 2019CFebruary 23, 2020; T0) and from the 3-months of consecutive lockdown (February 24CMay 18, 2020; T1) were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-two children and adolescents (11.1  4.37 years, 50% males) with T1D (median time disease 3.67 years) were enrolled in the study. Insulin total daily dose was unchanged, while time spent on physical activities was decreased (p<0.0001). Despite the lack of statistical significance, median value of the glucose management indicator decreased from 7.4% to 7.25%. Glucose standard deviation (p<0.0001) and coefficient of variation (p=0.001) improved across the study.

Our patients are not routinely seen by a dietitian. Methods: As a pilot project, all patients receiving either sequential or concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for lung cancer between May and November 2020, were identified by the lead lung radiographer and bookings team and referred to a specialist oncology dietitian. These patients were offered up to 3 routine fortnightly assessments on treatment. We recorded their symptoms (based on a standardised tool, PG-SGA) and weight during treatment. Results: 15 patients were referred to the dietitian: 7 male, 8 female. All patients accepted dietetic review. The median age was 64 years old;mean age 63 years old (range 50-79). The mean average number of cycles of chemotherapy was 3.4. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy was given to 11 patients, with the remaining 4 having sequential treatment. Of all patients, 1 had small cell lung cancer, 1 had a mixed adenocarcinoma and small cell. The remaining 13 were non-small cell lung cancers, and of these 6 were adenocarcinomas and 6 were squamous cell carcinomas and 1 mixed histology. All patients were reviewed at least twice whilst on treatment. The most complete data was for the review in weeks 3/4 of radiotherapy. All 15 patients had scores for this time point. Mean number of symptoms was 5.5 (range 3-9). The commonest symptoms were fatigue (100%), loss of appetite (67%), pain (67%) and dysphagia (60%). For 12 patients receiving 6 weeks of radiotherapy median symptom number increased from 5 in 1st 2 weeks, to 5.5 in weeks 2nd 2 weeks, to 6.5 in final 2 weeks. All patients in this group lost weight. Median weight loss during treatment was 6.6% (range 1.8-15.9%). All patients received food fortification advice throughout their treatment and advice on symptom management. The symptom management advice for 12 of the 15 patients either reinforced advice, or, made adjustments to the timing of medications prescribed by medical or nursing staff. The other 3 patients did not have an existing prescription, and so recommendations were made of medications to manage symptoms, e.g. oxcetacaine, anti-emetics and laxatives. Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) were recommended if patients were not meeting their estimated nutritional requirements from dietary assessment. Seven patients received ONS prescription in addition to the food fortification advice. One patient declined an ONS prescription. Conclusion: 1. Routine dietetic review during radical chemo-radiotherapy is feasible and occurred successfully during the COVID-19 pandemic. It led to some simple, but vital changes in practice such as weekly weighing of patients on treatment 2. Patients undergoing chemo-radiotherapy have a high symptom burden. 3. All patients receiving 6 weeks of radiotherapy lost weight during treatment. 4. We received positive feedback from patients.

Aim: In light of the dynamic developments and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the care of people in need of long-term care the following questions arise: How do leaders of care facilities perceive the challenges, how burdened are they and how do they cope with these? METHODS: Leaders from outpatient and inpatient nursing and hospice care facilities were contacted by e-mail to participate in an online survey. Closed questions were analysed descriptively, open information was analysed by content analysis. RESULTS: From of 4,333 nursing facilities contacted, usable information was available from 525 persons. The greatest pandemic-related, interdependent challenges include concern about infections of patients and employees, procurement of protective equipment, compliance with hygiene regulations, inconsistency and lack of transparency of information and guidelines that are important for work, and loss of income and lead to a cascade of burdens. Around 40 % of respondents are uncertain whether they can cope with these. According to the respondents, the well-being and presenteeism of the leaders surveyed has deteriorated in the course of the pandemic outbreak and they appeared to be more often ill at work. Financial and structural measures, the strengthening of social cohesion and explanation were mentioned as coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The results show an increase in challenges and illustrate interdependent pandemic-related burdens. These are mainly met by overtime and additional effort, especially on the part of leaders.

The Improving Community Health Workers (ICHWs) Project of Save the Children piloted a CC-centered health service (CCHS) model that strengthened community and local government engagement, harmonized the work of different CHW cadres who were working in the same catchment area of each CC, and improved the accountability of CHWs and the CC to the local community. METHODS: We describe the process for developing and implementing the CCHS model in 6 unions in Barishal District where the model was piloted and provide some early qualitative and quantitative findings pertaining to the model's effectiveness. Data were collected from CCs in the 6 pilot unions and 6 other unions that served as a control. Qualitative data were collected from the intervention area during the pre-pilot (October 2017CSeptember 2018) and pilot phase (October 2018CSeptember 2019). Document review, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were also conducted. Maternal and child health service utilization data were extracted from the government health information system in both the intervention and control areas. RESULTS: Community group meetings ensured engagement with local government authorities and supported resource mobilization. There was greater coordination of work among CHWs and increased motivation of CHWs to better serve their clients. The analysis showed that the increase in maternal health consultations was substantially greater in the intervention area than in the control area, as was the number of referrals for higher-level care. CONCLUSION: The CCHS model as applied in this pilot project is effective in engaging local key stakeholders, increasing CHW capacity, and improving client satisfaction. The model demonstrated that a community health system can be strengthened by a comprehensive approach that engages communities and local government officials and that harmonizes the work of CHWs.","output":"Learnings From a Pilot Study to Strengthen Primary Health Care Services: The Community-Clinic-Centered Health Service Model in Barishal District, Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have higher rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE).Higher mortality rates have been reported in severe cases of COVID-19 including those who have elevated D-dimer levels and have thromboembolic phenomena. Objective The objective of this retrospective and observational study was to ascertain which type and dosages of anticoagulation provide a mortality benefit and decrease the risk of developing VTE. Methods We evaluated the risk factors for VTEs in patients with a confirmed polymerase chain reaction test positive for COVID-19 who were admitted to our facility from April 1 to July 1, 2020. In addition, we performed a logistic regression to examine the relationship between mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, specific risk factors outlined in the study, D-dimer, ferritin, prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Patients with a history of VTE, those already on anticoagulation (AC) prior to hospitalization, and patients on comfort care were excluded from study. Results There were originally 331 patients in the data set. Of those, 111 patients were excluded based on exclusion criteria and 4 additional patients were removed as they were the only individual patients in their specific AC covariant group. The analysis was performed on the remaining 216 patients. We divided the AC medications administered to the patients into five separate covariates: 1. enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous (sq) daily, 2. enoxaparin 40 mg sq every 12 hours (q12h), 3. heparin 5000 mg sq q12h, 4. heparin 5000 mg sq every 8 hours (q8h), 5. Patients taking multiple AC or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis medications. 6. No AC and examined them via logistic regression for mortality at 28 days and 60 days (Table 1). Patients in enoxaparin 40 mg daily group had statistically significant lower 28 day mortality. There was no statistically significant relationship between the use of enoxaparin 40 mg q12h and 28 day mortality rate. Patients in both heparin groups did not have significantly lower 28 day mortality rates. Patients in groups 5 & 6 had significantly higher 28 day mortality rates (Table 1). It is important to note that 33 patients underwent a pulmonary computed tomography angiography due to concern for pulmonary embolism and 38 patients underwent an ultrasound of their lower extremities to rule out the development of DVT. For patients with additional risk factors defined as chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, organ transplant recipient, obesity (BMI > 30), cardiac disease (heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy), sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus and smoking history, the odds of death at 28 days increased by a factor of 1.71, at 60 days by a factor of 1.63 and being admitted to the ICU by a factor of 1.41. Patients with 3-5 risk factors are 2.48 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU than patients with 0-2 risk factors. Patients with 4 or 5 risk factors are 3.56 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU than patients with 0-3 risk factors (Table 2). Predictably, patients that were admitted to the ICU had a significantly increased rate of mortality compared to those who were not (Table 3). Per our analysis, there was no relationship between PT or INR and mortality. At 28 days and 2 months, the D-dimer > 4000 was indicative of a higher odds of death versus patients with a D-dimer < 4000. An increased ferritin was also indicative of a higher mortality rate (Table 4). Conclusion Patients receiving enoxaparin 40 mg daily benefited more than any other AC regimen with respect to the development of VTE at both 28 days and 2 months. Increasing the dosing to twice daily did not decrease mortality. Additionally, patients receiving heparin did not have a decreased mortality. It is important to note that there was no standard protocol used to determine which patients received daily or twice daily dosing. The type and dose of AC was determined based on the clinical judgment of intensivists in each case. It is also possible that patients with severe COVID-19 infection were more likely to be given twice daily dosing which could account for the lack of mortality benefit with more frequent dosing. We did not report bleeding rates in AC groups in our study and this can be a possible reason for no mortality benefit among higher dose AC groups.

However, practical studies have often criticized this linear regression model due to its sensitivity to departure from the normality and from the partial nonlinearity. This paper proposes to solve these potential issues simultaneously in the context of the partial linear regression model by assuming that the random errors follow a scale-mixture of normal (SMN) family of distributions. The proposed method allows us to model data with great flexibility, accommodating heavy tails, and outliers. By implementing the B-spline function and using the convenient hierarchical representation of the SMN distributions, a computationally analytical EM-type algorithm is developed to perform maximum likelihood inference of the model parameters. Various simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample properties as well as the robustness of the model in dealing with the heavy-tails distributed datasets.

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, nucleic acids, and so forth. Herein, we report a modified version of the MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). We first demonstrated the performance of this MPS system for bioassay-related applications. Using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a model, we have achieved a detection limit of 125 nM (equal to 5 pmole) for detecting spike protein molecules in the liquid phase. In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration-dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin were also investigated. Results show that by using a lower concentration/amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to a lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower concentration-response indicates the possibility of improved bioassay sensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.","output":"Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy with One-Stage Lock-In Implementation for Magnetic Bioassays with Improved Sensitivities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various entrepreneurship initiatives benefit from advanced technology and information in fields like geography and demography.

Both drugs can alter cardiac electrophysiology and have been associated with drug-induced arrhythmias. Meanwhile, sympathetic activation is commonly observed during systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., in SARS-CoV-2 infection) and may influence the electrophysiological effects of CQ and AZM. Here, we investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on proarrhythmic properties of CQ and AZM using detailed in silico models of ventricular electrophysiology. Concentration-dependent alterations in ion-channel function were incorporated into the Heijman canine and O'Hara-Rudy human ventricular cardiomyocyte models. Single and combined drug effects on action-potential (AP) properties were analyzed using a population of 1,000 models accommodating inter-individual variability. Sympathetic stimulation was simulated by increasing pacing rate and experimentally validated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced changes in ion-channel function. In the canine ventricular model at 1 Hz pacing, therapeutic doses of CQ and AZM (5 and 20 M, respectively) individually prolonged AP duration (APD) by 33 and 13%. Their combination produced synergistic APD prolongation (+161%) with incidence of proarrhythmic early afterdepolarizations in 53.5% of models. Increasing the pacing frequency to 2 Hz shortened APD and together with 1 M ISO counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. No afterdepolarizations occurred following increased rate and simulated application of ISO. Similarly, CQ and AZM individually prolonged APD by 43 and 29% in the human ventricular cardiomyocyte model, while their combination prolonged APD by 76% without causing early afterdepolarizations. Consistently, 1 M ISO at 2 Hz pacing counteracted the drug-induced APD prolongation. Increasing the ICa,L window current produced afterdepolarizations, which were exacerbated by ISO. In both models, reduced extracellular K+ reduced the repolarization reserve and increased drug effects. In conclusion, CQ- and AZM-induced proarrhythmia is promoted by conditions with reduced repolarization reserve. Sympathetic stimulation limits drug-induced APD prolongation, suggesting the potential importance of heart rate and autonomic status monitoring in particular conditions (e.g., COVID-19).","output":"Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation Modulates the Cellular Proarrhythmic Effects of Chloroquine and Azithromycin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Blood eosinophil count has been proposed as a predictor of response to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD. An optimal threshold of blood eosinophil count for prescribing ICS has not been agreed. Doubt has been cast on the role by observational studies. The role of inhaled corticosteroids in this relationship, independent of long-acting bronchodilators, has not been examined. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of post-hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies examining three blood eosinophil thresholds and the independent role of ICS. Included studies were categorised by the form (relative or absolute count) and cut point of eosinophil threshold used. Thresholds assessed were relative eosinophil count of 2%, and absolute counts of 150 cells/L and 300 cells/L. Three meta-analyses of the effect of ICS use in post-hoc analyses of RCTs based on these counts were carried out. Initial analysis included all studies of ICS vs. any non-ICS regimen. Further analysis examined the effect of ICS, independent of the effect of long-acting bronchodilators. RESULTS Sixteen studies examined the association between blood eosinophil count and response of exacerbation risk to ICS, in COPD patients. Eleven studies (25,881 patients) were post-hoc analyses of RCTs. Five studies (109,704 patients) were retrospective observational studies. The independent effect of ICS on the reduction of exacerbation risk was 20% at 2% blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85), 35% at 150 cells/L blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.65; 0.52-0.79), and 39% at 300 cells/L blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.61; 0.44-0.78). No association was found in four out of five observational studies. CONCLUSION This is the first systematic review to assess, in post-hoc analyses of RCTs, the independent effect of ICS in reducing the risk of COPD exacerbation across a range of blood eosinophil thresholds. Association between ICS prescription and reduced exacerbation risk at these thresholds was confirmed. The lack of association found in the observational studies questions the relevance of these observations to a \\"real world\\" COPD population. To clarify the clinical utility of this biomarker, the association should be tested in prospective effectiveness studies.","output":"Blood eosinophil count, a marker of inhaled corticosteroid effectiveness in preventing COPD exacerbations in post-hoc RCT and observational studies: systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: Covid derailed multiple facets of emergency medicine (EM) residency training, including the need to move from in-person to online weekly didactics. While online education has been used within 90% of medical schools, it has not traditionally been used for residency education. Recent studies evaluating post-graduate residents' perception of online education found a receptive audience eager to incorporate the modality. To date, no study has analyzed how EM programs are approaching online education, including content, efficacy, and attendance etiquette. Methods: As part of a process improvement project, an online Survey Monkey questionnaire was sent out to 180 EM residency program directors and coordinators. The survey was open from November 2020 to March 2021. Results: We received 52 responses from program directors and coordinators from all regions of the United States with a majority from academic or university-affiliated programs. Due to COVID-19, over 90% of programs shifted to an online didactic platform with only 10% maintaining in-person didactics. Zoom has been the preferred modality utilized at 89% of programs we surveyed with minimal security and techinical issues. Program consensus was that residents should be on time or no more than 5-minutes late for credit (42% of programs), have video cameras on (52% of programs), and appear attentive (44% of programs). Virtual etiquette was also examined, including screen presence: upright posture (less than 18% of programs reported accountable), background (less than 10%), and lighting (less than 6%). A majority of programs had not set expectations for screen presence. If not presenting, the dress code is generally at the residents discretion and was noted to be casual (52%). Sixty percent of programs reported increased faculty attendance since moving to a virtal conference. Programs also reported maintiaing consistency in content (62% of programs), increased utilization of guest speakers (50% of programs), use of national platforms (21% of programs), and maintaing small group sessions (77% of programs). Many residency programs do not record didactics, and only 15% offer credit if lectures are watched at a later date. When safely able, over 65% of programs plan to return to in-person didactics. Conclusion: The online learning platform provides opportunities and proves challenges. Many programs have shifted to online learning and diversified their curriculum. EM residency training requires a strong foundation in core content, which may not entirely be suited for an online platform. This coupled with the loss of face-to-face learning may reflected in the desire for programs to return to in-person learning. The benefits of online learning, which include accessibility, flexibility, and broader reach of topics should not be neglected.

Owing to current lifestyle changes, the increasing burden of CVD and importance of healthy behaviours, the need for strategies to increase uptake of healthy lifestyles among sub-Saharan African populations are apparent. This study explored the factors influencing uptake of healthy lifestyle practices among adults following implementation of a community CVD prevention programme. METHODS: This was a descriptive qualitative study conducted among purposively selected adults who had engaged in a community CVD prevention programme. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Study transcripts were read into NVIVO 12.6 software for coding and analysis guided by thematic analysis following the semantic approach. RESULTS: This study found variations in uptake of healthy lifestyle practices for CVD prevention with most changes reported for dietary behaviour especially in vegetable and fruit intake, reduction of salt intake and fats and oils consumption. Changes in physical activity were also notable. On the other hand, participants were slow in making changes in alcohol consumption, smoking behaviours and stress reduction. The barriers to uptake of healthy lifestyle practices were individual such as limited capability or skills, structural such as limited physical activity facilities, and social such as cultural and peer influence. Relatedly, the facilitators of practices uptake were individual including knowledge and personal determination to change, and social including social support from family and the community. CONCLUSIONS: Insights from understanding the uptake of lifestyle practices should guide planning and design of community programmes with an emphasis on removing barriers and strengthening facilitators building on the intermediate motivating factors and considering individual needs and expectations.","output":"Understanding factors influencing uptake of healthy lifestyle practices among adults following a community cardiovascular disease prevention programme in Mukono and Buikwe districts in Uganda: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems to identify areas for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policymaking. However, data about the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza sentinel surveillance system (ISSS) in DRC during 2012C2015. The performance of the system was evaluated using eight surveillance attributes: (i) data quality and completeness for key variables, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed and described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Scores for each indicator were as follows: < 60% weak performance; 60C79% moderate performance; 80% good performance. RESULTS: During 2012C2015, we enrolled and tested 4339 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and 2869 patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 11 sentinel sites situated in 5 of 11 provinces. Influenza viruses were detected in 446 (10.3%) samples from patients with ILI and in 151 (5.5%) samples from patients with SARI with higher detection during DecemberCMay. Data quality and completeness was > 90% for all evaluated indicators. Other strengths of the system were timeliness, simplicity, stability and utility that scored > 70% each. Representativeness, flexibility and acceptability had moderate performance. It was reported that the ISSS contributed to: (i) a better understanding of the epidemiology, circulating patterns and proportional contribution of influenza virus among patients with ILI or SARI; (ii) acquisition of new key competences related to influenza surveillance and diagnosis; and (iii) continuous education of surveillance staff and clinicians at sentinel sites about influenza. However, due to limited resources no actions were undertaken to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed overall satisfactorily and provided reliable and timely data about influenza circulation in DRC. The simplicity of the system contributed to its stability. A better use of the available data could be made to inform and promote prevention interventions especially among the most vulnerable groups.","output":"Evaluation of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2012C2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship making an international journey, which led to quarantine of the ship at Yokohama Port, Japan.

METHODS One autopsy case of diagnosed SARS was investigated. Lung puncture was performed immediately after the patient died, and the autopsy was done after 12 h. The specimens from lymph nodes, spleen, small intestine, colon and bone marrow were studied by immunohistochemical technique. The antibodies used included CD20, CD45RO (UCHL-1), CD4, CD8, CD68 and CD34. RESULTS The principal lesions of the SARS case consisted of acute lobular intrastitial pneumonia, hyaloid membranes of pulmonic alveoli and hyperplasia and shedding of alveolar epithelium of. Virus-like inclusions occasionally contained cytoplasm of the alveolar epithelium, which were positive by histochemical staining. The adjacent blood-vessels were changed by hyperplasia and enlargement. The structures of lymph nodes and spleen were damaged with lymph follicles depletion and splenic nodules atrophy. The specific changes included reduction of lymphocytes and hyperplasia of histiocytes, depletion of the follicles of small intestine and colon wall, decreased hyperplasia of the bone marrow and increased number of the megakaryocyte. Meanwhile, in the immunohistochemical study, CD(20)(+) B cells were fully expressed in lymph nodes and spleen, and the CD45RO (UCHL-1)(+) T cells were scatteredly expressed. The number of CD4(+) help T cell was markedly decreased, while the number of CD8+ poisonal T cells increased, and the ratio of the former and latter was no more than 0.5. Under the electronic microscopy observation, virus-like particles with 80 - 160 nm diameter and halo or garland envelope were found in mononuclear macrophage and cytoplasm of alveolar epithelium. CONCLUSION The specific lesions of SARS consist of lobular intrastitial pneumonia with the formation of hyaline membranes of lung, haemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation of blood vessels and the damages of extralung lymphohemopioetic system. The damages were very similar to the pathological features of tissues infected by human immunodeficiency virus, in which numbers of T cells decreased and CD(4)(+) T cell/CD(8)(+) T cell ratio was no more than 0.5.

This in vitro study applies angiographic analysis of intra-aneurysmal flow to compare the flow-diversion performance of five neurovascular devices in idealized sidewall and bifurcation aneurysm models. Methods Five commercial devices (Enterprise, Neuroform, LVIS, FRED, and Pipeline) were implanted in silicone sidewall and bifurcation aneurysm models under physiological average flow of blood analog fluid. High-speed angiographic images were acquired pre- and post-device implantation and contrast concentration-time curves within the aneurysm were recorded. The curves were quantified with five parameters to assess changes in contrast transport, and thus aneurysm hemodynamics, due to each device. Results Inter-device flow-diversion performance was more easily distinguished in the sidewall model than the bifurcation model. There were no obvious overall statistical trends in the bifurcation parameters but the Pipeline performed marginally better than the other devices. In the sidewall geometry, overall evidence suggests that the LVIS performed better than the Neuroform and Enterprise. The Pipeline and FRED devices were statistically superior to the three stents and Pipeline was superior to FRED in all sidewall parameters evaluated. Conclusions Based on this specific set of experiments, lower-porosity flow diverters perform significantly better in reducing intra-aneurysmal flow activity than higher-porosity stents in sidewall-type geometries.

Based on several manufactured mechanical ventilators, two proposed designs are investigated in this study. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is used for solving any problems with the first design, and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis with moving boundary is used for solving any issues with the second design. For this purpose, ANSYS Workbench platform is used to solve the set of equations. The results showed that the Ambu-bag-based mechanical ventilator exhibited difficulties in controlling ventilation variables, which certainly will cause serious health problems such as barotrauma. The mechanical ventilator based on piston-cylinder is more satisfactory with regards to delivered parameters to the patient. The ways to obtain pressure control mode (PCM) and volume control mode (VCM) are identified.

However, the clinical significance of the LUS score in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of the LUS score in patients with COVID-19. Methods: : The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones and was performed in 280 consecutive patients with COVID-19. The LUS score based on B-lines, lung consolidation and pleural line abnormalities was evaluated. Results: : The median time from admission to LUS examinations was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-10). Patients in the highest LUS score group were more likely to have a lower lymphocyte percentage (LYM%);higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, hypersensitive troponin I and creatine kinase muscle-brain;more invasive mechanical ventilation therapy;higher incidence of ARDS;and higher mortality than patients in the lowest LUS score group. After a median follow-up of 14 days [IQR, 10-20 days], 37 patients developed ARDS, and 13 died. Patients with adverse outcomes presented a higher rate of bilateral involvement;more involved zones and B-lines, pleural line abnormalities and consolidation;and a higher LUS score than event-free survivors. The Cox models adding the LUS score as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.021.08;P < 0.001;Akaike Information Criterion [AIC] =272;C-index = 0.903) or as a categorical variable (HR: 10.76, 95% CI: 2.7542.05;P = 0.001;AIC =272;C-index = 0.902) were found to predict poor outcomes more accurately than the basic model (AIC =286;C-index = 0.866).

Fifty-three AMI patients (31 STEMI, 22 NSTEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic were matched to 53 AMI patients before the pandemic. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the matched patients. STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer delay time, less primary or remedial PCI and more emergency thrombolysis than those before the pandemic. Less coronary angiography and stenting were performed in AMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the matched patients. However, STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a 4-fold (12.9% vs. 3.2%) increase in all-cause mortality rate compared with those before the pandemic.

Case Report 39-year-old male with past medical history notable for tobacco abuse and recently diagnosed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy presented to our institution with NYHA Class IV symptoms and was found to be in cardiogenic shock. On admission Covid-19 PCR was negative. He initially responded to the initiation of inotropic support and aggressive diuresis with normalization of his end-organ function and improvement in his symptoms over three days. He suddenly experienced rapid hemodynamic decline necessitating escalation of inotropic and mechanical circulatory support with VA ECMO and Impella 5.5. On that day, his wife felt unwell and was found to be positive for Covid-19. The patient's Covid-19 PCR was repeated and also positive. He underwent treatment with Regeneron. His hospital course was further complicated by multiple sequelae of Covid-19 including pneumonia, acute renal failure necessitating hemodialysis (HD), and Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) presenting with bilateral ascending paralysis extending to his hip flexors, improved with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy. Over a period of two weeks, he demonstrated improvement and was weaned from VA ECMO to Impella 5.5. Unfortunately, he was unable to tolerate weaning the Impella 5.5. He was aggressively rehabilitated. After extensive multidisciplinary discussion, LVAD implantation was recommended to the patient. Following insertion of a HeartMate3 LVAD, the patient demonstrated renal recovery and ongoing improvement in physical ability. He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility and was subsequently discharged home. He will be monitored for listing for cardiac transplantation pending abstinence from tobacco use.

Despite their great impact on mortality, sufficient screening techniques for early diagnosis of OSCC often lack accuracy and thus OSCCs are mostly diagnosed at a late stage. Early detection and accurate recognition of OSCCs would lead to an improved curative result and a reduction in recurrence rates after surgical treatment. The introduction of image recognition technology into the doctor's diagnosis process can significantly improve cancer diagnosis, reduce individual differences, and effectively assist doctors in making the correct diagnosis of the disease. The objective of this study was to assess the precision and robustness of a deep learning-based method to automatically identify the extent of cancer on digitized oral images. We present a new method that employs different variants of convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting cancer in oral cells. Our approach involves training the classifier on different images from the imageNet dataset and then independently validating on different cancer cells. The image is segmented using multiscale morphology methods to prepare for cell feature analysis and extraction. The method of morphological edge detection is used to more accurately extract the target, cell area, perimeter, and other multidimensional features followed by classification through CNN. For all five variants of CNN, namely, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and Xception, the train and value losses are less than 6%.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a major component of the RAAS and a cell surface receptor exploited by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter host cells. A recent molecular modeling study has revealed that the direct renin peptide inhibitor remikiren can bind to the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). By analogy, we postulated that the non-peptidic drug aliskiren, a more potent renin inhibitor than remikiren and a drug routinely used to treat hypertension, may also be able to interact with Mpro. An in silico comparison of the binding of the two compounds to Mpro indicates that aliskiren (E = -75.9 kcal/mol) can form stable complexes with the main viral protease, binding to the active site, as remikiren (E = -83.2 kcal/mol).

METHODS We conducted a three-arm, multicentre, parallel group, open-label, blinded endpoint, phase III, randomised-controlled trial. We stratified eligible participants by baseline aphasia on the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Aphasia Quotient (WAB-R-AQ).

Data were collected from January 6, 2015, to December 20, 2017, and analyzed from October 4, 2019, to October 15, 2020. EXPOSURES: Parental past 12-month exclusive medical prescription opioid use and any misuse (ie, using without a prescription or in any way not directed by a physician). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescent past 12-month medical prescription opioid use or misuse. Multivariable regressions estimated associations between parental and offspring medical prescription opioid use or misuse, controlling for sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Respondents included 9400 mother-child and 5800 father-child dyads in the same household; children were aged 12 to 17 years (52.8% male; mean [SD] age, 14.5 [1.7] years). Controlling for other factors, parental medical prescription opioid use was associated with adolescent prescription opioid medical use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53) and misuse (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25), whereas parental misuse was not. Parental medical prescription stimulant use was associated with adolescent medical prescription opioid use (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91). Parental marijuana use (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13-2.99), parent-adolescent conflict (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.52), and adolescent depression (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.26-2.44) were associated with adolescent prescription opioid misuse. Adolescent delinquency (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38-1.74) and perceived schoolmates drug use (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.95-4.23) were also associated with adolescent misuse and more weakly with medical use (aORs, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.22] and 1.61 [95% CI, 1.32-1.96], respectively).

METHODS In 6 mechanically ventilated patients with poor-grade aSAH, the PaCO? was first decreased to 30 mm Hg by modification of the respiratory rate, then gradually increased to 40, 50 and 60 mm Hg for 15 minutes each setting. Thereafter, the respirator settings were returned to baseline parameters. Intracerebral CBF measurement and brain tissue oxygen saturation (StiO?), measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), were the primary and secondary end points. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was controlled by external ventricular drainage. RESULTS A total of 60 interventions were performed in 6 patients. CBF decreased to 77% of baseline at a PaCO? of 30 mm Hg and increased to 98%, 124%, and 143% at PaCO? values of 40, 50, and 60 mm Hg, respectively. Simultaneously, StiO? decreased to 94%, then increased to 99%, 105%, and 111% of baseline. A slightly elevated delivery rate of cerebrospinal fluid was noticed under continuous drainage. ICP remained constant. After returning to baseline respirator settings, both CBF and StiO? remained elevated and only gradually returned to pre-hypercapnia values without a rebound effect. None of the patients developed secondary cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS Gradual hypercapnia was well tolerated by poor-grade SAH patients.

The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently breaching the borders of Central Asia. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders; however, existing surveillance explains past transmissions while obscuring shifts in the pandemic, increases in infection rates, and the persistence of the transmission of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide enhanced surveillance metrics for SARS-CoV-2 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic, including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence, to better understand the risk of explosive growth in each country and which countries are managing the pandemic successfully. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 60 days of COVID-19-related data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Central Asia region as a function of the prior number of cases, level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the weeks of September 30 to October 6 and October 7-13, 2020, in Central Asia. The region averaged 11,730 new cases per day for the first week and 14,514 for the second week. Infection rates increased across the region from 4.74 per 100,000 persons to 5.66. Russia and Turkey had the highest 7-day moving averages in the region, with 9836 and 1469, respectively, for the week of October 6 and 12,501 and 1603, respectively, for the week of October 13. Russia has the fourth highest speed in the region and continues to have positive acceleration, driving the negative trend for the entire region as the largest country by population. Armenia is experiencing explosive growth of COVID-19; its infection rate of 13.73 for the week of October 6 quickly jumped to 25.19, the highest in the region, the following week. The region overall is experiencing increases in its 7-day moving average of new cases, infection, rate, and speed, with continued positive acceleration and no sign of a reversal in sight. CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic requires novel dynamic surveillance metrics in addition to static metrics to effectively analyze the pandemic trajectory and control spread. Policy makers need to know the magnitude of transmission rates, how quickly they are accelerating, and how previous cases are impacting current caseload due to a lag effect. These metrics applied to Central Asia suggest that the region is trending negatively, primarily due to minimal restrictions in Russia.","output":"Surveillance Metrics of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Central Asia: Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: La actual pandemia de la COVID-19 ha resultado en la interrupcin a nivel mundial de la educacin de las ciencias mdicas de pregrado y posgrado.

Second, we conducted a comparative analysis between the two groups. Overall, results indicated that student's SOC scores increased. Additionally, interpersonal stress scores were lower after the onset of the pandemic than before. There were almost no differences in family relationships, financial conditions, or personality tendencies between the two groups. However, Group 2 did not regain their sense of belonging to school. In this group, the frequency of stress experiences in club activities after the onset of the pandemic, troubles with the opposite gender, and inability to catch up with the contents of the subject lecture were high. The accumulation of small stressors may have hindered the maintenance of a sense of school affiliation.

However, additional research is warranted before personalized mechanical ventilation strategies can be applied at the bedside. Ventilatory parameters should be titrated based on close monitoring of targeted physiologic variables and individualized goals. Although low tidal volume (V(T)) is a standard of care, further individualization of V(T) may necessitate the evaluation of lung volume reserve (e.g., inspiratory capacity). Low driving pressures provide a target for clinicians to adjust V(T) and possibly to optimize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), while maintaining plateau pressures below safety thresholds. Esophageal pressure monitoring allows estimation of transpulmonary pressure, but its use requires technical skill and correct physiologic interpretation for clinical application at the bedside. Mechanical power considers ventilatory parameters as a whole in the optimization of ventilation setting, but further studies are necessary to assess its clinical relevance. The identification of recruitability in patients with ARDS is essential to titrate and individualize PEEP. To define gas-exchange targets for individual patients, clinicians should consider issues related to oxygen transport and dead space.

We examined whether there is phylogenetic signal in virus nucleotide usage patterns that can be used to determine ancestral relationships. The well-studied model of tail morphology in bacteriophage classification was used for comparison with nucleotide usage patterns. Tetranucleotide usage deviation (TUD) patterns were chosen since they have previously been shown to contain phylogenetic signal similar to that of 16S rRNA. RESULTS: We found that bacteriophages have unique TUD patterns, representing genomic signatures that are relatively conserved among those with similar host range. Analysis of TUD-based phylogeny indicates that host influences are important in bacteriophage evolution, and phylogenies containing both phages and their hosts support their co-evolution. TUD-based phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses indicates that they cluster largely based on nucleic acid type and genome size. Similarities between eukaryotic virus phylogenies based on TUD and gene content substantiate the TUD methodology. CONCLUSION: Differences between phenotypic and TUD analysis may provide clues to virus ancestry not previously inferred. As such, TUD analysis provides a complementary approach to morphology-based systems in analysis of virus evolution.","output":"Evidence of host-virus co-evolution in tetranucleotide usage patterns of bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive chromatographic investigation of the ethanolic extract of Alnus japonica Steud stem bark led to the isolation of a new diarylheptanoid named alnuheptanoid A [(5S)-7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methoxyheptan-3-one] (8), together with seven known diarylheptanoid derivatives: platyphyllenone (5), (5S)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methoxyheptan-3-one (6), 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-hepten-3-one (7), hirsutenone (9), (5R)-O-methylhirsutanonol (10), hirsutanonol (11) and oregonin (13), three triterpenes: -amyrin (1), betulinaldehyde (3) and betulinic acid (4), and two sterols: -sitosterol (2) and daucosterol (12).

These incredible tools capable of linking variable payload, generate antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) that preserve targeting properties and therefore, specifically deliver drugs to the cancer cells. The drugs should exhibit sub-nano to picomolar cytotoxicity usually affecting fundamental oncogenic mechanisms via mitotic inhibition, DNA alkylation and topoisomerase poisoning. The linkers play a pivotal role in ADC design as they link the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers maintain the stability of the ADCs in the blood circulation securing their delivery to the cancer cell intact but cleaved when internalized to release the payload. Recently, a more advanced version of ADC, namely theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) ADC has emerged. These conjugates allow visualization of targeted drug delivery (TDD) vastly impacting the therapeutic index in cancer treatment. Among diagnostic probes, NIR fluorescent dyes provide important real-time information on the efficacy of drug delivery. A two-dye system comprising one switchable and one constantly light emitting cyanine (Cy) linkers provides the ratiometric quantification of the drug released in the tumor.

Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift toward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. The observation that only one-third of transmission was presymptomatic at baseline, combined with the finding that NPIs reduced presymptomatic transmission by less than 20%, suggests that the overall impact of NPIs was driven in large part by reductions in transmission following symptom onset. This implies that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as contact tracing and isolation, are particularly important for control of SARS-CoV-2. Interventions which specifically reduce opportunities for presymptomatic transmission, such as quarantine of asymptomatic contacts, are likely to have smaller, but non-negligible, effects on overall transmission.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after symptom onset: impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the remote learning necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, university GIS students did not always have home access to the kinds of software and hardware that they would ordinarily get in their on-campus lab facilities.

The detrimental effect of underweight on reproduction complicates the safety evaluation of anti-obesity drugs, making it challenging to distinguish pathological changes mediated through the intended drug-induced weight loss from direct drug effects on reproductive organs. Four-weeks dosing of normal weight Sprague Dawley rats with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)/glucagon receptor co-agonist induced a robust weight loss, accompanied by histological findings in prostate, seminal vesicles, mammary glands, uterus/cervix and vagina. Characterization of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in male rats revealed reduced hypothalamic Kiss1 mRNA levels and decreased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone concentrations following co-agonist dosing. These alterations resemble hypogonadotropic hypogonadism typically seen in adverse energy deprived conditions, like chronic food restriction. Concomitant daily administration of kisspeptin-52 from day 21 to the end of the four-week co-agonist dosing period evoked LH and testosterone responses without normalizing histological findings. This incomplete rescue by kisspeptin-52 may be due to the rather short kisspeptin-52 treatment period combined with a desensitization observed on testosterone responses. Concomitant leptin treatment from day 21 did not reverse co-agonist induced changes in HPG axis activity.

Lack of an effective treatment for kidney disease-associated pruritus often leads to many problems for these patients and makes it difficult to choose an appropriate treatment. The purpose of this evidence-based hypothesis is to share the scientific reasons and related mechanisms in order to claim that lettuce could be useful in the treatment of uremic pruritus. This hypothesis is based on studies related to lettuce and its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, sedative, hypnotic, nephroprotective, potassium balancing, and blood purification properties. As a result, we suggest that lettuce could be a good choice for improving and reducing uremic pruritus due to its certain characteristics. Although proof of this hypothesis requires further clinical trial studies, this hypothesis can nevertheless lead to formulating an appropriate therapy for uremic-induced pruritus. By conducting a molecular docking study, we investigated the interactions between nineteen natural bioactive components of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and human kappa opioid receptors. The in silico docking studies revealed that most of the ligands showed better antipruritic efficacy than gabapentin.

Pre-pandemic, such changes would have been considered potentially unsafe. This study outlines the impact of lockdown on the incidence and management of ENT emergencies at a large UK centre. METHODS: After modification of pre-pandemic guidelines, ENT emergency referrals data during the UK lockdown were prospectively captured. A comparative analysis was performed with retrospective data from a corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: An overall reduction (p < 0.001) in emergency referrals (n = 119) and admissions (n = 18) occurred during the lockdown period compared to the 2019 period (432 referrals and 290 admissions). Specifically, there were reduced admission rates for epistaxis (p < 0.0001) and tonsillar infection (p < 0.005) in the lockdown period. During lockdown, 90 per cent of patients requiring non-dissolvable nasal packing were managed as out-patients. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 compelled modifications to pre-pandemic ENT guidelines. The enforced changes to emergency care appear to be safe and successfully adopted.

Previous work with well-defined cohorts has explored the determinants of obesity and employed various methods and measures; however, less is known on the broader societal drivers, beyond individual-level influences, using a systems framework with adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore the drivers of obesity from adolescents perspectives using a systems approach through group model building in four South African schools. Group model building was used to generate 4 causal loop diagrams with 62 adolescents aged 16C18 years. These maps were merged into one final map, and the main themes were identified: (i) physical activity and social media use; (ii) physical activity, health-related morbidity, and socio-economic status; (iii) accessibility of unhealthy food and energy intake/body weight; (iv) psychological distress, body weight, and weight-related bullying; and (v) parental involvement and unhealthy food intake. Our study identified meaningful policy-relevant insights into the drivers of adolescent obesity, as described by the young people themselves in a South African context.

Few studies have addressed the basic physical properties of long single-stranded RNAs. Long RNAs with nonrepeating sequences usually adopt highly ramified secondary structures and are better described as branched polymers. To test whether a branched polymer model can estimate the overall sizes of large RNAs, we employed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to examine the hydrodynamic radii of a broad spectrum of biologically important RNAs, ranging from viral genomes to long noncoding regulatory RNAs. The relative sizes of long RNAs measured at low ionic strength correspond well to those predicted by two theoretical approaches that treat the effective branching associated with secondary structure formationone employing the Kramers theorem for calculating radii of gyration, and the other featuring the metric of maximum ladder distance. Upon addition of multivalent cations, most RNAs are found to be compacted as compared with their original, low ionic-strength sizes. These results suggest that sizes of long RNA molecules are determined by the branching pattern of their secondary structures. We also experimentally validate the proposed computational approaches for estimating hydrodynamic radii of single-stranded RNAs, which use generic RNA structure prediction tools and thus can be universally applied to a wide range of long RNAs.","output":"Sizes of Long RNA Molecules Are Determined by the Branching Patterns of Their Secondary Structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The results of a simulation-based evaluation of several policies for vaccine rollout are reported.

The different rates of social contacts among distinct age-groups are informed by a recent survey conducted in Greece. The results are summarised and evaluated in terms of the total number of deaths and infections as well as life years lost. The optimal strategy is found to be one based on fully vaccinating the elderly/at risk as quickly as possible, while extending the time-interval between the two vaccine doses to 12 weeks for all individuals below 75 years old, in agreement with epidemic theory which suggests targeting a combination of susceptibility and infectivity.

As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (>65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration.

The aim of this review is to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of home-based active video games on gait and balance, user compliance, feasibility and safety for pwMS. METHODS: We searched for studies in five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and Science direct) up to October 2020. Selection of studies, extraction of data and methodological quality assessment through the PEDro scale were made independently by two authors and discussed with a third author. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this systematic review. We found significant improvements in balance; results were mixed concerning mobility, physical activity and gait. Home-based active video games are feasible and safe, with good compliance and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (PEDro scale: 5.3  2). CONCLUSION: Overall, home-based active video games were found safe and effective improving static and dynamic balance in pwMS. Compliance was good, probably because it is a motivating and enjoyable training. Active video games can be a relevant alternative for physical rehabilitation at home in pwMS.

The results show that (1) The outer input flow of SARS epidemic in Beijing concentrated on Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, but the outer output flow was disperse and mainly includes several north provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong. And the control measurement should focus on the early and interim progress of SARS breakout.

This paper aims to compare vaccination momentum throughout 2021 and measures of population wellness to estimate the relative impact of each on deaths attributed to COVID-19 across the 50 States of America, plus Washington DC, during 2020 (i.e. the pre-vaccination period) and 2021 (i.e. the vaccination period). Our analysis shows that: (a) COVID-19 rates of death in 2020 are more important, and statistically more significant, at predicting rates of death in 2021 than vaccination momentum during 2021; (b) vaccination momentum does not predict the magnitude of change in COVID-19 rates of death between 2020 and 2021; and (c) for several underlying heath and risk factors vaccination momentum is significantly less important than population wellness at predicting COVID-19 rates of death. Of particular interest are our observations that exercise and fruit consumption are 10.1 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum, obesity (BMI 30+) is 9.6 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum, heart attacks are 4.37 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum and smoking is 3.2 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum.

Through the interpretation of the many models applied to the mental health survey data, we have concluded that the most important factor in predicting the mental health decline of a frontline worker is the healthcare role the individual is in (Nurse, Emergency Room Staff, Surgeon, etc.), followed by the amount of sleep the individual has had in the last week, the amount of COVID-19 related news an individual has consumed on average in a day, the age of the worker, and the usage of alcohol and cannabis.","output":"A Machine Learning Analysis of COVID-19 Mental Health Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV hijack the host molecular machinery to establish infection and survival in infected cells. This has led the scientific community to explore the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, establishes productive infection, and causes life-threatening pathophysiology. Very few targeted therapeutics for COVID-19 currently exist, such as remdesivir. Recently, a proteomic approach explored the interactions of 26 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with cellular targets in human cells and identified 67 interactions as potential targets for drug development. Two of the critical targets, the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs): BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR, are inhibited by the dual inhibitory small molecule SF2523 at nanomolar potency. SF2523 is the only known mTOR PI3K-/(BRD2/BRD4) inhibitor with potential to block two orthogonal pathways necessary for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in human cells. Our results demonstrate that SF2523 effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, showing an IC50 value of 1.5 M, comparable to IC50 value of remdesivir (1.1 M). Further, we demonstrated that the combination of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir is highly synergistic: it allows for the reduction of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir by 25-fold and 4-fold, respectively, to achieve the same potency observed for a single inhibitor. Because SF2523 inhibits two SARS-CoV-2 driven pathogenesis mechanisms involving BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR signaling, our data suggest that SF2523 alone or in combination with remdesivir could be a novel and efficient therapeutic strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence be beneficial in preventing severe COVID-19 disease evolution.

We describe the processes from March 12, 2020 to May 26, 2020, starting from the initial knowledge transfer, expert team formation and management, testing implementation, and concluding with the standalone testing facilities, which used automated processes sufficient to meet testing requirements at that time. In the case presented, the COVID-19 unit was organized by joining human and laboratory resources from five clinical departments at the Split University Hospital Centre. Sample preparation procedures and analyses were launched within the restricted time frame while simultaneously training and organizing new laboratory staff and completing equipment requirements. As a result, the process that started with 30 tests per day was constantly improved over time and reached up to 160 tests per day when MagNA Pure was added to automatize RNA extraction at the end of April. At that pace, the cumulative number of samples soon exceeded the first thousand, and by the end of May it exceeded 4000. The case presented provides an example of good practice for crisis response and organization that successfully enabled sufficient COVID-19 testing capacities within the restricted time frame, human and technical resources. Despite limited understanding of COVID-19 at that time, appropriate management, transfer of knowledge, previous experiences in related laboratory and diagnostic work, as well as interdisciplinary and interdepartmental cooperation proved appropriate to overcome the above limitations and ensure adequate healthcare response.","output":"BUILDING THE COVID-19 TESTING CAPACITIES IN CROATIA: ESTABLISHING THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL COVID-19 UNIT AT THE SPLIT UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CENTRE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report consists of two separate studies on the use of continuous capnography monitoring conducted in an effort to improve patient safety at Virtua Health System.

Patients diagnosed or suspected to have obstructive or central sleep apnea may benefit from the increased surveillance afforded by continuous monitoring. Pain management in this cohort of patients, recovering from bariatric, joint replacement, or other major surgery, often involves administration of opioids (e.g., hydromorphone, morphine sulfate), which are known to increase risk of respiratory depression. Continuous monitoring of these patients increases the likelihood of detecting adverse clinical events.

The outbreaks of Ebola viruses in 2014 represented the most serious Ebola epidemics in history and greatly threatened public health worldwide. The development of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents is therefore quite urgent. In this study, via high throughput screening of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, we identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, teicoplanin also has an inhibitory effect on transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles, with an IC(50) as low as 330 nm. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that teicoplanin is able to block the entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) envelope pseudotyped viruses as well. Teicoplanin derivatives such as dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola, MERS, and SARS viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of additional glycopeptides as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. Notably, given that teicoplanin has routinely been used in the clinic with low toxicity, our work provides a promising prospect for the prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola, MERS, and SARS virus infection.","output":"Glycopeptide Antibiotics Potently Inhibit Cathepsin L in the Late Endosome/Lysosome and Block the Entry of Ebola Virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The construction and application of knowledge graphs have seen a rapid increase across many disciplines in recent years.

This study aims to measure the incremental value of automated quantitative lung CT analysis to clinical CT interpretation. A head-to-head comparison of quantitative CT lung density analysis by parametric response mapping (PRM) with qualitative radiologist performance in BOS diagnosis was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Inspiratory and end-expiratory CTs of 65 patients referred to a post-bone marrow transplant lung graft-versus-host-disease clinic were reviewed by 3 thoracic radiologists for the presence of mosaic attenuation, centrilobular opacities, airways dilation, and bronchial wall thickening. Radiologists' majority consensus diagnosis of BOS was compared with automated PRM air trapping quantification and to the gold-standard diagnosis of BOS as per National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria. RESULTS Using a previously established threshold of 28% air trapping on PRM, the diagnostic performance for BOS was as follows: sensitivity 56% and specificity 94% (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC]=0.75). Radiologist review of inspiratory CT images alone resulted in a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 69% (AUC=0.74). When radiologists assessed both inspiratory and end-expiratory CT images in combination, the sensitivity was 92% and the specificity was 59% (AUC=0.75). The highest performance was observed when the quantitative PRM report was reviewed alongside inspiratory and end-expiratory CT images, with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 73% (AUC=0.83). CONCLUSIONS In the CT diagnosis of BOS, qualitative expert radiologist interpretation was noninferior to quantitative PRM. The highest level of diagnostic performance was achieved by the combination of quantitative PRM measurements with qualitative image feature assessments.","output":"Head-to-head Comparison of Qualitative Radiologist Assessment With Automated Quantitative Computed Tomography Analysis for Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high prevalence of the combination of arterial hypertension (AH) with coronary heart disease (CHD) suggests the improvement of their treatment methods. In this regard, it is of interest to assess the dynamics of the clinical picture of patients against the background of pathogenetically determined subcellular and systemic changes under the influence of laser therapy (LT). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of LT in patients with hypertension in combination with coronary artery disease and trace its relationship with the dynamics of the structure of the lipid bilayer of the erythrocyte membrane and changes in the microvascular bed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 65 male patients (mean age 50.96.3 years) with II-III degree AH in combination with coronary artery disease with angina pectoris. Among them, 40 patients received a 10-day course of LT, and 25 patients underwent simulated laser irradiation. At the initial stage and after 1 month, all patients underwent a bicycle exercise test, a study of the lipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane, including the main fractions of phospholipids and free cholesterol, as well as the level of intracellular Ca2+ and lipid peroxidation products - malondialdehyde and diene conjugates. Microcirculation was assessed using the method of conjunctival biomicroscopy. RESULTS: One month after the course of LT, patients showed a significant increase in exercise tolerance by 37.8%, a decrease in systolic blood pressure with a standard load by 9.9%. The improvement of the clinical picture occurred against the background of a decrease in the activity of lipid peroxidation and structural changes in the cell membrane: an increase in polyunsaturated fractions of phospholipids and a decrease in the cholesterol content, as well as a decrease in the Ca2+ level in the cell from 0.23 [0.19; 0.32] to 0.20 [0.16; 0.26] mmol/l. The results of the analysis of conjunctival biomicroscopy demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the ratio of arteriolovenular calibers, a limitation of the severity of sludge syndrome by 59%, and an almost twofold (from 3.90.52 to 7.21.23 cap/mm2) increase in capillary density.

The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees.

Aptamers are short three-dimensional structures of single-stranded nucleic acids (RNA or DNA), identified by an in vitro process, named systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), starting from a partially random oligonucleotide library. They bind to a molecular target with high affinity and specificity and can be easily modified to optimize binding affinity and selectivity.

A series of deletion mutants constructed from a full- length cDNA clone of the Simian 11 rotavirus VP7 gene were expressed in COS 7 cells. Products from wild-type, and mutants which did not affect the second hydrophobic domain of VP7, were localized by immunofluorescence to elements of the ER only. However, deletions affecting the second hydrophobic domain (mutants 42-61, 43-61, 47-61) showed immunofluorescent localization of VP7 which coincided with that of wheat germ agglutinin, indicating transport to the Golgi apparatus.

Glycosylation of the secreted molecules was inhibited by tunicamycin, resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and therefore of the N-linked complex type. An unglycosylated version of VP7 was also secreted. We suggest that the second hydrophobic domain contributes to a positive signal for ER location and a membrane anchor function.

Criteria for determining who should be tested by PCR vary between countries, and ultimately depend on resource constraints and public health objectives. Decisions are often based on sets of symptoms in individuals presenting to health services, as well as demographic variables, such as age, and travel history. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of sets of symptoms used for triaging individuals for confirmatory testing, with the aim of optimising public health decision making under different scenarios. METHODS: Data from the first wave of COVID-19 in New Zealand were analysed; comprising 1153 PCR-confirmed and 4750 symptomatic PCR negative individuals. Data were analysed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), automated search algorithms, Bayesian Latent Class Analysis, Decision Tree Analysis and Random Forest (RF) machine learning. RESULTS: Clinical criteria used to guide who should be tested by PCR were based on a set of mostly respiratory symptoms: a new or worsening cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, coryza, anosmia, with or without fever. This set has relatively high sensitivity (> 90%) but low specificity (< 10%), using PCR as a quasi-gold standard. In contrast, a group of mostly non-respiratory symptoms, including weakness, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, anosmia and ageusia, explained more variance in the MCA and were associated with higher specificity, at the cost of reduced sensitivity. Using RF models, the incorporation of 15 common symptoms, age, sex and prioritised ethnicity provided algorithms that were both sensitive and specific (> 85% for both) for predicting PCR outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: If predominantly respiratory symptoms are used for test-triaging, a large proportion of the individuals being tested may not have COVID-19. This could overwhelm testing capacity and hinder attempts to trace and eliminate infection. Specificity can be increased using alternative rules based on sets of symptoms informed by multivariate analysis and automated search algorithms, albeit at the cost of sensitivity. Both sensitivity and specificity can be improved through machine learning algorithms, incorporating symptom and demographic data, and hence may provide an alternative approach to test-triaging that can be optimised according to prevailing conditions.

For some residents of Japan it had been a long time coming. Without any laws specifically prohibiting racially discriminatory speech or writing, aggrieved parties had hitherto been forced to resort to indirect lines of protection. In 1999, for example, a Brazilian national ejected from a jewelry shop displaying a poster saying No foreigners allowed obtained a favourable ruling citing Japans ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and in 2013 an injunction for defamation and obstruction of business was granted on behalf of a school for children of North Korean descent repeatedly subjected to provocative demonstrations. But others questioned the need to reinforce limits on freedom of expression even in the face of aggressive taunts, with some claiming that incidents of racial discrimination in Japan lacked the historical, entrenched and violent dimensions that had prompted hate speech laws in Europe and elsewhere. When the text of the proposed law became public there was also debate about its utility as such an abstract measure seemed inapplicable to many potential victims and lacked punitive sanctions. Against this criticism it could be argued that the law went about as far as the government could expect to go if it were to get it passed; that it appears to be curtailing a particularly aggressive form of hate speech; and that it has ushered in a number of more specific initiatives, especially at local level.

Telehealth experiences and challenges encountered by dialysis providers, clinicians, nurses, and patients have exposed health care disparities in areas such as access to care, bandwidth connectivity, availability of devices to perform telehealth, and socioeconomic and language barriers. Future directions in telehealth use, quality measures, and research in telehealth use need to be explored. Telehealth during the public health emergency has changed the practice of health care, with the post-COVID-19 world unlikely to resemble the prior era. The future impact of telehealth in patient care in the United States remains to be seen, especially in the context of the Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative.","output":"Telehealth for Home Dialysis in COVID-19 and Beyond: A Perspective From the American Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Home Dialysis Subcommittee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus pandemic has the potential to cause significant morbidity in the United Kingdom with the risk of demand for hospital bed capacity significantly outstripping supply 1World Health Organisation guidance suggests that up-skill of non-acute medical and dental practitioners for rapid re-deployment into the acute medical environment is a vital task in ensuring appropriate surge capacity resilience 2 We report an upskilling course at our institution Summary of workA two-day course containing four key components was provided to pre-redeployment candidates Day 1: ClassroomCbased teaching introducing COVIDC19, infection prevention control and personal protective equipment use Intermediate life support tutorials and lowCfidelity simulation of a deteriorating patient Day 2: Practical clinical skills session refreshers including venepuncture, cannulation, catheterisation, and arterial blood gas sampling Followed by an opportunity to practice in a series of fully immersive high fidelity acute clinical scenarios proceeded by hot videoCassisted debrief Candidates completed pre and post course questionnaires A follow up post course questionnaire will be sent out one-month post course Unpaired (two tail) t-test analysis was used to analyse participant confidence scores pre and post course Thematic analysis of qualitative feedback was also performed Summary of ResultsEighty-five candidates undertook the course with 76 (89%) completing pre & post questionnaires Significant increases in candidate reported confidence were reported in;assessment of acutely unwell patients, leading a clinical team in the context of an acutely deteriorating patient and in handing over acutely unwell patients to senior acute clinicians Candidates also reported significant confidence score increases regarding non-technical skills such as clinical decision making, demonstration of situational awareness, task management and team working Participant qualitative feedback suggested three main advantages of the course: Simulation useful to tie up key skills learnt and to put skills into context, practical skills sessions useful refresher of common ward based activities, overall the faculty were enthusiastic and engaging and helped candidates to get the most out of the course Discussion and ConclusionsOur two-day multifaceted course provided non-acute medical and dental practitioners with significantly improved self-reported confidence in a number of key technical and non-technical domains Clinical decision making and assessment of the deteriorating patient are critical for the maintenance of patient safety in the acute medical environment, in the context of medical human resource planning for a global pandemic We hope that this course complemented ward based experiential learning at the start of the pandemic ReferencesImperial College London Strengthening hospital capacity for the COVID-19pandemic Available at: https://www imperial ac uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-15-hospital-capacity/(accessed 16 May 2020)Strengthening the Health Systems Response to COVID-19 Technical working guidance Maintaining the delivery of essential health care services freeing up resources for the COVID-19 response while mobilizing the health workforce for the COVID-19 response Available at: http://www euro who int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/436354/strengthening-health-systems-response-COVID-19-technical-guidance-1 pdf, (accessed 14 May 2020)","output":"PG85 Up-skilling the workforce.

Here, plasma-EDTA samples of 30 patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed via untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics and lipidomics. With the same approach, the effect of tocilizumab administration was evaluated in a subset of patients. Despite the heterogeneity of the clinical symptoms, COVID-19 patients are characterized by common plasma metabolomic and lipidomic signatures (91.7% and 87.5% accuracy, respectively, when compared to controls). Tocilizumab treatment resulted in at least partial reversion of the metabolic alterations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Immunological mechanisms in the eye must be tightly regulated to ensure externally mediated injury and infection or internally mediated autoimmunity do not exceed self-defence tolerance. Vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) and their receptors exist in the mammalian eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process and the retina and may have a role in protecting these normally immune privileged sites. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP pathway. A sound blood supply is essential for retinal survival hence vascular compromise will have serious consequences. Retinal vasculitis is a potentially blinding condition with a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases. Compromise of the endothelial barriers and the blood retina barrier (BRB) may instigate inflammatory responses setting up a chain of events involving VNs in a manner which provokes autoimmunity to them. Protection from BRB breakdown may be linked to nitric oxide (NO) effects and actions of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cAMP production. Induced NO expressed under influences of inflammatory mediators evokes neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis and may lead to serious ocular disease including retinal injury. Other inflammatory mediators also play a role in retinal pathology. PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract and PACAP attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons suggesting that compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability though glutamate toxicity. Additional effects of VN compromise would possibly occur through unopposed vasoconstriction and inflammation. Proof of this hypothesis has important implications for treatment and prevention of autoimmune retinopathy and blindness as a number of therapeutic pathways may be opened. Importantly for therapeutic contexts cAMP effects are maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors which could be used in VN autoimmune disorders. A compelling case may exist to undertake a therapeutic trial of VN replacement, PDE inhibitors and other agents in autoimmune retinopathies resulting from possible VN autoimmunity.","output":"Does autoimmunity of endogenous vasoactive neuropeptides cause retinopathy in humans?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The present pilot study examined to what extent the COVID-19 lockdown affected the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in people with dementia and worsened their family caregivers distress The associations between changes in the BPSD of relatives with dementia (RwD) and in their caregivers distress, and sense of social and emotional loneliness, and resilience were also investigated Materials and methods: Thirty-five caregivers of RwD attending formal healthcare services before the lockdown volunteered for the study, and were interviewed by phone during the lockdown Caregivers completed the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess their care recipients BPSD and their own distress, and two questionnaires assessing their social and emotional loneliness, and their resilience Results: No clear changes emerged in either the BPSD of the RwD or the caregivers distress during lockdown compared with before the pandemic Caregivers reporting more frequent and severe BPSD in their RwD before the lockdown scored higher on emotional loneliness Those reporting more frequent and severe BPSD under lockdown, especially men and those taking care of RwD with more advanced dementia, scored higher on both social and emotional loneliness A significant negative correlation also emerged between caregivers resilience and changes in their level of distress due to the lockdown, with female caregivers reporting greater resilience Discussion: Our findings offer preliminary insight on the effects of loneliness and resilience, and on the influence of individual characteristics on the experience and consequences of informal caregiving for RwD in times of restrictions imposed by a pandemic","output":"Caring for People With Dementia Under COVID-19 Restrictions: A Pilot Study on Family Caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuing expansion of social media and big data presents positive opportunities for healthcare research, public health surveillance, and dissemination of health information.

Hematological inflammatory and organ-specific biomarkers are universally practiced in helping clinical decisions in various infectious diseases. Accordingly, their role in predicting progression and severity, and fatal outcome of COVID-19 was investigated to take initial appropriate treatment measures to reduce associated mortality. Methods: The retrospective analysis of a total of 126 COVID-19 cases representing mild, moderate, severe, and succumbed cases were assessed for the pattern of hematological, inflammatory, and organ-specific biomarkers. Results: A total of 126 proven cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively analyzed for the association of various biomarkers with the COVID-19 disease progression. The CBC analysis showed that the median TLC was high for the severe group of both males (12.49 x 103/mcl) and females (14.23 x103/mcl). Similarly, the neutrophil count was also found high in the severe group, whereas the monocytes count showed low median values in severe cases, but both these parameters had no significant difference among the males and the females. The platelet count showed a significant difference (p=0.018) among the non-severe and severe groups between males and females. Among inflammatory markers, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, and APTT showed a higher median value in severe cases among both the males and females while ESR value was higher in non-severe cases and ferritin showed similar values in both severe and non-severe cases. The liver and kidney function parameters were also analyzed and a significant P-value was found for ALP (p=0.004), ALT (p=0.032), and AST (p=0.009) in the non-severe vs. severe category of COVID-19 patients. Discussion: High TLC, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and eosinopenia are the potential risk factor for the progression of COVID-19 disease for severe and fatal outcomes. Inflammatory markers of D-dimer, CRP, LDH, APTT, and ferritin above normal range also carries the potential risk of severe and fatal outcome in COVID-19 disease. Higher ALT, AST, and serum creatinine may also carry a poor prognosis.","output":"A hospital-based study to assess various biomarkers for prognostic prediction of clinical outcome in COVID-19 disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies indicate that the four major types of resistant starch (RS1-4) are fermented in the cecum and colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can alter the microbiome and host physiology. However, nearly all these studies were conducted in rodents fed with a diet that does not approximate what is typically consumed by humans. To address this, mice were fed a Total Western Diet (TWD) based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data that mimics the macro and micronutrient composition of a typical American diet for 6 weeks and then supplemented with 0, 2, 5, or 10% of the RS2, resistant potato starch (RPS), for an additional 3 weeks. The cecal microbiome was analyzed by 16S sequencing. The alpha-diversity of the microbiome decreased with increasing consumption of RPS while a beta-diversity plot showed four discreet groupings based on the RPS level in the diet. The relative abundance of various genera was altered by feeding increasing levels of RPS. In particular, the genus Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group was markedly increased. Cecal, proximal, and distal colon tissue mRNA abundance was analyzed by RNASeq. The cecal mRNA abundance principal component analysis showed clear segregation of the four dietary groups whose separation decreased in the proximal and distal colon. Differential expression of the genes was highest in the cecum, but substantially decreased in the proximal colon (PC) and distal colon (DC). Most differentially expressed genes were unique to each tissue with little overlap in between. The pattern of the observed gene expression suggests that RPS, likely through metabolic changes secondary to differences in microbial composition, appears to prime the host to respond to a range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. In summary, consumption of dietary RPS led to significant changes to the microbiome and gene expression in the cecum and to a lesser extent in the proximal and distal colon.","output":"Resistant Potato Starch Alters the Cecal Microbiome and Gene Expression in Mice Fed a Western Diet Based on NHANES Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The huge demand and consumption of DOX, its incomplete metabolism, and complex behavior in atmosphere are causing a great ecological issue, which needs to be solved.

The adsorption of curcumin and PVA into nanocellulose, and the presence of anionic sulphate groups, which is important for the interaction with viral glycoproteins were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FESEM images showed that the diameter of nanocellulose ranged from 50 to 100 nm, which is closer to the diameter (60C140 nm) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The solubility of poorly water-soluble curcumin was increased from 40.58  1.42 to 313.61  1.05 mg/L with increasing the PVA concentration from 0.05 to 0.8% (w/v) in aqueous medium.

The reason for this variability is unclear but is in critical need of investigation. Some COVID-19 patients have been labeled with 'happy hypoxia,' in which patient complaints of dyspnoea and observable signs of respiratory distress are reported to be absent. Based on ongoing debate, we highlight key respiratory and neurological components that could underlie variation in the presentation of silent hypoxaemia and define priorities for subsequent investigation. Abstract figure legend. Genesis of air hunger. In a working model of mechanisms giving rise to air hunger, brainstem respiratory centers send projections (corollary discharge) to the forebrain, giving rise to breathing discomfort in proportion to the magnitude of corollary discharge (Banzett et al., 2020). These brainstem respiratory centers also send descending projections, driving respiratory motor neurons and respiratory muscle activity to generate ventilation. Inputs to the brainstem centers include chemoreceptor inputs, exercise, and voluntary inputs from the motor cortex. Afferent feedback from lung stretch receptors modulate different qualities of dyspneic sensation. Slowly adapting lung stretch receptors (SAR) are inhibitory to air hunger. Pulmonary C-fiber receptors contribute to air hunger, but precise neural projections are not well understood. Whenever corollary discharge reaches a certain threshold, or when ventilation fails to meet demand, dyspnoea ensues.

To determine the poorly understood role of -arrestin in FPR2 endocytosis and in NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils, Barbadin was used as a research tool in this study. Barbadin has been shown to bind the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) and thereby prevent - arrestin/AP2 interaction and -arrestin-mediated GPCR endocytosis. In agreement with this, AP2/-arrestin interaction induced by an FPR2-specific agonist was inhibited by Barbadin. Unexpectedly, however, Barbadin did not inhibit FPR2 endocytosis, indicating that a mechanism independent of -arrestin/AP2 interaction may sustain FPR2 endocytosis. This was confirmed by the fact, that FPR2 also underwent agonist-promoted endocytosis in -arrestin deficient cells, albeit at a diminished level as compared to wild type cells. Dissection of the Barbadin effects on FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions including NADPH-oxidase activation mediated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotaxis reveled that Barbadin had no effect on chemotactic migration whereas the release of ROS was potentiated/primed. The effect of Barbadin on ROS production was reversible, independent of -arrestin recruitment, and similar to that induced by latrunculin A. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endocytic uptake of FPR2 occurs independently of -arrestin, while Barbadin selectively augments FPR2-mediated neutrophil ROS production independently of receptor endocytosis. Given that Barbadin binds to AP2 and prevents the AP2/-arrestin interaction, our results indicate a role for AP2 in FPR2-mediated ROS release from human neutrophils.","output":"Barbadin selectively modulates FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions independent of receptor endocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, Artemisia annua stem waste was identified, for the first time, as a potential natural source to produce cellulose microfibers (CMF), as well as cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) with unique functionalities by using various organic acids.

In particular, the average directivity factor of the microphone array is proposed as a measure for supporting this selection. The effect of head-related transfer function (HRTF) order truncation that occurs when using too many beamformer directions is presented and studied. In addition, the relation between HOA-based binaural reproduction and BFBR is discussed through analysis based on a spherical array. A simulation study is then presented, based on both a spherical and a planar array, demonstrating the proposed guidelines. A listening test verifies the perceptual attributes of the methods presented in this study. These results can be used for more informed beamformer design for BFBR.","output":"On the selection of the number of beamformers in beamforming-based binaural reproduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of presurgical breast MRI on the surgical management of selected patients with early-stage breast cancer, who were candidates for BCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The trial was built up according to the major European Breast Society. In additional foci classified as BI-RADS 3-4 (4a, 4b, and 4c), a targeted second-look US study was performed. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients underwent presurgical breast MRI. Therapeutic strategy established based on MRI was appropriate in 83.8% of cases. Analysis carried out on the subgroup of patients with dense breast showed that additional foci were found in 41.9% and a greater local extension of the index lesion in 6.4%. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the subgroup of patients with high breast density suggest the importance of a sensitive tool such as MRI in the local staging of breast cancer before treatment planning.

Needless to say, this book has two key words besides sociophysics, and these are evolutionary game and mathematical epidemiology. Game theory is a contemporary mathematical concept founded in the middle of the twentieth century by the milestone work of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern; Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Princeton University Press, 1944). Following their work, John Nash played an important role in applying the theory to various domains, including economics, information science, and biology; for his efforts, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994 due to his establishment of the concept of Nash Equilibrium. Briefly, game theory can be described as a mathematical template for modeling human decision-making processes. If one intends to address the time-evolutionary aspect of a dynamical system, this is called evolutionary game theory (EGT), as distinct from classic game theory, which focuses on a static situation in which several game players with several strategies mutually interact to maximize their benefits (called a payoff) at a certain moment. After the concept of complex science emerged in the 1990s and computational resources surged, EGT was combined with multi-agent simulation (MAS) to open up a new horizon through which it is possible to approach many complex problems related to human social systems that contain physical systems as subordinates. Such problems had previously been considered unsolvable because human behavior was seen as too stochastic to appropriately predict the dynamics of decision-making. A disease spreading in our society is a good example. Epidemiologymeaning the study of how an epidemic spreads on a human networkcan be said to be sufficiently predictable because we know that it obeys a simple physics: the principle of diffusion phenomena. But the behavior of each individual is so varied, so prone to stochastic deviation, and so significantly influenced by information from the media that it is hard to predict how a disease will really spread through a complex human social system. In fact, whether one commits to pre-emptive vaccination or not is deeply related to the costs of the illness and the vaccination, and is also significantly influenced by the extent of the current outbreak as it stochastically evolves in time. This is quite a difficult task: but this book aims to address it in the following chapters.","output":"A Social-Physics Approach to Modeling and Analyzing Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International collaborations have become the standard model for global health research and often include researchers and institutions from high income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While such collaborations are important for generating new knowledge that will help address global health inequities, there is evidence to suggest that current forms of collaboration may reproduce unequal power relations. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study with scientists, researchers and those involved in research management, working in international health collaborations. Interviews were conducted between October 2019 and March 2020. We conducted 13 interviews with 15 participants. From our findings, we derive three major themes. First, our results reflect characteristics of equitable, collaborative research relationships. Here we find both relational features, specifically trust and belonging, and structural features, including clear contractual agreements, capacity building, inclusive divisions of labour, and the involvement of local communities. Second, we discuss obstacles to develop equitable collaborations. These include exclusionary labour practices, donor-driven research agendas, overall research culture, lack of accountability and finally, the inadequate financing of indirect costs for LMIC institutions. Third, we discuss the responsibilities for promoting science equity of funders, LMIC researchers, LMIC institutions, and LMIC governments. While other empirical studies have suggested similar features of equity, our findings extend these features to include local communities as collaborators in research projects and not only as beneficiaries. We also suggest the importance of funders paying for indirect costs, without which the capacity of LMIC institutions will continually erode. And finally, our study shows the responsibilities of LMIC actors in developing equitable collaborations, which have largely been absent from the literature.","output":"Considering equity in global health collaborations: A qualitative study on experiences of equity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the resection of advanced liver tumors in which the tumor thrombus extends into the intrathoracic inferior vena cava (IVC) above the diaphragm, surgeons need very skillful techniques and much experience. However, after detachment of the line of fusion of the pericardium to the diaphragm (LFPD), the intrathoracic IVC can be exposed easily. We herein present this novel surgical method, an approach to the intrathoracic IVC through the abdominal cavity. A 66 year-old man was referred to our hospital because of high-grade fever. Computed tomography revealed a large tumor of the left hepatic lobe with tumor thrombus extending into the intrathoracic IVC through the left hepatic vein. Laboratory data showed elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (726 ng/ml) and protein induced by vitamin K absence (114 AU/ml). The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the left hepatic lobe with tumor thrombus extending into the IVC. He underwent left hepatectomy with partial resection of the IVC and intravascular tumor thrombectomy under total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE) without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Before THVE, we approached the IVC through the abdominal cavity with vertical dissection of the diaphragm after detachment of the LFPD without cutting the pericardium or performing median sternotomy.

We provide a deep and comprehensive map of the MNP landscape in COVID-19. A redistribution of monocyte subsets toward intermediate monocytes and a general decrease in circulating DCs was observed in response to infection. Severe disease coincided with the appearance of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage-specific and associated either with the general response against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 severity. This included an interferon-imprint in DC1s observed in all patients and a decreased expression of the coinhibitory molecule CD200R in pre-DCs, DC2s, and DC3 subsets of severely sick patients. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, pointed to a cluster of COVID-19 nonsurvivors.

We aimed to investigate risk factors and outcome of BSI in critically ill coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an ancillary analysis of a multicenter prospective international cohort study (COVID-ICU study) that included 4010 COVID-19 ICU patients. For the present analysis, only those with data regarding primary outcome (death within 90 days from admission) or BSI status were included. Risk factors for BSI were analyzed using Fine and Gray competing risk model. Then, for outcome comparison, 537 BSI-patients were matched with 537 controls using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among 4010 included patients, 780 (19.5%) acquired a total of 1066 BSI (10.3 BSI per 1000 patients days at risk) of whom 92% were acquired in the ICU. Higher SAPS II, male gender, longer time from hospital to ICU admission and antiviral drug before admission were independently associated with an increased risk of BSI, and interestingly, this risk decreased over time. BSI was independently associated with a shorter time to death in the overall population (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.28, 95% CI 1.05C1.56) and, in the propensity score matched data set, patients with BSI had a higher mortality rate (39% vs 33% p = 0.036). BSI accounted for 3.6% of the death of the overall population. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 ICU patients have a high risk of BSI, especially early after ICU admission, risk that increases with severity but not with corticosteroids use.

Methods: A retrospective review of orthopedic surgery residency applicants was performed comparing the 2018 and 2020 application cycle. Self-reported ethnicity on Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) forms was recorded for all applicants who met prescreening criteria, were invited to interview and who completed interviews. The proportion of underrepresented minority (URM) applicants was compared between these two cohorts. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2018 and 2020 application cohorts in terms of number or proportion of URM applicants that met initial screening criteria (p=0.7598), female applicants that met initial screening criteria (p=0.3106), URM applicants who were invited to interview (p=0.6647), or female applicants who were invited to interview (p=0.63).

The filtering mechanisms of these events and their strength on communities, however, can be different among regions. While time-for-adaptation theory defines whether or not water scarcity can be considered as disturbance, the stress-dominance theory predicts an increase in importance of environmental filtering and a decrease in the role of biotic interactions in communities with increasing environmental stress. Here, we tested whether environmental filtering (leading to trait convergence) or limiting similarity (leading to trait divergence) is the main assembly rule shaping the structure and trait composition of benthic diatom assemblages in Mediterranean (Portuguese) and continental (Hungarian) temporary and perennial streams. We assumed that the trait composition of diatom assemblages in the two stream types would be less different in the Mediterranean than in the continental region (addressed to time-for-adaptation theory). We also hypothesized that trait composition would be shaped by environmental filtering in the Hungarian streams while by biotic interactions in Portuguese streams (addressed to stress-dominance theory). Our results supported our first hypothesis since traits, which associated primarily to temporary streams were found only in the continental region. Our findings, however, only partially proved the stress-dominance hypothesis. In the continental region, where drying up of streams were induced by unpredictable droughts, biotic interactions were the main assembly rules shaping community structure. In contrast, environmental filtering was nearly as important as limiting similarity in structuring trait composition in the Mediterranean region during the predictable dry phase with no superficial flow. These analyses also highlighted that drought events (both predictable and unpredictable ones) have a complex and strong influence on benthic diatom assemblages resulting even in irreversible changes in trait composition and thereby in ecosystem functioning.","output":"Environmental filtering and limiting similarity as main forces driving diatom community structure in Mediterranean and continental temporary and perennial streams."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide causing a pandemic with millions of infected people and deaths.

At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (&#8805;20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (&#8805;20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.","output":"Evolutionary analysis of the Delta and Delta Plus variants of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Healthcare workers (HCW) are slated to be early recipients of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines due to increased risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, and will be tasked with administering approved vaccines to the general population. As lynchpins of the vaccination effort, HCWs' opinions of a vaccine's safety and efficacy may affect both public perception and uptake of the vaccine. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address potential hesitancy prior to vaccine administration. Objective: To understand healthcare workers' attitudes about vaccine safety, efficacy, and acceptability in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including acceptance of a novel coronavirus vaccine. Design, Setting, Participants: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to participants enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study surveilling SARS-CoV-2 infection among 1,093 volunteer sampled University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System employees. Surveys were completed online between September 24 and October 16, 2020. In total, 609 participants completed this supplemental survey. Results: We averaged a 9-statement Likert scale matrix scored from 1 (\\"strongly disagree\\") to 5 (\\"strongly agree\\") and found respondents overwhelmingly confident about vaccine safety (4.47); effectiveness (4.44); importance, self-protection, and community health (4.67). Notably, 47.3% of respondents reported unwillingness to participate in a coronavirus vaccine trial, and most (66.5%) intend to delay vaccination. The odds of reporting intent to delay coronavirus vaccine uptake were 4.15 times higher among nurses, 2.45 times higher among other personnel with patient contact roles, and 2.15 times higher among those without patient contact compared to doctors. Evolving SARS-CoV-2 science (76.0%), current political climate (57.6%), and fast-tracked vaccine development timeline (83.4%) were cited as primary variables impacting HCW decisions to undergo vaccination. Of note, these results were obtained prior to release of Phase III data from companies manufacturing vaccines in the U.S. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite overall confidence in vaccines, a majority of HCW expressed concerns over a novel coronavirus vaccine. A large proportion plan to delay vaccine uptake due to concerns about expedited development, emerging scientific discoveries, and the political climate. Forthcoming vaccination campaigns must address these unique points of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in order to achieve adequate vaccine coverage.","output":"Assessment of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in Los Angeles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food-grade Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) have been safely consumed for centuries by humans in fermented foods. Thus, they are good candidates to develop novel oral vectors, constituting attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for mucosal delivery strategies. Herein, this review summarizes our research, up until now, on the use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and DNA vaccines. Most of our work has been based on the model LAB Lactococcus lactis, for which we have developed efficient genetic tools, including expression signals and host strains, for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins such as antigens, cytokines and enzymes. Resulting recombinant lactococci strains have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in different animal models: i) against human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16)-induced tumors in mice, ii) to partially prevent a bovine -lactoglobulin (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice and iii) to regulate body weight and food consumption in obese mice. Strikingly, all of these tools have been successfully transposed to the Lactobacillus genus, in recent years, within our laboratory. Notably, anti-oxidative Lactobacillus casei strains were constructed and tested in two chemically-induced colitis models. In parallel, we also developed a strategy based on the use of L. lactis to deliver DNA at the mucosal level, and were able to show that L. lactis is able to modulate the host response through DNA delivery. Today, we consider that all of our consistent data, together with those obtained by other groups, demonstrate and reinforce the interest of using LAB, particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors which should be tested now in human clinical trials.","output":"Lactococci and lactobacilli as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and DNA vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has become an increasingly common diagnostic tool in the clinical environment. As a result, it is being used earlier for medical students in Undergraduate Medical Education (UME) as a learning tool for the basic sciences including gross anatomy. There is little literature, however, to support its utility for basic science education in students currently seeking a bachelors degree. This study consisted of fourteen currently enrolled bachelor students with previous instruction in human anatomy and physiology. Students participated in an ultrasound didactic and an interactive ultrasound experience with volunteers. Before and after this session, students were asked to complete an assessment measuring their spatial understanding of the human anatomy and their ability to locate structures using ultrasound. Wilcoxons signed-rank tests comparing assessment scores showed significant improvement on both portions of the assessment. Based on this improvement, we suggest that ultrasound is a valid educational tool which can be used at the bachelor-level to effectively enhance students learning of anatomy and provide hands on experience with modern technology.

This study evaluated possible changes in child eating behaviors, parental feeding practices, and parental motivations when buying food during the lockdown, compared to the period before the lockdown. Parents of 498 children aged 3-12 years (238 boys; M = 7.32; SD = 2.27) completed an online survey with items from validated questionnaires (e.g., CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD). They reported on their (child's) current situation during the lockdown, and retrospectively on the period before the lockdown. Many parents reported changes in child eating behaviors, feeding practices, and food shopping motivations. When changes occurred, child appetite, food enjoyment, food responsiveness and emotional overeating significantly increased during the lockdown. Increased child boredom significantly predicted increased food responsiveness, emotional overeating and snack frequency in between meals. When parents changed their practices, they generally became more permissive: less rules, more soothing with food, more child autonomy. They bought pleasurable and sustainable foods more frequently, prepared more home-cooked meals and cooked more with the child. Level of education and increased stress level predicted changes in parental practices and motivations. This study provides insights in factors that can induce positive and negative changes in families' eating, feeding and cooking behaviors.

Barriers to the integration of developing countries into the digital economy, as well as ways to eliminate these barriers, were determined. It is justified that the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 in 2020 leveled the efforts of the international community to bridge the digital divide between countries. A way out of this situation is seen in operating a policy of multilateralism, taking into account the interests of states with digital lagging, as well as in reforming the system of WTO agreements, which should take into account the need to expand the space for development policy.

These conditions can be either beneficial or detrimental. Diseases are due to detrimental changes caused by either protein overexpression or underexpression caused by as a result of a mutation or posttranslational modifications (PTM), among other factors. Identification of disease biomarkers through proteomics can be potentially used as clinical information for diagnostics. Common biomarkers to look for include PTM. For example, aberrant glycosylation of proteins is a common marker and will be a focus of interest in this review. A common way to analyze glycoproteins is by glycoproteomics involving mass spectrometry. Due to factors such as micro- and macroheterogeneity which result in a lower abundance of each version of a glycoprotein, it is difficult to obtain meaningful results unless rigorous sample preparation procedures are in place. Microheterogeneity represents the diversity of glycans at a single site, whereas macroheterogeneity depicts glycosylation levels at each site of a protein. Enrichment and derivatization of glycopeptides help to overcome these limitations. Over the time range of 2016 to 2020, several methods have been proposed in the literature and have contributed to drastically improve the outcome of glycosylation analysis, as presented in the sampling surveyed in this review. As a current topic in 2020, glycoproteins carried by pathogens can also cause disease and this is seen with SARS CoV2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Diabetic mice had fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and CD4+ T cells which correlated with lower levels of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 expression. Diabetic mice also had lower levels of Tnfa, Il6, Il12b, and Arg1 expression and higher levels of Il17a expression.

However, formally reported SEA represents only a fraction of that which occurs, and community experiences of peacekeeper-perpetrated SEA are likely different than those reflected in official UN documents. METHODS: Using mixed-methods, cross-sectional data collected in the DRC in 2018, we used descriptive analysis and multivariate Poisson regression with robust error estimates to examine the participant and narrative characteristics associated with sharing an experience about peacekeeper-perpetrated SEA. RESULTS: Participants in Bukavu (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) and Kalemie (aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81) were less likely to share narratives about sexual interactions, while civilian UN personnel (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.34) were slightly more likely to be implicated in narratives about sexual interactions. Narratives in which the outcome was deemed fair to the woman/girl were more likely to be about sexual interactions (aRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.12). Both the regression analysis and the participants interpretation of the shared narratives illustrated the significant role poverty played in SEA, suggesting that the outcomes of sexual interactions may have been deemed fair since affected women/girls were perceived to have benefited financially/materially. CONCLUSION: There is significant variation between host communities in the likelihood of sharing narratives about SEA, which could prove useful for informing more targeted SEA prevention initiatives. Narratives about sexual interactions with UN personnel were more often deemed to have fair outcomes for the affected women/girls, likely related to ongoing poverty in host communities and perceived financial/material gain. These findings highlight how extreme poverty may impact perceptions around informed consent as well as fairness and require further study. Perceptions around fair outcomes would disincentivise formal reporting, which needs to be considered when devising community-based complaint networks.","output":"Participant and narrative characteristics associated with host community members sharing experiences of peacekeeper-perpetrated sexual exploitation and abuse in the Democratic Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Field instruction is a crucial component of natural sciences education.

Owing to refractory hypoxemia, prone position ventilation has been used more frequently and patients will need repeated hemodynamic assessments. Our main objective was to show the feasibility of obtaining images to measure multiple parameters with transthoracic echocardiography during the prone position ventilation. Methods: We enrolled 15 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that required prone position ventilation as a rescue maneuver for refractory hypoxemia. The studies were performed by 2 operators with training in critical care echocardiography. Measurements were done outside the patient's room and the analysis of the images was performed by 3 cardiologists with training in echocardiography. Results: Adequate image acquisition of the left ventricle was possible in all cases; we were not able to visualize the right ventricular free wall only in 1 patient. The mean tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 17.8 mm, tricuspid peak systolic S wave tissue Doppler velocity 11.5 cm/s, and the right ventricular basal diameter 36.6 mm; left ventricle qualitative function was reduced in 6 patients; pericardial effusion or valvular abnormalities were not observed. Conclusion: We showed that echocardiographic images can be obtained to measure multiple parameters during the prone position ventilation. This technique has special value in situations where there is sudden hemodynamic deterioration and it is not possible to return the patient in the supine position.","output":"Transthoracic echocardiography during prone position ventilation: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anemia is a global public health problem that affects approximately one-third of the global population. Infants and children are the ones to develop both short-term and long-term devastating complications from anemia. Although anemia is a very big public health concern, newborns, especially in developing countries, are usually overlooked and undiagnosed. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among term newborns in Nekemte Specialized Hospital, Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study involving 278 newborns was conducted from October to November, 2020 with an interview-based questionnaire that included maternal socio-demographic and obstetrics characteristics, newborns weight and sex. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 20. The prevalence of newborn anemia was shown in percentage and as a pie-chart. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to identify the predictors of anemia in the term newborn. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of newborn anemia in the hospital was 29.1%. Maternal anemia (AOR: 3.95, 95% C.I.: 1.97C7.92), delivery by cesarean section (AOR: 4.17, 95% C.I.: 1.89C9.20), vaginal bleeding during pregnancy (AOR: 5.43, 95% C.I.: 1.60C18.39), and maternal failure to take iron-folate supplements during pregnancy (AOR: 2.17, 95% C.I.:1.07C4.41) were factors associated with newborn anemia. CONCLUSION: Anemia among newborns in the hospital was a moderate public health problem. Policy makers should consider maternal health education and appropriate health interventions to reduce the problem.

METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, observational study. All consecutive patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ischemic/ hemorrhagic stroke between March1st -May10th 2020 were included and compared with the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: There was a 41.9% increase in stroke admissions in 2020 (148 vs 210,P = .001). When comparing all ischemic strokes, higher rate of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (18.3% vs 33.8%,P = .008) and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival (67.75 vs 104.30 minutes,P = .001) was observed in 2020. When comparing all hemorrhagic strokes, there were no differences between the two years. Among 591 COVID-19 admissions, 31 (5.24%) patients with stroke including 19 with ischemic (3.21%) and 12 with hemorrhagic stroke (2.03%) were identified. Patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger (58.74 vs 48.11 years,P = .002), predominantly male (68.18% vs 94.74%,P = .016), had lesser vascular risk factors, had more severe clinical presentation (NIHSS 7.01 vs 17.05,P < .001), and higher rate of LVO (23.6% vs. 63.1%,P = .006). There was no difference in the rate of endovascular thrombectomy, but time to groin puncture was significantly longer in COVID-19 patients (83.41 vs 129.50 minutes,P = .003). For hemorrhagic stroke, COVID-19 patients did not differ from non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke continues to occur during this pandemic and stroke pathways have been affected by the pandemic. Stroke occurs in approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 associated ischemic stroke occurs in predominantly male patients who are younger, with fewer vascular risk factors, can be more severe, and have higher rates of LVO.

In this study we directly compared knowledge outcomes, social outcomes, and wellbeing of first year student small group teaching in either face to face (f2f) or online format.MethodsAt the end of the first course of our medical program, students were invited to participate in an online questionnaire with 10 quantitative items and 1 qualitative item. These were analysed using Factor Analysis Pattern Matrix and linear regression to group items and assess relatedness. Qualitative responses were thematized using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA). Summative assessment results were compared, both between current cohorts to historical cohorts.ResultsFrom a cohort of 298 students there was a 77% response rate. Overall, there were no differences in knowledge gains, either between groups or when compared to historical cohorts. Questionnaire items fell reliably into groups that related to either learning outcomes, social outcomes, or wellbeing. Independent T tests showed that format for teaching (online versus f2f) had an impact on social outcomes but no direct impact on learning outcomes. Linear regression revealed that the social outcomes have a direct impact on wellbeing and almost the double the impact on learning outcomes than mode of learning ie. F2f or online (=.448 and =.232 respectively). ConclusionIn this study, we were able to show with statistical strength that social outcomes for students such as engaging with peers and facilitator, contributing to the group, and making friends have a direct impact on wellbeing and indirectly impact learning outcomes (such as motivation, satisfaction, integration of knowledge). In a rapidly changing educational landscape, it is vital that these aspects are a focus of design and delivery of medical education.

As many as 30% of hospital staff say that they plan not to report for work during a large-scale disaster. We sought to understand the personal disaster preparedness for hospital staff. METHODS Surveys were distributed to the staff of a large academic tertiary-care hospital by either a paper-based version distributed through the departmental safety coordinators or a Web-based version distributed through employee e-mail services, depending on employee familiarity with and access to computer services. Surveys assessed the demographic variables and characteristics of personal readiness for disaster. RESULTS Of the individuals who accessed the survey, 1334 (95.9%) enrolled in it. Women made up 75% of the respondents, with a mean age of 43 years. Respondents had worked at the hospital an average of 9 years, with the majority (90%) being full-time employees. Most households (93%) reported 4 members, 6% supported a person with special medical needs, and 17% were headed by a single parent. A small number (24%) of respondents reported an established meeting place for reuniting households during a disaster. Many reported stockpiling a 3-day supply of food (86%) and a 3-day supply of water (51%). Eighteen percent of respondents were not aware of workplace evacuation plans. Most respondents were willing to report to work for natural disasters (eg, tornado, snowstorm; all categories >65%), but fewer respondents were willing to report during events such as an influenza epidemic (54%), a biological outbreak (41%), a chemical exposure, (40%), or a radiation exposure (39%). Multivariate analysis revealed being female, having a child in the household younger than 6 years old, and having a child in school lowered the likelihood of being willing to report to work in two or more event types, whereas pet ownership, being a clinical healthcare worker, and being familiar with the work emergency plan increased the likelihood. CONCLUSIONS Despite being employed at the same facility for a prolonged period, employees reported being willing to report for work at a low rate in a variety of disasters. Subjects reported suboptimal personal preparedness for disaster, which may further limit the number of staff who will report for work.

Previous studies established that osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the inner ear inhibits otic capsule remodeling.

Here we studied the expression and function of RANK and RANKL in the murine cochlea. Using a combination of in situ hybridization, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and western blot, we demonstrate that Rankl and Rank genes and their protein products are expressed in the intracochlear soft tissues and the otic capsule in a developmentally regulated manner. Using a culture of neonatal murine cochlear neurons, we show that the interaction between RANK and RANKL inhibits neurite outgrowth in these neurons, and is associated with upregulation of Nogo-A expression.

The ability of antibody-based therapies, including convalescent plasma, to affect established disease remains to be elucidated. Only few monoclonal therapies and only when used at a very early stage of infection have shown efficacy. Here, we conducted a proof-of-principle study of convalescent plasma therapy in a phase I trial in 30 COVID-19 patients including immunocompromised individuals hospitalized early after onset of symptoms. A comprehensive longitudinal monitoring of the virologic, serologic, and disease status of recipients in conjunction with detailed post-hoc seroprofiling of transfused convalescent plasma, allowed deciphering of parameters on which plasma therapy efficacy depends. Plasma therapy was safe and had a significant effect on viral clearance depending on neutralizing and spike SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the supplied convalescent plasma. Endogenous immunity had strong effects on virus control. Lack of endogenous neutralizing activity at baseline was associated with a higher risk of systemic viremia. The onset of endogenous neutralization had a noticeable effect on viral clearance but, importantly, even after adjusting for their endogenous neutralization status recipients benefitted from therapy with high neutralizing antibody containing plasma. In summary, our data demonstrate a clear impact of exogenous antibody therapy on the rapid clearance of viremia in the early stages of infection and provide directions for improved efficacy evaluation of current and future SARS-CoV-2 therapies beyond antibody-based interventions. Incorporating an assessment of the endogenous immune response and its dynamic interplay with viral production is critical for determining therapeutic effects.

The exposed and infectious periods have general distributions, and are not affected by the possible migrations of the individuals. The migration processes in either of the three states are assumed to be Markovian, and independent of the exposed and infectious periods. We establish a functional law of large number (FLLN) and a function central limit theorem (FCLT) for the susceptible, exposed/latent, infectious and recovered processes. In the FLLN, the limit is determined by a set of Volterra integral equations. In the special case of deterministic exposed and infectious periods, the limit becomes a system of ODEs with delays. In the FCLT, the limit is given by a set of stochastic Volterra integral equations driven by a sum of independent Brownian motions and continuous Gaussian processes with an explicit covariance structure.","output":"Multi-patch epidemic models with general exposed and infectious periods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can increase arterial stiffness 3-4 wk following infection, even among young, healthy adults. However, the long-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health and the duration of recovery remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to elucidate potential long-lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on markers of arterial stiffness among young adults during the 6 mo following infection. Assessments were performed at months 1, 2, 3, 4, and a??6 following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Doppler ultrasound was used to measure carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and carotid stiffness, and arterial tonometry was used to measure central blood pressures and aortic augmentation index at a heart rate of 75 beatsmin-1 (AIx@HR75). Vascular (VCAM-1) and intracellular (ICAM-1) adhesion molecules were analyzed as circulating markers of arterial stiffness. From months 1-6, a significant reduction in cfPWV was observed (month 1: 5.70  0.73 ms-1; month 6: 4.88  0.65 ms-1; P < 0.05) without any change in carotid stiffness measures. Reductions in systolic blood pressure (month 1: 123  8 mmHg; month 6: 112  11 mmHg) and mean arterial pressure (MAP; month 1: 97  6 mmHg; month 6: 86  7 mmHg) were observed (P < 0.05), although AIx@HR75 did not change over time. The month 1-6 change in cfPWV and MAP were correlated (r = 0.894; P < 0.001). A reduction in VCAM-1 was observed at month 3 compared with month 1 (month 1: 5,575  2,242 pgmL-1; month 3: 4,636  1,621 pgmL-1; P < 0.05) without a change in ICAM-1. A reduction in cfPWV was related with MAP, and some indicators of arterial stiffness remain elevated for several months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly contributing to prolonged recovery and increased cardiovascular health risks.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We sought to investigate potential long-lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on markers of arterial stiffness among young adults for 6 mo following infection. Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity was significantly reduced while carotid stiffness measures remained unaltered over the 6-mo period. These findings suggest several months of recovery from infection may be necessary for young adults to improve various markers of arterial stiffness, possibly contributing to cardiovascular health and recovery among those infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Six-month longitudinal tracking of arterial stiffness and blood pressure in young adults following SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hyperinflammatory phase of COVID-19 occurring because of cytokine storm is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the affected patients.

The following work presents a methodology by which Twitter data surrounding the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK is harvested and analysed using two main approaches. The first is an investigation into localized outbreak predictions by developing a prototype early-warning system using the distribution of total tweet volume. The temporal lag between the rises in the number of COVID-19 related tweets and officially reported deaths by Public Health England (PHE) is observed to be 6C27 days for various UK cities which matches the temporal lag values found in the literature. To better understand the topics of discussion and attitudes of people surrounding the pandemic, the second approach is an in-depth behavioural analysis assessing the public opinion and response to government policies such as the introduction of face-coverings. Using topic modelling, nine distinct topics are identified within the corpus of COVID-19 tweets, of which the themes ranged from retail to government bodies. Sentiment analysis on a subset of mask related tweets revealed sentiment spikes corresponding to major news and announcements. A Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm is trained and applied in a semi-supervised manner to recognise tweets containing location keywords within the unlabelled corpus and achieved a precision of 81.6%. Overall, these approaches allowed extraction of temporal trends relating to PHE case numbers, popular locations in relation to the use of face-coverings, and attitudes towards face-coverings, vaccines and the national Test and Trace scheme.","output":"Evaluation of Twitter data for an emerging crisis: an application to the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report the baseline prevalence of myopia among school children in Tamil Nadu, South India from a prospective cohort study. METHODS Children between the ages of 5 and 16 years from 11 schools in two districts of Tamil Nadu underwent vision screening. All children underwent visual acuity assessment using a Pocket Vision Screener followed by non-cycloplegic open-field autorefraction (Grand Seiko WAM-5500). Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent (SE) refraction of -0.75 D and high myopia was defined as SE  -6.00 D. Distribution of refraction, biometry and factors associated with prevalence of myopia were the outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 14,699 children completed vision screening, with 2% (357) of them having ocular abnormalities other than refractive errors or poor vision despite spectacle correction. The remaining 14,342 children (7557 boys; 52.69%) had a mean age of 10.2 (Standard Deviation [SD] 2.8) years. A total of 2502 had myopia in at least one eye, a prevalence of 17.5% (95% CI: 14.7-20.5%), and 74 (0.5%; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9%) had high myopia. Myopia prevalence increased with age (p < 0.001), but sex was not associated with myopia prevalence (p = 0.24). Mean axial length (AL; 23.08 (SD = 0.91) mm) and mean anterior chamber depth (ACD; 3.45 (SD = 0.27) mm) positively correlated with age (p < 0.001). The mean flat (K1; 43.37 (SD = 1.49) D) and steep (K2; 44.50 (SD = 1.58) D) corneal curvatures showed negative correlation with age (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the multivariable logistic regression, older age and urban school location had higher odds for prevalence of myopia. CONCLUSION The baseline prevalence of myopia among 5- to 16-year-old children in South India is larger than that found in previous studies, indicating that myopia is becoming a major public health problem in this country.","output":"Prevalence of myopia among urban and suburban school children in Tamil Nadu, South India: findings from the Sankara Nethralaya Tamil Nadu Essilor Myopia (STEM) Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Structural and biochemical studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and complexes with highly potent antibodies have revealed multiple conformation-dependent epitopes highlighting conformational plasticity of spike proteins and capacity for eliciting specific binding and broad neutralization responses. In this study, we used coevolutionary analysis, molecular simulations, and perturbation-based hierarchical network modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with a panel of antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to explore molecular mechanisms underlying binding-induced modulation of dynamics and allosteric signaling in the spike proteins. Through coevolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we identified highly coevolving hotspots and functional clusters that enable a functional cross-talk between distant allosteric regions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with antibodies. Coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with mutational sensitivity mapping and perturbation-based profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes with CR3022 and CB6 antibodies enabled a detailed validation of the proposed approach and an extensive quantitative comparison with the experimental structural and deep mutagenesis scanning data. By combining in silico mutational scanning, perturbation-based modeling, and network analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with H014, S309, S2M11, and S2E12 antibodies, we demonstrated that antibodies can incur specific and functionally relevant changes by modulating allosteric propensities and collective dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The results provide a novel insight into regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins showing that antibody-escaping mutations can preferentially target structurally adaptable energy hotspots and allosteric effector centers that control functional movements and allosteric communication in the complexes.","output":"Integrated Biophysical Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding and Allosteric Interactions with Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Deficiencies in immune-regulatory mechanisms such as immune activation and T-regulatory cells are classically referred to as cytokine storms.

Transferring these clinically established inflammation markers into exercise physiology seems highly beneficial, especially due to the low temporal, financial and infrastructural resources needed for assessment and calculation. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize evidence on the value of the integrative inflammation markers NLR, PLR and SII for depiction of exercise-induced inflammation and highlight potential applications in exercise settings. Despite sparse evidence, multiple investigations revealed responsiveness of the markers to acute and chronic exercise, thereby opening promising avenues in the field of exercise physiology. In performance settings, they might help to infer information for exercise programming by reflecting exercise strain and recovery status or periods of overtraining and increased infection risk. In health settings, application involves the depiction of anti-inflammatory effects of chronic exercise in patients exhibiting chronic inflammation. Further research should, therefore, focus on establishing reference values for these integrative markers in athletes at rest, assess the kinetics and reliability in response to different exercise modalities and implement the markers into clinical exercise trials to depict anti-inflammatory effects of chronic exercise in different patient collectives.","output":"Transferring clinically established immune inflammation markers into exercise physiology: focus on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune-inflammation index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We thank Dr. Thachil for his interesting comment regarding our article (1).

Expert consensus is an important input into evidence-informed policy and practice but is often employed at the national level which misses important local contextual factors shaping decision making. This study aimed to: (1) reach consensus on local priority interventions for preventing mental health problems for children living with adversity in Wyndham, Victoria; and (2) understand the enabling factors and barriers to implementing these interventions. METHODS: This study employed six online modified nominal group technique (NGT) workshops with 19 stakeholders; intersectoral service providers from health, social and education sectors and caregivers of children aged 0C8 years. RESULTS: Three interventions reached consensus among the mixed stakeholder groups as being a high or very high priority for implementation in Wyndham: nurse home visiting, parenting programs and community-wide programs. Key rationales were the ability for these interventions to act as a gateway for families to increase their knowledge about topics immediately relevant to them (i.e. parenting), increase their knowledge about available supports and build relationships with service providers. CONCLUSIONS: Local priorities for preventing mental health problems for children living with adversity emphasized relational approaches to service provision and were shaped by the availability of existing interventions and supports in the locality. The NGT was found to be an effective method for prioritising evidence-based practice interventions in health settings, engaging local stakeholders, and identifying enablers and barriers to implementation.

Therefore, it is important to determine teachers understanding of who they are. Thus, teachers opinions about their professional self-understanding in the study were aimed to be analysed. Although teacher training practices are gaining importance rapidly, it is seen that studies on how teachers evaluate themselves are not sufficiently included in the literature. For this purpose, the research was carried out using the qualitative research method and phenomenology pattern to consider teachers opinions about their professional self-understanding holistically. The research study group consists of 44 teachers working in primary, secondary, and high schools in the Pendik district of Istanbul. Research data were obtained from in-depth interviews with teachers through semi-structured interview forms. The findings obtained were grouped under five themes: Image, Respect, Job Motivation, Perception of Duty, and Future Views, considering the relevant literature. The study revealed that professional self-understanding is closely affected by emotions and teachers social status. Considering the relationship between social status, acceptance, and individual motivation, it is thought that the negative judgments in society about the teaching profession make individuals reluctant to choose this profession. For this reason, it can be evaluated that studies should be carried out to restore the eroded reputation of the profession in society and that this profession should be provided with much more attractive opportunities economically.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for studies published between the 1st of January 2020 and 22nd of April 2020. In addition, we scanned the bibliography of included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. The criteria for eligibility included studies published in English language (or translated to English), those involving patients with COVID-19 of all age groups, and reporting neurological findings. Data were extracted from eligible studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled percentages and means with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of individual studies on the summary estimate. A subgroup analysis was conducted according to severity. The main outcomes of the study were to identify the frequency and nature of neurological manifestations and complications, and the neuro-diagnostic findings in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: 44 articles were included with a pooled sample size of 13,480 patients. The mean age was 50.3 years and 53% were males. The most common neurological manifestations were: Myalgia (22.2, 95% CI, 17.2 to 28.1%), taste impairment (19.6, 95% CI, 3.8 to 60.1%), smell impairment (18.3, 95% CI, 15.4 to 76.2%), headache (12.1, 95% CI, 9.1 to 15.8%), dizziness (11.3, 95% CI, 8.5 to 15.0%), and encephalopathy (9.4, 95% CI, 2.8 to 26.6%).

This has created a need for strategies to triage surgical patients. Here, we describe our experience using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) COVID-19 Guidelines for Triage of Vascular Surgery Patients in an academic surgery practice. METHODS: We used the ACS Guidelines as a framework to direct the triage of vascular surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed the results of this triage during the first month of surgical restriction at our hospital. Patients undergoing surgery were identified by reviewing the operating room schedule. We reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) and assigned an ACS Category, Condition and Tier Class to each completed surgery. Surgeries that were postponed during that same time period were identified from a prospectively maintained list. We reviewed the EMR for all postponed surgeries and assigned an ACS Category, Condition and Tier Class to each surgery. We reviewed the EMR for all postponed procedures to identify adverse events related to the treatment delay. RESULTS: We performed 69 surgeries in 52 patients during the study period. All surgeries were performed to treat emergent, urgent or time-sensitive elective diagnoses. Forty-seven surgeries (68%) were from Tier 3 and 22 (32%) were from Tier 2b. We did not perform any surgeries from Tier 1 or 2a. We postponed surgery in 66 patients during the same time period. Thirty-six (55%) were from Tier 1, 22 (33%) were from Tier 2a, 5 (8%) were from Tier 2b and 3 (5%) could not be assigned a Tier Class. No Tier 3 surgeries were postponed. Three patients (4.5%) experienced an adverse event that could be attributed to the treatment delay. CONCLUSIONS: The ACS Triage Guidelines provided an effective method to decrease vascular surgical volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic without an increase in patient morbidity. The clinical utility of the Guidelines would be strengthened by incorporating the SURGCON/VASCCON threat level alert system.","output":"Vascular Surgery Triage During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The research here focuses on case study of Italy, one of the countries in the World to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results suggest that diffusion of COVID-19 is very high in cities with high air pollution generating severe negative effects on public health o. In particular, results reveal that, among Italian provincial capitals, the number of infected people was higher in cities with more than 100 days per year exceeding limits set for PM 10 or ozone, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away from the coast), cities having a low average intensity of wind speed and cities with a lower temperature. In hinterland cities (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with a high number of days exceeding PM 10 and ozone limits, coupled with low wind speed (atmospheric stability), the average number of infected people in April 2020 more than tripled those that had less than 100 days of excessive air pollution. In fact, results show that more than 75% of infected individuals and about 81% of deaths in Italy of COVID-19 are in regions with high air pollution.

The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients receiving palliative care is higher than in the general population. This association is intended to grow as a result of the rising burden of DM worldwide, ageing populations and the improved overall survival time of several diseases over the last few decades. Recommendations for DM management in the context of palliative care are mainly based on expert opinion as there is a lack of suitable evidence base and randomised clinical trials in palliative care are scarce. The aim of our systematic review is to identify the best DM management practices in order to reduce important DM-related symptoms and acute complications in patients receiving palliative care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The authors will study the DM treatment and management literature, surveying the different approaches employed to treat adult palliative patients. Core health bibliographic databases will be searched from January 1990 to May 2019. Data sources will include Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and grey literature. Details regarding diet, oral and injectable glucose-lowering medicines, insulin regimens and blood glucose monitoring strategies will be evaluated. We defined the primary outcomes to compare between DM management approaches as the presence of symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia) and acute complications of DM (hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and diabetic ketoacidosis), and secondary outcomes as hospital admissions and deaths due to DM-related complications, health-related quality of life and glycaemic control.

Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW). Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,...). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbeco-gene. This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/{micro}L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial. On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 {degrees}C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW. Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards to methodological limitations.

Results: The results of the regression analyses showed that for negative effects of DL, younger age and greater EF deficits explained most part of the variance. Specifically, regarding negative effects on children, the most important factor was EF deficits, whereas regarding negative effects on parents, child age was the most important factor. For positive effects of DL, all variables explained only a small part of the variance. Child age was the most important factor, but EF deficits and parents' psychological well-being also had a significant impact.

Number of positive cases and number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater were significantly correlated (p = 0.013).

We also tried to correlate the effect of viral circulation in wastewater with containment measures, probably the most unbiased correlation on their potential inflection effect of epidemic curves. Not only is this correlation not obvious, but it also clearly appears that the drop in cases as well as the drop in the viral load in the sewers occur before the containment measures. In fact, this suggests that there are factors that initiate the end of the epidemic peak independently of the containment measure.

We assessed the prevalence and frequency of respiratory and ear symptoms and studied differences by age and sex among an unselected population of Swiss people with PCD. METHODS: We sent a questionnaire that included items from the FOLLOW-PCD standardised questionnaire to all Swiss PCD registry participants. RESULTS: We received questionnaires from 74 (86%) out of 86 invited persons or their caregivers (median age 23 years, range 3C73 years), including 68% adults (18 years) and 51% females. Among participants, 70 (94%) reported chronic nasal symptoms; most frequently runny nose (65%), blocked nose (55%) or anosmia (38%). Ear pain and hearing problems were reported by 58% of the participants. Almost all (99%) reported cough and sputum production. The most common chronic cough complications were gastro-oesophageal reflux (n=11; 15%), vomiting (n=8; 11%) and urinary incontinence (n=6; 8%). Only nine (12%) participants reported frequent wheeze, which occurred mainly during infection or exercise, while 49 (66%) reported shortness of breath, and 9% even at rest or during daily activities. Older patients reported more frequent nasal symptoms and shortness of breath. We found no difference by sex or ultrastructural ciliary defect.

METHODS: Among 300 transcatheter procedures, a total of 6 patients had concurrent simultaneous transcatheter bioprosthesis implants for severe mitral bioprosthesis failure (valve-in-valve), with a second valve procedure that included native aortic (n = 2) or degenerated bioprostheses in the aortic position (n = 4). During the procedures, all patients were treated with a balloon-expandable Inovare transcatheter valve, using the transapical approach. RESULTS: Patients were highly symptomatic [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV: 100%], with a mean age of 62  5 years, yielding a mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk II (EuroSCORE II) of 24.0  10.1%. There was a mean of 1.6  0.4 prior valve operations/patient, with a median time from prior mitral bioprosthesis surgery of 13.0 (9.2-20.0) years. Device success was 100% according to the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium and the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. During the hospital stay, only 1 patient required dialysis, and the median intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 5.0 (3.2-6.7) days and 16.0 (12.2-21.2) days, respectively. No deaths occurred at 30 days; at a median follow-up of 287 (194-437) days, 1 patient died of a non-cardiac cause and the rest of patients were in NYHA functional class I or II, with normofunctioning bioprostheses. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter double valve interventions using the Inovare bioprosthesis in this initial series were shown to be a reasonable alternative to redo surgical operations. The short- and mid-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes demonstrate promising results, although future studies with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are warranted.","output":"Double transcatheter balloon-expandable valve implantation for severe valve dysfunction in high-risk patients: initial experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Large-scale school closures have been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, the impact of school closures and re-opening on epidemic dynamics remains unclear. Methods We simulated COVID-19 transmission dynamics using an individual-based stochastic model, incorporating social-contact data of school-aged children during shelter-in-place orders derived from Bay Area (California) household surveys. We simulated transmission under observed conditions and counterfactual intervention scenarios between March 17-June 1, and evaluated various fall 2020 K-12 reopening strategies. Findings Between March 17-June 1, assuming children <10 were half as susceptible to infection as older children and adults, we estimated school closures averted a similar number of infections (13,842 cases; 95% CI: 6,290, 23,040) as workplace closures (15,813; 95% CI: 9,963, 22,617) and social distancing measures (7,030; 95% CI: 3,118, 11,676). School closure effects were driven by high school and middle school closures. Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimate that fall 2020 school reopenings will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1), and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: -1.7, 12.0). Results are highly dependent on uncertain parameters, notably the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and extent of community transmission amid re-opening. The school-based interventions needed to reduce the risk to fewer than an additional 1% of teachers infected varies by grade level. A hybrid-learning approach with halved class sizes of 10 students may be needed in high schools, while maintaining small cohorts of 20 students may be needed for elementary schools. Interpretation Multiple in-school intervention strategies and community transmission reductions, beyond the extent achieved to date, will be necessary to avoid undue excess risk associated with school reopening. Policymakers must urgently enact policies that curb community transmission and implement within-school control measures to simultaneously address the tandem health crises posed by COVID-19 and adverse child health and development consequences of long-term school closures.","output":"The effect of school closures and reopening strategies on COVID-19 infection dynamics in the San Francisco Bay Area: a cross-sectional survey and modeling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cell states and functions at the single-cell level.

Accurate assessment of disease response is fundamental to increase the chances of successful breast-conserving surgery and to avoid local recurrence. The purpose of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) and contrast-enhanced-MRI (MRI) in the evaluation of tumor response to NAC. METHODS This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained. Fifty-four consenting women with breast cancer and indication of NAC were consecutively enrolled between October 2012 and December 2014. Patients underwent both CESM and MRI before, during and after NAC. MRI was performed first, followed by CESM within 3 days. Response to therapy was evaluated for each patient, comparing the size of the residual lesion measured on CESM and MRI performed after NAC to the pathological response on surgical specimens (gold standard), independently of and blinded to the results of the other test. The agreement between measurements was evaluated using Lin's coefficient. The agreement between measurements using CESM and MRI was tested at each step of the study, before, during and after NAC. And last of all, the variation in the largest dimension of the tumor on CESM and MRI was assessed according to the parameters set in RECIST 1.1 criteria, focusing on pathological complete response (pCR). RESULTS A total of 46 patients (85%) completed the study. CESM predicted pCR better than MRI (Lin's coefficient 0.81 and 0.59, respectively). Both methods tend to underestimate the real extent of residual tumor (mean 4.1mm in CESM, 7.5mm in MRI). The agreement between measurements using CESM and MRI was 0.96, 0.94 and 0.76 before, during and after NAC respectively. The distinction between responders and non-responders with CESM and MRI was identical for 45/46 patients. In the assessment of CR, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 84%, respectively, for CESM, and 87% and 60% for MRI. CONCLUSION CESM and MRI lesion size measurements were highly correlated. CESM seems at least as reliable as MRI in assessing the response to NAC, and may be an alternative if MRI is contraindicated or its availability is limited.","output":"Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography in neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring: a comparison with breast magnetic resonance imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The CURB-65 is a severity score to predict mortality secondary to community acquired pneumonia and is widely used to identify patients who can be managed as outpatients. However, whether CURB-65 can be applicable to COVID-19 patients for the decision of outpatient treatment is still unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-centre study assessing the performance of the CURB-65 to predict the risk of poor outcome, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation and/or death, among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The association between the CURB-65 and the outcome was assessed by a univariable Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: A total of 279 patients were hospitalized between March 15th and April 14th, 2020. According to the CURB-65, 171 (61.3%) patients were considered at low risk (CURB-65 01), 66 (23.7%) at intermediate risk (CURB-65=2), and 42 (15.1%) had high risk of 30-day mortality (CURB-65 35). During the study period, 88 (31.5%) patients had a poor outcome. The CURB-65 was strongly associated with a poor outcome (Pfor linear trend <0.001). However, among patients with a CURB-65 of 01, thus considered at low risk, 36/171 (21.1%) had a poor outcome.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the bioactive components of its seeds and the potential mechanisms of antioxidant activity to provide a foundation for further developmental work on R. tanguticum seeds as a functional food. METHODS: In this study, the antioxidant activities of R. tanguticum seeds were measured using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays. LC-Q-TOF/MS was used to identify the active compounds in the seeds, and Swiss Target Prediction was used to identify their potential targets. The DisGENET, DrugBank, OMIM and GeneCard databases were used to search for antioxidant-related targets. RESULTS: The componentCtargetCpathway network was constructed and included 5 compounds and 9 target genes. The hub genes included ESR1, APP, MAPK8, HSP90AA1, AKT1, MMP2, PTGS2, TGFB1 and JUN. The antioxidant activity signaling pathways of the compounds for the treatment of diseases were the cancer signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, colorectal cancer signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. Molecular docking revealed that the compounds in R. tanguticum seeds could inhibit potential targets (AKT1, ESR1 and PTGS2). CONCLUSION: Molecular docking studies revealed that the binding energy score between liriodenine and PTGS2 was the highest (8.16), followed by that of chrysophanol (7.10).

Most research on oil biodegradation focusses on the bulk oil, but the fate of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF), mainly composed of toxic aromatic compounds, is largely underexplored. To evaluate the bacterial degradation capacity of such dissolved aromatics in Greenlandic seawater, microcosms consisting of 0 C seawater polluted with WAF were investigated over a 3-month period. With a half-life (t1/2) of 26 days, m-xylene was the fastest degraded compound, as measured by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Substantial slower degradation was observed for ethylbenzene, naphthalenes, phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene and fluorenes with t1/2 of 40-105 days. Colwellia, identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was the main potential degrader of m-xylene. This genus occupied up to 47 % of the bacterial community until day 10 in the microcosms. Cycloclasticus and Zhongshania aliphaticivorans, potentially utilizing one-to three-ringed aromatics, replaced Colwellia between day 10 and 96 and occupied up to 6 % and 23 % of the community, respectively. Although most of the WAF can ultimately be eliminated in microcosms, our results suggest that the restoration of an oil-impacted Arctic environment may be slow as most analysed compounds had t1/2 of over 2-3 months and the detrimental effects of a spill towards the marine ecosystem likely persist during this time.","output":"Biodegradation of water-accommodated aromatic oil compounds in Arctic seawater at 0 C."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lambda interferons mediate antiviral immunity by inducing interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in epithelial tissues.

Transfection with non-tagged IFNL3 or IFNL4 induced no transcriptome change in the cells lacking either IL10R2 or IFNLR1 receptor subunits. Cytosolic overexpression of signal peptide-lacking IFNL3 or IFNL4 in wild type cells did not interfere with JAK-STAT signaling triggered by interferons in the medium.

However, 1 in 10 adults do not always wear a seat belt, with the lowest use rates of seat belt use among young adults. Digital behavioral interventions could be useful to increase seat belt use, but remain under-developed. This randomized clinical trial tested the efficacy of a 6-week behavioral text message program promoting seat belt use among young adults. Methods: A parallel, 2-group, single-blind, individually randomized clinical trial. Eligible individuals recruited from 4 Emergency Departments were aged 18 to 25 years who reported driving or being a passenger without always using a seat belt in the past 2-weeks. Two hundred eighteen participants completed the 2-week trial run-in phase were randomly assigned 1:1 to intervention: self-monitoring control. The intervention arm (n=110) received SaVE , a 6-week automated interactive text message program including weekly seat belt use queries with feedback and goal support to promote consistent use of a seat belt. The control arm (n=108) received identical weekly seat belt use queries but no additional feedback. The primary and secondary outcomes were the proportion of young adults reporting always wearing a seat belt at 6- and 12-weeks, collected via web-based self-assessments and analyzed under intent-to-treat models. Results: The mean (SD) age was 21.5 (2.2) years, 137 (63%) were female, 110 (50%) were White, and 33 (15%) were Hispanic. The 6-week follow-up rate was 86.2% (n=187), with no differential attrition. At 6-weeks, 39.1% (95% CI, 30.0%-48.9%) of intervention participants always wore a seat belt vs. 23.1% (95% CI, 15.6%-32.2%) of control participants (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.18-3.84; P =.01). The 12-week follow-up rate was 64.2% (n=140), with no differential attrition.

In enhanced-fibrinolytic-type DIC, both coagulation and fibrinolysis are markedly activated. Typical cases show decreased platelet counts and fibrinogen levels, increased concentrations of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer, and increased FDP/D-dimer ratios. Thrombin-antithrombin complex or prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, as markers of coagulation activation, and plasmin-(2) plasmin inhibitor complex, a marker of fibrinolytic activation, are all markedly increased. Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) is not so obvious, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is rather shortened in some cases. As a result, DIC can be neither diagnosed nor excluded based on PT and APTT alone. Many of the factors involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis activation are serine proteases. Treatment of enhanced-fibrinolytic-type DIC requires consideration of how to control the function of these serine proteases. The cornerstone of DIC treatment is treatment of the underlying pathology. However, in some cases surgery is either not possible or exacerbates the DIC associated with aortic aneurysm. In such cases, pharmacotherapy becomes even more important. Unfractionated heparin, other heparins, synthetic protease inhibitors, recombinant thrombomodulin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are agents that inhibit serine proteases, and all are effective against DIC. Inhibition of activated coagulation factors by anticoagulants is key to the treatment of DIC. Among them, DOACs can be taken orally and is useful for outpatient treatment. Combination therapy of heparin and nafamostat allows fine-adjustment of anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic effects. While warfarin is an anticoagulant, this agent is ineffective in the treatment of DIC because it inhibits the production of coagulation factors as substrates without inhibiting activated coagulation factors. In addition, monotherapy using tranexamic acid in cases of enhanced-fibrinolytic-type DIC may induce fatal thrombosis. If tranexamic acid is needed for DIC, combination with anticoagulant therapy is of critical importance.","output":"Therapeutic Strategies for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Associated with Aortic Aneurysm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 disease were identified in a cohort study involving 1099 patients from China.

Occupational therapy is used to promote independence during ADL in people living with HTLV (PLHTLV). OBJECTIVE: To quantify the clinical aspects, levels of functionality, performance in ADLs and occupational roles of PLHTLV and propose an occupational therapeutic intervention. METHOD: A cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study was designed with 40 PLHTLV monitored at two referral laboratories of the Federal University of Par. The Evandro Chagas Research Institute Neurological Disability Scale (EIPEC-2), the Barthel Index and the Occupational Roles Identification List were applied. The G test and Fishers exact test (to identify associations between qualitative variables), the MannCWhitney test (to identify associations between quantitative variables) and Pearson correlation analysis (to identify associations between the total Barthel Index and EIPEC-2 scores) were performed with Microsoft Excel and BioEstat 5.0, and the significance level was set at p  0.05. RESULTS: Motor aspects, the presence of spasticity, sensory aspects, and pain in the lumbar region and lower limbs were significantly (p = 0.0002) higher among symptomatic individuals, who also had more difficulties urinating, traveling up and down stairs and transferring from a chair to a bed.

The viral infection continues to impact the globe with no vaccine to prevent the infection or highly effective therapeutics to treat the millions of infected people around the world. The disease starts as a respiratory infection, yet it may also be associated with a hypercoagulable state, severe inflammation owing to excessive cytokines production, and a potentially significant oxidative stress. The disease may progress to multiorgan failure and eventually death. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we summarize the potential of dipyridamole as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed the literature describing the biological activities of dipyridamole in various settings of testing. Data were retrieved from PubMed, SciFinder-CAS, and Web of Science. The review concisely covered relevant studies starting 1977. RESULTS: Dipyridamole is an approved antiplatelet drug, that has been used to prevent stroke, among other indications. Besides its antithrombotic activity, the literature indicates that dipyridamole also promotes a host of other biological activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant ones. CONCLUSION: Dipyridamole may substantially help improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 treatment. The pharmacokinetics profile of the drug is well established which makes it easier to design an appropriate therapeutic course. The drug is also generally safe, affordable, and available worldwide. Initial clinical trials have shown a substantial promise for dipyridamole in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, yet larger randomized and controlled trials are needed to confirm this promise.","output":"Potential Therapeutic Benefits of Dipyridamole in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humoral immunity is important for controlling viral diseases of poultry, but recent studies have indicated that cytotoxic T cells also play an important role in the immune response to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). To better understand the cell mediated immune responses to IBV in the mucosal and systemic immune compartments chickens were ocularly vaccinated with IBV. This induced a lymphocyte expansion in head-associated lymphoid tissues (HALT) and to a lesser extent in the spleen, followed by a rapid decline, probably due to homing of lymphocytes out of these organs and contraction of the lymphocyte population. This interpretation was supported by observations that changes in mononuclear cells were mirrored by that in CD3(+)CD44(+) T cell abundance, which presumably represent T effector cells. Increased interferon gamma (IFN-) expression was observed in the mucosal immune compartment, i.e., HALT, after primary vaccination, but shifted to the systemic immune compartment after boosting. In contrast, the expression of cytotoxicity-associated genes, i.e., granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin mRNA, remained associated with the HALT after boosting. Thus, an Ark-type IBV ocular vaccine induces a central memory IFN- response in the spleen while the cytotoxic effector memory response, as measured by GZMA and perforin mRNA expression, remains associated with CALT after boosting.","output":"Cell-mediated immune responses in the head-associated lymphoid tissues induced to a live attenuated avian coronavirus vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heterotopic ossification is defined as an aberrant formation of bone in extraskeletal soft tissue, for which both genetic and acquired conditions are known.

Social distancing measures that were implemented to control the 2019C2020 novel coronavirus outbreak were investigated for their ability to lessen the incident cases of seasonal influenza. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using data from Canadas national influenza surveillance system to investigate whether social distancing measures to control COVID-19 reduced the incident cases of seasonal influenza. Data taken from three separate time frames facilitated analysis of the 2019C2020 influenza season prior to, during, and following the implementation of COVID-19-related measures and enabled comparisons with the same time periods during three preceding flu seasons. The incidence, which referred to the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of specific influenza strains, was of primary focus. Further analysis determined the number of new laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness outbreaks. RESULTS: Our results indicate a premature end to the 2019C2020 influenza season, with significantly fewer cases and outbreaks being recorded following the enactment of many COVID-19 social distancing policies. The incidence of influenza strains A (H3N2), A (unsubtyped), and B were all significantly lower at the tail end of the 2019C2020 influenza season as compared with preceding seasons (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0019).

However, current hospital resilience frameworks emerged from pre-disaster conceptualizations, and have not been verified in real-life disaster contexts nor in the frontlines. Our aim was to study a tertiary hospital's resilience after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, as experienced by its staff. Methods: We undertook a qualitative study in the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), where we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with hospital staff. We inductively created themes to describe the earthquake burden to the hospital, and to analyze individual resilience of hospital staff. In addition, we deductively documented the resilience of the hospital as a system, according to the system resilience dimensions: means of resilience (redundancy and resourcefulness), and ends of resilience (robustness and rapidity). Results: In terms of robustness, TUTH increased its capacity for earthquake victims as elective activities were temporarily interrupted and quality of care was not a priority. Three stages of rapidity were identified: critical rapidity to address immediate needs, stabilizing rapidity until the hospital re-started routine activities, and recovery rapidity. In addition to the disaster plan, emerging adaptations played a major role in redundancy and resourcefulness. We found that individual resilience depended on three determinants: safety, meaningfulness, and sense of belonging. Conclusions: Hospital resilience results from a complexity of emerging and planned adaptations, as well as from interdependencies with individual resilience. Frameworks and plans to improve hospital resilience must reflect flexibility of response, and a concern for well-being of hospital staff is central for sustainable disaster response and improved resilience.","output":"Hospital Resilience After the 2015 Earthquake in Nepal: Results From Semi-structured Interviews With Hospital Staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early-life vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse child health outcomes, but the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its correlates in infants remains underexplored, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Infants were categorized into distinct categories based on serum 25(OH)D concentration level including deficient (<50 nmol/L), insufficient (50C74 nmol/L), and sufficient (75 nmol/L). Using multivariable Tobit and logistic regression models, we examined the correlates of serum 25(OH)D(3) levels. The overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 81% (95% confidence intervals (CI]) 78C83). Multivariable regression analysis showed that serum 25(OH)D(3) concentration was independently associated with study site, socioeconomic status, and sex.

Yet, scientific exchange is more important than ever, especially for infectious diseases and infection prevention specialists. Within a prospective cohort of congress attendees, we evaluated the safety concept of the 2020 congress of the Swiss Societies of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Hygiene. Methods The congress was held between September 2nd and 4th 2020 in Geneva (Switzerland), where COVID-19 incidence in the week during the congress was 65 cases /100 000 population within 7 days. A rigorous safety concept was implemented including universal face masking, physical distancing during sessions, and maximal reduction of social events. We invited congress attendees to participate in this prospective cohort and used an anonymized online questionnaire to assess risk perception, risk exposures, symptoms and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 of attendees before, during and after the congress. Dried blood spots were taken from attendees on-site and four weeks later to detect specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and to document seroconversions. Results A total of 365 people attended the congress, thereof 271 healthcare professionals. Of these, 196 (54%) either answered the questionnaire (N = 150) or provided baseline and follow-up blood samples (N = 168). None of the study participants reported a positive PCR result in the 2 weeks after the congress. Five of 168 (3%) participants were seropositive at follow-up, all of which had already been positive at baseline.

AS is caused by absent expression of the paternally imprinted gene UBE3A in the central nervous system. Disparities in the management of AS are a major problem in preparing for precision therapies and occur even in patients with access to experts and recognized clinics. AS patients receive care based on collective provider experience due to limited evidence\\\\based literature. We present a consensus statement and comprehensive literature review that proposes a standard of care practices for the management of AS at a critical time when therapeutics to alter the natural history of the disease are on the horizon. METHODS: We compiled the key recognized clinical features of AS based on consensus from a team of specialists managing patients with AS. Working groups were established to address each focus area with committees comprised of providers who manage >5 individuals. Committees developed management guidelines for their area of expertise. These were compiled into a final document to provide a framework for standardizing management. Evidence from the medical literature was also comprehensively reviewed. RESULTS: Areas covered by working groups in the consensus document include genetics, developmental medicine, psychology, general health concerns, neurology (including movement disorders), sleep, psychiatry, orthopedics, ophthalmology, communication, early intervention and therapies, and caregiver health. Working groups created frameworks, including flowcharts and tables, to help with quick access for providers.

Studies on the effect of castration and androgen receptor blockade have been mixed, while 5-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) use in men with COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus) have shown potential benefits. We assessed the association of 5ARI use on risk of community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60,474 males in a prospective registry of people tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and February 15, 2021 were included. Using a matched cohort design, men using 5ARIs were matched 1:1 to non5ARI users. Independent analysis using unconditional multivariable logistic regression on the entire unmatched data set was completed for validation. Primary outcome measures were the association of 5ARI use on rates of SARS-Cov-2 positivity and disease severity. RESULTS: Of the men 1,079 (1.8%) reported 5ARI use and 55,100 were available for matching. The final matched cohorts included 944 men each. Mean duration of use was 60.4 months (IQR 17-84 months). Absolute risk for infection was significantly lower in 5ARI users compared to nonusers, 42.3% (399/944) vs 47.2% (446/944), respectively (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 4.9%, OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97, p=0.026). Unconditional multivariable logistic regression analysis of the entire study cohort of 55,100 men confirmed the protective association of 5ARI use (ARR 5.3%, OR=0.877, 95% CI 0.774-0.995, p=0.042).

I review changes in prevalence, incidence, mortality, and other clinical outcomes among patients undergoing dialysis since March 2020, highlighting vulnerabilities in the current system and opportunities for improved care in the future. RECENT FINDINGS The number of dialysis patients in the United States declined between March 2020 and March 2021, an unprecedented year-over-year drop in the census. Some of the decline can be attributed to an early drop in patients initiating dialysis but most of the decline can be attributed to excess mortality. Kidney transplants also declined during the early part of the pandemic. Home dialysis utilization increased during 2020 but that increase was largely in line with secular trends. The rate of hospitalization for causes other than COVID-19 fell significantly during 2020. SUMMARY The epidemiology of dialysis in the United States is clearly modifiable, as it reflects decisions to initiate treatment, prescribe home therapies, and hospitalize patients with acute medical needs. On the other hand, some outcomes are powerfully guided by health outcomes in the general population, thus limiting the ability of dialysis providers and nephrologists to influence outcomes.","output":"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: the disruptor that maintenance dialysis never anticipated."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe adolescents' everyday activities and emotional consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Qualitative study grounded in Alfred Schtz's social phenomenology, involving 22 students at two public schools in a municipality in the state of S?o Paulo, Brazil.

RESULTS: Five categories emerged from the accounts: i) adolescents' reaction before the COVID-19 pandemic; ii) emotional consequences; iii) concern about the family; iv) adolescents' adaptation; and v) fragmentation of social support networks. Feelings such as uncertainty, fear, anguish, anxiety, and lack of motivation, depressive symptoms, and extreme suicidal ideation were reported. CONCLUSION: Paying attention to adolescents' psychosocial needs is essential, especially in face of the possibility of post-traumatic stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health professionals' technical competence combined with sensibility, strengthening of social support networks, and engagement of different community sectors are fundamental for promoting adolescent mental health in the current transition and resignification period following the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Emotional consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents: challenges to public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that are dependent on cellular machineries for their replication.

METHOD: All 9411 members of the DOG and BVA were given the opportunity to complete a questionnaire online in 2018 regarding aggression and violence in ophthalmology. RESULTS: Overall, 253 of 1508 (16.8%) ophthalmologists participating in the survey reported their most serious incident, 46.8% of which were classified as moderate and 34.3% were related to verbal violence such as insults and threats. The most serious incident was experienced by 171 (67.6%) physicians in a practice setting, 71% were specialists at the time of the incident and 74.3% of the incidents occurred during regular working hours. The main causes were intercultural conflicts, long waiting times, problems with the allocation of appointments, excessive expectations, differences in treatment and basic aggressiveness.

This article aims to investigate the change of anxiety severity and prevalence among non-graduating undergraduate students in the new semester of online learning during COVID-19 in China and also to evaluate a machine learning model based on the XGBoost model. A total of 1172 non-graduating undergraduate students aged between 18 and 22 from 34 provincial-level administrative units and 260 cities in China were enrolled onto this study and asked to fill in a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) twice, respectively, during February 15 to 17, 2020, before the new semester started, and March 15 to 17, 2020, 1 month after the new semester based on online learning had started. SPSS 22.0 was used to conduct t-test and single factor analysis. XGBoost models were implemented to predict the anxiety level of students 1 month after the start of the new semester. There were 184 (15.7%, Mean = 58.45, SD = 7.81) and 221 (18.86%, Mean = 57.68, SD = 7.58) students who met the cut-off of 50 and were screened as positive for anxiety, respectively, in the two investigations. The mean SAS scores in the second test was significantly higher than those in the first test (P < 0.05). Significant differences were also found among all males, females, and students majoring in arts and sciences between the two studies (P < 0.05). The results also showed students from Hubei province, where most cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, had a higher percentage of participants meeting the cut-off of being anxious. This article applied machine learning to establish XGBoost models to successfully predict the anxiety level and changes of anxiety levels 4 weeks later based on the SAS scores of the students in the first test. It was concluded that, during COVID-19, Chinese non-graduating undergraduate students showed higher anxiety in the new semester based on online learning than before the new semester started.

METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, we conducted a case-control study using ICD-10-CM codes to identify PWSUD aged 12 years and older with hospital visits for any reason during AprilCDecember 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to identify factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among PWSUD (age, sex, race/ethnicity, U.S. Census Region, urban/rural classification, insurance payor type, comorbidities, and substance use disorder [SUD] type), and then stratified by SUD type. RESULTS: From April-December 2020, 18,298 (1.3%) of 1,429,154 persons with SUD in the database had a COVID-19 diagnosis. Among PWSUD, opioid use disorder (OUD; aOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.18C1.32), alcohol use disorder (AUD; aOR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.11C1.22), cocaine or other stimulant use disorder (COUD; aOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.22C1.34), and multiple SUDs (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.15C1.26) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19, as were comorbidities such as chronic lower respiratory disease (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.26C1.37), chronic hepatitis (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.34C1.57), and diabetes (aOR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.71C1.86).

The spike glycoprotein (S) of PEDV is the major immunogenic determinant that plays a pivotal role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV, which therefore is an ideal target for the development of subunit vaccine. In an attempt to develop a subunit vaccine for PEDV, we cloned two different fragments of S protein and expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins, namely rGST-COE and rGST-S1D, in E.coli. However, the expression of these recombinant protein antigens using a variety of expression vectors, strains, and induction conditions invariably resulted in inclusion bodies. To achieve the soluble expression of recombinant proteins, several chaperone co-expression systems were tested in this study. RESULTS: We firstly tested various chaperone co-expression systems and found that co-expression of trigger factor (TF) with recombinant proteins at 15 C was most useful in soluble production of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D compared to GroEL-ES and DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE/GroEL-ES systems. The soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D were purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B with a yield of 7.5 mg/l and 5 mg/l, respectively. Purified proteins were detected by western blot using mouse anti-GST mAb and pig anti-PEDV immune sera. In an indirect ELISA, purified proteins showed immune reactivity with pig anti-PEDV immune sera. Finally, immunization of mice with 10 g of purified proteins elicited highly potent serum IgG and serum neutralizing antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, soluble production of recombinant spike protein of PEDV, rGST-COE and rGST-S1D, were achieved by using TF chaperone co-expression system. Our results suggest that soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D produced by co-expressing chaperones may have the potential to be used as subunit vaccine antigens.

Objective: To determine if the observed change in reported norovirus outbreaks in the United States was best explained by underreporting, seasonal trends, or reduced exposure due to NPIs. We also aimed to assess if the change in reported norovirus outbreaks varied by setting. Design: An ecologic, interrupted time series analysis of norovirus outbreaks from nine states reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) from July 2012-July 2020. Setting: Surveillance data from Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin were included in the analysis. Participants: 9,226 reports of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks with norovirus as an epidemiologically suspected or laboratory-confirmed etiology were included in the analysis, resulting in more than 8 years of follow up. Outbreak reports from states that participated in NoroSTAT for at least 4 years were included in the analysis (range: 4-8 years). Exposure: The main exposure of interest was time period: before (July 2012-February 2020) or after (April 2020-July 2020) the start of NPIs in the United States Main outcome: The main outcome of interest was monthly rate of reported norovirus outbreaks. As a secondary outcome, we also examined the average outbreak size. Results: We found that the decline in norovirus outbreak reports was significant for all 9 states considered (pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing April 2020-July 2020 vs. all pre-COVID months for each state= 0.14, 95% CI: 0.098, 0.21; P=<0.0001), even after accounting for typical seasonal decline in incidence during the summer months. These patterns were similar across a variety of settings, including nursing homes, child daycares, healthcare settings, and schools. The average outbreak size was also reduced by 61% (95% CI: 56%, 42.7%; P=<0.0001), suggesting that the decline does not reflect a tendency to report only more severe outbreaks due to strained surveillance systems, but instead reflects a decline in incidence. Conclusions and relevance: While NPIs implemented during the spring and summer of 2020 were intended to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these changes also appear to have impacted the incidence of norovirus, a non-respiratory pathogen. These results suggest that NPIs may provide benefit for preventing transmission of other human pathogens, reducing strain to health systems during the continued SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for SARS-CoV-2 on norovirus outbreaks: an analysis of outbreaks reported by 9 US States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in many ways, economically, socially and culturally. One of the most important ways to recover from the devastating effects of COVID-19 is identification of ideal vaccination strategy. The fact that it is not possible to vaccinate everyone at the same time in the world leads to vaccinations by giving priority to certain groups. Therefore, governments should determine priority groups for allocating COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, four main criteria (age, peoples health status, woman status, and job kinds), fifteen sub-criteria, and six possible vaccine alternatives are identified. First, the main and sub-criteria are evaluated using the Interval-Valued Pythagorean fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (IVPF-AHP). Then, possible COVID-19 vaccine alternatives are ranked using Interval-Valued Pythagorean fuzzy WASPAS (IVPF-WASPAS).

In vivo studies in the available literature have used avian models, but these models are difficult to scale and maintain. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the plausibility of a murine model of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis utilizing bioluminescence imaging and tissue analysis at harvest. METHODS: A 2-L inoculate of bioluminescent Xen29 Staphylococcus aureus or sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (sPBS) was administered to the tendon sheath of 36 male C57BL/6J mice. The infectious course was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) via an in vivo imaging system, gross anatomic deformity, and weight change. The infected hind paws were harvested at 4 time points: 24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks for histological analysis using Alcian blue, hematoxylin, and Orange-G staining. Two-way analysis of variance with the Sidak multiple comparison test was used to assess differences in bioluminescence and weight at each time point. RESULTS: The infected cohort displayed significantly elevated bioluminescence values, had reductions in weight, and exhibited swelling of the infected digit throughout the course of infection. By day 4, most infected mice saw a substantial decrease in BLI signal intensity; however, 2 infected mice exhibited persistent BLI intensity through day 14. Histological analysis of the infected cohort showed tissue disorganization and the presence of a cellular infiltrate in and around the flexor tendon sheath. CONCLUSIONS: A murine model of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is possible and can serve as an experimental platform for further investigation of the pathophysiology of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis.

Therefore, chloroquine is considered as a treatment option for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chloroquine is known for prolonging the QT interval, but limited data are available on the extent of this QT-prolonging effect. OBJECTIVE: To assess the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate whether this prolongation increases with the cumulative dose of chloroquine and is associated with the peak plasma concentration of chloroquine. Furthermore, the number of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment or had an adjustment in dose due to QTc-interval prolongation was established. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed in patients aged over 18 years, hospitalised for a suspected or proven infection with COVID-19, and therefore treated with chloroquine, with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to the start of treatment and at least one ECG after starting the treatment. RESULTS: In total, 397 patients were included. The mean increase in QTc interval throughout the treatment with chloroquine was 33 ms. Nineteen out of 344 patients unnecessarily had their treatment prematurely discontinued or adjusted due to a prolonged QTc interval based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients gradually increased the QTc interval. Due to a significant number of overestimated QTc intervals by computer analysis, it is advisable to measure the QTc interval manually before adjusting the dose or withdrawing this potentially beneficial medication.","output":"The risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Recent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 raised concerns about diminishing vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 caused by particular variants. Even with a high initial efficacy, if a vaccine efficacy drops significantly against variants, or if it cannot be distributed quickly, it is uncertain whether the vaccine can provide better health outcomes than other vaccines. Hence, we evaluated the trade-offs between speed of distribution vs. efficacy of multiple vaccines when variants emerge. Methods: We utilized a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIR-D) model to simulate the impact of immunization using different vaccines with varying efficacies and assessed the level of infection attack rate (IAR) under different speeds of vaccine distribution. Results: We found that a vaccine with low efficacy both before and after variants may outperform a vaccine with high efficacy if the former can be distributed more quickly. Particularly, a vaccine with 65% and 60% efficacy before and after the variants, respectively, can outperform a vaccine with 95% and 90% efficacy, if its distribution is 46% to 48% faster (with the selected study parameters).

Forty participants (70.3  5.0 years) were randomly assigned to either a training (TG) or control group (CG) and performed a controlled low-threshold and care-oriented 6-week-long combined resistance and endurance training program. Changes in anthropometrics as well as strength capacity were measured. In subgroups of TG and CG, T cells and their subpopulations (CD4(+), CD8(+), na?ve, central, effector memory, T-EMRA) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The changes of various plasma cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adipokines were analyzed by luminex assays. The exercise program was followed by an increase in strength capacities.

METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was conducted, involving patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2 periods: pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The surgical intervention data evaluated included diagnostic category, case priority, complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 850 procedures were included, 36% during COVID-19. The median number of procedures per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (5.5 cases) than during the pre-COVID-19 period (12 cases; P < 0.0001).

In 40 of the 70 cases (57%), the Circuit affirmed a decision below, in most cases, denying applications for writs of habeas corpus. Eight cases (11%) are still pending, that is, there was a remand from the Fifth Circuit or a grant of a certificate of appealability, and further proceedings are currently taking place or being scheduled. In 13 cases (18.5%), although preliminary relief had been granted, defendants were ultimately unsuccessful;as of the writing of this paper, ten have been executed, one defendants execution has been stayed because of Covid-related reasons, one died in prison and one remains on death row. In short, if every one of the defendants in pending cases is successful (an outcome that, based on the Fifth Circuits global track record, is certainly not likely), that will mean that Atkins claims were successful in just 24% of all cases. Our findings also revealed important patterns of why certain defendants were successful, and the majority were unsuccessful. It was more likely that at least preliminary relief was granted in those cases in which defendants were able to rebut allegations that they were malingering, in which effort to raise the so-called Flynn effect were prevalent, and in which the WAIS IQ test was relied upon;if all three were present, that seemed to heighten the likelihood of success. On the other hand, the findings also revealed that it was less likely that a defendant would be successful if the WISC IQ test were used, if there was no rebuttal for malingering claims or if the subsequently-discredited testimony of one forensic psychologist was used by the state.Our roadmap is this: First, we discuss the Atkins case and the significance of how post-Atkins cases modified and reinforced some of Atkins most salient points. Following this, we will examine the universe of Fifth Circuit cases applying (often, misapplying) Atkins, explaining our methodology and revealing our findings. We then consider this entire area of law and policy through the lens and filter of therapeutic jurisprudence, and then subsequently apply that doctrines principles to the database of the cases in question. We conclude by offering some modest suggestions focusing on how we can finally, some 17 years after one of us used this phrase in a title of another law review article about Atkins, giv[e] life to this case.","output":"'Man is Opposed to Fair Play': An Empirical Analysis of How the Fifth Circuit Has Failed to Take Seriously Atkins v.

The earlier successes in repurposing resulted primarily from serendipitous findings but more recently, drug or target-centric systematic identification of repurposing opportunities continues to rise. Kinases are one of the most sought-after cancer drug targets over the last three decades. There are many non-cancer approved drugs that can inhibit kinases as \\"off-targets\\" as well as many existing kinase inhibitors that can target new additional kinases in cancer. Identifying cancer-associated kinase inhibitors through mining commercial drug databases or new kinase targets for existing inhibitors through comprehensive kinome profiling can offer more effective trial-ready options to rapidly advance drugs for clinical validation. In this review, we argue that drug repurposing is an important approach in modern drug development for cancer therapeutics. We have summarized the advantages of repurposing, the rationale behind this approach together with key barriers and opportunities in cancer drug development. We have also included examples of non-cancer drugs that inhibit kinases or are associated with kinase signalling as a basis for their anti-cancer action.","output":"Repurposing existing therapeutics, its importance in oncology drug development: kinases as a potential target."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND EAACI guidelines emphasise the importance of patient history in diagnosing food allergy (FA), and the need for studies investigating its value, using standardised allergy-focused questionnaires. OBJECTIVE To determine the contribution of reaction characteristics, allergic comorbidities, and demographics, in predicting FA in individuals experiencing food-related adverse reactions. METHODS Adult and school-age participants in the standardised EuroPrevall population surveys, with self-reported FA, were included. Penalised multivariable regression was used to assess the association of patient history determinants with 'probable' FA, defined as a food-specific case history supported by relevant IgE sensitisation. RESULTS In adults (N=844), reproducibility of reaction (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.29-1.41]), oral allergy symptoms (OAS) (4.46 [4.19-4.75]), allergic rhinitis (AR) comorbidity (2.82 [2.68-2.95]), asthma comorbidity (1.38 [1.30-1.46]), and male sex (1.50 [1.41-1.59]), were positively associated with probable FA. Gastrointestinal symptoms (0.88 [0.85-0.91]) made probable FA less likely. The AUC of a model combining all selected predictors was 0.85 after cross-validation. In children (N=670), OAS (2.26 [2.09-2.44]) and AR comorbidity (1.47 [CI 1.39-1.55]) contributed most to prediction of probable FA, with a combined cross-validation-based AUC of 0.73. When focusing on plant foods, the dominant source of FA in adults, the paediatric model also included gastrointestinal symptoms (inverse association), and the AUC increased to 0.81. CONCLUSIONS In both adults and school-age children from the general population, reporting of OAS, and AR comorbidity, appear to be the strongest predictors of probable FA. Patient history particularly allows for good discrimination between presence and absence of probable plant FA.","output":"Predicting food allergy: the value of patient history reinforced."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic disrupted learning environments, adding significantly to an already-challenging time for adolescents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Single-center retrospective study. Patients with clinical suspicion and imaging diagnosis of osteoid osteoma were treated by CT-guided RFA using the same device with either a 7- or 10-mm active tip electrode. Specific precautions were applied in case of articular or spinal OO. Patients were contacted by phone to evaluate the long-term outcome in terms of pain, ability to perform daily activities (including sports), and long-term complications. Success was defined as the absence of residual pain and ability to perform daily activities normally. RESULTS From 2008 to 2015, 126 patients were treated by CT-guided RFA for OO in our institution. Mean patient age was 26.1 years (SD = 11, range 1-53); mean delay to diagnosis was 16.9 months (SD = 15.2, range 1-120). Among patients who answered the follow-up call (n = 88), the overall success rate was 94.3%: 79/88 (89.8%) had primary success of the procedure, and 4/88 (4.5%) had a secondary success (repeat-RFA after pain recurrence). Mean follow-up time was 34.6 months (SD = 24.7, range 3-90). Few complications occurred: two mild reversible peripheral nerve injuries, one brachial plexus neuropathy, one broken electrode tip fragment, and one muscular hematoma.

Imaging plays an important role in assessing severity of COVID 19 pneumonia. However, semantic interpretation of chest radiography (CXR) findings does not include quantitative description of radiographic opacities. Most current AI assisted CXR image analysis framework do not quantify for regional variations of disease. To address these, we proposed a four region lung segmentation method to assist accurate quantification of COVID 19 pneumonia. Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used, which are the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower lungs. To improve the segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical relevance of the proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the Quality of Lung Edema (RALE). Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods (0.854 0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive correlation to the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities under the RALE framework. Conclusion.

In this respect, bitumen with 70/100 penetration grade was modified with WS in different rates ranging from 1 to 5% with 1% increment. Basic test methods including penetration, softening point, rotational viscometer were conducted on the bitumen samples to analyze physical properties, while dynamic shear rheometer and bending beam rheometer tests were performed on the samples for rheological assessment. Rolling thin film oven and pressure aging vessel tests, which are aging methods in rheological evaluation, were followed to supply short- and long-term aged samples, respectively. Storage stability test was conducted on the modified samples to determine the compatibility between the two materials at different contribution WS rates. The results showed that significant changes occur on both physical and rheological properties of WS-modified bitumen. Compatibility between WS and bitumen was not observed except of the bitumen modified up to 2% WS as examined with softening point, but up to 3% WS as examined with penetration test.

The evidence base underpinning such practices warrants examination. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize current guidance and systematic review evidence on extended use, reuse, or reprocessing of single-use surgical masks or filtering face-piece respirators. DATA SOURCES: We used the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England websites to identify guidance. We used Medline, PubMed, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database, and preprint servers for systematic reviews. METHODS: Two reviewers conducted screening and data extraction. The quality of included systematic reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Findings were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: In total, 6 guidance documents were identified. Levels of detail and consistency across documents varied. They included 4 high-quality systematic reviews: 3 focused on reprocessing (decontamination) of N95 respirators and 1 focused on reprocessing of surgical masks. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation were highlighted as the most promising reprocessing methods, but evidence on the relative efficacy and safety of different methods was limited. We found no well-established methods for reprocessing respirators at scale. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the impact of extended use and reuse of surgical masks and respirators is limited, and gaps and inconsistencies exist in current guidance. Where extended use or reuse is being practiced, healthcare organizations should ensure that policies and systems are in place to ensure these practices are carried out safely and in line with available guidance.","output":"Extended use or reuse of single-use surgical masks and filtering face-piece respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization's (WHO) 2018 blueprint of priority diseases, based upon their potential to cause epidemics and public health emergencies included two respiratory illnesses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), both caused by members of the Coronaviridae family (BioDefense, 2018). Now three years later, we are amid an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by another Coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2. This virus has rapidly spread across the globe causing over 5.4 million deaths throughout the world. Symptoms of the viral infection include shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headaches and most importantly acute lung injury (ALI) caused by dysregulation of pulmonary RAS (Renin-Angiotensin System). RAS, the main network controlling blood pressure is regulated by ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) and its homolog ACE2. It is now known that the SARS-CoV-2, uses ACE2 as the cell receptor to enter and infiltrate the host cell. While ACE promotes atrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, oxidants, and vasoconstriction, ACE2 through its metabolism of angiotensin I, restricts excessive atrophy, fibrosis and causes vasodilation. Furthermore, ACE2 with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role protects lung tissues and therefore a downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-Cov-2 infection can result in development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Imai, Kuba, & Penninger, 2008). The Spike (S) protein of SARS-Cov-2 binds to ACE2, and recent studies have identified several residues in Exon 1 of ACE-2, that mediate this binding (Rehman & Tabish, 2020). Our study aims to sequence ACE2 Exon 1 from Bos taurus and then compare it to human ACE2 Exon 1 using a variety of bioinformatics tools to understand and possibly identify polymorphisms that could determine species susceptibility to Covid-19 infection. This investigation began with genomic DNA extraction from calf thymus. The genomic DNA was then analyzed using spectrophotometry (Biophotometer and Nanodrop) and gel electrophoresis. Thereafter, ACE2 target primers were designed using Primer BLAST and Primer Quest. We are now getting ready to run PCR to amplify our ACE2 Exon 1 target from Bos taurus, and after purifying the PCR products, we will sequence the ACE2 Exon 1 using our SeqStudio genetic analyzer. The sequence will then be analyzed and compared to its human counterpart using a variety of bioinformatics tools to gain a better understanding of polymorphisms that might influence SARS-Cov-2's initial interaction with its host as well as pathogenesis of COVID-19 in general.

Data obtained from death certificates from the Arkansas Department of Health was used to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis to assess whether decedents of IHD were more likely to die at home during the pandemic (March 2020 through September 2020). The analysis compared location of death for decedents of IHD pre and during the pandemic to location of death for decedents from non-natural causes. Before the pandemic, 50.0% of decedents of IHD died at home compared to 57.9% dying at home during (through September 2020) the pandemic study period (p < .001). There was no difference in the proportion of decedents who died at home from non-natural causes before and during the pandemic study period (55.8% vs. 53.5%; p = .21). After controlling for confounders, there was a 48% increase in the odds of dying at home from IHD during the pandemic study period (p < .001) relative to the change in dying at home due to non-natural causes.

However, the efficacy of recanalization therapy for BAO has not been established as yet. OBJECTIVE We analyzed consecutive cases of BAO treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) to evaluate its safety and efficacy and to determine factors associated with the prognosis. METHODS Between October 2011 and September 2016, MT was performed in 34 patients with BAO. MT was performed using the Penumbra system and stent retriever. CT perfusion was used for evaluating patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps were evaluated. CBF/CBV mismatch was defined as 50% penumbra. Clinical outcomes were correlated with demographic, clinical, and radiographic findings. RESULTS The median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 29 (14-33). The recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grades 2b) was 100%. The median onset to recanalization time (OTR) was 197 (160-256) min. Favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 2) at 90 days occurred in 56% (n = 19 of 34). The mortality rate at 90 days was 12% (n = 4 of 34).

Participants were randomly asked about either government \\"passports\\" or private \\"certificates\\" for COVID-19 immunity. Participants: U.S. adults from a standing panel maintained for academic research, selected to approximate national demographics. Main Outcomes/Measures: Level of support/opposition to immunity privileges, and whether views vary based on: government vs. private adoption; demographics; political affiliation or views; or various COVID19-related attitudes and experiences. Results: Of 1315 respondents, 45.2% supported immunity privileges, with slightly more favoring private certificates than government passports (48.1% vs 42.6%, p=0.04). Support was greater for using passports or certificates to enable returns to high-risk jobs or attendance at large recreational events than for returning to work generally. Levels of support did not vary significantly according to age groups, socioeconomic or employment status, urbanicity, political affiliation or views, or whether the respondent had chronic disease(s). However, estimates from adjusted analyses showed less support among women (Odds Ratio, 0.64; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56; 0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40 to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Opposition was much lower among those who personally wanted a passport or certificate (24.4%) and much higher among those who believed this would harm the social fabric of their community (77.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: Public views are divided on either government or private use of immunity certificates, but these views do not vary along usual political lines or by characteristics that indicate individual vulnerability to infection.

The medications currently available to treat AD and PD have limited efficacy and are associated with side effects. Natural products are one of the most vital and conservative sources of medicines for treating neurological problems. Karanjin is a furanoflavonoid, isolated mainly from Pongamia pinnata with several medicinal plants, and has been reported for numerous health benefits. However, the effect of karanjin on AD and PD has not yet been systematically investigated. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of karanjin, extensive in silico studies starting with molecular docking against five putative targets for AD and four targets for PD were conducted. The findings were compared with three standard drugs using Auto Dock 4.1 and Molegro Virtual Docker software. Additionally, the physiochemical properties (Lipinski rule of five), drug-likeness and parameters including absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) profiles of karanjin were also studied. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with two selective karanjin docking complexes to analyze the dynamic behaviors and binding free energy at 100 ns time scale. In addition, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and density-functional theory (DFT) were also investigated from computational quantum mechanism perspectives using the Avogadro-ORCA 1.2.0 platform. Karanjin complies with all five of Lipinskis drug-likeness rules with suitable ADMET profiles for therapeutic use. The docking scores (kcal/mol) showed comparatively higher potency against AD and PD associated targets than currently used standard drugs. Overall, the potential binding affinity from molecular docking, static thermodynamics feature from MD-simulation and other multiparametric drug-ability profiles suggest that karanjin could be considered as a suitable therapeutic lead for AD and PD treatment. Furthermore, the present results were strongly correlated with the earlier study on karanjin in an Alzheimers animal model. However, necessary in vivo studies, clinical trials, bioavailability, permeability and safe dose administration, etc. must be required to use karanjin as a potential drug against AD and PD treatment, where the in silico results are more helpful to accelerate the drug development.","output":"In Silico Molecular Docking Analysis of Karanjin against Alzheimers and Parkinsons Diseases as a Potential Natural Lead Molecule for New Drug Design, Development and Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thalidomide was initially developed as a sedative; subsequently, its use was expanded to treat morning sickness in pregnant women.

Targeted initiatives based on survey responses were implemented focusing on antimicrobial bathing, increasing confidence in an evidence-based bundle, and its ability to reduce infections. Adherence and central lineCassociated bloodstream infection rates were monitored at baseline and at 3, 9, and 15 months post intervention. OUTCOMES: Adherence to bundle elements improved post intervention in 4 areas in critical care units: correctly labeling catheter dressings, maintaining an occlusive dressing, clamping unused catheter lumens, and daily antimicrobial bathing. In oncology units, adherence improved in clamping unused lumens and daily antimicrobial bathing. At 9 months post intervention, infection rates decreased from 6.08 to 1.48 in critical care units and 3.13 to 0.30 in oncology units.

Moreover, there is a scarce of reliable non-invasive methods to evaluate atherosclerotic changes of the vasculature. The ALIROCKS trial was performed to address these issues using standard ultrasound-based procedures and a completely novel magnetic resonance-based imaging technique. Methods: A total of 24 patients with an indication for treatment with PCSK9 antibodies were recruited. There were 2 visits to the study site, the first before initiation of treatment with alirocumab and the second after 10 weeks of treatment. The key outcome measures included the change of carotid vessel wall fractional anisotropy, a novel magnetic resonance-based measure of vascular integrity, and the changes of carotid intima-media thickness and flow-dependent dilatation of the brachial artery measured with ultrasound. Results: A total of 19 patients completed the trial, 2 patients stopped treatment, 3 patients did not undergo the second visit due to the COVID pandemic. All of them had atherosclerotic vascular disease. Their mean (standard deviation) LDL-cholesterol concentration was 154 (85) mg/dL at baseline and was reduced by 76 (44) mg/dL in response to alirocumab treatment (p < 0.001, n = 19).

To reduce the spread, it is important to engage in preventive behaviors recommended by health authorities, such as washing your hands, wearing a face mask, and social distancing. Aim: In the present study, we draw from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine the associations between perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm and whether people engage in eight different preventive behaviors. Methods: For each of the preventive behaviors (washing hands; using hand sanitizer; not touching your face; social distancing; wearing a face mask; disinfecting surfaces; coughing in your elbow; staying home if sick), we conducted separate logistic regressions predicting whether the participants (N = 2,256; age range = 1898 years) reported engaging in the behavior from their perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm. Results: We found that perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm had independent significant associations with each preventive behavior. Moderation analyses revealed that for most behaviors the associations with perceived behavioral control were stronger for older adults than for younger adults. Limitation: The present study was cross-sectional; future longitudinal studies and interventions are needed to disentangle directionality.

All countries have taken measures to control the spread of the epidemic. Because it is not known when the epidemic will end in several countries, then the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic is a very important challenge. This study has predicted the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries using the logistic growth model. This model has analyzed several countries to describe the epidemic situation of these countries. The time interval of the actual data used as a comparison with the prediction results of this model was starting in the firstly confirmed COVID-19 cases to December 2020. This study examined an approach to the complexity spread of the COVID-19 pandemic using the logistic growth model formed from an ordinary differential equation. This model described the time-dependent population growth rate characterized by the three parameters of the analytical solution. The non-linear least-squares method was used to estimate the three parameters. These parameters described the rate growth constant of infected cases and the total number of confirmed cases in the final phase of the epidemic. This model is applied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. The prediction results show the spread dynamics of COVID-19 infected cases which are characterized by time-dependent dynamics. In this study, the proposed model provides estimates for the model parameters that are good for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic because they correspond to actual data for all analyzed countries. It is based on the coefficient of determination, R2, and the R2 value of more than 95% which is obtained from the non-linear curves for all analyzed countries.

Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, concomitant pharmacotherapy, primary and secondary outcome, and lab profile were compared between patients who received inpatient ACEI/ARB use and those who did not in all patients, and subpopulation of patients when concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir or dexamethasone was excluded. Primary outcome was also compared in subgroup of patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure.Findings Among the 4854 patients admitted with COVID-19, 571 patients (11.8%) received inpatient ACEI/ARB, and 4283 patients (88.2%) did not. The ACEI/ARB group were older, had more male patients, and had more cardiovascular comorbidities. The 30-day and 90-day mortality for ACEI/ARB users were 14.71% and 15.41%, whereas the 30-day and 90-day mortality for non-users were 21.9% and 22.53%.

We explored the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on on patients' cannabis use, hypothesizing that users would be increasing their use due to heightened stress and increased uncertainty. METHODS: Participants were part of an anonymous online survey of cannabis use in cancer. Items specific to COVID-19 were administered between April and June 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of respondents (n = 26) confirmed they used cannabis during COVID-19. The top 5 reasons for use were sleep, anxiety, nausea, pain, and appetite. Ninety-two percent denied they were using cannabis for new or different symptoms. Eighty-one percent were using about the same amount as before, 11.5% were using less, and 8% more. Only 12% reported that product cost affected their use and that they had changed the way in which they used cannabis. Eight percent were stockpiling product so that they did not run out during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of those reporting a change in cannabis use were modest. Increased use may reflect efforts to relieve stress. Decreased use may reflect barriers to securing unregulated products and perceived vulnerability to the effects of infection on the respiratory system.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection.

The proposed framework makes use of two approaches: an unsupervised classification based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a supervised classification based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Both of these approaches consider two spectral features, namely the Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) and Spectral Centroid (SC), determined during the feature extraction step. Unsupervised classification is used to explore the content of the BCG signals, justifying the existence of different classes and permitting the definition of useful hyper-parameters for effective segmentation. In contrast, the considered supervised classification approach aims to determine if the BCG signal content allows the measurement of the heart rate (HR) and the respiratory rate (RR) or not. Furthermore, two levels of supervised classification are used to classify human-body activities into many realistic classes from the BCG signal (e.g., coughing, holding breath, air expiration, movement, et al.). The first one considers frame-by-frame classification, while the second one, aiming to boost the segmentation performance, transforms the frame-by-frame SFM and SC features into temporal series which track the temporal variation of the measures of the BCG signal.

Developing drugs that target multiple points in the viral life cycle could serve as a strategy to tackle the current as well as future coronavirus pandemics. Here we leverage the power of our recently developed in silico screening platform, VirtualFlow, to identify inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. VirtualFlow is able to efficiently harness the power of computing clusters and cloud-based computing platforms to carry out ultra-large scale virtual screens. In this unprecedented structure-based multi-target virtual screening campaign, we have used VirtualFlow to screen an average of approximately 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets in the cloud. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also target critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interaction interfaces. This multi-target approach not only increases the likelihood of finding a potent inhibitor, but could also help identify a collection of anti-coronavirus drugs that would retain efficacy in the face of viral mutation. Drugs belonging to different regimen classes could be combined to develop possible combination therapies, and top hits that bind at highly conserved sites would be potential candidates for further development as coronavirus drugs.

An online community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from November 2020 through January 2021. In the survey, 402 Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) members from the Mzuzu City area participated, recruited using snowball and respondent-driven sampling techniques. The sample size was computed using a single population proportion using the Yamane formula. Descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regression model techniques were also employed. Additionally, we used the Chi-Square test, two-way ANOVA, and Ordinal regression model to determine statistical associations between socioeconomic data and QOL and wellbeing variables with a 5% level of significance. On the aspect of community wellbeing, the findings of our study indicated that income (levels and disposal) provided members with options to live a better QOL and wellbeing within the community by either facilitating payment for better education, eating healthier foods, acquiring assets, etc. Further, the absence of discrimination provided a platform for voice, inclusion, and social trust, enhancing freedom of expression. We also found that education facilitated better earnings and knowledge of public health-related issues. As for the contribution to the sharing economy, our study has emphasized the role played by trust in enhancing sharing economy. We recommend and encourage people to join these VSLAs so as to improve their QOL and wellbeing. However, there is a need to replicate the study on a larger scale to validate our study findings for effective policy formulation and implementation geared to improving the overall quality of peoples lives. Based on these findings, we further recommend that authorities reinstate programs like National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2016C2020 and Savings and Loan Groups Best Practice Guidelines (SLG BPGs) 2016C2017 that could further enhance the future of VSLAs, which are vital for QOL and community wellbeing of the people in developing countries like Malawi.","output":"Quality of Life and Community Wellbeing of Members Associated With Village Savings and Loans Associations as a Model of Sharing Economy in the Least Developing Countries: A Case of Mzuzu City in Northern Malawi, Southern Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the frequency and factors related to punitive patient safety event report submissions, referred to as Patient Safety Net reports, or PSNs B Objective: b To analyze emergency department (ED) revisits from patients discharged with possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) B Editor's note: b The Hong Kong Journal of Emergency Medicine has partnered with a small group of selected journals of international emergency medicine societies to share from each a highlighted research study, as selected monthly by their editors [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Hong Kong Journal of Emergency Medicine is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Reciprocal Abstracts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lack of established knowledge and treatment strategies, and change in work environment, may altogether critically affect the mental health and functioning of physicians treating COVID-19 patients.

Unfortunately, this is likely a gross underestimate because of a lack of reliable and accurate COVID-19 data for American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Multiple factors contribute to poor data quality including the lack of Indigenous representation in the data and rampant racial misclassification at both the individual and group levels. The current pandemic has shed light on multiple pre-existing issues related to Indigenous data sovereignty in data collection and management. We discuss the importance of centring Indigenous data sovereignty in the systemic efforts to increase COVID-19 data availability and quality. The federal and state governments must support and promote Tribes' rights to access data. Federal and state governments should also focus on bolstering their data availability and quality for aggregated data on AIAN populations and for providing disaggregated Tribal data to Tribes.

The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of the pandemic on surgical volume in our hospital. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was done at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. A 2- year data was collected from March 2019 up to March 2021 from the operation theatre registration books. The data registry at the admission records office was also reviewed to extract the number pf patients on the elective surgery waiting list. Data were recorded, analyzed and reported using SPSS software package 26. RESULTS: The findings showed that there was a significant drop in surgical volume during the COVID-19 era. Surgical volume has dropped by 19% for emergency and by 32% for elective surgeries. COVID-19 test positivity of patients was identified as the single most important reason for elective operation cancellation during the first wave of the pandemic, contributing to as high as 85% of the reasons. CONCLUSION: The outcome of our study showed that COVID-19 has adversely affected elective and emergency surgical volume in our institution. This has also led to a dramatic increase in the surgical waiting list load. We recommend immediate surgical systems strengthening measures to re-build the surgical care ecosystem significantly affected by COVID-19.

The aim of this study is to compare the absolute pre- and postoperative incidence of AF after minimally invasive surgical ablation for paroxysmal AF. METHODS Twenty consecutive patients (mean age 55  8; 55% male) received a continuous loop monitor (CLM) 4 weeks prior to a minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation (MIPVI). The mean preoperative AF burden was compared with the mean AF burden during follow-up. Follow-up was achieved for a period of 12 months. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent an MIPVI successfully. Two patients did not reach the threshold for surgery. In 1 patient, surgery was discontinued because of a perioperative bleeding due to adhesions after a previous percutaneous AF ablation. Mean AF burden preoperatively was 66%. After 12 months, there was an absolute reduction in AF burden of 65% (95% CI 42-88, P < 0.001) and 12 of 15 patients in follow-up (80%) were free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). CONCLUSIONS The use of a CLM in the follow-up of surgical ablation is a very accurate way to confirm absolute surgical results. Furthermore, with the use of a CLM, preoperative evaluation can be done more accurately, and the surgical procedure can be adjusted to the patients' needs.","output":"A new approach to determine the results of minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation using a continuous loop monitor: preliminary results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 continues to represent a global health emergency as a highly transmissible, airborne virus. An important coronaviral drug target for treatment of COVID-19 is the conserved main protease (Mpro). Nirmatrelvir is a potent Mpro inhibitor and the antiviral component of Paxlovid?. The significant viral sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represented a unique opportunity to assess potential nirmatrelvir escape mutations from emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. To establish the baseline mutational landscape of Mpro prior to the introduction of Mpro inhibitors, Mpro sequences and its cleavage junction regions were retrieved from 4,892,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in GISAID. Any mutations identified from comparison to the reference sequence (Wuhan-hu-1) were cataloged and analyzed. Mutations at sites key to nirmatrelvir binding and protease functionality (e.g., dimerization sites) were still rare. Structural comparison of Mpro also showed conservation of key nirmatrelvir contact residues across the extended Coronaviridae family (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronaviruses). Additionally, we showed that over time the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme remained under purifying selection and was highly conserved relative to the spike protein. Now, with the EUA approval of Paxlovid and its expected widespread use across the globe, it is essential to continue large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro evolution. This study establishes a robust analysis framework for monitoring emergent mutations in millions of virus isolates, with the goal of identifying potential resistance to present and future SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. Importance The recent authorization of oral SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, such as Paxlovid, has ushered in a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergence of new variants, as well as selective pressure imposed by antiviral drugs themselves, raise concern for potential escape mutations in key drug binding motifs. To determine the potential emergence of antiviral resistance in globally circulating isolates and its implications for the clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates before, during, and after the introduction of new antiviral treatments is critical. The infrastructure built herein for active genetic surveillance of Mpro evolution and emergent mutations will play an important role in assessing potential antiviral resistance as the pandemic progresses and Mpro inhibitors are introduced. We anticipate our framework to be the starting point in a larger effort for global monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutational landscape.","output":"Genetic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reveals high sequence and structural conservation prior to the introduction of protease inhibitor Paxlovid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), is rapidly spreading around the world.

The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to predict the number of patients during the next thirty days. RESULTS: The ARIMA model forecasted an exponential increase in the number of newly detected patients. The result of this study also show that if the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 3574 by April 20.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two hundred eight subjects (3-14 years) were recruited for a prospective, observational protocol to measure interocular brightness disparity, uniocular acuities with and without a pinhole, and colour vision using an iPad. Subjects looked through polarizing filters and chose the brighter of two spaceships to measure interocular brightness disparity. The differential brightness of image pairs was varied through a staircase algorithm until equal brightness was perceived. Acuities and colour vision were tested with tumbling Es and AO-HRR colour plates, respectively. Unilateral amblyopia was later confirmed in two subjects. RESULTS: Binocular brightness balance on the iPad detected amblyopes with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Using 20/30 as cutoff for normal acuity, 1 of the amblyopes was detected, and non-amblyopes were excluded by visual acuity pinhole testing. The mean difference between iPad and E-Chart visual acuities with pinhole was 0.02 logMAR with limits of agreement from -0.08 to +0.11 logMAR. iPad and printed plates Colour vision testing produced identical results.

However, there are few cost-effectiveness studies from Ethiopia or directly transferable evidence from other low-income countries to inform a comprehensive revision of the Ethiopian EHSP. Therefore, this paper reports average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs) of 159 health interventions used in the revision of Ethiopias EHSP. METHODS: In this study, we estimate ACERs for 77 interventions on reproductive maternal neonatal and child health (RMNCH), infectious diseases and water sanitation and hygiene as well as for 82 interventions on non-communicable diseases. We used the standardised World Health Organization (WHO) CHOosing Interventions that are cost effective methodology (CHOICE) for generalised cost-effectiveness analysis. The health benefits of interventions were determined using a population state-transition model, which simulates the Ethiopian population, accounting for births, deaths and disease epidemiology. Healthy life years (HLYs) gained was employed as a measure of health benefits. We estimated the economic costs of interventions from the health system perspective, including programme overhead and training costs. We used the Spectrum generalised cost-effectiveness analysis tool for data analysis. We did not explicitly apply cost-effectiveness thresholds, but we used US$100 and $1000 as references to summarise and present the ACER results. RESULTS: We found ACERs ranging from less than US$1 per HLY gained (for family planning) to about US$48,000 per HLY gained (for treatment of stage 4 colorectal cancer). In general, 75% of the interventions evaluated had ACERs of less than US$1000 per HLY gained. The vast majority (95%) of RMNCH and infectious disease interventions had an ACER of less than US$1000 per HLY while almost half (44%) of non-communicable disease interventions had an ACER greater than US$1000 per HLY. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that several potential cost-effective interventions are available that could substantially reduce Ethiopias disease burden if scaled up. The use of the World Health Organizations generalised cost-effectiveness analysis tool allowed us to rapidly calculate country-specific cost-effectiveness analysis values for 159 health interventions under consideration for Ethiopias EHSP.","output":"Generalised cost-effectiveness analysis of 159 health interventions for the Ethiopian essential health service package"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus spreading all around the world. Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions and a better strategy to train a robust deep learning model for COVID-19 infection segmentation. Methods: Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. i) We introduce the multi-task learning method to get a multi-lesion pre-trained model for COVID-19 infection. ii) We propose and compare four transfer learning strategies with various performance gains and training time costs. Our proposed Hybrid-encoder Learning strategy introduces a Dedicated-encoder and an Adapted-encoder to extract COVID-19 infection features and general lung lesion features, respectively. An attention-based Selective Fusion unit is designed for dynamic feature selection and aggregation. Results: Experiments show that trained with limited data, proposed Hybrid-encoder strategy based on multi-lesion pre-trained model achieves a mean DSC, NSD, Sensitivity, F1-score, Accuracy and MCC of 0.704, 0.735, 0.682, 0.707, 0.994 and 0.716, respectively, with better genetalization and lower over-fitting risks for segmenting COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.","output":"Does non-COVID-19 lung lesion help? investigating transferability in COVID-19 CT image segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter unpacks the notion of power-sharing and explains its centrality for political Switzerland.

The isolation procedure comprised ion exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose, SP Sepharose and Mono Q followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75. The lectin was adsorbed on all three ion exchangers, and it exhibited an N\\\\terminal sequence identical to that of soybean lectin. Of all the sugars tested, melibiose most potently inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the lectin, which was stable between pH 3\\\\12 and 0\\\\70 C. The lectin evoked maximal mitogenic response at about the same molar concentration as Con A. However, the response was much weaker. The soybean lectin inhibited the activity of HIV\\\\1 reverse transcriptase as well as the proliferation of breast cancer MCF7 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells with an IC(50) of 2.82 M, 2.6 M and 4.1 M, respectively. There was no antifungal activity. Another lectin was isolated from a different cultivar of soybean called little black soybean. The lectin was essentially similar to small glossy black soybean lectin except for a larger subunit molecular mass (31 kDa), a more potent mitogenic activity and lower thermostability. The results indicate that different cultivars of soybean produce lectins that are not identical in every aspect.","output":"Purification of melibiose\\\\binding lectins from two cultivars of Chinese black soybeans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 is in the global epidemic, which seriously affects the normal medical order. How to effectively manage colorectal cancer under the background of regular epidemic prevention and control need to gather the experience and wisdom of countries all over the world to study together. Methods: : A retrospective observational study was performed to compare colorectal cancer patients clinical characters between the severe epidemic group (SEG,January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020) versus the epidemic remission group (ERG, April 20, 2019 to June 20, 2020). The demographic characteristics, surgical data, postoperative pathological features and postoperative clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared. Results: : 112 patients were enrolled in the study, including 47 patients in SEG and 65 patients in ERG. There was no significant difference in age, sex, height, weight and body mass index between two groups. The proportion of local patients in SEG was significantly higher than that in ERG ( P =0.001). More patients in ERG received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Neo-CRT) ( P =0.025). There was no significant difference in pT staging, pN staging and pM staging between the two groups ( P > 0.05), but the overall pTNM staging was earlier in the SEG ( P < 0.001). At the same time, the proportion of vascular invasion ( P =0.004) and perineural invasion ( P < 0.001) in SEG was higher than that in ERG. There were no postoperative complications in STG group, but 6 patients in ECG group had postoperative complications, including 4 cases of incision infection and 2 cases of anastomotic leakage. It should be noted that, 5 of these 6 patients received Neo-CRT before operation. Conclusion: our study shows that due to the interference of serious epidemic situation to medical activities and more patients choosing preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, some patients delayed operation to the period of the epidemic remission, which may lead to the progress of tumor staging and increase the risk of postoperative complications. In addition, we hope that our strategy for colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment during the epidemic will help other surgeons.","output":"Change in Clinicopathological Characteristics of Patients With Colorectal Cancer During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: a Single-institution Retrospective Analysis Based on Real-world Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"a?No work is insignificant All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence a?aDr Martin Luther K","output":"Human Rights Violations of Migrants Workers in India During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Centrosomes are micron-scale structures that nucleate microtubule arrays for chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle positioning.

A single\\\\center, randomized split\\\\scar comparison trial using laser speckle contrast analysis was used to quantify the perfusion at elliptical wound closures in human patients both with and without an ARSD. RESULTS: The finite element model revealed that the ARSD promoted load transfer to the skin over a larger area, thus reducing the local stress and deformation in the skin around the suture site. Results from the split\\\\scar study showed a mean improvement of 25% perfusion units with the ARSD, and the improvement was statistically significant (p = 0.002).

We have developed a new homemade VHC, made of a paper coffee cup, and a drinking water bottle. This study was conducted to compare the bronchodilator response in children with airway hyperresponsiveness after the use of our homemade VHC and that of a standard commercial one. METHODS In a randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial, we recruited 20 children, aged 6-15 years, who had a greater than 12% increase in FEV1 after inhaled salbutamol. They were randomized into Group A and B. Group A used our VHC on the first day and Aerochamber? on the second day. Group B used the same VHCs but in alternate sequence. Spirometries were performed before and after 400 g of salbutamol, MDI was administered via those VHCs. RESULTS Baseline demographic data and spirometric values did not have statistically significant differences between group A and B and between the first and second day (p > .05). After giving salbutamol MDI, both VHCs produced significant increases in FVC, FEV1 , and FEF25-75% (p < .005). The improvement in FEV1 did not significantly differ between our homemade VHC and Aerochamber? (p > .05). CONCLUSION Our homemade VHC is effective for an MDI bronchodilator delivery.

Since inflammation is one of the major causes of COVID\\\\19 complications, the associated molecular mechanisms have been the focus of many studies to better understand this disease and develop improved treatments for patients contracting SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Among these, strong emphasis has been placed on pro\\\\inflammatory cytokines, associating severity of COVID\\\\19 with so\\\\called cytokine storm. More recently, peptide bradykinin, its dysregulated signaling or bradykinin storm, has emerged as a primary mechanism to explain COVID\\\\19\\\\related complications. Unfortunately, this important development may not fully capture the main molecular players that underlie the disease severity. To this end, in this focused review, several lines of evidence are provided to suggest that in addition to bradykinin, two closely related vasoactive peptides, substance P and neurotensin, are also likely to drive microvascular permeability and inflammation, and be responsible for development of COVID\\\\19 pathology. Furthermore, based on published experimental observations, it is postulated that in addition to ACE and neprilysin, peptidase neurolysin (Nln) is also likely to contribute to accumulation of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin, and progression of the disease. In conclusion, it is proposed that vasoactive peptide storm may underlie severity of COVID\\\\19 and that simultaneous inhibition of all three peptidergic systems could be therapeutically more advantageous rather than modulation of any single mechanism alone.","output":"Between two storms, vasoactive peptides or bradykinin underlie severity of COVID\\\\19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To characterize the effectiveness of the multimodal strategy to control an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the emergency department of a highly complex hospital in Santiago, Chile Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study, case definition corresponded to workers of the Emergency Service with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period (15 workers), 60% were doctors The factor associated with the transmission was contamination in social spaces (Physicians Room and / or living room due to clinical, social and food registration activities) and low adherence to Hand Hygiene (HM) measures, use of personal protection (PPE), droplet and contact precautions Measures implemented, reinforcement of safe behaviors in personnel (use and location of PPE), social distance, fulfilling the occupations defined for common spaces;Use of a permanent mask;cleaning and disinfection of the workplace (before each use);defer coffee hours;PC installation outside of attention box Results: On May 16, the primary case was recognized, pick on May 25 (46 6% of cases), ending on May 27, 2020, cases and contacts (20 officials) were sent home The cases were divided into 1 administrative, 1 nurse, 9 doctors, 4 paramedical technicians 100% of PCs were installed out of the box;Training coverage on safe measures 100% Adherence during the pre-intervention period for HM 73 5%;droplet and contact precautions 60%;Installation of 88% EPP and removal of 79% EPP After the intervention, adherence to HM 88 5%;Precautions according to transmission route 100%;installation of PPE 95 5% and removal of PPE 97%, no new outbreaks in service have been observed to date Conclusions: The multimodal strategy fulfilled the objective of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic outbreak in the emergency department","output":"PMU28 Multimodal Strategy to Control and Mitigate a Sars-COV-2 Epidemic Outbreak in the Emergency Service of Highly Complex Hospital in Santiago De Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory virus challenge studies involve administration of the challenge virus and sampling to assess for protection from the same anatomical locations. It can therefore be difficult to differentiate actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical to investigate the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporate into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total RNA assay in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies.ImportanceDeveloping therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public health priority. During challenge studies, respiratory viruses are delivered and sampled from the same anatomical location.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: 1) To assess the psychosocial impact on patients whose fertility treatments were interrupted during the COVID-19 shutdown. 2) To assess the correlation of patient perceived risk at the time of treatment cessation compared to the resumption of treatment, both during an ongoing pandemic. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Female patients with scheduled fertility treatments at Mayo Clinic within 6 months of 3/15/2020, were contacted through the patient portal and invited to participate in this study. Interested patients were contacted by a study staff member to obtain their consent and HIPAA authorization and to schedule a phone or Zoom interview. Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually, or in partner dyads depending upon participant preference, and were recorded with their permission. Audio recordings were professionally transcribed and de-identified. Transcripts were qualitatively analyzed using NVivo 12 based on the principles of grounded theory. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: 26 participants were interviewed;20 interviews were conducted individually and 3 were conducted in dyads with their partners. Initial themes from the interviews show that COVID-19 compounded existing psychosocial burden on individuals and couples undergoing fertility treatments. Women who were older in age, had prolonged history of infertility, or multiple unsuccessful treatment cycles reported feeling an increased urgency to proceed with fertility treatments due to the time sensitive care, which outweighed the perceived risks of COVID-19 to either themselves or the potential pregnancy. Patients also reported a desire for improved communication regarding their procedures and overall well-being, as well as options for counseling services for individuals or couples undergoing fertility treatments.

Mouse models are convenient to the investigation of virus-activated immune response mechanisms. However, mice are not proper model organisms to study COVID-19 due to decreased interaction affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) compared with human ACE2. In the present study, we propose a mouse model that allows estimating the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system. To mimic the effects of RBD- ACE2 high-affinity interaction, mice received the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760. To simulate virus loading, we applied 100 nm particles suspended in the solution of RBD via the oropharyngeal route to mice. In this model, MLN-4760 application enhanced neutrophil egress from the bone marrow to the bloodstream and RBD attracted neutrophils to the luminal side of the conducting airway epithelium. By contrast, inert 100 nm particles were not potent to stimulate neutrophil recruitment to the conducting airway mucosa. Using this model, and by altering the dosage of the ACE2 inhibitor, nanoparticles, and RBD, one can adapt it to investigate different COVID-19 states characterized with mild or severe airway inflammation.

METHODS A cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary rheumatology department in Israel. Consecutive patients completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoprotein IgG (N-IgG). If this was positive, an anti-S1/S2 spike IgG (S-IgG) test was done. If both were positive, the patient was considered seropositive. Seropositive patients were retested after 3 months. RESULTS The study included 572 AIIRD patients. Thirty patients were found seropositive, for a seroprevalence of 5.24%. The seropositive rate was significantly lower for patients treated with immunosuppressive medications (3.55%, p0.01), and specifically for patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) (2.7%, p0.05). These associations remained significant in the multivariate regressions adjusting for age, sex and exposure to a known COVID-19 patient. A second serology test 3 months later was collected in 21 of the 30 seropositive patients. In a meanstandard deviation (SD) of 166.6340.76 days between PCR and second serology, 85% were still positive for N-IgG, and 100% were still positive for S-IgG, with a higher meanSD titre compared to the first S-IgG (166.77108.77 vs. 132.4491.18, respectively, p0.05).

Axi-cel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, is approved for treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) LBCL after 2 lines of systemic therapy. Here we report the primary analysis of ZUMA-12, a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study of axi-cel as part of first-line therapy in patients with high-risk LBCL. Methods: Eligible adults had high-risk LBCL, defined by histology (double- or triple-hit status [MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations] per investigator) or an IPI score 3, plus a positive interim PET per Lugano Classification (Deauville score [DS] 4/5) after 2 cycles of an anti-CD20 mAb and anthracycline-containing regimen. Patients underwent leukapheresis and received conditioning chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) followed by a single axi-cel infusion at 210 6 CAR T cells/kg. Non-chemotherapy bridging could be administered before conditioning per investigator discretion. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed complete response (CR) rate per Lugano. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR;CR + partial response), duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of adverse events (AEs), and levels of CAR T cells in blood and cytokines in serum. The primary analysis occurred after all treated patients had 6 months of follow-up. Results: As of May 17, 2021, 42 patients were enrolled and 40 were treated with axi-cel. Median age was 61 years (range, 23-86);68% of patients were male, 63% had ECOG 1, 95% had stage III/IV disease, 48% had DS4, 53% had DS5, 25% had double- or triple-hit status per central assessment, and 78% had IPI score 3. A total of 37 patients had centrally confirmed double- or triple-hit histology or an IPI score 3 and were evaluable for response, with 15.9 months of median follow-up (range, 6.0-26.7). The CR rate was 78% (n=29;95% CI, 62-90);89% of patients had an objective response, and median time to initial response was 1 month. Among all 40 treated patients, 90% had an objective response (80% CR rate). At data cutoff, 73% of response-evaluable patients had ongoing responses. Medians for DOR, EFS, and PFS were not reached;12-month estimates were 81%, 73%, and 75%, respectively. The estimated OS at 12 months was 91%. All 40 treated patients had AEs of any grade;85% of patients had Grade 3 AEs, most commonly cytopenias (68%). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs) occurred in 3 patients (8%) and 9 patients (23%), respectively. Median times to onset of CRS and NEs were 4 days (range, 1-10) and 9 days (range, 2-44), with median durations of 6 days and 7 days, respectively. All CRS and most NEs (28/29) of any grade resolved by data cutoff (1 ongoing Grade 1 tremor);39/40 CRS events resolved by 14 days post-infusion and 19/29 NEs resolved by 21 days post-infusion. Tocilizumab was administered to 63% and 3% of patients for management of CRS or NEs, respectively;corticosteroids were administered to 35% and 33% of patients for CRS and NE management. One Grade 5 event of COVID-19 occurred (Day 350). Median peak CAR T-cell level in all treated patients was 36 cells/L (range, 7-560), and median expansion by AUC 0-28 was 495 cells/L  days (range, 74-4288). CAR T-cell levels peaked at a median of 8 days post-infusion (range, 8-37). Higher frequency of CCR7+CD45RA+ T cells in axi-cel product, previously associated with greater expansion of CAR T cells (Locke et al. Blood Adv. 2020), was observed in ZUMA-12, compared with the ZUMA-1 study in R/R LBCL (Neelapu et al. New Engl J Med. 2017). Conclusion: In the primary analysis of ZUMA-12, axi-cel demonstrated a high rate of rapid and complete responses in patients with high-risk LBCL, a population with high unmet need. With 15.9 months of median follow-up, responses were durable as medians for DOR, EFS, nd PFS were not yet reached and over 70% of patients remained in response at data cutoff. No new safety signals were reported with axi-cel in an earlier line. Overall, axi-cel may benefit patients exposed to fewer prior therapies, and further trials in first-line high-risk LBCL are warranted to assess axi-cel in this setting.

The government has further directed school reopening under strict preventive measures. However, there is still considerable concern on the impact of school reopening on community transmission of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of these directives and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children as compared to adults using sufficient national sample data. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients as compared to adults by analyzing the length of hospital stays (LOS), medical expenses, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates. A multivariate linear regression analysis was carried out to examine the effects of COVID-19 patients that the characteristics on the LOS and medical expenses, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify COVID-19 characteristics that affect hospital and ICU admission rates and to prove the low SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in pediatric patients. RESULTS: The hospitalization period for children aged 0-9 was 37% shorter and that of patients aged 10-19 years was 31% shorter than those of older age groups (P < 0.001). The analysis of the medical expenses by age showed that on average, medical expenses for children were approximately 4,900 USD lower for children than for patients over 80 years of age. The linear regression analysis also showed that patients who were 0-9 years old spent 87% and those aged 10-19 118% less on medical expenses than those aged 70 and over, even after the correction of other variables (P < 0.001). The probability of hospitalization was the lowest at 10-19 years old (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.09), and their ICU admission rate was also the lowest at 0.14 (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24). On the other hand, the likelihood of hospitalization and ICU admission was the highest in children aged 0-9 years, and among patients under the age of 50 years in general. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the low severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger patients (0-19 years) by analyzing the LOS, medical expenses, hospital, and intensive care unit admission rates as outcome variables. As the possibility to develop severe infection of coronavirus at the age of 10-19 was the lowest, a mitigation policy is also required for middle and high school students. In addition, children with underlying diseases need to be protected from high-risk infection environments.","output":"Characteristics in Pediatric Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The analysis of the pulsation of unruptured intracranial aneurysms might improve the assessment of their stability and risk of rupture. Pulsations can easily be concealed due to the small movements of the aneurysm wall, making post-processing highly demanding. We hypothesized that the quantification of aneurysm pulsation is technically feasible and can be improved by computer-aided post-processing. MATERIALS AND METHODS Images of 14 cerebral aneurysms were acquired with an ECG-triggered 4D CTA. Aneurysms were post-processed manually and computer-aided on a 3D model. Volume curves and random noise-curves were compared with the arterial pulse wave and volume curves were compared between both post-processing modalities. RESULTS The aneurysm volume curves showed higher similarity with the pulse wave than the random curves (Hausdorff-distances 0.12 vs 0.25, p<0.01). Both post-processing methods did not differ in intra- (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) and inter-observer (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) reliability. Time needed for segmentation was significantly reduced in the computer-aided group (3.9  1.8 min vs 20.8  7.8 min, p<0.01). CONCLUSION Our results show pulsatile changes in a subset of the studied aneurysms with the final prove of underlying volume changes remaining unsettled. Semi-automatic post-processing significantly reduces post-processing time but cannot yet replace manual segmentation.","output":"Feasibility of Quantification of Intracranial Aneurysm Pulsation with 4D CTA with Manual and Computer-Aided Post-Processing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compare the importance of market factors against that of COVID-19 dynamics and policy responses in explaining Eurozone sovereign spreads. First, we estimate a multifactor model for changes in credit default swap (CDS) spreads over January 2014 - June 2019. Then, we apply a synthetic control-type procedure to extrapolate model-implied changes in the CDS. The factor model does very well over the rest of 2019 but breaks down during the pandemic, especially during March 2020 when there is a large divergence between the actual and model-implied CDS changes. We find that the March 2020 divergence is well accounted for by COVID-specific risks and associated policies, mortality outcomes, and policy announcements, rather than traditional determinants. Daily CDS widening ceased almost immediately after the ECB announced the PEPP, but the divergence between actual and model-implied changes persisted. This points to COVID-19 Dominance: widening spreads during the pandemic has led to unconventional monetary policies that primarily aim to mitigate short-run fears, temporarily pushing away concerns over fiscal risk.","output":"Pandemic Shocks and Fiscal-Monetary Policies in the Eurozone: COVID-19 Dominance During January - June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely spread around the world.

Furthermore, the structural differences between the predecessor SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have not been fully understood. Here, we show the structural and dynamical differences between the two main proteases, and demonstrate the relationship between the dimerization and the activity via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Simulating monomeric and dimeric 3CLpro systems for each protease, we show that (i) global dynamics between the two different proteases are not conserved, (ii) the dimerization stabilizes the catalytic dyad and hydration water molecules behind the dyad, and (iii) the substrate-binding site (active site) and hydration water molecules in each protomer fluctuate asymmetrically.

Nucleic acid amplification can be a time-consuming step in NAT using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a simple method to reduce the amplification time while maintaining the PCR system. The three-step process of a general qPCR was reduced to a two-step process. The annealing/extension temperatures were increased to minimize the differences between the denaturation temperature and the annealing/extension temperatures. Subsequently, the time for each of these steps was reduced and, finally, the denaturation temperature was lowered. Taq polymerase was replaced with SD polymerase because it has strand displacement activity and is efficient in amplifying partial dsDNA at lower denaturation temperatures. In the two-step qPCR of genomic DNA using SD polymerase, the final conditions included an initial denaturation at 92 C for 2 min, and 1 s at each cycling step with a denaturation temperature of 87 C and an annealing/extension temperature of 72 C. Amplification of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus was evaluated at a template concentration as low as 10 copies. This method, named SF-qPCR (strand displacement-based fast quantitative polymerase chain reaction), can stably detect less than 10 copies of DNA and RNA within 25C40 min.

To understand the significance of the vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes, as potentially modulated by vitamin D endocrine system, were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient's cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

CAS is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and CSS was developed to understand and assess COVID-19-related distress. An online questionnaire was administered to active 1,265 university students in Turkey between February 27 and March 8, 2021, via Google forms.

The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions. Here we report the ectodomain structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1 determined at 4.3 ? resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in down positions. The binding of the down CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state. Conformations 2-4 determined at 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8 ? resolutions are all asymmetric, in which one RBD rotates away from the down position by different angles to an up position. The up CTD1 exposes the receptor-binding site for ACE2 engagement, suggesting that the conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding active state. This conformational change is also required for the binding of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1. This phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing CTD1 of the S1 subunit for receptor binding, which provides new insights into the intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer during infection.","output":"Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein reveal a prerequisite conformational state for receptor binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently in the midst of a daunting global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and associated COVID-19 disease.

Of these manifestations, myocardial injury and right ventricular dysfunction are the most common, however, heart failure, circulatory shock, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and vascular thrombosis have been noted as well. Furthermore, these CV related manifestations portend greater morbidity and mortality, which requires clinicians to be familiar with the most recent information to provide informed patient care.

Gaining clinical advice from colleagues experienced in a particular disease or treatment 2. Experiencing Life-long coaching and mentoring from senior experienced clinicians 3. Accessing high quality continuing medical education relevant for patient care 4. Support to carry out medical research All four challenges have been adversely impacted during the Covid-19 pandemic as traditional face-to-face networks have become harder to access. This is especially pertinent when treating complex or rare diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Atypical or refractory patients, and those who experience toxicities often benefit from timely input from experts with considerable experience managing ALL. Online networks offer a robust pandemic-proof source of health and care support and advice. Until recently there have been few dedicated professional networks that provide a regular online forum dedicated to research and care on specific diseases across countries and none related to ALL. Methods: We describe the Resonance ALL Research and Care Network (ALL RCaN;https://resonancehealth.org/networks/all-rcan ) which includes a network of colleagues and a weekly, multidisciplinary online forum that brings together pediatric and adult hematologists and oncologists from around the world to share data, discuss cases and support patient care. In addition, there is a monthly Fellows Fourth Friday to help fellows build their own professional network and gain scientific and clinical advice. The network was born out of a monthly meeting of study chairs (the Study Chair Affinity Group) for ALL research protocols which had been running for 10 years. Results: The network launched formally in June 2020 with 30 founding members but has expanded rapidly through word of mouth. The Acute Leukemia network grew by 850% by Dec 2020 and 1460% by March 2021 and as of July 2021 has 579 members across 18 time zones. It has succeeded in 'Building ALL Bridges between physicians that treat adults and pediatricians for joint discussions in acute leukemia. This collaboration has been severely lacking in the past. The network also presents selected s from major national and international conferences every 4 weeks. This model has been replicated for other cancers including the Global Neuroblastoma Network (resonancehealth.org/networks/gnn) and High-dose Methotrexate Quality Improvement Network (resonancehealth.org/networks/hdmtx). Network software development, video conferencing, meeting coordination, and content hosting have been funded by volunteer network leaders, many volunteer presenters, philanthropic contributions, and unrestricted educational grants. Now that the Resonance infrastructure is fully developed (and available to all at no cost), most Networks function well without funding. Conclusions: Providing free video conferencing, content hosting, and network management tools combined with dedicated leadership and clinically relevant discussions and presentations has led to massive growth of the ALL Research and Care Network, which continues to grow. Networks for other cancers are in various stages of development since the tool set and methodology easily scales to new groups of colleagues and new diseases.

ECMO is increasingly used in COVID-19 pts with severe ARDS. ECMO has been used for ARDS due to influenza at our center in prior years. Pts on ECMO are at high risk for infections. We compared the rates of antibiotic (Ab) and antifungal (AF) use in pts on ECMO for COVID-19 vs influenza ARDS. Methods This was a retrospective review of pts on ECMO for COVID-19 (2020-2021) or influenza (2013-2019). Antimicrobials (Abs and AFs) were categorized as anti-MRSA, anti-pseudomonal -lactams (AP-BL), carbapenems, and new broader spectrum -lactams. We calculated total Ab and AF utilization, adjusted for ECMO duration. Results Seventy-one pts (36 COVID-19 and 35 influenza) were included. COVID-19 pts had longer ECMO duration (median: 25 vs 11 days, p=.03). 100% and 97% of pts with COVID-19 and influenza received 1 Ab, respectively, and 42% and 33% an AF, respectively. COVID-19 pts received longer duration of Abs (26 vs 10 days, p< 0.001) and but not AF. COVID-19 group (gp) were more likely to receive anti-MRSA Ab (69% vs 33%, p=.004);otherwise, there were no differences between gps in types of Abs used. When adjusted for ECMO days, COVID-19 gp received higher median number of Abs (1.23 vs 1, p=.06). Specifically, COVID-19 gp received higher median number of anti-MRSA Ab (0.2 vs 0, p=.007) and AP-BL (0.44 vs 0.28, p=.08). There was no difference in Ab-free days between gps, though the proportion of Ab-free days was lower (0.2 vs 0.36) in COVID-19 pts (p=.08). More COVID-19 pts had pathogens recovered from clinical cultures, especially S. aureus and Enterobacterales (Figure). Pathogens recovered from clinical cultures Patients recovered from clinical cultures of patients with COVID-19 and Influenza ARDS requiring ECMO Conclusion Among pts on ECMO, those with COVID-19 received significantly longer courses of Abs than those with influenza, even after adjusting for longer durations of ECMO. Differences were driven by receipt of anti-MRSA and AP-BLs. Recovery of pathogenic bacteria was greater in COVID-19 pts than influenza pts. Given difficulties in distinguishing pneumonia from airway colonization among ARDS pts on ECMO, development of diagnostic criteria for pt care, rational antimicrobial stewardship and further research are needed.

Filomicelles have a ~ 6-fold stronger interaction with reconstituted SR-BI than PEO-PBD spheres. HDL, and the lipid transport inhibitor, BLT-1, both block the uptake of filomicelles by macrophages and Idla7 cells that are constitutively expressing SR-BI (Idla7-SR-BI). Co-injections of HDL and filomicelles into wild-type mice reduced filomicelle signal in the liver and increased filomicelle plasma levels. The same was true with SCARB1-/- mice. SR-BI binding is followed by phagocytosis for filomicelle macrophage entry, but only SR-BI is needed for entry into Idla7-SR-BI cells. PEO-PBD spheres did not interact strongly with SR-BI in the above experiments.

In this work, we modelled a complete membrane-embedded SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the primary target of vaccine and therapeutics development, based on available structural data and known glycan content. We then used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the system in the presence of benzene probes designed to enhance discovery of cryptic, potentially druggable pockets on the S protein surface. We uncovered a novel cryptic pocket with promising druggable properties located underneath the 617-628 loop, which was shown to be involved in the formation of S protein multimers on the viral surface. A marked multi-conformational behaviour of this loop in simulations was validated using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, supportive of opening and closing dynamics. Interestingly, the pocket is also the site of the D614G mutation, known to be important for SARS-CoV-2 fitness, and within close proximity to mutations in the novel SARS-CoV-2 strains B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.28, both of which are associated with increased transmissibility and severity of infection. The pocket was present in systems emulating both immature and mature glycosylation states, suggesting its druggability may not be dependent upon the stage of virus maturation. Overall, the predominantly hydrophobic nature of the cryptic pocket, its well conserved surface, and proximity to regions of functional relevance in viral assembly and fitness are all promising indicators of its potential for therapeutic targeting. Our method also successfully recapitulated hydrophobic pockets in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain associated with detergent or lipid binding in prior cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies.

To protect national health, government agencies have regulations on hospital chaperoning and visiting. This article presents the development and implementation of a monitoring system for hospital visiting and chaperoning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to create a hospital visiting and chaperoning monitor system that uses nation-wide data sources to more accurately screen hospital visitors and chaperones, assist contract tracing, and prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. METHODS: This project was implemented in 57 ward units of an academic medical center. The system was connected to the National Health Insurance (NHI) system and Hospital Information System (HIS), and built on the data of everyone who accessed either the hospital or ward using an NHI smart card or national identification card. To shorten the time for manual identification, we also developed a new system of \\"app for appointment visits and chaperones\\" to make appointments online. RESULTS: After the implementation of the system, data from visitors and chaperones in the nursing information system could be accessed. Given that all data were registered in the HIS visiting/chaperoning monitor system, an epidemic investigation could be performed whenever there was a confirmed case.

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of symptoms, including fever, muscle pain, tiredness, cough, and difficulty breathing. Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms and have a higher risk of physical deconditioning during their hospital stay. Physical therapists have an important role in supporting hospitalized patients with COVID-19 but also need to be aware of challenges when treating these patients. In line with international initiatives, this article aims to provide guidance and detailed recommendations for hospital-based physical therapists managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through a national approach in the Netherlands. METHODS: A pragmatic approach was used. A working group conducted a purposive scan of the literature and drafted initial recommendations based on the knowledge of symptoms in patients with COVID-19, and current practice for physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with lung disease and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). An expert group of hospital-based physical therapists in the Netherlands provided feedback on the recommendations, which were finalized when consensus was reached among the members of the working group. RESULTS: The recommendations include safety recommendations, treatment recommendations, discharge recommendations, and staffing recommendations. Treatment recommendations address 2 phases of hospitalization: when patients are critically ill and admitted to the ICU, and when patients are severely ill and admitted to the COVID ward. Physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 comprises elements of respiratory support and active mobilization. Respiratory support includes breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, airway clearance techniques, and respiratory muscle strength training. Recommendations toward active mobilization include bed mobility activities, active range-of-motion exercises, active (-assisted) limb exercises, activities-of-daily-living training, transfer training, cycle ergometer, pre-gait exercises, and ambulation.","output":"Recommendations for Hospital-Based Physical Therapists Managing Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the effects of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and to assess inconsistencies in results from individual studies with focus on risk of bias due to methodological limitations. Evidence review We searched the L.OVE platform through July 6, 2021 and included randomized trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard or other active treatments. We conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analysis, assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach and performed sensitivity analysis excluding trials with risk of bias. Results We included 29 RCTs which enrolled 5592 cases. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to low. Compared to standard of care, ivermectin may reduce mortality, may increase symptom resolution or improvement, may increase viral clearance, may reduce infections in exposed individuals and may decrease hospitalizations (Risk difference (RD) 21 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 35 fewer to 4 more). However, after excluding trials classified as ''high risk'' or ''some concerns'' in the risk of bias assessment, most estimates of effect changed substantially: Compared to standard of care, low certainty evidence suggests that ivermectin may not significantly reduce mortality (RD 7 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 77 fewer to 108 more) nor mechanical ventilation (RD 6 more per 1000, 95%CI: 43 fewer to 86 more), and moderate certainty evidence shows that it probably does not significantly increase symptom resolution or improvement (RD 14 more per 1000, 95%CI: 29 fewer to 71 more) nor viral clearance (RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 84 fewer to 76 more). It is uncertain if ivermectin increases or decreases severe adverse events and symptomatic infections in exposed individuals. Conclusions and Relevance Ivermectin may not improve clinically important outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and its effects as a prophylactic intervention in exposed individuals are uncertain.

This paper establishes a new image classification and segmentation method through simulation techniques, conducted over images of COVID-19 patients in India, introducing the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in medical practice. METHODS: This study establishes a prototype model for classifying COVID-19, comparing it with non-COVID pneumonia signals in Computed tomography (CT) images. The simulation work evaluates the usage of quantum machine learning algorithms, while assessing the efficacy for deep learning models for image classification problems, and thereby establishes performance quality that is required for improved prediction rate when dealing with complex clinical image data exhibiting high biases. RESULTS: The study considers a novel algorithmic implementation leveraging quantum neural network (QNN). The proposed model outperformed the conventional deep learning models for specific classification task. The performance was evident because of the efficiency of quantum simulation and faster convergence property solving for an optimization problem for network training particularly for large-scale biased image classification task. The model run-time observed on quantum optimized hardware was 52 min, while on K80 GPU hardware it was 1 h 30 min for similar sample size. The simulation shows that QNN outperforms DNN, CNN, 2D CNN by more than 2.92% in gain in accuracy measure with an average recall of around 97.7%.

Among pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased odds of testing positive (OR per case: 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.15). These effects were adjusted for a range of demographic covariates, and in particular any known cases within the same household, which had the strongest association with testing positive (staff OR: 39.86, 95% CI 35.01 to 45.38; pupil OR: 9.39, 95% CI 8.94 to 9.88). CONCLUSIONS: In a national school cohort, the odds of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not significantly increased in the 14-day period after case detection in the school. However, pupils were found to be at increased odds, following cases appearing within their own year group, where most of their contacts occur. Strong mitigation measures over the whole of the study period may have reduced wider spread within the school environment.","output":"StaffCpupil SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways in schools in Wales: a population-level linked data approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article focuses on obtaining ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) material reinforced with functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (f-SWCNTs) and the manufacturing of unicompartmental knee implants via Single-Point Incremental Forming process (SPIF).

It presents similarly to spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Twelve cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) have previously been described. OBJECTIVE: To describe surveillance data and reporting rates of all reported TTS cases after COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: Case patients receiving a COVID-19 vaccine from 14 December 2020 through 31 August 2021 with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (excluding isolated ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction) reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. If thrombosis was only in an extremity vein or pulmonary embolism, a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antiplatelet factor 4 antibodies or functional heparin-induced thrombocytopenia platelet test result was required. MEASUREMENTS: Reporting rates (cases per million vaccine doses) and descriptive epidemiology. RESULTS: A total of 57 TTS cases were confirmed after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (n = 54) or a messenger RNA (mRNA)Cbased COVID-19 vaccine (n = 3). Reporting rates for TTS were 3.83 per million vaccine doses (Ad26.COV2.S) and 0.00855 per million vaccine doses (mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines). The median age of patients with TTS after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was 44.5 years (range, 18 to 70 years), and 69% of patients were women. Of the TTS cases after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination, 2 occurred in men older than 50 years and 1 in a woman aged 50 to 59 years. All cases after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination involved hospitalization, including 36 (67%) with intensive care unit admission. Outcomes of hospitalizations after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination included death (15%), discharge to postacute care (17%), and discharge home (68%). LIMITATIONS: Underreporting and incomplete case follow-up. CONCLUSION: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome is a rare but serious adverse event associated with Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. The different demographic characteristics of the 3 cases reported after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and the much lower reporting rate suggest that these cases represent a background rate.

Venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in patients in whom conventional mechanical ventilatory support has failed. To date, published data have focused on survival from ECMO and survival to discharge. In addition to survival to discharge, this study reports 1-year follow-up data for patients who were successfully discharged from the hospital. METHODS: A single-institution, retrospective review of all patients with severe COVID-19 who were cannulated for VV-ECMO between March 10, 2020 and May 1, 2020 was performed. A multidisciplinary ECMO team evaluated, selected, and managed patients with ECMO support. The primary outcome of this study was survival to discharge. Available 1-year follow-up data are also reported. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were supported with VV-ECMO, and 27 patients (90%) survived to discharge. All patients were discharged home or to acute rehabilitation on room air, except for 1 patient (3.7%), who required supplemental oxygen therapy. At a median follow-up of 10.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 8.9-14.4 months) since ECMO cannulation, survival was 86.7%, including 1 patient who underwent lung transplantation. Of the patients discharged from the hospital, 44.4% (12/27) had pulmonary function testing, with a median percent predicted forced expiratory volume of 100% (IQR, 91%-110%). For survivors, a 6-minute walk test was performed in 59.3% (16/27), with a median value of 350 m (IQR, 286-379 m). CONCLUSIONS: A well-defined patient selection and management strategy of VV-ECMO support in patients with severe COVID-19 resulted in exceptional survival to discharge that was sustained at 1-year after ECMO cannulation.","output":"One-Year Outcomes With Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support for Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) put a spotlight on focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) However, the spectra of cardiac disease, and the resources available for investigation vary internationally The applicability of FoCUS to internal medicine (IM) and critical care medicine (CCM) practice in Saudi Arabia and their current use of FoCUS are unknown Aims: To determine the applicability of FoCUS to IM and CCM practice in Saudi Arabia and quantify the residents current proficiency, accreditation and use of FoCUS Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to the residents in IM and CCM at our institution to determine their proficiency, use of FoCUS, and perceptions of its applicability Results: In total, 110 residents (IM 100/108;CCM 10/10) participated (Response rate 93 2%) and reported that FoCUS was very applicable to their practice, most specifically for pericardial effusion, right heart strain, and left ventricular function Two IM residents had received postgraduate training, ten used FoCUS regularly, none were accredited and overall selfreported proficiency was poor In contrast all CCM residents had received postgraduate training and reported regular use of FoCUS Two were accredited Conclusions: Whilst FoCUS is applicable to IM practice in Saudi Arabia, significant skills gaps exist The skills gap in CCM is lower but unaccredited practice is common Our residents responses were similar to those from Canada Thus, international standardization of FoCUS training could be considered ? 2020 Saudi Heart Association","output":"Focused cardiac ultrasound is applicable to internal medicine and critical care but skill gaps currently limit use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim: Of the work was to develop clinical and organizational regulations ensuring infectious safety and epidemiological response in the work process (the case of COVID-19) based on the current legislative acts of Ukraine to combat the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), as well as on the data from international practices PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The research objective was carried out in accordance with the Methodology for the development of medical and technological documents for the standardization of medical care RESULTS: Results: The Protocol includes organizational elements to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease, such as \\"The development of general provisions on infectious safety and antiepidemic measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in the company's workplaces, taking into account the legislative acts of Ukraine and international practices\\", which include: the development of \\"Health Questionnaire\\" (epidemiological data questionnaire) for daily monitoring of the company employee health;the development of \\"Checklist for self-assessment of the workplace\\", \\"Checklist for self-assessment of the public space\\";the development of \\"Analytical report on compliance with the infectious safety rules in the workplace and in the public space on the basis of self-assessment\\", thirteen Appendices CONCLUSION: Conclusions: \\"The Protocol for infectious safety and antiepidemic measures in the work process\\" is a detailed instruction that provides a balance of compliance with medical standards and reasonable needs of employees and employers through the implementation of scientific evidence base in antiepidemic and infectious safety measures in the workplace","output":"Approaches to Developing and Implementing Clinical and Organizational Regulations Ensuring Infectious Safety and Epidemiological Response in the Work Process (the Case of Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The small intestine mucosa is lined by specialized cells that form the crypt-villus axis, which expands its surface. Among the six intestinal epithelial cell types, the Paneth cell is located at the base of the crypt, and it contains numerous granules in its cytoplasm, composed of antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and lysozyme, and growth factors, such as EGF, TGF-alpha, and Wnt ligands.

Despite its remarkable clinical as well as analytical specificity and sensitivity, qRT-PCR necessitates pure nucleic acid free of any polymerase inhibitors (from complex biological matrices) as its substrate. Similarly, isothermal NAATs (iNAATs), despite their advantage over qRT-PCR in terms of thermal cycler independence, still require pure nucleic acid as a template. The requirement of pure nucleic acid in turn warrants the use of spin-column mediated extraction with centralized high-speed centrifuges. Additionally, utilization of centralized real-time fluorescence readout and use of sequence-specific molecular probes like TaqMan further prevent their deployment in decentralized locations. To circumvent these disadvantages, we have envisioned a sample-to-answer workflow comprising of indirect sequence-specific magneto-extraction (also referred to as magnetocapture, magneto-preconcentration, or magneto-enrichment in this manuscript) followed by in situ fluorescence or electrochemical LAMP. This study, using SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid as the analyte, compared the analytical effectiveness of indirect and direct sequence-specific magneto-extraction followed by LAMP. Since contamination carryover may affect the efficacy of sequence-specific indirect magnetocapture, its performance in presence of excess host nucleic acid or serum was probed. Through these experiments, we have established a comprehensive limited resource-adoptable and highly specific nucleic acid detection method with the limit of detection of 2.5 copies/?L. Its advantage lies in the flexibility of using either centralized real-time SYBR-based fluorescence LAMP or portable electrochemical LAMP as the readout. Simultaneously, the performance with magneto-capture aided fluorescence and electrochemical LAMP readouts were weighed against each other in terms of analytical sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time. Additionally, the analytical efficacy of the magnetocapture-LAMP workflow was also checked against that of LAMP using pure nucleic acid as a template. Besides being the first report utilizing electrochemical LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, this would probably be the first study to make the analytical comparative assessment of magnetic preconcentration combined with in situ fluorescence and electrochemical LAMP. It is probably also the first study (to the best of our knowledge) to compare the analytical efficacy of a sequence-specific magnetic target enrichment-LAMP (fluorescence and electrochemical) to that of a LAMP assay using pure nucleic acid as a template.","output":"A Comparative Evaluation of Indirect Sequence-Specific Magnetoextraction-aided Fluorescence and Electrochemical LAMP with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid as the Analyte (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION A vertical penetration of the thread through the abdominal wall for the hernia defect closure in laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair (LVIHR) is difficult especially in the large defect cases when applying the existing techniques.

Currently, prenylation has been detected in type 1 adenovirus, hepatitis C virus, several herpes viruses, influenza virus, HIV. However, this list is far from complete, given that prenylated proteins play an extremely important role in the activity of the virus. We assume that the interferon produced in response to PPP may suppress expression of the SREBP2 transcription factor. As a result, the mevalonic acid pathway is violated and, as a result, the formation of early polyprenols precursors (geraniol, geranyl geraniol, farnesol), which are necessary for the prenylation of viral proteins, is blocked and the formation of mature, virulent virus particles is broken. As a consequence, the maturation of viral particles is inhibited, and defective particles are formed. Polyprenol was extracted from greenery (pine, fir and spruce needles, mulberry leaves, etc.), purified by chromatography, phosphorylated and identified by HPLC and NMR. Obtained PPP was used as antiviral in some experimental models in vitro and in vivo. During numerous studies, it was found that PPP manifested versatile antiviral effects, both in vitro and in vivo. The maximum effect was observed with viruses in which the presence of prenylated proteins was established, namely influenza A virus, HIV-1, tick-borne encephalitis virus, hepatitis A and C viruses, herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2, some coronavirus.

The TGF-/Smad signal transduction pathway plays an important role in allergic bronchial asthma. However, the effect of M. vaccae nebulization on the TGF-/Smad signal transduction pathway in mouse models of allergic asthma remains unclear. This study investigated the preventive effect of M. vaccae nebulization during bronchial asthma in a mouse model and elucidate the implication of TGF-/Smad signal transduction pathway in the process. METHODS: In total, 24 female Balb/c mice were randomized to normal control (group A), asthma control (group B), and M. vaccae nebulization (group C) groups. Both groups B and C were sensitized using ovalbumin for establishment of the asthmatic model; group A received phosphate-buffered solution. Prior to the establishment of asthma, Group C was nebulized with M. vaccae. Airway responsiveness was measured in all the groups, using a noninvasive lung function machine before and 24 h after establishment of the asthmatic model. The animals were then harvested, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were collected. The total cell counts in BALF was estimated. Protein expression of TGF-1, TR1, Smad1, and Smad7 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The population of CD3(+)æT, IL-13(+)CD3(+)T, TGF-(+)CD3(+)T, IL-13(+)CD3(+)æT, and TGF-(+) CD3(+) æT cells were detected by flow cytometry. One-way analysis of variance for within-group comparisons, the least significant difference t-test or StudentCNewmanCKeuls test for intergroup comparisons, and the nonparametric rank sum test for analysis of airway inflammation scores were used in the study. RESULTS: The eosinophil count; protein expression of TGF-1, TR1, and Smad1; and percentages of CD3(+)æT and IL-13(+)CD3(+)T cells were significantly lower in the M. vaccae nebulization group than in the asthma control group (P < 0.01). There were significant intergroup differences in the percentages of TGF-(+)CD3(+)T and IL-13(+)CD3(+)æT cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization could confer protection against allergic bronchial asthma by reducing airway responsiveness and alleviating airway inflammation in mice.

This study sought to determine baseline asymptomatic COVID-19 rates in secondary schools as students returned to full-time in-person learning with universal masking in place and to evaluate the logistical obstacles of implementing surveillance testing. METHODS An observational cohort study lasting 11 weeks during spring 2021 included 2,288 students and staff in Wood County, Wisconsin. SARS-CoV-2 nasal polymerase chain reaction testing was done on consenting students and staff to determine baseline disease burden. Teacher surveys collected data on student masking compliance and classroom distancing. Information about percent positivity, secondary transmission, quarantine and distancing policies, screening participation, costs, and volunteer hour requirements were obtained. Modified quarantine for fully masked in-classroom exposures was evaluated. RESULTS Percent positivity averaged 3.0% (0%-16.2% weekly) among students and 1.72% (0%-6.9% weekly) among staff. Two cases of secondary transmission were suspected out of 163 individuals quarantined. An average of 15.6% of the school population consented to participate each week. Minimum classroom distance between students ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 feet. Student masking compliance was greater than 87%. The cost of the program was $106,400 and required approximately 300 volunteer hours. The modified quarantine policy, where students were allowed to continue to attend in-person school after exposure to a case of COVID-19 if the infected and exposed parties were masking, did not result in additional transmission. CONCLUSIONS In the setting of relatively high student masking compliance and limited distance between students, weekly secondary school screening of students and staff in an area of high community disease spread was found to be low yield, costly, and burdensome for the school district. Surveillance participation was low. A modified quarantine policy was not associated with increased in-school transmission. School funding may be better spent on targeted testing or other school expenses, especially with increasing vaccination rates.","output":"COVID-19 Surveillance Testing in Secondary Schools: Findings and Barriers to Implementation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To summarize the current status of, and the current expert opinions, recommendation and evidence associated with the use and implementation of electronic health (eHealth), telemedicine, and/or telehealth to provide healthcare services for chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 pandemic Materials and methods: We searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Web of Science Core Collection) to identify relevant articles published between 2019 and 2020 Searches were restricted to English language articles only Two independent reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and keywords for relevance The potential eligible articles, papers with no abstract, and those that fall into the uncertain category were read in full text independently The reviewers met and discussed which articles to include in the final review and reached a consensus Results: We identified 51 articles of which 25 articles met the inclusion criteria All included articles indicated the promising potential of eHealth, telehealth, and/or telemedicine solutions in delivering healthcare services to patients living with chronic diseases/conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic We synthesized the main findings into ten usages and eight recommendations concerning the different activities for delivering healthcare services remotely for those living with chronic diseases/conditions in the era of COVID-19 Discussion and conclusions: There is limited evidence available about the effectiveness of such solutions Further research is required during this pandemic to improve the credibility of evidence on telemedicine, telehealth, and/or eHealth-related outcomes for those living with chronic diseases ?

All patients underwent lung ultrasound imaging to verify the entity of lung recruitment after NI-CPAP initiation. RESULTS: After one hour of treatment we observed a significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio in 10 patients. Notably, only 50 % of them reached an effective improvement in lung aeration detectable with lung ultrasound. In the other 50 % or patients the improvement in PaO2/FiO2 might be related to blood redistribution and reverse of hypoxic vasoconstriction.

By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea (2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and cough (1.8-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date).

The platform holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for retraining underlying neural networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.","output":"Augmented Curation of Unstructured Clinical Notes from a Massive EHR System Reveals Specific Phenotypic Signature of Impending COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 65 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine. METHODS: We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant. FINDINGS: During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (721%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 953% (95% CI 949-957; incidence rate 915 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 31 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 915% (907-922; 409 vs 18 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 970% (967-972; 325 vs 08 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 972% (968-975; 46 vs 03 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 975% (971-978; 27 vs 02 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 967% (960-973; 06 vs 01 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 945% among SARS-CoV-2 infections. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (&#8805;16 years, including older adults aged &#8805;85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.

C1INH belongs to a superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitor (serpins) and exhibits its inhibitory activities towards several target proteases of plasmatic cascades, operating as a major anti-inflammatory protein in the circulation. In addition to its inhibitory activities, C1INH is also involved in non-inhibitory interactions with some endogenous proteins, polyanions, cells and infectious agents. While C1INH is essential for multiple physiological processes, it is better known for its deficiency with regards to Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant disease clinically manifested by recurrent acute attacks of increased vascular permeability and edema. Since the link was first established between functional C1INH deficiency in plasma and HAE in the 1960s, tremendous progress has been made in the biochemical characterization of C1INH and its therapeutic development for replacement therapies in patients with C1INH-dependent HAE. Various C1INH biological activities, recent advances in the HAE-targeted therapies, and availability of C1INH commercial products have prompted intensive investigation of the C1INH potential for treatment of clinical conditions other than HAE. This article provides an updated overview of the structure and biological activities of C1INH, its role in HAE pathogenesis, and recent advances in the research and therapeutic development of C1INH; it also considers some trends for using C1INH therapeutic preparations for applications other than angioedema, from sepsis and endotoxin shock to severe thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients.","output":"C1-Inhibitor: Structure, Functional Diversity and Therapeutic Development."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cannula cricothyroidotomy is recommended for emergency transtracheal ventilation by all current airway guidelines.

Here, we demonstrate that the level of circulating mtDNA and degree of STING activation are increased in sALI patients. Furthermore, STING activation was found to play a pivotal role in mtDNA-mediated lung injury by evoking an inflammatory storm and disturbing autophagy. Mechanistically, STING activation interferes with lysosomal acidification in an interferon (IFN)-dependent manner without affecting autophagosome biogenesis or fusion, aggravating sepsis.

The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus. CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

To limit the exposure of providers and patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages providers to use telehealth platforms whenever possible. Given the maternal mortality crisis in the United States and the compounding 2019 coronavirus disease public health emergency, continued access to quality preconception, prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care are essential to the health and well-being of mother and baby. OBJECTIVE: This commentary explores unique opportunities to optimize virtual obstetric care for low-risk and high-risk mothers at each stage of pregnancy. METHODS: In this review paper, we present evidence-based literature and tools from first-hand experience implementing telemedicine in obstetric care clinics during the pandemic. RESULTS: Using the best evidence-based practices with telemedicine, health care providers can deliver care in the safest, most respectful, and appropriate way possible while providing the critical support necessary in pregnancy. In reviewing the literature, several studies endorse the implementation of specific tools outlined in this article, to facilitate the implementation of telemedicine. From a quality improvement standpoint, evidence-based telemedicine provides a solution for overburdened healthcare systems, greater confidentiality for obstetric services, and a personalized avenue for health care providers to meet maternal health needs in the pandemic.

There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess past infection, evaluate responses to vaccines in development, and determine individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which have not scaled to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests so far. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum/plasma or whole blood with direct, visual readout. Two novel fusion proteins, RBD-2E8 and B6CCH1-RBD, were designed to bind red blood cells (RBCs) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), thereby displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Mixing mammalian-derived RBD-2E8 and B6CCH1-RBD with convalescent COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs led to visible hemagglutination, indicating the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. B6CCH1-RBD made in bacteria was not as effective in inducing agglutination, indicating better recognition of RBD epitopes in mammalian cells. Given that our hemagglutination test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world for blood typing, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed in low-resource settings at minimal cost.

Three retinal specialists assessed corresponding OCT images to label the fundus photographs. We developed a novel deep learning model to detect and predict myopic maculopathy according to the atrophy (A), traction (T), and neovascularisation (N) classification and grading system.

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of hospitalised older adults. Subjects include unscheduled medical admissions of older inpatients to a University Hospital with laboratory and clinically confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was death during the inpatient stay or within 14 days of discharge after a maximum follow up time of 45 days. The characteristics of the cohort were described in detail as a whole and by frailty status. Results: 214 patients were included in this study with a mean length of stay of 11 days (Range 6 to 18 days), of whom 140 (65.4%) patients were discharged and 74 (34.6%) patients died in hospital. 142 (66.4%) patients were frail with median Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score of 6. Frail patients were more likely to present with atypical symptoms including new or worsening confusion compared to non-frail patients (20.8% vs 45.1%, p<0.001) and were more likely to die in hospital or within 14 days of discharge (66% vs 16%, p=0.001). Older age, being male, presenting with high illness acuity and high frailty were all independently associated with higher risk of death and a dose response association between higher frailty and higher mortality was observed. Conclusions: Older adult inpatients with COVID-19 infection are likely to present with atypical symptoms, experience delirium and have a high mortality, especially if they are also living with frailty.

Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), we showed a strong contribution of common polymorphisms previously associated with BD and schizophrenia (SZ) and noticed that those specifically associated with SZ contributed more in familial forms of BD than in non-familial ones. The analysis of rare damaging variants shared by affected individuals in multiplex families with BD revealed a single interaction network enriched in neuronal and developmental biological pathways, as well as in the regulation of gene expression. We identified four genes with a higher mutation rate in individuals with BD than in the general population and showed that mutations in two of them were associated with specific clinical manifestations. In addition, we showed a significant negative correlation between PRS and the number of rare damaging variants specifically in unaffected individuals of multiplex families.

We used mixed methods (online survey, n=282 and in-depth interviews, n=14) to investigate whether the psychological impact of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives.

It was later used in Venice and other rich port cities in the Mediterranean. On the territory of today's Poland, quarantine measures were used by the so-called Mayor of the Air - LukaszDrewno in 1623 during the plague epidemic in Warsaw.

Since the end of the 19th century, quarantine has lost its practical meaning. The discovery of bacteria and a huge development of medical and social sciences allowed limiting its range. In the 20th century isolation and quarantine no longer had a global range, because the ability to identify factors causing the epidemic, knowledge about the incubation period, carrier, infectiousness, enabled the rational determination of its duration and territorial range.

How to recover the immunological function is important for cyclophosphamide-treated patients. In the present study, Phellodendri Cortex polysaccharides (CPP) could enhance the proliferation of mouse spleen lymphocytes in vitro. The immunoregulatory function of CPP was then investigated in cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressed mice. In CPP-treated groups, mice were orally treated with CPP at doses of 1, 0.5, and 0.25 g/kg bodyweight from 1 to 11 d, respectively. The cyclophosphamide was administrated in CPP and cyclophosphamide groups from 12 to 14 d. In the cyclophosphamide and normal control groups, the mice received equal volume of saline from 1 to 14 d. The results showed that CPP (1 g/kg) could significantly increase the bodyweight of mice, even during cyclophosphamide treatment. The organ coefficients of the spleen and thymus were recovered by CPP treatment. CPP upregulated the contents of cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IFN-, and TNF-) in serum, which were downregulated by cyclophosphamide. The mRNA levels of these cytokines were also elevated by CPP treatment in the spleen. Cyclophosphamide upregulated the expressions of NF-B p65, TLR4, and MyD88, suggesting that the NF-B signaling pathway was activated by cyclophosphamide. After CPP treatment, it was recovered to normal level. These results indicated that CPP alleviated the cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression.","output":"The Immunomodulatory Effects of Phellodendri Cortex Polysaccharides on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Immunosuppression in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The virologic and histologic outcomes of a Hepatitis C virus(HCV) infected liver graft into an HCV negative recipient are not well understood. We aim to evaluate the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate and the liver histology at 1-year post-OLT with an HCV infected graft. METHODS A total of 33 patients received the HCV antibody(Ab)+/Nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)+ graft. Of these patients, 23 were HCV negative recipients, and 10 were HCV positive recipients. The 1-year biopsy data was available for 24 patients: 15 patients in HCV negative group who received an HCV Ab+/NAT+ graft and 9 patients in HCV positive group who received an HCV Ab+/NAT+ graft. Patients with (+) HCV RNA were started on direct-acting antiviral(DAA) treatment approximately 107 days after OLT using either a Glecaprevir-Pibrentasvir or Sofosbuvir-Velpatasvir or Sofosbuvir-Ledipasvir. RESULTS All patients (n=33) were treated with DAA and achieved SVR. The 1-year post-OLT liver-biopsies were available in 24 patients: 9 patients had F1 & F2 fibrosis and 17 patients had minimal to moderate inflammation. There was no statistical difference in fibrosis and inflammation between the HCV negative vs. positive recipients. All patients who received the NAT+ graft developed viremia and subsequently achieved SVR with treatment. CONCLUSION At 1-year protocol liver-biopsy, patients had inflammation consistent with viral hepatitis despite the successful eradication of HCV.","output":"Transplantation of Liver from Hepatitis C-infected Donors to Hepatitis C RNA Negative Recipients: Histological and Virologic Outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine anti-SARS-Cov2 antibodies and T-cell immunity in convalescent people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and/or pwMS vaccinated against Covid-19, depending on the disease modifying therapy, and in comparison to healthy controls (HC). METHODS: 75 participants were enrolled: Group 129 (38.7%) COVID-19 convalescent participants; Group 234 (45.3%) COVID-19 vaccinated; Group 312 (16.0%) COVID-19 convalescent participants who were later vaccinated against COVID-19. Cellular immunity was evaluated by determination of number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells secreting TNF, IFN, and IL2 after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. RESULTS: pwMS treated with ocrelizumab were less likely to develop humoral immunity after COVID-19 recovery or vaccination. No difference was observed in the cellular immunity in all studied parameters between pwMS treated with ocrelizumab compared to HC or pwMS who were treatment na?ve or on first line therapies. These findings were consistent in convalescent, vaccinated, and convalescent+vaccinated participants. COVID-19 vaccinated convalescent pwMS on ocrelizumab compared to COVID-19 convalescent HC who were vaccinated did not show statistically difference in the rate of seroconversion nor titers of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSION: Presence of cellular immunity in pwMS on B-cell depleting therapies is reassuring, as at least partial protection from more severe COVID-19 outcomes can be expected.","output":"Humoral and cellular immunity in convalescent and vaccinated COVID-19 people with multiple sclerosis: Effects of disease modifying therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The temporary shift from face-to-face instruction to online teaching at North American universities as an alternative solution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic brought significant challenges to international students who had to study abroad from their home countries.

Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) live in matrilineal societies, in which females spend their entire lives not only with maternal half-sisters (MHS) but also with paternal half-sisters (PHS). We show that PHS have more differentiated social relationships compared to nonkin, suggesting the existence of kin recognition mechanisms. We further demonstrate that facial resemblance increases with genetic relatedness. However, PHS resemble each other visually more than MHS do, despite both kin categories sharing similar degrees of genetic relatedness. This paternally derived facial resemblance among PHS indicates selection to facilitate kin recognition.

Current models of epidemics are classified as either mechanistic or non-mechanistic: mechanistic models make explicit assumptions on the dynamics of disease, whereas non-mechanistic models make assumptions on the form of observed time series. Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model which bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both. The model represents time series of cases and fatalities as a mixture of Gaussian curves, providing a flexible function class to learn from data compared to traditional mechanistic models. Although the model is non-mechanistic, we show that it arises as the natural outcome of a stochastic process based on a networked SIR framework. This allows learned parameters to take on a more meaningful interpretation compared to similar non-mechanistic models, and we validate the interpretations using auxiliary mobility data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a simple learning algorithm to identify model parameters and establish theoretical results which show the model can be efficiently learned from data. Empirically, we find the model to have low prediction error. The model is available live at covidpredictions.mit.edu.

Previous studies have introduced many experiments showing the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems. In this study, a novel numerical method of estimating the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems for air exhaled by ward patients was introduced. The method adopts and modifies the concept of ventilation efficiency because the germicidal effect depends upon how the air containing airborne infectious particles flows and stays within UV-radiated area. A case study based on a four-patient ward showed that UV doses were correlated with the age of the air exhaled by a source patient, as expected. Moreover, the UV doses were considerably affected by the position of the UR-UVGI system. Inactivation rates of the influenza virus estimated using the UV doses, were in the range of 48C74%, and those of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 68C90% in the breathing area of a neighboring patient. The results indicate not directly the decreased concentration of airborne infectious particles, but the possibility of inactivation caused by the UR-UVGI system, which is useful for system optimization.","output":"Estimating the germicidal effect of upper-room UVGI system on exhaled air of patients based on ventilation efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The well-being of the public during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is deeply rooted in institutional trust in the governments risk communication effort. The objective of this study was to examine the psychological pathway through which public trust in the government is associated with mental and physical well-being. We collected cross-sectional data from 501 participants aged 18 years using an online panel. Public trust in the government was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for psychological distress by combining the Patient Health Questionnaire and the General Anxiety Disorder scale. Physical well-being was examined using self-rated health. We further assessed the roles of risk perceptions. The author conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearsons correlations, multivariable regressions, and mediation analyses (using the Preachers and Hayes approach). Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% Caucasian/white with a mean age of 32.44  11.94 years. Public trust in the government regarding COVID-19 was negatively correlated with psychological distress (r = ?0.20; p < 0.001) and positively associated with physical well-being (r = 0.13; p < 0.001). After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, public trust remained negatively associated with psychological distress ( = ?0.19; 95% confidence intervals, [CI] ?0.30, ?0.09) and positively associated with physical well-being ( = 0.26; 95% CI [0.16, ?0.37]). Perceived self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 protective behavior partially mediated the relationship between public trust and psychological distress (13.07%); and physical well-being (28.02%).

However, it remains unknown whether tendencies to use emotion regulation strategiessuch as cognitive reappraisal, which involves altering the meaning or relevance of affective stimulican shape individual differences regarding how stress affects perceptions of ambiguity. Here, we examined whether increased reappraisal use is one factor that can determine whether stress exposure induces increased negativity bias. In Study 1, healthy participants (n = 43) rated the valence of emotionally ambiguous (surprised) faces before and after an acute stress or control manipulation and reported reappraisal habits. Increased negativity ratings were milder for stressed individuals that reported more habitual reappraisal use. In Study 2 (n = 97), we extended this investigation to real-world perceived stress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that reappraisal tendency moderates the relationship between perceived stress and increased negativity bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that the propensity to reappraise determines negativity bias when evaluating ambiguity under stress.

Due to the sudden and urgent nature of most disasters, it is hard to make the exact prediction on the demand information. Meanwhile, timely delivery is also a problem. In this paper, taking the COVID-19 epidemic as an example, we propose an integrated method to fulfill both the demand estimation and the relief material distribution. We assume the relief supply is directed by government, so it is possible to arrange experts to evaluate the situation from aspects and coordinate supplies of different sources. The first part of the integrated method is a fuzzy decision-making process. The demand degrees on relief materials are estimated by extending COPRAS under interval 2-tuple linguistic environment. The second part includes the demand degrees as one of the inputs, conducts a hybrid distribution model to decide the allocation and routing. The key point of hybrid distribution is that each demand point could be visited by different vehicles and each vehicle could visit different demand points.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMAs. We will search a broad set of electronic databases/registries and contact drug companies and experts in the field to retrieve published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel or cross-over) of medications (either licensed or unlicensed) and any non-pharmacological intervention in adults (18 years) with ADHD. Primary outcomes will be: (1) change in severity of ADHD core symptoms, and (2) acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes will include tolerability (drop-out due to side effects) and change in the severity of emotional dysregulation, executive dysfunctions and quality of life. The risk of bias in each individual RCT included in the NMA will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool-version 2. We will evaluate the transitivity assumption comparing the distribution of possible effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. We will perform Bayesian NMA for each outcome with random-effects model in OpenBUGS. Pooled estimates of NMA will be obtained using the Markov Chains Monte Carlo method. We will judge the credibility in the evidence derived from the NMA using the CINeMA tool (which includes assessment of publication bias). We will conduct a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings.

Although, the IL-33 levels increased in sera of viral hepatitis patients in human, the cellular sources of IL-33 in viral hepatitis remained obscure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression of IL-33 in murine fulminant hepatitis induced by a Toll like receptor (TLR3) viral mimetic, poly(I:C) or by pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3). The administration of poly(I:C) plus D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in mice led to acute liver injury associated with the induction of IL-33 expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC), while the administration of poly(I:C) alone led to hepatocyte specific IL-33 expression in addition to vascular IL-33 expression. The hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was down-regulated in NK-depleted poly(I:C) treated mice suggesting a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. The CD1d KO (NKT deficient) mice showed hepatoprotection against poly(I:C)-induced hepatitis in association with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in CD1d KO mice than WT controls. These results suggest that hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in poly(I:C) induced liver injury was partially dependent of NK cells and with limited role of NKT cells. In parallel, the L2-MHV3 infection in mice induced fulminant hepatitis associated with up-regulated IL-33 expression as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment in liver. The LSEC and VEC expressed inducible expression of IL-33 following L2-MHV3 infection but the hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident between 24 to 32h of post infection. In conclusion, the alarmin cytokine IL-33 was over-expressed during fulminant hepatitis in mice with LSEC, VEC and hepatocytes as potential sources of IL-33.","output":"Pathogenic Mouse Hepatitis Virus or Poly(I:C) Induce IL-33 in Hepatocytes in Murine Models of Hepatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical condition COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020.

Methods: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut, was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. Results: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N=26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID-19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P<0.001].

In comparison to traditional building materials such as timber, steel and concrete, mycelium-based materials are renewable alternatives that use organic agricultural and industrial waste as a key ingredient for production, and do not rely on mass extraction or exploitation of valuable finite or non-finite resources. Mycelium-based materials have shown their potential as a more circular and economically competitive alternative to conventional synthetic materials in numerous industries ranging from packaging, electronic prototyping, furniture, fashion to architecture. However, application of mycelium-based materials in the construction industry has been limited to small-scale prototypes and architectural installations due to low mechanical properties, lack of standardisation in production methods and material characterisation.

Therefore, cities should be prepared to satisfy the needs of their citizens and provide the best services. The idea of a city of the future is commonly represented by the smart city, which is a more efficient system that optimizes its resources and services, through the use of monitoring and communication technology. Thus, one of the steps towards sustainability for cities around the world is to make a transition into smart cities. Here, sensors play an important role in the system, as they gather relevant information from the city, citizens, and the corresponding communication networks that transfer the information in real-time. Although the use of these sensors is diverse, their application can be categorized in six different groups: energy, health, mobility, security, water, and waste management. Based on these groups, this review presents an analysis of different sensors that are typically used in efforts toward creating smart cities. Insights about different applications and communication systems are provided, as well as the main opportunities and challenges faced when making a transition to a smart city. Ultimately, this process is not only about smart urban infrastructure, but more importantly about how these new sensing capabilities and digitization developments improve quality of life. Smarter communities are those that socialize, adapt, and invest through transparent and inclusive community engagement in these technologies based on local and regional societal needs and values.

Presently, the human world is affected by a novel version of the coronavirus family known as SARS-CoV-2, which has an extremely high contagion rate. Although the infection fatality rate (IFR) of this rapidly spreading virus is not high (ranging from 0.00% to 1.54% across 51 different locations), the increasing number of infections and deaths has created a worldwide pandemic situation. To provide therapy to severely infected patients, instant therapeutic support is urgently needed and the repurposing of already approved drugs is presently in progress. In this regard, the development of nanoparticles as effective transporters for therapeutic drugs or as alternative medicines is highly encouraged and currently needed. The size range of the viruses is within 60-140 nm, which is slightly larger than the diameters of nanoparticles, making nanomaterials efficacious tools with antiviral properties. Silver-based nanomaterials (AgNMs) demonstrate antimicrobial and disinfectant effects mostly by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are presently considered as a versatile tool for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Other metal-based nanoparticles have been primarily reported as delivery agents or surface modifying agents, vaccine adjuvant against coronavirus. The present review summarizes and discusses the possible effectiveness of various surface-modified AgNMs against animal coronaviruses and presents a concept for AgNM-based therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in the near future.","output":"Silver-Based Nanomaterials as Therapeutic Agents Against Coronaviruses: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(C)) concentrations have been correlated in a number of diseases including ischemia-reperfusion injury and drug-induced liver injury. Herein, we report the development of a fluorescent probe ATP-LW, which enables the simultaneous detection of ONOO(C) and ATP. ONOO(C) selectively oxidizes the boronate pinacol ester of ATP-LW to afford the fluorescent 4-hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimide product NA-OH ((ex) = 450 nm, (em) = 562 nm or (ex) = 488 nm, (em) = 568 nm). In contrast, the binding of ATP to ATP-LW induces the spirolactam ring opening of rhodamine to afford a highly emissive product ((ex) = 520 nm, (em) = 587 nm). Due to the differences in emission between the ONOO(C) and ATP products, ATP-LW allows ONOO(C) levels to be monitored in the green channel ((ex) = 488 nm, (em) = 500C575 nm) and ATP concentrations in the red channel ((ex) = 514 nm, (em) = 575C650 nm). The use of ATP-LW as a combined ONOO(C) and ATP probe was demonstrated using hepatocytes (HL-7702 cells) in cellular imaging experiments. Treatment of HL-7702 cells with oligomycin A (an inhibitor of ATP synthase) resulted in a reduction of signal intensity in the red channel and an increase in that of the green channel as expected for a reduction in ATP concentrations.

However, if not suitably appropriated, this haste adoption of digital technology might have unintended adverse effects in the longer term. In this introductory chapter, a theory of third-order impacts of digital technology is introduced to explore the effects of digital technology adoption in the service sector organizations. The third-order changes will have more profound implications for future services beyond the simple digitalization of service routines. Although third-order changes may occur much later, preparation is critical because the first-order adoption and the second-order adaptation may form a basis for the third-order metamorphosis. We hope that this theoretical lens is useful in providing foresight for the changes in the nature of services in the post-pandemic. As an exemplary analysis, the first-, second-, and third-order changes are extracted from the six cases of service transformation presented in this volume, and contrasted with each other. Finally, a refined theory of third-order changes in the service sectors is proposed in relation to the evolution of digital technology, and its implications are discussed.","output":"Preparing for Accelerated Third Order Impacts of Digital Technology in Post Pandemic Service Industry: Steep Transformation and Metamorphosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that has spread rapidly across the world. Many studies have already evaluated the clinical features of COVID-19, but how it compares with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative community-acquired pneumonia (SN-CAP) is still unclear. Moreover, COVID-19 mortality is correlated with disease severity, but indicators for severity grading have not been specified. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with SN-CAP and find indicators for disease severity in COVID-19. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SN-CAP were enrolled. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The numbers of COVID-19 and SN-CAP patients enrolled were 304 and 138, respectively. The age of the patients was not significantly different between the groups. Compared with SN-CAP, COVID-19 patients had more symptoms of fever and dyspnea; and showed significant difference in blood count results. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 patients showed patchy ground-glass opacities that correlated with disease severity, whereas the CT imaging of SN-CAP patients showed patchy high-density shadows. COVID-19 patients were classified into moderate, severe, and critically severe groups. The severe and critically severe groups had elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, platelets, C-reaction protein (CRP), lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), troponin-I, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). However, they had decreased levels of lymphocytes, lymphocyte ratio, and albumin. Compared with the younger patients, the older COVID-19 individuals had more chronic diseases and significantly elevated levels of WBC, neutrophil, and CRP levels. Conclusion: SN-CAP showed more inflammatory reaction than COVID-19. Old people with chronic diseases are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high likelihood of developing severe and critically severe infection. Levels of WBC, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CRP, NLR, PLR, troponin-I, creatinine, and BUN are important indicators for severity grading in COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 Is Distinct From SARS-CoV-2-Negative Community-Acquired Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A worldwide movement to empower communities to support their members to care for each other at the end of life (EoL) has emerged since Kellehear published the Compassionate City Charter.

Through GWAS meta-analysis of RG in 493,036 individuals without diabetes of diverse ethnicities we identified 128 associated loci represented by 162 distinct signals, including 14 with sex-dimorphic effects, 9 discovered through trans-ethnic analysis, and 70 novel signals for glycaemic traits. Novel RG loci were particularly enriched in expression in the ileum and colon, indicating a prominent role for the gastrointestinal tract in the control of blood glucose. Functional studies and molecular dynamics simulations of coding variants of GLP1R, a well-established type 2 diabetes treatment target, provided a genetic framework for optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy. We also provided new evidence from Mendelian randomisation that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication.

Methods: Anti-PD-L1 antibodies underwent sulfohydryl moiety-specific conjugation with maleimide-deferoxamine (DFO) followed by 89Zr radiolabeling. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG was evaluated for radiochemical purity, specific activity and radiolabel stability. Parental CT26 colon cancer cells and CT26/PD-L1 cells engineered to stably overexpress PD-L1 underwent binding assays, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. In vivo pharmacokinetics was evaluated and tumor-bearing mice underwent biodistribution and PET studies after 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG injection. Results: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG synthesis was straightforward and efficient. SDS PAGE showed that reduction with TCEP produced half-antibody fragments and MALDI-TOF analysis estimated 2.18 DFOs conjugated per antibody, indicting site-specific conjugation at the hinge region disulfide bonds. High expressing CT26/PD-L1 cells showed 102.2  6.7-fold greater 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding compared to weak expressing CT26 cells. Excellent target specificity was confirmed by a drastic reduction of CT26/PD-L1 cell binding to 3.0  0.8% by excess cold antibody. Intravenous 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG followed bi-exponential blood clearance. Tissue activity assessed by PET/CT demonstrated decreases in major organ activity over 7 days, whereas high CT26/PD-L1 tumor activity was maintained. Again, this was suppressed by excess cold antibody. Treatment of CT26 cells with gemcitabine for 24 h augmented PD-L1 protein to 592.4  114.2% of controls and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding. This was accompanied by increased AKT activation and reduced PTEN. In CT26 tumor mice, gemcitabine treatment substantially increased tumor uptake from 1.56  0.48 to 6.24  0.37 %ID/g (tumor/blood ratio: 34.7).

The present study was therefore designed to understand the students perspective, attitudes, and readiness about online classes being conducted at the University level. An Observational, Descriptive study was conducted. The data was collected using a Questionnaire. The present study was carried out amongst 200 stu-dents. After analyzing the results, it was found that 74% of the students liked studying through online classes. The most common reason (49%) as to why the students like studying online were that the study time becomes lexible, and they can study anytime they want. Lack of co-curricular activity was the most common issue (34%) of online classes, as reported by the students. Most of the students were found satisied with the content and procedure of online teaching. About 30% of the students reported that they prefer their lecture being delivered through a PPT with an audio recording. The present study that was conducted among college students revealed that maximum students are in favor of studying through online classes, but they feel that there is a lack of co-curricular activities in the online mode of conducting classes.

The objective of this study is to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 Moroccan patients and to establish the relationship between specific clinical symptoms, namely ageusia and/or anosmia, with these characteristics. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, non-interventional cross-sectional study analyzing data from 108 patients admitted to the VINCI clinic, Casablanca (Morocco). The database includes 39 parameters including epidemiological characteristics, anthropometric measurements and biological analyzes. RESULTS: The average of age of the patients was 43.80  15.75 years with a sex ratio of 1:1. The mean body mass index of the patients was 25.54  4.63 Kg/m(2). The majority of patients had, at least, one comorbidity and among 75% symptomatic patients, about 50% had, at least, three symptoms namely, fever (40.7%), cough (39.8%), myalgia (28.7%), and anosmia and/or ageusia (20.4%). From biological analyzes, we noticed lymphopenia and an elevated protein C reactive and lactate dehydrogenases levels in 24.1, 36.1, and 35.2% of patients, respectively. A disturbance in liver function markers was observed in 15.7% of cases. For the other hemostasis parameters, high levels of prothrombin and platelets were reported in 14.6 and 14.8% of patients, respectively. Comparisons related to the presence of anosmia and/or ageusia did not show any difference for demographic and anthropometric characteristics, while a possibility of a significant difference was revealed for certain biological parameters, particularly the levels of lymphocytes, D-dimer and troponin. CONCLUSION: This study provides significant findings that will be used not only to supplement previous studies carried out in Morocco in order to resume the epidemiological situation in comparison with other countries, but also to improve the quality of the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients by identifying all the symptoms of the disease and better understanding its clinical outcomes.","output":"Study of Clinical and Biological Characteristics of Moroccan Covid-19 Patients With and Without Olfactory and/or Gustatory Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To assess whether the preoperative 1-h pad test could predict postoperative urinary incontinence and quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Shortages in healthcare staff and manpower bring the practical skills of medical students under the spotlight. However, before they can be placed on hospital frontlines, it is crucial to assess their preparedness for patient interaction. This can be achieved by comparing their behavioral dynamics to those of physicians. An online questionnaire was administered between March 20, 2020 and March 27, 2020. The preventive strategies adopted by medical students and physicians at different ages and levels of education were compared by using chi-square test where a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We report that the demonstration of preventive behaviors increased with educational attainment and age. Older age groups avoided crowded areas, wore more masks, used disinfectants and did not touch their faces as compared to the younger participants (p < 0.001). Similarly, postgraduate doctors used more masks and disinfectants as compared to graduate doctors and medical students (p < 0.001). Based on our results, the lack of preventive behavior shown by medical students has implications for policy makers. We recommend short- and long-term changes to medical programs and admissions policies to equip medical students with the personal and professional skills to better contribute to the healthcare system in the present pandemic and beyond.","output":"Comparing the preventive behavior of medical students and physicians in the era of COVID-19: Novel medical problems demand novel curricular interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil experienced two major lineage replacements until mid-2021. The first driven by lineage P.2, in late 2020, and the second by lineage Gamma, in early 2021. To understand how these SARS-CoV-2 lineages spread in Brazil, we analyzed 11,724 genomes collected throughout the country between September 2020 and April 2021. Our findings indicate that lineage P.2 probably emerged in July 2020 in the Rio de Janeiro state and Gamma in November 2020 in the Amazonas state. Both states were the main hubs of viral disseminations to other Brazilian locations. We estimate that Gamma was 1.56-3.06 times more transmissible than P.2 in Rio de Janeiro and that the median effective reproductive number (Re) of Gamma varied according to the geographic context (Re = 1.59-3.55).

Parents were expected to support childrens learning, often while also working from home. Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are at particularly high risk for setbacks due to difficulties with organization and increased risk of not participating in scheduled online learning. This paper explores how smartwatch technology, including timing notifications, can support children with ADHD during distance learning due to COVID-19. We implemented a 6-week pilot study of a Digital Health Intervention (DHI) with ten families. The DHI included a smartwatch and a smartphone. Google calendars were synchronized across devices to guide children through daily schedules. After the sixth week, we conducted parent interviews to understand the use of smartwatches and the impact on childrens functioning, and we collected physiological data directly from the smartwatch. Our results demonstrated that children successfully adopted the use of the smartwatch, and parents believed the intervention was helpful, especially in supporting the development of organizational skills in their children. Overall, we illustrate how even simple DHIs, such as using smartwatches to promote daily organization and task completion, have the potential to support children and families, particularly during periods of distance learning. We include practical suggestions to help professionals teach children with ADHD to use smartwatches to improve organization and task completion, especially as it applies to supporting remote instruction.","output":"Parents perspectives on a smartwatch intervention for children with ADHD: Rapid deployment and feasibility evaluation of a pilot intervention to support distance learning during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, close unprotected contact, and intense aerosols-generating procedures.

Since the severity of the disease is highly variable, predictive models to stratify patients according to their mortality risk are needed. Objective To develop a model able to predict the risk of fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients, which could be used easily upon arrival of patients to the hospital. Methods We constructed a prospective cohort with 611 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10 and April 12, 2020, in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. We included in the analysis 501 patients who had been discharged or had died by April 20, 2020. The capacity to predict mortality of several biomarkers, measured at the beginning of hospitalisation, was assessed individually. Those biomarkers that independently contributed to improve mortality prediction were included in a multivariable risk model. Results High interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, and low albumin, lymphocyte count, monocyte count and peripheral blood oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2), were all predictive of mortality (area under the curve (AUC)>0.70). A multivariable mortality risk model including SpO2/FiO2, N/L ratio, LDH, IL-6, and age, was developed and showed high accuracy for the prediction of fatal outcome (AUC=0.94). The optimal cut-off reliably classified patients into survivor and non-survivor, including patients with no initial respiratory distress, with 0.88 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity.

We developed a reliable clonal cell line which produces single-round mature DENVs without the need for DENV reverse genetics. More importantly, using protein engineering coupled with natural and directed evolution of the prM cleavage site, we engineered genetically stable mature DENVs without comprising viral yield and independent of cell, host, or passage. Using these complementary strategies to regulate maturation, we demonstrate that the resulting mature DENVs are antigenically distinct from their isogenic immature forms. Given the clinical importance of mature DENVs in immunity, our strategy provides a reliable strategy for the production of stable, high-titer mature candidate DENV live virus vaccines, genetically stabilized viruses for DENV maturation and immunity studies, and models for maturation-regulated experimental evolution in mammalian and invertebrate cells.

Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that glucocorticoid exposure of 10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease. Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation.","output":"Characteristics associated with hospitalisation for COVID-19 in people with rheumatic disease: data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician-reported registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new global threat demanding a multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agentsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.

However, the behaviors of 6:2 FTAB in plants are still unclear. This study investigated the bioaccumulation, biotransformation and ecotoxicity of 6:2 FTAB in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by hydroponic exposure. 6:2 FTAB was easily taken up by roots with the root concentration factor (RCF) as high as 94.8, but difficult to be acropetally translocated in the shoots with the translocation factor (TF) as low as 0.058. Two intermediates and six terminal perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) metabolites were detected in roots and shoots. The detected metabolites included 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA), 6:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (6:2 FTCA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA), pentafluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and 6:2 FTSA was the main metabolite. 6:2 FTAB significantly reduced the biomass of plant and prevented chlorophyll (Chl) accumulation, while caused no significant change in malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Significant reduction in glutathione (GSH) contents, excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and obvious inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activities were observed, suggesting damage of antioxidant defense systems and failure to detoxication of 6:2 FTAB in wheat.

The cohort consisted of patients with moderate respiratory failure (n = 11) and severe respiratory failure (n = 10) at an acute stage (day 0C3) and in the later course of the disease (>7 days). All patients needed supplemental oxygen and severe patients were defined by the requirement of positive pressure ventilation (intubation). Levels of D-dimers, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6 were significantly higher in patients with severe compared with moderate respiratory failure. Concurrently, next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis demonstrated increased dysregulation of miRNA expression with progression of disease severity connected to extreme downregulation of miR-320a, miR-320b and miR-320c. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway, the transforming growth factor (TGF)- signaling pathway and in the regulation of adherens junctions. The expression of all miR-320 family members was significantly correlated with CRP, IL-6, and D-dimer levels.

To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. The limit of detection (LoD) is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, and a reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for LoD studies. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA carrying specific genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure including nucleic acid extraction and to accommodate customized primer-probe sets targeting different genome sequences. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (460000 {+/-}65000 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.","output":"A SARS-CoV-2 Reference Standard Quantified by Multi-digital PCR Platforms for Quality Assessment of Molecular Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging is a dynamic process that can bring well-being but also physical and cognitive decline.

Reminiscence therapy is a psychological intervention for older adults to assist in remembering and interpreting the life events, feelings, and thoughts that define and give meaning to the persons life. Reminiscence can lead to positive mental health and other elements of particular relevance to older adults. In each session, we worked on a different theme that promoted the memory of positive emotions: optimal experience, decisive moment, stresses, tensions, problems and solutions, memories of childhood, adolescence, maturity, significant people in life, sense of life, and future script. We compared an intervention group (n = 12) with a control group (n = 17) using a pre-post, single-blind design.

Wistar rats were pretreated intragastrically with vehicle, BW-HS-101 (0.5C50 mol/kg) or its analogue without the ability to release H(2)S, BW-iHS-101 prior to ASA administration (125 mg/kg, intragastrically). BW-HS-101 was administered alone or in combination with nitroarginine (L-NNA, 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or zinc protoporphyrin IX (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Gastroprotective effects of BW-HS-101 were additionally evaluated against necrotic damage induced by intragastrical administration of 75% ethanol. Gastric mucosal damage was assessed microscopically, and gastric blood flow was determined by laser flowmetry. Gastric mucosal DNA oxidation and PGE(2) concentration were assessed by ELISA. Serum and/or gastric protein concentrations of IL-1, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, VEGF, GM-CSF, IFN-, TNF-, and EGF were determined by a microbeads/fluorescent-based multiplex assay. Changes in gastric mucosal iNOS, HMOX-1, SOCS3, IL1-R1, IL1-R2, TNF-R2, COX-1, and COX-2 mRNA were assessed by real-time PCR. BW-HS-101 or BW-iHS-101 applied at a dose of 50 mol/kg protected gastric mucosa against ASA-induced gastric damage and prevented a decrease in the gastric blood flow level. H(2)S prodrug decreased DNA oxidation, systemic and gastric mucosal inflammation with accompanied upregulation of SOCS3, and EGF and HMOX-1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase but not carbon monoxide (CO)/heme oxygenase (HMOX) activity by L-NNA or ZnPP, respectively, reversed the gastroprotective effect of BW-HS-101. BW-HS-101 also protected against ethanol-induced gastric injury formation. We conclude that BW-HS-101, due to its ability to release H(2)S in a controllable manner, prevents gastric mucosa against drugs-induced gastropathy, inflammation and DNA oxidation, and upregulate gastric microcirculation. Gastroprotective effects of this H(2)S prodrug involves endogenous NO but not CO activity and could be mediated by cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory SOCS3 and EGF pathways.","output":"Novel Hydrogen Sulfide (H(2)S)-Releasing BW-HS-101 and Its Non-H(2)S Releasing Derivative in Modulation of Microscopic and Molecular Parameters of Gastric Mucosal Barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim was to perform adaptation and validation of the Perceived Implicit Rationing of Nursing Care.

Since then, the population eligible for vaccination against COVID-19 has been extended to include all 12-15-year-olds, and a booster programme has been initiated among adults aged 50 years and over, health care and care home workers, and immunocompromised people. Meanwhile, schoolchildren have returned to school often with few COVID-19-related precautions in place. Methods: In the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, throat and nose swabs were sent to non-overlapping random samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England. We analysed prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-positivity data from REACT-1 round 14 (between 9 and 27 September 2021). We combined results for round 14 with round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) and estimated vaccine effectiveness and prevalence of swab-positivity among double-vaccinated individuals. Unlike all previous rounds, in round 14, we switched from dry swabs transported by courier on a cold chain to wet swabs using saline. Also, at random, 50% of swabs (not chilled until they reached the depot) were transported by courier and 50% were sent through the priority COVID-19 postal service. Results: We observed stable or rising prevalence (with an R of 1.03 (0.94, 1.14) overall) during round 14 with a weighted prevalence of 0.83% (0.76%, 0.89%). The highest weighted prevalence was found in children aged 5 to 12 years at 2.32% (1.96%, 2.73%) and 13 to 17 years at 2.55% (2.11%, 3.08%). All positive virus samples analysed correspond to the Delta variant or sub-lineages of Delta with one instance of the E484K escape mutation detected. The epidemic was growing in those aged 17 years and under with an R of 1.18 (1.03, 1.34), but decreasing in those aged 18 to 54 years with an R of 0.81 (0.68, 0.97). For all participants and all vaccines combined, vaccine effectiveness against infection (rounds 13 and 14 combined) was estimated to be 62.8% (49.3%, 72.7%) after two doses compared to unvaccinated people when adjusted for round, age, sex, index of multiple deprivation, region and ethnicity; the adjusted estimate was 44.8% (22.5%, 60.7%) for AstraZeneca and 71.3% (56.6%, 81.0%) for Pfizer-BioNTech, and for all vaccines combined it was 66.4% (49.6%, 77.6%) against symptomatic infection (one or more of 26 surveyed symptoms in month prior). Across rounds 13 and 14, weighted prevalence of swab-positivity was 0.55% (0.50%, 0.61%) for those who received their second dose 3-6 months before their swab compared to 0.35% (0.31%, 0.40%) for those whose second dose was within 3 months of their swab. However, the prevalence was lower in those with one or two doses of vaccine than in unvaccinated individuals at 1.76% (1.60%, 1.95%). In round 14, age group, region, key worker status, and household size jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab-positivity. Discussion: In September 2021 infections were increasing exponentially in the 5-to-17-year age group coinciding with the start of the autumn school term in England. Relatively few schoolchildren aged 5 to 17 years have been vaccinated in the UK though single doses are now being offered to those aged 12 years and over. In adults, the higher prevalence of swab-positivity following two doses of vaccine within 3 to 6 months supports the use of a booster vaccine. It is important that the vaccination programme maintains high coverage and reaches children and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated adults to reduce transmission and associated disruptions to work and education.","output":"REACT-1 study round 14: High and increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among school-aged children during September 2021 and vaccine effectiveness against infection in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To determine the role of nuclear medicine methods in the diagnosis and quality control of treatment and rehabilitation of patients with complications after coronavirus diseasr (COVID-19) The article provides a brief analysis of the incidence of COVID-19 and highlights the role of diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of patients suffering from the consequences of coronavirus diseasr after the end of the pandemic.

To gather data on the total number of cases and the severity of symptoms among IMD patients one year into the pandemic, an online survey was distributed among all MetabERN healthcare providers (HCP). Epidemiological analysis was performed by integrating the surveys data with the MetabERN database. RESULTS: Surveys respondents reported a total of 452 cases of COVID-19 among their IMD patients (213 paediatric and 239 adults). Considering the total number of patients followed by the respondents (n = 26,347), the registered prevalence of COVID-19 in the IMD population was of 1716  100,000. Italy emerged as the most affected country (25.4% of cases), followed by the United Kingdom (14.2% of cases). Most of the paediatric cases of COVID-19 displayed no or mild symptoms during the disease: 34% of HCP reported having asymptomatic patients in 75C100% of cases, while 37.5% reported mild symptoms in about a quarter of their patients. Similarly to paediatric cases, most adult IMD patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms: about one third of respondents reported 75C100% asymptomatic patients and about 65% of HCP had between 0 and 50% of patients with mild symptoms. The majority of the respondents reported no deaths due to COVID-19 in adult and paediatric patients with IMDs. CONCLUSIONS: Most of MetabERNs IMD patients who got COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic had mild symptoms and a positive outcome of the disease. However, fatal events were recorded in paediatric patients; this, together with the lack of information on the long-term effects of COVID-19 in IMDs, call for caution in the metabolic population.

One such risk includes the reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV), an issue commonly affecting all kinds of transplant recipients. Similarly, with the rise of the ever-evolving global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients must be constantly monitored for any respiratory symptoms, and observed closely under the care of their attending physician.

In order to give patients optimal care, these arising problems need to be studied and addressed.","output":"Are CMV and SARS-CoV-2 Infections Mutual Risk Factors in Kidney Transplant Recipients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Substantial health inequities exist for Indigenous Peoples in Canada. The remote and distributed population of Canada presents unique challenges for access to and use of surgery. To date, the surgical outcome data for Indigenous Peoples in Canada have not been synthesized. METHODS We searched 4 databases to identify studies comparing surgical outcomes and utilization rates of adults of First Nations, Inuit or Mtis identity with non-Indigenous people in Canada. Independent reviewers completed all stages in duplicate. Our primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included utilization rates of surgical procedures, complications and hospital length of stay. We performed meta-analysis of the primary outcome using random effects models. We assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies were reviewed involving 1 976 258 participants (10.2% Indigenous). No studies specifically addressed Inuit or Mtis populations. Four studies, including 7 cohorts, contributed adjusted mortality data for 7135 participants (5.2% Indigenous); Indigenous Peoples had a 30% higher rate of death after surgery than non-Indigenous patients (pooled hazard ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.54; I 2 = 81%). Complications were also higher for Indigenous Peoples, including infectious complications (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.13-2.34) and pneumonia (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.58-3.19). Rates of various surgical procedures were lower, including rates of renal transplant, joint replacement, cardiac surgery and cesarean delivery. INTERPRETATION The currently available data on postoperative outcomes and surgery utilization rates for Indigenous Peoples in Canada are limited and of poor quality. Available data suggest that Indigenous Peoples have higher rates of death and adverse events after surgery, while also encountering barriers accessing surgical procedures. These findings suggest a need for substantial re-evaluation of surgical care for Indigenous Peoples in Canada to ensure equitable access and to improve outcomes.

Here we define Distinctiveness of SARS-CoV-2 sequences based on a proteome-wide comparison with all prior sequences from the same geographical region. From the perspective of viral evolution, Distinctiveness captures \\"regional herd exposure\\" and has the advantage over the canonical concept of mutation, which relies foremost on the reference ancestral sequence that is invariant over time. By assessing the correlation between Distinctiveness and change in prevalence for all circulating lineages in each region when a new lineage is introduced, we find that the relative Distinctiveness of emergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages is associated with their competitive fitness (Pearson r = 0.67). Further, by assessing the Delta variant in India versus Brazil, we show that the same lineage can have different Distinctiveness-contributing positions in different geographical regions depending on the other variants that previously circulated in those regions. Finally, analysis of Omicron lineages in India and USA shows the BA.1 and BA.2 sub-lineages have comparable distinctiveness, suggesting that they may have similar levels of competitive fitness. Overall, our study proposes that augmenting the ongoing surveillance of highly mutated variants with real-time assessment of Distinctiveness can aid in achieving robust pandemic preparedness.","output":"Competitive fitness of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is linked to their Distinctiveness relative to preceding lineages from that region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the factors associated with disease severity and patient outcomes in 631 patients with COVID-19 who were reported to the Jiangsu Commission of Health between January 1 and March 20, 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: We conducted an epidemiological investigation enrolling 631 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from our clinic from January to March 2020. Patients information was collected through a standard questionnaire. Then, we described the patients epidemiological characteristics, analyzed risk factors associated with disease severity, and assessed causes of zero mortality. Additionally, some key technologies for epidemic prevention and control were identified. RESULTS: Of the 631 patients, 8.46% (n=53) were severe cases, and no deaths were recorded (n=0). The epidemic of COVID-19 has gone through 4 stages: a sporadic phase, an exponential growth phase, a peak plateau phase, and a declining phase. The proportion of severe cases was significantly different among the 4 stages and 13 municipal prefectures (P<0.001). Factors including age >65 years old, underlying medical conditions, highest fever >39.0C, dyspnea, and lymphocytopenia (<1.010(9)/L) were early warning signs of disease severity (P<0.05). In contrast, earlier clinic visits were associated with better patient outcomes (P=0.029). Further, the viral load was a potentially useful marker associated with COVID-19 infection severity. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings from the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Jiangsu Province, China showed that patients who were more than 65 years of age and with comorbidities and presented with a fever of more than 39.0C developed more severe disease. However, mortality was prevented in this initial patient population by early supportive clinical management.","output":"Epidemiology of 631 Cases of COVID-19 Identified in Jiangsu Province Between January 1(st) and March 20(th) 2020: Factors Associated with Disease Severity and Analysis of Zero Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Introduction: Donning and doffing of personal protective equipments (PPE) has become relevant especially during COVID-19 pandemic and neurosurgeons operating upon COVID-19 positive or suspect patients should be aware of proper technique of donning and doffing of PPE.[1] Surgeries involving direct exposure of anterior nasal spaces/paranasal sinuses carry significantly more risk of infection and it may be prudent to use PPE while operating all such cases.[2].

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit sequence confirmed that strain ck/CH/LJL/111054 is of the Connecticut-type; however, further extensive full-length genomic analysis identified the occurrence of recombination events. Therefore, strain ck/CH/LJL/111054 may have originated from recombination events between Conn- and Mass-like strains at three recombination breakpoints: two located within the nsp3 gene sequence and one in the nsp12 gene sequence. Further, the uptake of the 5 untranslated regions, nsp2, parts of nsp3, nsp4C11, and parts of nsp 12 from Mass-like virus by ck/CH/LJL/111054 might have resulted in changes in viral replication efficiency rather than antigenic changes, via cross-neutralization analysis with the H120 strain.

No recent review on plasma levels of oxytocin in response to breastfeeding is available. MATERIALS AND METHODS Systematic literature searches on breastfeeding induced oxytocin levels were conducted 2017 and 2019 in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Data on oxytocin linked effects and effects of medical interventions were included if available. RESULTS We found 29 articles that met the inclusion criteria. All studies had an exploratory design and included 601 women. Data were extracted from the articles and summarised in tables. Breastfeeding induced an immediate and short lasting (20 minutes) release of oxytocin. The release was pulsatile early postpartum (5 pulses/10 minutes) and coalesced into a more protracted rise as lactation proceeded. Oxytocin levels were higher in multiparous versus primiparous women. The number of oxytocin pulses during early breastfeeding was associated with greater milk yield and longer duration of lactation and was reduced by stress. Breastfeeding-induced oxytocin release was associated with elevated prolactin levels; lowered ACTH and cortisol (stress hormones) and somatostatin (a gastrointestinal hormone) levels; enhanced sociability; and reduced anxiety, suggesting that oxytocin induces physiological and psychological adaptations in the mother. Mechanical breast pumping, but not bottle-feeding was associated with oxytocin and prolactin release and decreased stress levels. Emergency caesarean section reduced oxytocin and prolactin release in response to breastfeeding and also maternal mental adaptations. Epidural analgesia reduced prolactin and mental adaptation, whereas infusions of synthetic oxytocin increased prolactin and mental adaptation. Oxytocin infusion also restored negative effects induced by caesarean section and epidural analgesia. CONCLUSIONS Oxytocin is released in response to breastfeeding to cause milk ejection, and to induce physiological changes to promote milk production and psychological adaptations to facilitate motherhood. Stress and medical interventions during birth may influence these effects and thereby adversely affect the initiation of breastfeeding.","output":"Maternal plasma levels of oxytocin during breastfeeding-A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic was making a huge impact on Europes healthcare systems in the spring of 2020, and most predictive models concurred that pandemic waves were in the offing. Most studies adopted a pathogenic approach to the subject; few used a salutogenic approach. These showed, however, that nurses can retain their health despite a pandemic by mobilising generalised resistance resources. Our study aims to understand how nurses working in Switzerlands hospitals protected their health and workplace well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating the moderating effects of the health resources they mobilised against the stressors inherent to the situation. The study aims to explore and describe the stressors and the resources nurses used to remain healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This might not be true for bariatric surgery because of reimbursement requirements and changes in coding systems. We assessed the availability and validity of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes among bariatric surgery patients. METHODS: We identified three nested retrospective cohorts of adult bariatric surgery patients who underwent adjusted gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2018 using different components of OptumLabs? Data Warehouse, which contains linked de-identified claims and electronic health records (EHRs). We measured the availability of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes in the 6-month preoperative and 1-year postoperative periods in the main cohort identified in the claims data. We created two claims-based algorithms to classify the presence of severe obesity (a commonly used cohort selection criterion) and categorize BMI (a commonly used baseline confounder or postoperative outcome). We evaluated their performance by estimating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and weighted kappa in two sub-cohorts using EHR-based BMI measurements as the reference. RESULTS: Among the 29,357 eligible patients identified using claims only, 28,828 (98.2%) had preoperative weight-related diagnosis codes, either granular indicating BMI ranges or nonspecific denoting obesity status. Among the 27,407 patients with granular preoperative codes, 12,346 (45.0%) had granular codes and 9355 (34.1%) had nonspecific codes in the 1-year postoperative period. Among the 3045 patients with both preoperative claims-based diagnosis codes and EHR-based BMI measurements, the severe obesity classification algorithm had a sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 78%. The BMI categorization algorithm had good validity categorizing the last available preoperative or postoperative BMI measurements (weighted kappa [95% confidence interval]: preoperative 0.78, [0.76, 0.79]; postoperative 0.84, [0.80, 0.87]).

However, hesitancy to vaccination is a major barrier to achieving herd immunity, particularly among a population working on a military base. To better understand the perceptions and concerns of these individuals, a voluntary survey was conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interactive, online survey was constructed and disseminated to individuals associated with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) in Dayton, OH. Survey participation was voluntary with responses collected over the initial weeks in which WPAFB began to distribute COVID-19 vaccines in a series of phases. Although initially designed to collect demographic data and identify reasons for potential vaccine hesitancy among WPAFB 88th Medical Group personnel, the study population was expanded to include all WPAFB-affiliated personnel at the direction of base leadership. The chi-squared test was used to examine the relationships between categorical variables, while multivariable logistic regression was used to assess age and occupation as independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: A total of 816 individuals completed the survey, of whom 22.7% (n = 185) self-identified as vaccine hesitant (VH). The VH group had a lower mean age than the not vaccine hesitant (NVH) group (39.3  14.2 vs. 45.9  13.4, P < .001). Respondents whose occupation was medical were more likely to be VH than their non-medical colleagues (49% vs. 18%, P < .001). The VH group was more concerned about short-term side effects (43% vs. 26%, P < .001), long-term side effects (82% vs. 50%, P < 0.001), vaccine effectiveness (23% vs. 5%, P < .001), vaccine making them feel sick (22% vs. 13%, P = .002), being infected with COVID-19 from the vaccine (10% vs. 5%, P = 0.008), and worry about misinformation/political agenda (43% vs. 31%, P = 0.003). Younger respondents and medical personnel were more likely to be concerned about long-term side effects and vaccine effectiveness, and the younger group was also more likely to be concerned about pregnancy/breastfeeding issues and worry about misinformation/political agenda. Age (younger vs. older, odds ratio 2.15) and occupation (medical vs. non-medical, odds ratio 3.74) were independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy. The NVH group was more likely to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to a friend or family member than the VH group (93% vs. 20%, P < .001) as were the older age group (79% vs. 67%, P = .001) and non-medical personnel (81% vs. 52%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Younger age and medical occupation were independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy and these individuals were less likely to recommend vaccination to a friend or family member. We also identified several key concerns related to vaccination hesitancy, in particular those related to short- and long-term side effects, and the spread of misinformation. Among military personnel, these findings carry important implications that may negatively impact mission readiness, a matter that merits further investigation.

However, the clinical performance of many of these is still insufficiently described. Therefore, we compared 3 commercial CE-marked, SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays side by side. METHODS: We included a total of 1154 specimens from pre-COVID-19 times and 65 samples from COVID-19 patients (&#8805;14 days after symptom onset) to evaluate the test performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin. RESULTS: All 3 assays presented with high specificities: 99.2% (98.6-99.7) for Abbott, 99.7% (99.2-100.0) for Roche, and 98.3% (97.3-98.9) for DiaSorin. In contrast to the manufacturers' specifications, sensitivities only ranged from 83.1% to 89.2%. Although the 3 methods were in good agreement (Cohen's Kappa 0.71-0.87), McNemar tests revealed significant differences between results obtained from Roche and DiaSorin.

Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study carried out in the Pulmonology Ward of the Bahawal Victoria hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan. All patients with empyema thoracis registered at the study site during the period of 1 year were included in the study. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the factors associated with duration of hospital stay and unsuccessful treatment outcome among the patients. Results: A total 110 patients were included in the study. Most of the patients (n = 73, 66.4%) were treated with piperacillin/tazobactam alone and in combination with either one or more than one antibiotics as an empiric therapy. Culture was positive in 58 (52.7%) patients and the most commonly identified organisms included, gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 20; 18.8%) and Klebsiella sp.

The most commonly identified bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against antibiotics used as an empiric therapy, while these showed low level of resistance against amoxicillin, clarithromycin, ertapenem, colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, and vancomycin. In this study, 82 (74.5%) patients successfully completed the treatment, while 12 (11%) showed no clinical improvement, 5 (4.5%) lost to follow up and 11 (10%) died. In multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, none of the patient attributes were significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome, while in multivariate linear regression analysis, the factors which were significantly associated with duration of hospital stay included; duration of symptoms <2 weeks prior to admission (p = 0.008, beta = ?0.247) and resistance to five antibiotic classes (p = 0.02, beta = 0.280). Conclusion: Close to 25% of the patients did not complete the treatment successfully. Most of the common bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the broad-spectrum antibiotics used as an empiric therapy. This is alarming.

In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that allows for rapid automated diagnosis of malaria (achieving a high classification accuracy of 98%), as well as a deep neural network (DNN) based three-dimensional (3D) modeling algorithm that renders 3D models of parasitic cells in augmented reality (AR). This creates an opportunity to optimize the current workflow for malaria diagnosis and demonstrates potential for deep learning models to improve telemedicine practices and patient health literacy on a global scale.","output":"End-to-end Malaria Diagnosis and 3D Cell Rendering with Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk society theory, with its complexity and inclusion of different ideas with respect to the peculiarity of risk in the modern era, the role played by the media in the construction and communication of risk as well as the nature of reflexivity, has had repercussions in various fields. Since multiple elements are to be analysed to reconsider the risk society theory in the current global landscape characterized by emerging threats, an integrated approach has been chosen in this study for a comprehensive evaluation. The majority of the studies conducted on the relevant subject matter lack quantitative analyses; therefore, this study aims at bridging a gap in this regard by elucidating the parameters and implications of the concepts related to the risk society based on the results obtained by quantitative and qualitative analyses. To this end, a survey (including demographic, sociological and psychological items) on risk and economic uncertainty was designed and conducted online. Secondly, content analysis was done on a set of news items focusing on global economy. The results of the survey evaluated with statistical analyses (ANOVA, t-test and correlation analysis) were used to relate the responses to different aspects and thematic qualities of the risk society theory postulated and developed by Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and other social philosophers. The experimental results of the study revealed certain relationships between demographic characteristics and sociological-psychological elements of the risk society theory and its parameters in the individuals attitudes and perception. Correspondingly, repercussions of the risk society theory have been revealed in the news items handled. The majority of the results obtained support the key postulations of the risk society, which can shed light on understanding the significant transformation of our era along with the social attitudes, fears, insecurity and risk perception among individuals. In addition, the findings can lead to further interpretation of the interplay between economy, media, science and politics, opening up new perspectives toward reconsidering contemporary risks.","output":"Reconsidering the Risk Society: Its Parameters and Repercussions Evaluated by a Statistical Model with Aspects of Different Social Sciences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the Editor: Mental health risks increase during the pandemic,1 owing to unpredictability and uncertainty, social distancing, loss of income, increase in alcohol use, and online gambling.2 In a survey of 1257 healthcare workers in China, 50.4% reported symptoms of depression, 44.6% reported symptoms of anxiety, 34.0% reported symptoms of insomnia, and 71.5% reported symptoms of distress.3 Healthcare professionals may be reluctant to seek care for mental health conditions. 40% of physicians reported that they would be reluctant to seek formal medical care for treatment of a mental health condition because of concerns about repercussions to their medical licensure.4 Primary prevention is important to reduce mental health risks in healthcare professionals.

Value seeing patients as whole people Research Objectives This study investigated a new standard of care in which hospitalized patients chose and displayed a single photograph representing how they wished to be seen by their healthcare team. This method was based on a pilot study demonstrating that the use of photographs can stimulate conversations and affect patients sense of dignity. The aim was to expand the definition of dignity-conserving therapy and evaluate the impact of the photographs on patients or surrogates sense of dignity and clinicians sense of meaningful work. Methods This study was conducted in a mixed-method design, including cross-sectional pre- and post-intervention clinician surveys and semistructured interviews. A convenience sample of patient/surrogates admitted to palliative care, intensive care, and medical/surgical units were surveyed, and the responses were analyzed via thematic content analysis. Results The intervention affected patients and surrogates sense of dignity and clinicians sense of meaningful work by humanizing the patients and stimulating conversations between patients, surrogates, and clinicians. Nineteen patients or surrogates participated in the study, and 9 themes emerged: conveying goals, acceptance, joy, capturing the patient's spirit, humanizing the patient, faith or spirituality, sense of belonging, physical appearance or health. and stimulating conversation or connection. Analysis of questions within the staff surveys yielded similar themes: humanizing the patient, stimulating conversation or connection, goals, joy, meaningful work, compassion, and empathy. Conclusion Patients and surrogates felt the photographs simulated conversations with providers, boosted their sense of dignity, and improved their experience in the hospital. The photographs also helped clinicians recognize the meaning in their work.

Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) between HCWs working within (high-risk) or outside (intermediate-risk) units treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In addition, administration staff (low-risk) was included. Materials: Co-HCW is a prospective cohort study among employees at the Jena University Hospital, Germany. Since 16th March 2020, 50 SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and 73 outpatients were treated in our hospital. Mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We here evaluated seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays, assessed COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Findings: Between 19th May and 19th June 2020 we analysed 660 employees [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Eighteen participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Among them, 13 (72.2%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (50.0%) did not report any clinical symptoms. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and risk area (high-risk: 2 of 137 HCWs (1.5%), intermediate-risk: 10 of 343 HCWs (2.9%), low-risk: 6 of 180 administration employees (3.3%); p=0.574). Reported compliance to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). Conclusion: No evidence for higher seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in high-risk COVID-19 areas could be observed, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE.

But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of defensive pessimism to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.","output":"The paradox of trust: perceived risk and public compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunization with mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been highly recommended and prioritized in fragile subjects, including patients with myelofibrosis (MF).

No study has reported changes in RA emptying over time or evaluated whether serial measurements offer further prognostic information. METHODS Prospective study of 32 children with idiopathic or heritable PAH undergoing echocardiogram at baseline and 1-year. RA conduit fraction percent (RA cF%) was measured as percentage of total diastolic RA area change prior to the electrical p wave. Clinical worsening was analyzed with a predefined composite adverse event outcome. RESULTS Longitudinal subjects (median age 13.3 yr) had RA cF% 61% (IQR 32-68%) at baseline and 60% (IQR 35-73%) at 1-year (NS). 11 subjects had a qualifying event during median 21-month follow-up. Subjects with an event had 1-year RA cF% = 33% (IQR 20-40%) compared to 72% (IQR 63-75%) for those with no event (p < 0.001). Event rates were lowest for subjects with both echocardiograms showing RA cF% > 60% (0%), highest for subjects with neither (80%), and intermediate for those with one (38%, p = 0.003).

Several clinical areas, most notably oncology and autoimmune disorders, have seen the successful introduction of monoclonal-based therapeutics.

Age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, and 44 chronic disease categories were considered as possible risk factors for severe infection. Severe infection was defined as hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Associations between risk factors and severe infection were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models overall and within 3 age groups (0-44, 45-64, and 65+ years).

Our findings showed that people with individualistic worldviews, high general interpersonal trust, low social trust, a low level of perceived risks, and the conviction that risks other than health risks were neglected had less acceptance of the implemented measures compared with people who held the opposite views on the mentioned variables. The number of infected people declined between survey waves 1 and 2. This desired effect not only reduced people's perceived risks but also decreased their social trust and increased the conviction that other risks were neglected. Finally, the acceptance of the measures declined. Our data also support the idea that reduced risk perceptions and a decline in social trust are important drivers for the reduction in the acceptance of the measures in survey wave 2. Our results suggest that as soon as the measures attain success or the public is tired of the implemented restrictions, public acceptance declines, and it seems difficult to prolong the measures as may be desirable from an epidemiological standpoint.

The main finding reveals that the emergence of the pandemic was described by the participants as an unexpected and significant rupture in the transition to motherhood that raised feelings of fear and anxiety. In addition, I-other relations were marked by intense ambivalence between the need for social support and the risk of contagion, and the perspective and experience of childbirth were marked by a feeling of insecurity in the relations with the health personnel and settings. In light of Semiotic Cultural Psychology, three interdependent affective-semiotic fields were highlighted from the narratives: the perception of oneself regulated by the sign of vulnerability, the other regulated by the sign of a potential threat, and healthcare provision regulated by the sign of risk.

Two hundred and seventy-four athletes were assessed over 7 weeks using the GHQ-28 and an ad hoc survey exploring the practice of physical activity. A mixed-model fixed effects ANCOVA was used to analyze the effects of time, place, and company in which the sport was practiced, with an index of the amount of physical activity expended as a covariate. Results show a significant effect of time in three out of four of the GHQ-28 subscales, in all cases showing a consistent adaptation to conditions over time. Results also show that playing sport indoors, outdoors, or both, and practicing alone vs. with others differentially affect the somatic symptoms exhibited during confinement: Athletes who practiced sport with others showed higher levels of somatic symptoms at the beginning of the set of data but a quicker rate of adaptation. Differences arising from practicing sport alone or with others were more pronounced in the case of indoor sports, which could be related to the fact that physical activity that can be practiced during confinement is more similar to that practiced indoors alone. Implications relating to what sport psychologists and other health professionals may offer to athletes in stressful situations are discussed.","output":"Athletes Psychological Adaptation to Confinement Due to COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID 19 infection also affects obstetric patients Regular obstetric care has continued despite the pandemic Case series of obstetric patients have been published Neuroaxial techniques appear to be safe and it is important to obtain the highest possible rate of success of the blocks before a cesarean section For this reason, it is recommended that the blocks be carried out by senior anesthesiologists The protection and safety of professionals is a key point and in case of general anesthesia, so it is also recommended to call to the most expert anesthesiologist Seriously ill patients should be recognized quickly and early, in order to provide them with the appropriate treatment as soon as possible Susceptibility to thrombosis makes prophylactic anticoagulation a priority Resumen La infeccin por COVID 19 afecta tambin a las pacientes obsttricas La atencin obsttrica habitual ha continuado a pesar de la pandemia Existen series de casos de pacientes obsttricas Parece que las tcnicas neuroaxiales son seguras y es importante asegurarse que los bloqueos funcionen correctamente antes de una cesrea Es por esto, que se recomienda que los bloqueos sean realizados por anestesilogos expertos La proteccin y seguridad de los profesionales es un punto fundamental y en caso de anestesia general, tambin se recomienda acudir al anestesilogo ms experto Las pacientes gravemente enfermas, deben reconocerse rpida y precozmente, para poder suministrarles el tratamiento adecuado lo antes posible La susceptibilidad a las trombosis hace que la anticoagulacin profilctica sea prioritaria","output":"Practical recommendations in the obstetric patient with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding and monitoring the epidemiological time delay dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights that are key to discerning changes in the phenotype of the virus, the demographics impacted, the efficacy of treatment, and the ability of the health service to manage large volumes of patients. This paper analyses how the pandemic has evolved in the United Kingdom through the temporal changes to the epidemiological time delay distributions for clinical outcomes. Using the most complete clinical data presently available, we have analysed, through a doubly interval censored Bayesian modelling approach, the time from infection to a clinical outcome. Across the pandemic, for the periods that were defined as epidemiologically distinct, the modelled mean ranges from 8.0 to 9.7 days for infection to hospitalisation, 10.3 to 15.0 days for hospitalisation to death, and 17.4 to 24.7 days for infection to death. The time delay from infection to hospitalisation has increased since the first wave of the pandemic. A marked decrease was observed in the time from hospitalisation to death and infection to death at times of high incidence when hospitals and ICUs were under the most pressure. There is a clear relationship between age groups that is indicative of the youngest and oldest demographics having the shortest time delay distributions before a clinical outcome. A statistically significant difference was found between genders for the time delay from infection to hospitalisation, which was not found for hospitalisation to death. The results by age group indicate that younger demographics that require clinical intervention for SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to require earlier hospitalisation that leads to a shorter time to death, which is suggestive of the largely more vulnerable nature of these individuals that succumb to infection. The distinction found between genders for exposure to hospitalisation is revealing of gender healthcare seeking behaviours.","output":"Understanding an evolving pandemic: An analysis of the clinical time delay distributions of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Nusa Tenggara Barat province, on May 04, 2020, there were 275 cases out of 11,587 total cases in Indonesia COVID-19 not only has an impact on physical health issues, but it also impacts on psychological issues One of the psychological issues is how society experiences negative emotion (e g , depression) during the spread of COVID-19 This study aimed to explore the telecounseling process on the individual who had experienced negative emotion especially in the case of depressive disorder in the COVID-19 Nusa Tenggara Barat province This study used a single-case research design approach, and the collected data were analyzed qualitatively The results showed that the participant reported everything she felt and thought about in stage I Next, in stage II, the participant analyzed what she thought and wished The statements of having suicidal thoughts, having negative emotions (e g , feeling sad) and not being interested in any activities indicated that the participant experienced severe depression (BDI-II) Stage III took the form of a strategy of how the participant realized her goals Through the telecounseling process, the participant understood the goals and strategies to achieve them amid COVID-19","output":"\\"Why Can Other People Live Normally While I Cannot?\\": An Application of Telecounseling Due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES We demonstrate indications for external mechanical stapler diverticulectomy in the modern era of endoscopic treatment. We review treatment of a large diverticulum and discuss considerations that should be made in deciding on the type of surgical treatment. METHODS The index case was in a 75-year-old man who had undergone open cricopharyngeal myotomy with diverticulopexy 35 years earlier. He presented with 25 years of recurrent symptoms. A swallow study showed a 6.5 x 5.0-cm diverticulum. The diverticulum was deemed too large for standard endoscopic myotomy, so diverticulectomy was performed with a stapler. RESULTS The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 without complications. A swallow study on postoperative day 5 demonstrated no diverticulum or extravasation of barium. The patient resumed a normal diet with resolution of dysphagia. Two additional patients with large Zenker's diverticula that were managed similarly are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS Although endoscopic laser cricopharyngeal myotomy and stapler diverticulostomy have become standard treatments for Zenker's diverticulum, this case of a large recurrent diverticulum illustrates a situation in which older techniques may be preferred. Use of the mechanical stapler allowed for a shorter surgery time than traditional suture techniques, and the potential for an earlier return to a normal diet.","output":"Open staple diverticulectomy for a large recurrent Zenker's diverticulum: still a valid procedure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change is the greatest threat to global health in human history.

It is suggested that helminths are capable of evading and manipulating the host immune system through the release of a spectrum of worm proteins which underpins their long-term survival in the host. We hypothesise that the worm overexpresses these proteins when infecting adults compared to children to cirvumvent the more robust defence mechanisms of adults. However, little is known about the parasites genes and encoded proteins involved during A. lumbricoides infection. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the expression profile of putative virulence-associated genes during an active infection of adults and children. METHODS: In this study, quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression profile of putative virulence-associated genes in A. lumbricoides isolated from infected children and adults. The study was initiated by collecting adult worms expelled from adults and children following anthelminthic treatment. High-quality RNA was successfully extracted from each of six adult worms expelled by three adults and three children, respectively. Eleven putative homologues of helminth virulence-associated genes reported in previous studies were selected, primers were designed and specific amplicons of A. lumbricoides genes were noted. The expression profiles of these putative virulence-associated genes in A. lumbricoides from infected adults were compared to those in A. lumbricoides from infected children. RESULTS: The putative virulence-associated genes VENOM, CADHERIN and PEBP were significantly upregulated at 166-fold, 13-fold and fivefold, respectively, in adults compared to children. Conversely, the transcription of ABA-1 (fourfold), CATH-L (threefold) and INTEGRIN (twofold) was significantly suppressed in A. lumbricoides from infected adults. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the expression profile of the putative virulence-associated genes, we propose that the encoded proteins have potential roles in evasion mechanisms, which could guide the development of therapeutic interventions.

METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 60 critically ill patients (43 males and 17 females, mean age 64.4  11.0 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to two different clinical centers. Their clinical and medical records were analyzed, and the chest CT images were assessed to determine the involvement of lobes and the distribution of lesions in the lungs between the patients who recovered from the illness and those who died. RESULTS: Compared with recovered patients (50/60, 83%), deceased patients (10/60, 17%) were older (mean age, 70.6 vs. 62.6 years, p = 0.044). C-reactive protein (CRP) (110.8  26.3 mg/L vs 63.0  50.4 mg/L, p < 0.001) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (18.7  16.6 vs 8.4  7.5, p = 0.030) were significantly elevated in the deceased as opposed to the recovered. Medial or parahilar area involvement was observed in all the deceased patients (10/10, 100%), when compared to only 54% (27/50) in the recovered. Ground-glass opacities (97%), crazy-paving pattern (92%), and air bronchogram (93%) were the most common radiological findings. There was significant difference in diabetes (p = 0.025) and emphysema (p = 0.013), and the odds ratio on a deceased patient having diabetes and emphysema was 6 times and 21 times the odds ratio on a recovered patient having diabetes and emphysema, respectively.

METHODS: A multicenter cohort of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at 126 Brazilian intensive care units between February 27th and October 28th, 2020. Assessing temporal changes in deaths, we identified distinct time periods. We evaluated the association of characteristics and respiratory support strategies with 60-day in-hospital mortality using random-effects multivariable Cox regression with inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Among the 13,301 confirmed-COVID-19 patients, 60-day in-hospital mortality was 13%. Across four time periods identified, younger patients were progressively more common, non-invasive respiratory support was increasingly used, and the 60-day in-hospital mortality decreased in the last two periods. 4188 patients received advanced respiratory support (non-invasive or invasive), from which 42% underwent only invasive mechanical ventilation, 37% only non-invasive respiratory support and 21% failed non-invasive support and were intubated. After adjusting for organ dysfunction scores and premorbid conditions, we found that younger age, absence of frailty and the use of non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) as first support strategy were independently associated with improved survival (hazard ratio for NIRS first [95% confidence interval], 0.59 [0.54-0.65], p < 0.001).

Design/methodology/approach Quantitative survey design was used and 98 usable responses were collected from undergraduate and postgraduate students at a major New Zealand university during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The questionnaire consisted of 23 items relating to three dimensions of online student engagement and 19 items referring to six dimensions of campus attachment. Findings Results of the exploratory study indicate that classmate community in online lectures, referring to student-student interactions, can positively influence five of the dimensions of campus attachment, including place identity, place dependence, affective attachment, social bonding and place memory, even though students are physically not on campus. However, it cannot influence place expectation. Moreover, instructor community (student-instructor interaction) and learning engagement (student-content interaction) in online lectures have insignificant impact on campus attachment. Research limitations/implications This study emphasises the social dimension when interacting in e-servicescapes.

A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively. In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term and some included low patient numbers.This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence. It also emphasises the importance of tailoring interventions to disease stage and severity for maximum efficacy.","output":"Current evidence for COVID-19 therapies: a systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appearance of the first coronavirus cases in Argentina led to debate about features of the health care system and ways of accessing its services and benefits.

This study examined whether the risk of depression was associated with COVID-19 pandemic-related medical school communication. METHODS: A 144 - item pilot cross-sectional online survey of medical students in the US, was carried out between September 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Items on stress, depression, and communication between students and their medical schools were included. This study examined associations of student perceptions of universities communication efforts and pandemic response with risk of developing depression. RESULTS: The sample included 212 students from 22 US states. Almost 50% (48.6%) were at risk of developing depression. Students felt medical schools transitioned well to online platforms, while the curriculum was just as rigorous as in-person courses. Students at risk of developing depression reported communication was poor more frequently compared to students at average risk. Students at risk of depression were also more than 3 times more likely to report their universities communication about scholarships or other funding was poor in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: Universities communicated well with medical students during the pandemic.

Lack of skills and knowledge on the part of health care providers have a negative effect on their access to care and health outcomes. This study 1) explores the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT people, and 2) assesses the impact of a one-hour lecture targeting adolescent LGBT health needs. METHODS: Fourth-year medical students attended a compulsory one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and gender identity development in adolescence, highlighting health issues. We created a questionnaire with items to elicit students' knowledge and attitudes about LGBT health issues. Students were invited to complete this questionnaire online anonymously one week before the lecture and one month after the lecture. RESULTS: Out of a total of 157 students, 107 (68.2%) responded to the pre-intervention questionnaire and 96 (61.1%) to the post-intervention questionnaire. A significant proportion-13.7% of all respondents-identified as LGBT or questioning. Our results show that most medical students already show favorable attitudes towards LGBT people and a certain degree of knowledge of LGBT health needs. They demonstrated a large and significant increase in knowledge of LGBT health issues one month after the lecture. DISCUSSION: A single one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and LGBT health issues may increase knowledge among medical students.

Being both a physical and a psychological experience, pain is affected by many factors, including biological, psychological, and social rather than a single variable. Aims To determine the effects of biological, psychological, and social factors on pain level among participants experiencing with the COVID-19. Design A web-based, retrospective, and descriptive study Participants One hundred and forty-nine participants were included. Methods Data were collected based on the biopsychosocial model. Pain level was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The data were analyzed using descriptive, correlational statistics and structural equation modeling. Results The mean age of participants was 32.87 (SD=11.32) years. The VAS scores were associated with gender (Z=-2.103, p=0.035) and chronic disease status (Z=3.001, p=0.003), and the Chalder Fatigue Scale total score (=0.718, p<0.001) associated with biological factors. The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale scores among psychological factors showed a direct impact on the VAS scores (=0.583, p<0.001). The Patterns of Activity Measure-Pain total score examined within social factors directly affected the VAS score. The VAS score did not correlate with age, smoking status, hospitalization status, and respiratory support, marital status, education level, employment, and income status. Conclusion The pain level in COVID-19 participants was determined by biological, psychological, and social factors. Females and participants with chronic illness, anxiety, fatigue, and low physical activity were found to experience high levels of pain.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women are very similar. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester are more likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to require intensive care, though this may reflect a lower threshold for intervention in pregnant women rather than more serious disease. Compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital have worse maternal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk remains very low.

The outbreak, confirmed on the New Year's Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating. Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission. The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called 'super-spreading events' emerge with time. Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host. India is responding swiftly to the emergency situation, and the whole of the country is under lockdown since 25 March 2020, to ensure social distancing. All the international flights are padlocked and the travellers are being screened at airports and seaports via thermal sensors, and quarantine for a period of 14 days is recommended.

After its experience with SARS, Taiwan established a comprehensive mechanism at its border to prevent the entry of infectious diseases. However, people with chronic infectious diseases, carriers with no symptoms, and those likely to be infected are not easy to identify during border screenings. Therefore, Taiwan must implement internal disease-containment measures in addition to stopping infectious disease at its borders. With increasing numbers of patients coming to Taiwan for medical examinations, medical aesthetic treatments, and medical treatments and care, the risk of acute, chronic, and contagious diseases originating from non-residents must be considered and addressed.

The early detection of infected patients is effective in fighting COVID19. Using radiology (X-Ray) images is perhaps the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Thereby, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be considered as applicable tools to diagnose COVID19 positive cases. Due to the complicated architecture of a deep CNN, its real-time training and testing become a challenging problem. This paper proposes using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) instead of the last fully connected layer to address this deficiency. However, the parameters' stochastic tuning of ELM's supervised section causes the final model unreliability. Therefore, to cope with this problem and maintain network reliability, the sine-cosine algorithm was utilized to tune the ELM's parameters. The designed network is then benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and the results are verified by a comparative study with canonical deep CNN, ELM optimized by cuckoo search, ELM optimized by genetic algorithm, and ELM optimized by whale optimization algorithm. The proposed approach outperforms comparative benchmarks with a final accuracy of 98.83% on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 2.33% compared to a canonical deep CNN.

The subsequent social burden is a major concern. We aimed to assess the short-term HRQoL, physical function and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms of invasively mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated in our ICU. METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort study in a follow-up clinic. Patients completed a 6-min walking test (6MWT) to assess their cardio-pulmonary function around 2 months (early follow-up) from hospital discharge, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire for quality of life assessment around 2 months and at 6 months from hospital discharge and an anonymous web-based Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire for Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms at 2 months. RESULTS: 47 patients attended our follow-up program, mean age 59  10 years, median pre-morbid Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) 2 [2-3]. The median distance walked in 6 min was 470 [406-516] m, 83 [67-99]% of the predicted value. Overall 1 out 3 patients and 4/18 (22%) among those with a good functional baseline prior to COVID-19 (CFS of 1 or 2) had lower (84%) than predicted 6MWT.

Due to inconsistent practice opportunities in the clinical setting, a disparity of skill levels among students has been observed. In addition, the poor availability of faculty professors is a limiting factor in teaching and adequately preparing medical students for their clerkship years. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, medical students do not have access to traditional suturing learning opportunities. Didactic courses are available on videoconferencing platforms; however, these courses do not include technical training. OBJECTIVE: Our overarching goal is to evaluate the efficacy and usability of web-based peer-learning for advanced suturing techniques (ie, running subcuticular sutures). We will use the Gamified Educational Network (GEN), a newly developed web-based learning tool. We will assess students ability to identify and perform the correct technique. We will also assess the students satisfaction with regard to GEN. METHODS: We will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinding of expert examiners. First-year medical students in the Faculty of Medicine of Universit de Montral will be randomized into four groups: (1) control, (2) self-learning, (3) peer-learning, and (4) peer-learning with expert feedback. Each arm will have 15 participants who will learn how to perform running subcuticular sutures through videos on GEN. For our primary outcome, the students ability to identify the correct technique will be evaluated before and after the intervention on GEN. The students will view eight videos and rate the surgical techniques using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills Global Rating Scale and the Subcuticular Suture Checklist as evaluation criteria. For our secondary outcomes, students will anonymously record themselves performing a running subcuticular suture and will be evaluated using the same scales. Then, a survey will be sent to assess the students acceptance of the intervention. RESULTS: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by our institutional review board (CERSES 20-068-D). No participants have been recruited yet. CONCLUSIONS: Peer learning through GEN has the potential to overcome significant limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of availability of faculty professors. Further, a decrease of the anxiety related to traditional suturing classes can be expected. We aim to create an innovative and sustainable method of teaching surgical skills to improve the efficiency and quality of surgical training in medical faculties.

The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched extensively using the terms Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with Ear surgery and Otology. Data collected from these, put together with our experience helped us in putting forward fresh management strategies to deal with the current situation being experienced worldwide. To reduce the risk of infection to the healthcare staff, we have suggested a new triage strategy for ear surgeries to reduce the accumulated disease burden in the post-lockdown period until immunity by vaccination develops amongst a good number of Ear surgeons. Also we have put forward certain operating guidelines that might prove helpful for the Ear surgeon during these times. Fresh Triage guidelines mentioned in this article are particularly meant to help ear surgeons reduce the accumulated disease burden in the post lockdown-period with ease and efficacy. Since ear surgery poses a risk of infection to the healthcare workers, specific guidelines pertaining to ear surgery during the pandemic are mentioned in detail which in our opinion can be of immense help to all the healthcare professionals involved in ear procedures till the time the vaccine is administered on a large scale.","output":"Covid-19 and Ear Surgery: Treatment Strategies and Triage during the Post-lockdown Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to impose quarantines and lockdowns as containment strategy, raising concerns about mental health and low level of physical activity performed by quarantined populations.

With health systems increasingly establishing performance management programmes to account for and incentivize performance, it is important to conduct research that is actionable by the end-users involved with or impacted by these programmes. The aim of this study was to co-design a research agenda on healthcare performance management with and for end-users in a specific jurisdictional and policy context. METHODS: We undertook a rapid review of the literature on healthcare performance management (n = 115) and conducted end-user interviews (n = 156) that included a quantitative ranking exercise to prioritize five directions for future research. The quantitative rankings were analysed using four methods: mean, median, frequency ranked first or second, and frequency ranked fifth. The interview transcripts were coded inductively and analysed thematically to identify common patterns across participant responses. RESULTS: Seventy-three individual and group interviews were conducted with 156 end-users representing diverse end-user groups, including administrators, clinicians and patients, among others. End-user groups prioritized different research directions based on their experiences and information needs. Despite this variation, the research direction on motivating performance improvement had the highest overall mean ranking and was most often ranked first or second and least often ranked fifth. The research direction was modified based on end-user feedback to include an explicit behaviour change lens and stronger consideration for the influence of context. CONCLUSIONS: Joint research priority-setting resulted in a practice-driven research agenda capable of generating results to inform policy and management practice in healthcare as well as contribute to the literature. The results suggest that end-users are keen to open the black box of performance management to explore more nuanced questions beyond does performance management work? End-users want to know how, when and why performance management contributes to behaviour change (or fails to) among front-line care providers.

The disease has a marked predilection for adults, and children are relatively spared. Understanding the age-based differences in pathophysiological pathways and processes relevant to the onset and progression of disease both in the clinical course and in experimental disease models may hold the key to the identification of therapeutic targets. The differences in the clinical course are highlighted by the lack of progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond mild symptoms in a majority of children, whereas in adults the disease progresses to acute lung injury and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like phenotype with high mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to decreased lung injury in children may involve the decreased expression of the mediators necessary for viral entry into the respiratory epithelium and differences in the immune system responses in children. Specifically, decreased expression of proteins, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the airway epithelium in children may prevent viral entry. The immune system differences may include a relative preponderance of CD4(+) T cells, decreased neutrophil infiltration, decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased production of immunomodulatory cytokines in children compared with adults. Notably, the developing lung in children may have a greater capacity to recover and repair after viral infection. Understanding the relative contributions of the above processes to the protective phenotype in the developing lung can guide the trial of the appropriate therapies in adults.","output":"Understanding the age divide in COVID-19: why are children overwhelmingly spared?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for timely predicting severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and sixteen COVID-19 patients (246 non-severe and 70 severe) were retrospectively collected from two institutions and allocated to training, validation, and testing cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT images. Radiomics signature was constructed based on reproducible features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm with 5-fold cross-validation. Logistic regression modeling was employed to build different models based on quantitative CT features, radiomics signature, clinical factors, and/or the former combined features. Nomogram performance for severe COVID-19 prediction was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Sixteen selected features were used to build the radiomics signature. The CT-based radiomics model showed good calibration and discrimination in the training cohort (AUC, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.843C0.942), the validation cohort (AUC, 0.878; 95% CI, 0.796C0.958), and the testing cohort (AUC, 0.842; 95% CI, 0.761C0.922). The CT-based radiomics model showed better discrimination capability (all p < 0.05) compared with the clinical factors joint quantitative CT model (AUC, 0.781; 95% CI, 0.708C0.843) in the training cohort, the validation cohort (AUC, 0.814; 95% CI, 0.703C0.897), and the testing cohort (AUC, 0.696; 95% CI, 0.581C0.796).

CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based radiomics signature shows favorable predictive efficacy for severe COVID-19, which might assist clinicians in tailoring precise therapy. KEY POINTS: ? Radiomics can be applied in CT images of COVID-19 and radiomics signature was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19. ? CT-based radiomics model can predict severe COVID-19 with satisfactory accuracy compared with subjective CT findings and clinical factors. ?

METHODS A prospective evaluation was made of 69 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperative USG was applied to the patients and measurements were taken and recorded of the stomach antrum full layer wall thickness (USGFT) and of mucosal thickness (USGMT). Postoperatively, same parameters were again measured histopathologically and the pathological full thickness (PFT) and pathological mucosal thickness (PMT) values were compared. RESULTS When evaluation was made in respect of USG and pathological measurements, the USGFT was 8.51  3.07 (range 4.5-15.8) and USGMT was 5.80  2.15 (range 2.36-10.5). The PFT was determined as 8.13  2.24 (range 4-14) and PMT as 5.53  1.86 (range 2-10.5). In the histopathological examination, gastritis was seen in 53 (76.8 %) patients and Helicobacter pylori (HP) positivity was determined in 32 (46.4 %) patients. When the patients were grouped as obese (BMI  49.9 kg/m2) (group 1, n = 50) and super obese (BMI  50 kg/m2) (group 2, n = 19), no difference was determined between the groups ultrasonographically or histopathologically (p > 0.05). The antrum wall thickness was seen to be significantly greater in the patients with gastritis and HP positivity compared to the patients who were negative. In ROC analysis, cutoff values were calculated for USGFT (5.86 mm) and USGMT (4.49 mm). In gastritis diagnosis, the USGFT cutoff value was found to have 796 % sensitivity and 68.7 % specificity. CONCLUSION USG was seen to be an extremely effective method in visualising the antrum wall and gastritis diagnosis can be made comfortably from the wall thickness measurement.","output":"The Role of Conventional Ultrasonography in the Evaluation of Antrum Wall Thickness in Obese Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Second language (L2) writing strategies are essential for successful learning outcomes in courses with a substantial writing component and this is especially true during emergency remote teaching (ERT) when online writing tasks help compensate for the missing offline communication.

METHODS: We constructed a novel dataset that combined information on manufacturers with detailed data about their patent challenges after introduction of the patent linkage system. Based on the number of successful patent challenges, manufacturers were categorized into non-challengers, passive challengers, and aggressive challengers. Then, two types of logistic models were applied to identify the factors associated with successful and aggressive challengers. FINDINGS: Only 39 active ingredients were challenged by 77 manufacturers from March 2015 to December 2019. Of 171 manufacturers, 94 (55 %) were non-challengers, 58 (34 %) were passive challengers who had succeeded in fewer than 4 patent challenges, and 19 (11 %) were aggressive challengers who had succeeded in 4 or more patent challenges. Higher sales, more employees, and a greater number of reimbursed drugs were associated with being a patent challenger, while a greater number of reimbursed drugs was associated with being an aggressive challenger. CONCLUSION: Some manufacturers utilize patent challenges to strengthen their product portfolios in the market. However, under the patent linkage system, the frequency of patent challenges is limited in South Korea compared to the United States.

Several new imaging techniques for angle evaluation have been developed in the recent years. However, whether these instruments may replace or not gonioscopy in everyday clinical practice remains unclear. This review summarizes the last findings in ACA evaluation, focusing on new instruments and their application to the clinical practice. Special attention will be given to the comparison between these new techniques and traditional slit-lamp gonioscopy. Whereas ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography provide quantitative measurements of the anterior segments structures, new gonio-photographic systems allow for a qualitative assessment of angle findings, similarly to gonioscopy.

The results were assessed and compared with those of conventionally processed samples. A variety of infectious agents, some with a potential for bioterrorism, and liver biopsies serving as an example for routine histopathology samples were studied. The samples represented virus-producing cell cultures (such as SARS-coronavirus, West Nile virus, Orthopox virus), bacteria suspensions (cultures of Escherichia coli and genetically knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis), suspensions of parasites (malaria Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, Microsporidia cuniculi, Caenorhabditis elegans), and whole Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with microsporidia. Fresh liver samples and infected flies were fixed in Karnovsky-fixative by microwaving (20 min), all other samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky-fixative overnight or longer. Subsequently, all samples were divided to evaluate alternative processing protocols: one part of the sample was OsO(4)-postfixed, ethanol-dehydrated, Epon-infiltrated (overnight) in an automated tissue processor (LYNX, Leica), and polymerized at 60 C for 48 h; in parallel the other part was microwave-assisted processed in the bench microwave device (REM, Milestone), including post-osmication and the resin block polymerization. The microwave-assisted processing protocol required at minimum 3 h 20 min: the respective epon resin blocks were uniformly polymerized allowing an easy sectioning of semi- and ultrathin sections. Sections collected on non-coated 200 mesh grids were stable in the electron beam and showed an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure and high contrast, thus allowing an easy, unequivocal and rapid assessment of specimens. Compared with conventional routine methods, microwave technology facilitates a significant reduction in sample processing time from days to hours without any loss in ultrastructural details. Microwave-assisted processing could, therefore, be a substantial benefit for the routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload. Due to its speed and robust performance it could be applied wherever a rapid electron microscopy diagnosis is required, e.g., if bioterrorism or emerging agents are suspected.

However, direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral protein expression have also been reported in other organs, which potentially contributes to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality in COVID-19. Since the original Wuhan-type genome was sequenced, several genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged with differing pathophysiological properties such as the levels of transmissibility, disease severity, and mortality. We previously reported that the protein encoded by open reading frame 3a (ORF3a), a critical protein for SARS-CoV-2 replication and release, is found in the mitochondria of host cells and could increase oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling. ORF3a-Q57H is a highly recurrent variation and the most commonly found variant of ORF3a. Interestingly, the Q57H variant is associated with increased transmissibility, but lower mortality. AIM To investigate the impact of the ORF3a-Q57H variant on host cell damage. METHODS Plasmids carrying ORF3a-Q57H were generated by PCR-based site mutagenesis using Wuhan-type ORF3a (ORF3a-WT) as a template. Whole cell lysates were prepared from HEK293T cells and H9c2 cardiac myoblasts expressing ORF3a-WT or the mutant ORF3a-Q57H and used for biochemical assays. Live cell imaging for assessing subcellular localization of ORF3a/ORF3a-Q57H, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), and caspase 3 activity in H9c2 cells was performed by confocal microscopy. RESULTS In whole cell lysates, we found that ORF3a-Q57H exhibits significantly higher protein expression compared to ORF3a-WT. However, there is no significant difference in the ability of mitochondrial trafficking between ORF3a-WT and ORF3a-Q57H assessed by live cell imaging using GFP-tagged ORF3a/ORF3a-Q57H with mitochondria-targeted DsRed. Next, we investigated the effects of ORF3a expression on apoptotic and mitophagy signaling by quantifying the caspase 3 activity and LC3A/B ratio. We found that ORF3a-Q57H has significantly lower apoptosis and mitophagy signaling compared to WT despite its higher protein expression levels. ER-stress signaling was not activated in either ORF3a-WT or ORF3a-Q57H, as assessed by markers including Glucose-regulated protein 78/94 and C/EBP-homologous protein. Lastly, live cell imaging using the mitochondrial superoxide-sensitive dye Mitosox Red revealed that ORF3a-WT significantly increases mROS levels, but ORF3a-Q57H expression does not. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a-Q57H causes lower oxidative stress and cell damage compared to the Wuhan-type variant, which could help explain the decreased mortality associated with the ORF3a-Q57H variant. These results provide novel insights on how genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 influence the pathophysiology and clinical severity of COVID-19.","output":"Variation in ORF3a Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Decreases The Severity of Host Cell Damage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Recent studies reported sex differences in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) We aim to analyze sex differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors for disease severity of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Beijing All adults (185 cases) diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University were included in samples The median age of all patients was 41 years The mean body mass index (BMI) of males was relatively higher compared to females (p &lt; 0 001) The proportion of male patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), history of smoking and drinking was higher than females Male patients developed more clinical symptoms, obtained more abnormal laboratory test results, while they were less aware of care-seeking than female patients There were no significant differences in clinical complications and outcomes between two groups Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1 082;95% confidence interval [CI]: 1 034?1 132;p = 0 001) and BMI (OR: 1 237;95% CI: 1 041?1 47;p = 0 016) were considered risk factors for refractory pneumonia in multivariate regression analysis The findings of the current study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to affect older males with comorbidities Further researches into factors underlying obesity and disease severity may provide mechanistic insight into COVID-19 development","output":"Sex differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors for disease severity of hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical progression of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains pessimistic.

The univariate Cox regression analysis, KaplanCMeier curves, and receiver operating characteristic curves were applied to determine OGT's clinical relevance in cancers. The Spearman correlation analysis and enrichment analysis were utilized to explore the underlying mechanisms of OGT in cancers. For the first time in the field, we provide an overview of OGT in 32 cancers using a large number of samples (n = 21,196), determining distinct OGT expression in 25 cancers and its prognosis effects in 12 cancers. Furthermore, using 950 samples from multiple sources, upregulated OGT was found in both mRNA and protein levels in SCLC (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI [0.24, 1.63]). Higher OGT levels represented a more unfavorable disease-free interval for SCLC patients (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the source(s) of COVID-19 information among people in Nigeria, as well as the predictors and the perceived accuracy of information from these sources. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of consenting adults residing in Nigeria between April and May 2020 during the lockdown and first wave of COVID-19. The major sources of information about COVID-19 were distilled from 7 potential sources (family and friends, places of worship, health care providers, internet, workplace, traditional media, and public posters/banners). An open-ended question was asked to explore how respondents determined accuracy of information. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 15.0 software (StataCorp Texas) with significance placed at P<.05. Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: A total of 719 respondents completed the survey. Most respondents (n=642, 89.3%) obtained COVID-19Crelated information from the internet. The majority (n=617, 85.8%) considered their source(s) of information to be accurate, and 32.6% (n=234) depended on only 1 out of the 7 potential sources of COVID-19 information. Respondents earning a monthly income between NGN 70,000-120,000 had lower odds of obtaining COVID-19 information from the internet compared to respondents earning less than NGN 20,000 (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.98). In addition, a significant proportion of respondents sought accurate information from recognized health organizations, such as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. CONCLUSIONS: The internet was the most common source of COVID-19 information, and the population sampled had a relatively high level of perceived accuracy for the COVID-19 information received.

Studies using EQ-5D generate ordinal data that are interpreted as categories ordered by severity. New analytic approaches taking into account the ordinal nature of the health dimension severity and leading to a better interpretation of EQ-5D data are needed to better elucidate differences in health-related quality of life. We propose utilizing the Improved RIDIT statistical method to analyze EQ-5D outcomes. METHODS: 556 Moroccan participants aged over 18 years representing four chronic diseases: back pain (n = 158), renal insufficiency (n = 56), diabetes (n = 82) or hypertension (n = 80) and healthy subjects (n = 180). All participants received the two EQ-5D versions. Two other published data sets were included. The first was extracted from a diabetic Spain study and the second was extracted from a clinical trial study. The Improved RIDIT analyses were carried out using an R statistic program we developed. RESULTS: Applying the Improved RIDIT on the EQ-5D data allowed estimating for the first time the ordinal odds, the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) or the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI) and the Number Needed to Treat. The ARI values estimated for Moroccan patients showed that (i) hypertension increased anxiety/depression by 66% and reduced mobility by 65%; (ii) back pain increased pain/discomfort by 69%; (iii) renal insufficiency impacts mobility (ARI = 57%, odds(ordinal) = 9.95) and usual activities (ARI = 44%, odds(ordinal) = 6.41) and (iv) diabetes acts only on anxiety/depression (ARI = 50%, odds(ordinal) = 4.8). Also, we demonstrated that the approach works well in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Improved RIDIT provides more intuitive and informative interpretation of the EQ-5D data by (1) taking into account the level severity; estimating (2) the odds ordinal, (3) the ARR/ARI and the NNT; (4) analyzing the five dimensions of the EQ-5D separately, which gives clinical teams more precision in understanding the treatment/pathology impacts on the health status and completes the EQ-5D data analysis based on score utilities.","output":"Improved RIDIT statistic approach provides more intuitive and informative interpretation of EQ-5D data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) practice is not well known.

This virus is endemic in many countries and has very recently spread to China, but no licensed vaccines or treatments are currently available. Despite extensive research, the basic question of how ASFV-encoded proteins inhibit host translation remains. Here, we examined how ASFV interfered with host translation and optimized viral gene expression. We found that 14 ASFV proteins inhibited Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity greater than 5-fold, and the protein with the strongest inhibitory effect was pE66L, which was not previously reported. Combined with bioinformatical analysis and biochemical experiment, we determined that the transmembrane (TM) domain (amino acids 13-34) of pE66L was required for the inhibition of host gene expression. Notably, we constructed a recombinant plasmid with the TM domain linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and further demonstrated that this domain broadly inhibited protein synthesis. Confocal and biochemical analyses indicated that the TM domain might help proteins locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to suppress translation though the PKR/eIF2 pathway. Deletion of the E66L gene had little effect on virus replication in macrophages, but significantly recovered host gene expression. Taken together, our findings complement studies on the host translation of ASFV proteins and suggest that ASFV pE66L induces host translation shutoff, which is dependent on activation of the PKR/eIF2 pathway.Importance African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a member of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus superfamily that predominantly replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The ASFV double-stranded DNA genome varies in length from approximately 170 to 193 kbp depending on the isolate and contains between 150 and 167 open reading frames (ORFs), of which half the encoded proteins have not been explored. Our study showed that 14 proteins had an obvious inhibitory effect on Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene synthesis, with pE66L showing the most significant effect. Furthermore, the transmembrane (TM) domain of pE66L broadly inhibited host protein synthesis in a PKR/eIF2a pathway-dependent manner. Loss of pE66L during ASFV infection had little effect on virus replication, but significantly recovered host protein synthetic. Based on the above results, our findings expand our view of ASFV in determining the fate of host-pathogen interactions.","output":"A novel function of African Swine Fever Virus pE66L in inhibition of host translation by the PKR/eIF2 pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, personal protective equipment, including face masks, is one important tool to interrupt virus transmission chains within the community.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects from 10 lung transplant centres were assigned to ECP treatment or to observation based on spirometric criteria, with potential crossover for those under observation. The primary endpoint of this study was to assess response to ECP (i.e., greater than a 50% decrease in the rate of FEV1 decline) before and 6 months after initiation of ECP. Mortality was also evaluated 6 and 12 months after enrolment as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Of 44 enrolled subjects, 31 were assigned to ECP treatment while 13 were initially assigned to observation on a non-random basis using specific spirometric inclusion criteria (seven of the observation patients subsequently crossed over to receive ECP). Of evaluable patients, 95% of patients initially assigned to treatment responded to ECP with rates of FEV1 decline that were reduced by 93% in evaluable ECP-treated patients. Mortality rates (percentages) at 6 and 12 months after enrolment was 32% and 41%, respectively. The most common (92%) primary cause of death was respiratory or graft failure.

Due to the shortage of these devices, they should be prioritised for use in healthcare settings when aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are performed. Several different procedures have been tested for decontamination of respirators in the event of shortage. The most useful methods are highlighted in the overview table in the conclusions. Guiding principles for reuse are: Respirators which have been visibly contaminated (e.g. during procedure at intubated patients, such as suction cleaning of airways, taking probes, extubation attempts, etc.) or are damaged or not fitting, should be discarded and cannot be taken for re-use or decontamination procedures;Respirators may be protected by a medical face mask in order to prevent soiling;Use of new 'expired respirators' (manufacturers expiry date) is possible if they were properly stored until use. A quite feasible approach for reuse of respirators seems to be providing each healthcare worker with a set of minimum five respirators (potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination of the four respirators not in use will be inactivated after five days). Irrespective of which method of decontamination is applied, a fit-check prior to re-use is necessary. If the fit check is not passed, the respirator should be discarded. This document provides an overview of the evidence on the available methods for decontaminating respirators or filtering face pieces (FFP), in the event of shortages, used in healthcare settings providing care to possible, probable or confirmed COVID-19 patients.","output":"Options for the decontamination and reuse of respirators in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anxiety is common among youths in primary care. Face-to-face treatment has been the first choice for clinicians, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital psychological interventions have substantially increased. Few studies have examined young peoples interest in internet treatment or the attitudes they and their parents have toward it. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate adolescents and parents attitudes toward and experiences of internet-based cognitive behavioral anxiety treatment in primary care and its presumptive effects. METHODS: The study used mixed methods, analyzing qualitative data thematically and quantitative data with nonparametric analysis. Participants were 14 adolescents and 14 parents recruited in adolescent primary health care clinics. The adolescents and their parents filled out mental health questionnaires before and after treatment, and were interviewed during ongoing treatment. RESULTS: The quantitative data indicated that the internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program used in this study was successful in reducing symptoms ((2)(2)=8.333; P=.02) and that adolescents motivation is essential to the treatment outcome (r=0.58; P=.03). The qualitative results show that youths highly value their independence and freedom to organize treatment work on their own terms. The parents expressed uncertainty about their role and how to support their child in treatment. It was important for parents to respect the youths need for autonomy while also engaging with them in the treatment work. CONCLUSIONS: Internet treatment in primary care is accepted by both youths and their parents, who need clarification about the difference between their role and the therapists role. Patient motivation should be considered before treatment, and therapists need to continue to develop the virtual alliance. Finally, primary care should be clearer in informing adolescents and their parents about the possibility of internet treatment.","output":"Youths and Parents Experiences and Perceived Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Disorders in Primary Care: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Shikani optical stylet (SOS) versus fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) for awake nasal intubation in head and neck surgery patients with an anticipated difficult airway. STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized clinical trial. METHODS This study involved 50 adult patients scheduled for elective head and neck surgery and presented with an anticipated difficult airway. Patients planned for awake nasotracheal intubation were randomly divided into two groups: FOB (n = 25) and SOS (n = 25). Patients were intubated under local anesthesia and sedation using the randomly assigned intubation device by anesthetists proficient in both airway devices. The time to successful intubation was regarded as the primary endpoint. RESULTS The median time (interquartile range) to tracheal intubation in the FOB group was 74 seconds (57-108) and 38 seconds (27-60) in the SOS group (P < .001). Intubation success rates on the first attempt in the FOB and SOS groups were 96% and 92%, respectively (P > .999). Airway assisted maneuvers were required in six (24%) SOS intubations compared to 21 (84%) FOB intubations (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidences of oxygen desaturation and postoperative complications related to intubation. CONCLUSION Compared to the FOB group, awake nasal intubation in the SOS group required significantly less time and fewer airway-assisted maneuvers on adult head and neck surgery patients with anticipated difficult airway.

In this study, an anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody assay and an INF-release assay (IGRA) were used to detect humoral and cellular responses to the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine in three separate cohorts of COVID-19-na?ve patients: 108 healthcare workers (HCWs), 15 elderly people, and 5 autoimmune patients treated with immunosuppressive agents. After the second dose of vaccine, the mean values of anti-RBD antibodies (Abs) and INF were 123.33 U/mL (range 27.55C464) and 1513 mIU/mL (range 145C2500) in HCWs and 210.7 U/mL (range 3C500) and 1167 mIU/mL (range 83C2500) in elderly people. No correlations between age and immune status were observed. On the contrary, a weak but significant positive correlation was found between INF and anti-RBD Abs values (rho = 0.354, p = 0.003). As to the autoimmune cohort, anti-RBD Abs were not detected in the two patients with absent peripheral CD19(+)B cells, despite high INF levels being observed in all 5 patients after vaccination. Even though the clinical relevance of T cell response has not yet been established as a correlate of vaccine-induced protection, IGRA testing has showed optimal sensitivity and specificity to define vaccine responders, even in patients lacking a cognate antibody response to the vaccine.","output":"Assessment of humoral and cellular immunity induced by the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthcare workers, elderly people, and immunosuppressed patients with autoimmune disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Late 2019, the world witnessed a new devastating outbreak: coronavirus (COVID19) that attacks the human lungs and causes respiratory infections like pneumonia pathologies This disease is spreading rapidly in the globe, causing multiple damages, even on the healthcare sector, economic and social sectors In this article, we present a framework dedicated to epidemiologists for the investigation of the Patient 0 infected and establish the propagation path in different areas of the country A Content Based Medical Image Retrieval system is proposed based on the Stacked Auto-encoders for the recognition of the disease characteristics in medical images Our model search target COVID Chest X-Ray and CT images using similarity measurements learned through an image database of different pathologies as SARS and other viral or bacterial species of pneumonia diseases ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Content Based COVID-19 Chest X-Ray and CT Images Retrieval framework using Stacked Auto-Encoders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of robotics in the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario can change the face of the industries.

This has meant revisiting and reinventing existing technology-based educational processes and models. This study investigates whether teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) are confident that they have the requisite knowledge of how particular technologies are used for remote teaching, both during COVID-19 and as they look to the future. By adopting a mixed-method approach, this paper investigates teacher practices and perceptions regarding teaching online during Covid-19's emergency remote teaching. One hundred and twenty-nine participants were recruited through an online survey. All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 25. Data was based on ranking and non-parametric tests were used. Qualitative data from the open-ended question were analyzed using data-driven thematic analysis. Teachers reported significantly increased reliance on self-teaching, colleagues' knowledge, staff tutorials, and online school support. The gap between knowledge and usage of digital tools was found to be associated with the challenges facing EFL teachers with distance learning. Teachers who reported knowing more or roughly the same about the tools compared to their usage of them knew how to incorporate their knowledge into their practical teaching, took control over the management of their instruction, and had higher pupil engagement and motivation. However, teachers whose knowledge of digital tools was lower than their usage encountered technological difficulties that impaired their teaching. Some implications can be drawn from the study, such as the need for teacher education programs to improve teacher awareness of new pedagogical-technological learning methods, and the importance of providing opportunities to acquire digital competence and encourage teachers to adapt personally to new digital technologies within specific disciplinary contexts. Our findings have both theoretical and practical implications for pre- and in-service teacher training.","output":"English as a foreign language teachers perceptions regarding their pedagogical-technological knowledge and its implementation in distance learning during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 18 million people in 188 countries have been diagnosed as having coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and COVID-19 has been responsible for more than 600,000 deaths worldwide.

METHODS: Cake flour (aerosol model) was expelled from an advanced life support training mannequin. The primary outcome measure was the number of 0.3C10 m-sized particles at three locations corresponding to the physician, medical staff, and environmental aerosol exposure levels. The aerosol dispersion was visualized using a high-resolution video. The number of expelled particles was measured after artificial coughing during simulated tracheal intubation and extubation in four situations, with or without an aerosol box in a pressurized or depressurized room ( 2.5 Pa). RESULTS: The particles arising from tracheal intubation at the three positions in the four groups differed significantly in size (p < 0.05). The sizes of particles arising from extubation at the physicians and medical staffs faces in the four groups differed significantly in size (p < 0.05). Post hoc analysis showed that the counts of all particles at the three positions were significantly lower in the depressurized room with an aerosol box than in the pressurized room without an aerosol box during tracheal intubation (p < 0.05 at three positions) and extubation (p < 0.05) at the physicians and medical staffs positions). Visual assessments supported these results. CONCLUSION: The aerosol box decreased the exposure of the aerosol to the physician, medical staff, and environment during aerosol-generating procedures in the depressurized room only.

It has been shown for instance, that the measures to fight against the coronavirus may impact (at least for a while) greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the COVID-19 can serve as a prototypical example for climate change, demonstrating how global crises may become personally relevant and certain. Here, our aim was to investigate whether explicit reference to the COVID-19 crisis in communication messages on global climate change could enhance message effectiveness. Through two pre-registered studies (Ntotal = 651), we examined whether the use of factual elements stressing the certainty dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 1) or the use of arguments linking COVID-19 and climate change framed in terms of positive or negative outcomes (Study 2) could impact the effectiveness of climate messages. Results did not show that messages aiming to increase the certainty of the climate crisis by linking it to the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived message effectiveness. However, we have found that emotional framing influenced perceived message effectiveness, but not pro-environmental behaviour. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of the concepts of certainty, message framing and emotions on climate change communication.

Due to their properties, ISCs are not only vulnerable targets during intestinal damage, but also act as the resources responsible for repair and regeneration. Moreover, the intestinal tract is the largest immune organ in the body, with the greatest number of immune cells including, but not limited to, macrophages, innate lymphoid cells and T cells. With the advance of intestinal organoid culture systems and single-cell RNA sequencing, the effects of immune cells on ISCs have been initially explored. As a component of the stem cell niche, these activated immune cells and their corresponding cytokines directly modulate apoptosis or survival of ISCs, leading to either destruction or protection of the intestinal epithelium in immune-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and graft-versus-host disease. In this review, we describe the effects of various immune cells on ISCs, as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects.

METHODS Published articles in PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and Embase databases from January 2000 to April 2016 were queried. Inclusion criteria were any study that reported the prevalence of urethral strictures following external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), or both as a primary treatment for PCa. Forty-six articles met our inclusion criteria. A summary estimate of the proportion of patients who developed a urethral stricture was derived via a random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS In total, 16,129 PCa patients underwent either EBRT (5681, 35.2%), BT (5849, 36.3%), or both (4599, 28.5%). Overall, 630 strictures were diagnosed at follow-up with a pooled estimate period prevalence of 2.2% (95% confidence interval, CI 1.9-2.6%) in a median follow-up time of 4 years (interquartile range, IQR 2.7-5). Of which, the pooled estimate prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI 0.9-2%) post EBRT, 1.9% (95% CI 1.3-2.4%) post BT, and 4.9% (95% CI 3.8-6%) post both EBRT and BT. Of 20 studies reporting a median time to stricture formation, the overall median time was 2.2 years (IQR 1.8-2.5, range 1.4-9). In a meta-regression analysis, receiving both EBRT and BT increased the estimated difference in proportion of stricture diagnoses by 3% (95% CI 1-6%), p = 0.018 compared to EBRT alone. An increase in median follow-up time was found to significantly increase the risk of developing urethral strictures (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS With a short-term follow-up, urethral strictures occur in 2.2% of men with PCa receiving radiotherapy. Receiving both EBRT and BT increased the risk of stricture formation. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the long-term natural history of stricture formation after RT.","output":"Prostate cancer radiation and urethral strictures: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the eukaryotic cell, capping of mRNA 5 ends is an essential structural modification that allows efficient mRNA translation, directs pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export from the nucleus, limits mRNA degradation by cellular 5C3 exonucleases and allows recognition of foreign RNAs (including viral transcripts) as 'non-self'.

However, systematic studies for changes in sediment microbial community structure and greenhouse gasses (GHGs) production, as well as environmental parameters following bait input at time scale are still rare. A 90-day incubation experiment was conducted using sediment collected from coastal wetland in Qi'ao Island in southern China, followed by the observations of temporal variations of physicochemical properties, sediment microbial community, and GHGs production in response to different amounts of bait input (0, 20, and 40 mg bait g-1 wet sediment). The results showed that dissolved oxygen of overlying water was profoundly decreased owing to bait input, while dissolved organic carbon of overlying water and several sediment properties (e.g., organic matter, sulfide, and ammonium) varied in reverse patterns. Meanwhile, bait input led to significant loss of microbial community richness and diversity, and strongly altered microbial compositions from aerobic, slow-growing, and oligotrophic (Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteriota) to anaerobic, fast-growing, and copiotrophic (Firmicutes and Bacteroidota). Moreover, both GHGs production and global warming potential were significantly enhanced by bait input, implying that aquaculture ecosystem is an important hotspot for global GHGs emission. Overall, bait input triggered quick responses of physicochemical properties, sediment microbial community, and GHGs production, followed by long-term resilience of the ecosystem. This study could provide new insight into temporal interactive effects of bait input on physicochemical properties, microbial community, and GHGs production, which can enhance the understanding of the temporal dynamics and ecological impacts of coastal aquaculture activities and emphasize the necessity of sustainable assessment and management in aquaculture ecosystems.","output":"Bait input altered microbial community structure and increased greenhouse gases production in coastal wetland sediment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] DNA nanotechnology, and DNA computing in particular, has grown extensively over the past decade to end with a variety of functional stable structures and dynamic circuits.

The Ministry of Public Health recommended that healthcare workers received a third dose of AZD1222 to increase level of protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, immune response after the third vaccination with AZD1222 are limited. In this study, sera from those who received a booster of AZD1222 in June-July 2021 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG, anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and anti-spike protein 1 (S1) IgA. The neutralizing activities in a subset of serum samples were tested against the wild type and variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.617.2, and B.1.351) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based surrogate virus neutralization test.

Shock-responsive social protection measures included increased benefits to existing beneficiaries (vertical expansion) and registration of new beneficiaries on existing programmes (horizontal expansion). These approaches had the advantages of being quick and administratively simple, but the disadvantage of bypassing people who were made most vulnerable by COVID-19, notably retrenched and informal workers with no access to social insurance. On the other hand, setting up new humanitarian relief or temporary social assistance programmes was slow and susceptible to targeting errors and corruption.

Patients with Primary Antibody Deficiencies (PAD) represent a potential at-risk group in the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, unexpectedly low cumulative incidence, low infection-fatality rate, and mild COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were frequently reported in PAD. The discrepancy between clinical evidence and impaired antibody production requires in-depth studies on patients immune responses. Methods. Forty-one patients with Common Variable Immune Deficiencies (CVID), 6 patients with X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and 28 healthy age-matched controls (HD) were analyzed for anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibody production, generation of low and high affinity Spike-specific memory B-cells, Spike-specific T-cells before and one week after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Results. HD produced antibodies, and generated memory B-cells with high affinity for Trimeric Spike. In CVID, the vaccine induced poor Spike-specific antibodies, and atypical B-cells with low affinity for Trimeric Spike, possibly by extra-follicular reactions or incomplete germinal center reactions. In HD, among Spike positive memory B-cells, we identified receptor-binding-domain-specific cells that were undetectable in CVID, indicating the incapability to generate this new specificity. Specific T-cell responses toward Spike-protein were evident in HD and defective in CVID. Due to the absence of B-cells, patients with XLA responded to immunization by specific T-cell responses only. Conclusions. We present detailed data on early non-canonical immune responses in PAD to a vaccine against an antigen never encountered before by humans. From our data, we expect that after BNT162b2 immunization, XLA patients might be protected by specific T-cells, while CVID patients might not be protected by immunization.

In this paper, we develop a model that tries to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions. Since the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth rates.","output":"Modeling ambient temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their role in Covid-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In the wake of both the unprecedented nationwide ban on elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemicand the increased mortality of otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons during this same time period, concern regarding thetiming and safety of neurosurgical intervention for sellar-based pathology has been raised within both the neurosurgical andotolaryngology communities. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent operative intervention for sellar-basedpathology from March 12 to July 1 for both 2019 and 2020. Dates were chosen to align with the Virginia State ofEmergency on March 12 and the multiphase reopening of the public which lasted until July 1. Primary endpoints studied forcomparison included case volume, median time to surgery, and COVID-related mortality. Results: In total, a 26.6% decrease in overall surgical case volume occurred in comparison to the previous year. Astatistically significant decrease in frequency of endonasal surgery was seen from 20 in 2019 to 6 in 2020 ( p = 0.04). Whilemedian time to surgery for pituitary adenomas was unchanged from the previous year (26 days), this data does not takeinto account six patients who electively postponed treatment due to fear of receiving medical care during the pandemic.Among 2,795 COVID-19 patients treated in our institution, only one patient had a pituitary tumor. Here, treatment wasdelayed by 81 days. For emergent cases, such as pituitary apoplexy, surgeons increased utilization of the microscope as ameans to reduce the number of personnel exposed. Finally, our practice had no COVID-related mortality for patientsundergoing sellar-based surgery. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic did not delay time to treatment for emergent presentations of vision loss or pituitaryapoplexy. In these instances, our department followed strict institutional policy regarding use of proper PPE, as well asminimization of hospital personnel exposure. On an outpatient basis, the pandemic did cause a noticeable delay in time totreatment;however, patients' outcomes were unaffected. Close patient monitoring was achieved via utilization oftelemedicine to trend hormone levels and assess development of related symptoms. Finally, decreases in overall casevolume are likely due to ongoing cultural avoidance of seeking medical care, while deferment of endonasal surgery may beattributed to a concern for greater mortality for endonasal procedures.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic significant effect on transsphenoidal pituitary resection surgery (TSPR) at inova health system: An institutional experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is a third\\\\generation sequencing technology that is gaining popularity in ecological research for its portable and low\\\\cost sequencing possibilities.

High-volume image-guided injection (HVIGI) proposes to strip away associated neovascularity, disrupt painful nerve ingrowth, and facilitate rehabilitation. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of HVIGI with and without steroid relative to placebo. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 62 participants were recruited between May 25, 2016, and March 5, 2020. Participants were men aged 18 to 55 years with Achilles or patellar tendinopathy of at least 6-month chronicity that had not improved with nonoperative management (including physical therapy and shockwave therapy), with ultrasound evidence of neovascularization, tendon thickening, and echogenic changes. They were assigned to the following groups: control (3 mL of subcutaneous 0.5% bupivacaine), HVIGI (10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and 30 mL of normal saline, ultrasound-guided between tendon and underlying fat pad), or HVIGI with steroid (HVIGIwSteroid; 0.25 mL of 100 mg/mL hydrocortisone). Clinicians and assessors were blinded. All participants were supervised through a pain-guided progressive loading program for 6 months postinjection. The main outcome measures were the Victoria Institute of Sport Assessments (VISA) for Achilles and patellar tendinopathy and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain at 6 months postinjection. RESULTS: The VISA score improved by a mean of 22.8 points (95% CI, 10.4-35.3 points; effect size [ES], 1.51) in the control group (n = 21), 18.6 points (95% CI, 9.1-28.0 points; ES, 1.31) in the HVIGI group (n = 21), and 18.5 points (95% CI, 3.4-33.6 points; ES, 0.88) in the HVIGIwSteroid group (n = 20). VAS pain improved by a mean of 15 points (interquartile range [IQR], C38.75, 8 points; ES, 0.39) in controls, 13 points (IQR,C34.0, 3.75 points; ES, 0.47) in the HVIGI group, and 27 points (IQR,C38.0, C1.0 points; ES, 0.54) in the HVIGIwSteroid group.

Overall, forecasts for 2020 were made with cautious optimism given the global slowdown in 2019. While at this, the Chinese city of Wuhan was being ravaged by a deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 disease. The disease described by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic has dealt a severe blow on the health system and economic activities on a global scale. Substantial uncertainties surround the appreciation of the precise nature of the health challenge, its spread over time and other aspects all of which further complicate the deployment of appropriate measures in clinical interventions as well as dampen the effectiveness of broader macroeconomic policies especially for the developing countries with their multifarious structural weaknesses. This paper explored the nature of the COVID-19 both in terms of the shape of its growth curve and then estimated the basic reproduction number on the one hand, while also providing forecast of the path of the pandemic, particularly the number of infections for Nigeria. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Wallinga and Teunis (2004) modelling techniques were used on data from Nigeria. As at April 28, 2020, the COVID-19 curve for Nigeria was upward sloping in nature with the steepness becoming marked from around 30 March 2020. This was about the same period that government ordered the lockdown of the epicentres of the pandemic. Also, the basic reproduction number was both time variant and relatively high for the national (2.25) and subnational [Lagos (3.44) and Abuja (2.77)] cases. The projections from the two standard models suggested that the incidence of infections may just begin to taper off by the end of the second quarter before stabilising at about the third quarter of 2020. This is suggestive of huge trade-offs with respect to losses in potential GDP and thereby of the need for government and other stakeholders to come up with proactive steps to mitigate the severity and reduce the duration of the imminent economic recession that will culminate.","output":"Empirical Modelling of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Nigeria: Forecasts and Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen A [HLA-A], -B, and -C genes) may affect susceptibility to and severity of the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA-A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explored the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was successfully sampled and was represented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (M. Lin, H.-T. Tseng, J. A. Trejaut, H.-L. Lee, et al., BMC Med Genet 4:9, 2003, https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity. Finally, we reported global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of severity of viral disease in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.","output":"Human Leukocyte Antigen Susceptibility Map for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penyakit COVID-19 diawali dengan munculnya kasus pneumonia yang tidak diketahui etiologinya di Wuhan China.

The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020 when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020.During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at 9 different hospitals. As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital. Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.","output":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Treatment of Severe Pulmonary and Cardiac Compromise in COVID-19: Experience with 32 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted education and forced the whole education system to shift to online learning.

Here, we overexpressed PEDF in placenta-derived MSCs (PD-MSCsPEDF, PEDF+) using a nonviral gene delivery system and evaluated the characteristics of PD-MSCsPEDF and their potential regenerative effects on RPE cells damaged by H2O2-induced OS. PD-MSCsPEDF maintained their stemness, cell surface marker, and differentiation potential characteristics. Compared to naive cells, PD-MSCsPEDF promoted mitochondrial respiration by enhancing biogenesis regulators (e.g., NRF1, PPARGC1A, and TFAM) as well as antioxidant enzymes (e.g., HMOXs, SODs, and GPX1). Compared to OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with naive cells, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF showed PEDF upregulation and VEGF downregulation. The expression levels of antioxidant genes and RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, RGR, and RRH, were significantly increased in RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF. Furthermore, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF had dramatically enhanced mitochondrial functions, and antiapoptotic effects improved due to cell survival signaling pathways. In the H2O2-induced retinal degeneration rat model, compared to administration of the naive counterpart, intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF alleviated proinflammatory cytokines and restored retinal structure and function by increasing PEDF expression and decreasing VEGF expression. Intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF also protected retinal degeneration against OS by increasing antioxidant gene expression and regulating the mitochondrial ROS levels and biogenesis. Taken together, PEDF overexpression in PD-MSCs improved the mitochondrial activities and induced OS-damaged RPE cell regeneration by regulating the oxidative status and mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

The achieved result showed that the circular cross-section is the most efficient shape for the microchannel heat sink, which has a maximum heat transfer enhancement of 25% compared to the square shape at the Reynolds number of 1150. In the next phase of the study, the circular cross-section microchannel is located below the PCR device to evaluate the cooling rate of the PCR. Also, the results demonstrate that it takes 16.5 s to cool saliva samples in the PCR well, which saves up to 157.5 s for the whole amplification procedure compared to the conventional air fans. Another advantage of using the microchannel heat sink is that it takes up a little space compared to other common cooling methods.","output":"Effect of liquid cooling on PCR performance with the parametric study of cross-section shapes of microchannels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2007, a novel coronavirus associated with an acute respiratory disease in alpacas (Alpaca Coronavirus, ACoV) was isolated.

Atherosclerotic changes, the primary pathological substrate for CVD, are closely related to hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia is a key therapeutic strategy for CVD management. Statins, as the gold standard in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have shown enhanced cardiac outcomes in many randomized clinical trials. However, often despite the maximum allowed and tolerated dosage of statins, we are not able to reach the target cholesterol levels, and thus patients persist at an increased cardiovascular risk. Recently, most of the large clinical studies in the field of preventive cardiology have focused on proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its activity regulation. PCSK9 plays an essential role in the metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor recirculation to the cell surface. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of PCSK9 by the administration of monoclonal antibodies is capable of significantly reducing LDL levels (up to an additional 60%) as well as reducing the incidence of CVD. However, this treatment procedure of administering the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, most frequently two times a month, has its limitations in terms of time, patient adherence, and nevertheless cost. Administration of active vaccination instead of passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies may be an effective way of controlling blood cholesterol levels. However, clinical data, as well as human testing, are still inadequate. This work aims to provide an overview of PCSK9 vaccines and their potential clinical benefit.","output":"Vaccines Targeting PSCK9 for the Treatment of Hyperlipidemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Studies from the first pandemic wave found associations between COVID-19 hospital load and mortality. Here, we aimed to study if mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with the COVID-19 admission rate during a full year of the pandemic in Sweden. METHOD: Observational review of all patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Sweden between March 2020 and February 2021 (n = 42,017). Primary outcome was 60-day all-cause mortality related to number of COVID-19 hospital admissions per month/100,000 inhabitants. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk for death by month of admission, adjusting for pre-existing factors. RESULTS: The overall mortality was 17.4%. Excluding March 2020, mortality was clearly correlated to the number of COVID-19 admissions per month (coefficient of correlation =.96; p<.0001). After adjustment for pre-existing factors, the correlation remained significant (=.75, p=.02). Patients admitted in December (high admission rate and high mortality) had more comorbidities and longer hospital stays, and patients treated in intensive care units (ICU) had longer pre-ICU hospital stays and worse respiratory status on ICU admission than those admitted in July to September (low admission rate and low mortality). CONCLUSION: Mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was clearly associated with the COVID-19 admission rate. Admission of healthier patients between pandemic waves and delayed ICU care during wave peaks could contribute to this pattern. The study supports measures to flatten-the-curve to reduce the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.","output":"Mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with the COVID-19 admission rate during the first year of the pandemic in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the valuation of EQ-5D-Y-3L, adult respondents are asked to complete composite time trade-off (cTTO) tasks for a 10-year-old child. Earlier work has shown that cTTO utilities elicited in such a child perspective are generally higher than when adults take their own perspective. We explore how differences in time preference in child and adult perspectives could explain this effect. Furthermore, as cTTO valuation in a child perspective involves explicit consideration of immediate death for a child, we also consider how cTTO utilities could be affected by decision-makers lexicographically avoiding death in children. We report the results of an experiment in which 219 respondents valued 5 health states in both adult and child perspectives with either a standard cTTO or a lead-time TTO only approach, in which immediate death is less focal. Time preferences were measured in both perspectives. Our results suggest that utilities were lower when lead-time TTO, rather than cTTO, was used. We find large heterogeneity in time preference in both perspectives, with predominantly negative time preference. The influence of time preferences on utilities, however, was small, and correcting for time preferences did not reduce differences between utilities elicited in both perspectives. Surprisingly, we found more evidence for differences in utilities between adult and child perspectives when lead-time TTO was used. Overall, these results suggest that time and lexicographic preferences affect time trade-off valuation in child and adult perspectives, but are not the explanation for differences between these perspectives.

The best way to treat the condition is unclear. OBJECTIVES We assessed evidence in three areas of equipoise. 1. Induction. To compare efficacy and safety of initial therapy with liposomal amphotericin B versus initial therapy with alternative antifungals. 2. Maintenance. To compare efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with 12 months of oral antifungal treatment with shorter durations of maintenance therapy. 3. Antiretroviral therapy (ART). To compare the outcomes of early initiation versus delayed initiation of ART. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane CENTRAL; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three in the Web of Science); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry, all up to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We evaluated studies assessing the use of liposomal amphotericin B and alternative antifungals for induction therapy; studies assessing the duration of antifungals for maintenance therapy; and studies assessing the timing of ART. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), single-arm trials, prospective cohort studies, and single-arm cohort studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors assessed eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed certainty of evidence. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias in randomized studies, and ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias in non-randomized studies. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS We identified 17 individual studies. We judged eight studies to be at critical risk of bias, and removed these from the analysis. 1. Induction We found one RCT which compared liposomal amphotericin B to deoxycholate amphotericin B. Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B may have higher clinical success rates (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; 1 study, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B has lower rates of nephrotoxicity (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 study, 77 participants; high-certainty evidence). We found very low-certainty evidence to inform comparisons between amphotericin B formulations and azoles for induction therapy. 2. Maintenance We found no eligible study that compared less than 12 months of oral antifungal treatment to 12 months or greater for maintenance therapy. For both induction and maintenance, fluconazole performed poorly in comparison to other azoles. 3. ART We found one study, in which one out of seven participants in the 'early' arm and none of the three participants in the 'late' arm died. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Liposomal amphotericin B appears to be a better choice compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B for treating PDH in people with HIV; and fluconazole performed poorly compared to other azoles. Other treatment choices for induction, maintenance, and when to start ART have no evidence, or very low certainty evidence.

Words such as quarantine, ?the practice of separating individuals who have had contact with someone with COVID,? and social distancing, the ?practice of increasing the space between individuals to reduce the risk of spreading a disease,? have become normal in conversation. With 440,000 deaths in the US, cases continue to impact the global economy. Quarantining and social distancing may be the only way to prevent spread even with vaccine distribution. Included in the closures are medical schools. With one percent of Americans employed as physicians, the country entrusts few to maintain health for millions. In a profession with personal contact, the lack of in-person training may hinder the ability of physicians to achieve this goal. The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine current physicians-in-training, and their ability to diagnose and treat pathology while adapting to the distanced education due to COVID-19. Second-year students from two medical schools were surveyed with a questionnaire comprised of eight areas of suggestion to: assess confidence in pathology recognition on licensure examinations, confidence in pathology recognition in clinical settings, and the impact of COVID-19 on clinical competency skills. Results It was found that thirteen percent of students found online lectures to be very effective, with fifty-eight percent of students claiming moderate effective. Twenty-three percent of students share improved exam performance with online school, and seventy-seven percent of students had no change. Nearly ninety-two percent of students supplement coursework with other resources. Twenty-three percent of students feel very confident in their ability to recognize pathology on boards. Zero percent of students feel very confident in recognition in clinical settings. Over fifty percent of students feel their clinical competency skills have worsened. Students do not feel confident in their ability to care for a patient. Students do, however, feel confident for exams. Online education has shown to be effective in teaching nurses, and the same applies to medical school. With 70% of responses showing online lectures are effective, the conclusion is pathology can be taught without traditional means. Suggestions include condensation of material even further, proving students do not have issue with an online format. Total replacement for in-class learning does not seem applicable. While students have confidence in exam skills, confidence disappears when in a clinical setting. There is a difference between answering a clinical vignette and solving the presentation of a vignette in the clinic. More than 50% of students do not feel prepared clinically, showing that the online medical education is inadequate for teaching the basics of clinical duties, such as history and physical exam. With all of the current cohort lacking in-person training, those who do not feel prepared clinically may rise. Research has shown that COVID-19 may be the start of a change in medicine with advancements of telehealth;however, this is from the perspective of educators. The student shows low confidence for patient care due to the pandemic.

Effective communication of measures by credible sources throughout the epidemic is one of the crucial factors for the containment of the disease, and the official communication about pandemics is straightforwardly directed toward changes in behavior via engagement in (self-)protective measures. Calls for the adherence to these measures are aimed at the general population, but people's reactions to these calls vary depending on, for example, their individual differences in cognitive and emotional responses to the situation. The focus of our study was the general narrative about the epidemic as conveyed by both state officials and media outlets in times of decreased social contacts due to the quarantine, in which relying on these sources of information is even more pivotal. Our aim was to explore the stability of the proposed mediational model during the course of the epidemic in Serbia. In the model, we tested the relationship between perceived credibility of information (PCI) and two types of protective behaviorthe actual self-protective behavior (ASPB) and the hypothetical protective behavior (HPB), as well as the potential mediating role of alertness in these relationships time-wise. A cross-sectional study (N = 10,782, female = 79.1%) was being administered daily during the first epidemic wave and in three more 2-week time frames during the second wave. Based on the variability of these measures during the first epidemic wave, three stages of psychological responses were mapped (acute, adaptation, and relaxation stage), which were observed, with some deviations, also in the second wave. The mediational model was relatively robust after the initial few weeks, but the strength of pairwise relationships was more changeable. With both types of protective behaviors, the predictive power of PCI was partially mediated through alertness. This suggests that, while individual differences in cognitive and affective responses are important, so is coherent, focused, and credible communication in all stages of the epidemic, which emphasizes the communality aspect of the social containment of the infection. Our findings can thus be valuable in informing the planning of effective future communication.","output":"One Hundred and Sixty-One Days in the Life of the Homopandemicus in Serbia: The Contribution of Information Credibility and Alertness in Predicting Engagement in Protective Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Circulating CCR9+ IL-17+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and intestinal barrier biomarkers, such as trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and Zonulin, are associated with gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases. So far, it is still difficult for clinicians to predict early necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: This study included 13 patients with stage I NEC-like presentation (early NEC), 24 patients with one stage of II or III NEC (confirmed NEC), and 80 non-NEC and nonsepsis preterm infants (control group). Another 16 patients experienced at least two stages. We used flow cytometry to measure the frequency of CCR9+ IL-17+ Treg cells and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure TFF3, I-FABP, and Zonulin levels in the peripheral blood. RESULTS: The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were comparable. Compared with controls, CCR9+ IL-17+ Treg cells were markedly increased in early NEC and slightly increased in confirmed NEC; in contrast, plasma TFF3, I-FABP, and Zonulin concentrations were notably elevated in confirmed NEC and slightly elevated or not elevated in early NEC. Moreover, for patients who experienced at least two stages, dynamic monitoring of the above indicators also verified this.

Here we assess these genetic alterations for the first time in a cohort from North of Morocco. METHODS Thirty-three patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years were recruited irrespective of breast and/or ovarian cancer family history. Coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA using Ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific) next generation sequencing platform. RESULTS Overall, five BRCA germline mutations were identified (15.1%). The frequency of mutations among patients with family history of breast cancer was 16.7%. Three mutations were found in BRCA1 (9%) and two within the BRCA2 gene (6%). These are three frameshift mutations (c.798_799del, c.2125_2126insA, c.5116_5119delAATA), one missense (c.116G > A) and one nonsense mutation (c.289G > T). The mutation c.5116_5119delAATA has a founder effect in North Africa. Moreover, one variant of unknown significance was identified in BRCA2 (c.4090A > G). Most BRCA mutations carriers (80%) had no family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSION Our data do not support the hypothesis that BRCA mutations alone explain the higher frequency of breast cancer in Moroccan young women.

Objectives: This shift gave our Department of Psychiatry a chance to better understand key challenges and opportunities vis--vis virtual mental healthcare. We aimed to obtain provider feedback on the use of telepsychiatry and to learn from the provider perspective about patient experiences with video visits. This information will be used to inform the telemedicine strategy at a systems level within our psychiatry department, our academic health system, as well as the field of telemedicine as a whole. Design and Sample: A 22-item online questionnaire comprising 16 quantitative and six qualitative items was distributed to providers currently using video visits to provide care. Results: A total of 89 mental health providers completed the questionnaire. Outcomes demonstrated that while providers perceive challenges associated with virtual care (e.g., fatigue, technology-related issues, and age-related concerns), they also recognize a number of benefits to themselves and their patients (e.g., convenience and increased access). Overall, provider satisfaction, comfort, and willingness to use telepsychiatry was high. Conclusions: The vast majority of providers adapted quickly to the use of virtual platforms; many endorse advantages that suggest virtual care will continue to be a modality they provide in the future, post-COVID-19.

It has been shown to affect the central nervous system and produce varied neurological symptoms, including ischemic strokes, seizures, and encephalitis. Neurological manifestations of this viral infection are thought to be due to neurotropic reactions on the central nervous system or post-infectious immune-mediated damage. This report presents a case of bilateral tremor of the upper limbs more than 6 weeks after a diagnosis of COVID-19, with confirmed volumetric brain loss shown by follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with 3-dimensional volumetric NeuroQuant image analysis. CASE REPORT We report a case of new-onset tremors in a 62-year-old man after SARS-CoV-2 infection. MRI of the brain was performed shortly after the onset of tremors, and a follow-up MRI after 2 months showed evidence of rapid parenchymal volume, loss of midbrain substance, and increased cerebrospinal fluid volume within 2 months of the initial examination.

Some studies have cited statistically significant associations between adolescent social media use and depression and have proposed that parents must regulate their adolescents' social media use in order to protect their mental health. METHOD In order to rigorously assess the size of the effect that has been reported in the current scientific literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured the association between social media use specifically and depressive symptoms amongst early- to mid- adolescents (11-18 years-old). We searched Psychnet, PubMed, and Web of Science with the following terms: online social networks, social media, internet usage, facebook, twitter, instagram, myspace, snapchat, and depression. RESULTS We found a small but significant positive correlation (k=12 studies, r=.11, p<.01) between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms. There was also high heterogeneity (I2=95.22%) indicating substantial variation among studies. CONCLUSIONS High heterogeneity along with the small overall effect size observed in the relationship between self-reported social media use and depressive symptoms suggests that other factors are likely to act as significant moderators of the relationship. We suggest that future research should be focused on understanding which types of use may be harmful (or helpful) to mental health, rather than focusing on overall use measures that likely reflect highly heterogeneous exposures.","output":"A meta-analysis of the association between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) was introduced into bariatric surgery by Sanchez-Pernaute et al. as an advancement of the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized contemporary studies that report the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) to treat COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY: Six electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched from their beginning to May 15, 2020 with the following search terms: traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, COVID-19, new coronavirus pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2, and randomized controlled trial. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from peer-reviewed journals and non-reviewed publications were included. Further, included RCTs had a control group that was given standard care (SC; such as conventional Western medicine treatments or routine medical care), and a treatment group that was given SC plus CHM. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two evaluators screened and collected literature independently; information on participants, study design, interventions, follow-up and adverse events were extracted, and risk of bias was assessed. The primary outcomes included scores that represented changes in symptoms and signs over the course of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the level of inflammatory markers, improvement of pneumonia confirmed by computed tomography (CT), and adverse events. Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratio or hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI); where time-to-event analysis was used, outcomes were expressed as odds ratio with 95% CI. Continuous data were expressed as difference in means (MD) with 95% CI, and standardized mean difference (SMD) was used when different outcome scales were pooled. RESULTS: Seven original studies, comprising a total of 732 adults, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to SC alone, CHM plus SC had a superior effect on the change of symptom and sign score (?1.30 by SMD, 95% CI [?2.43, ?0.16]; 3 studies; n = 261, P = 0.03), on inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L; ?11.82 by MD, 95% CI [?17.95, ?5.69]; 5 studies; n = 325, P = 0.0002), on number of patients with improved lung CT scans (1.34 by risk ratio, 95% CI [1.19, 1.51]; 4 studies; n = 489, P < 0.00001).

While APOBEC3A-induced mutations are common, APOBEC3A expression is rarely detected in cancer cells. This discrepancy suggests a tightly controlled process to regulate episodic APOBEC3A expression in tumors. In this study, we find that both viral infection and genotoxic stress transiently up-regulate APOBEC3A and pro-inflammatory genes using two distinct mechanisms. First, we demonstrate that STAT2 promotes APOBEC3A expression in response to foreign nucleic acid via a RIG-I, MAVS, IRF3, and IFN-mediated signaling pathway. Second, we show that DNA damage and DNA replication stress trigger a NF-B (p65/IkB)-dependent response to induce expression of APOBEC3A and other innate immune genes, independently of DNA or RNA sensing pattern recognition receptors and the IFN-signaling response. These results not only reveal the mechanisms by which tumors could episodically up-regulate APOBEC3A but also highlight an alternative route to stimulate the immune response after DNA damage independently of cGAS/STING or RIG-I/MAVS.","output":"Genotoxic stress and viral infection induce transient expression of APOBEC3A and pro-inflammatory genes through two distinct pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Errors in lethal force by police are met with significant demand for explanations as to why they occur, stimulating a growing body of multidisciplinary research. Acutely stressful occupational conditions result in decrements to police performance, including lethal force decision-making. Further, although it is known that repeated and prolonged exposure to potentially traumatic work-related encounters is linked to higher rates of mental health symptoms, it is unclear if psychological symptoms are related to police performance, and lethal force errors specifically. The present study tested the relationships between biological stress and psychological symptoms on lethal force errors among a combined sample of non-clinical, active-duty frontline (n = 57) and tactical (n = 44) police officers. Specifically, biological measures included: diurnal (cortisol awakening response - CAR), and reactive cortisol (prior to and in response to realistic critical incident (CI) simulations). Psychological self-reported symptoms included: pre-CI stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and occupational stress. Tactical officers displayed higher CAR compared to frontline officers, consistent with prior research. When including outliers, CAR significantly predicted lethal force decision-making errors; however, the effect does not remain once removing the influence of outlier CAR observations. The current findings suggest that biological measures of reactive cortisol may be too nonspecific to predict lethal force errors during acutely stressful police operations and measures of diurnal cortisol are heavily influenced by outlier values. Non-clinical levels of psychological symptoms (as measured in this study) do not appear to interfere with lethal force decision-making. It remains to be tested if clinically diagnosed disorders would interfere with police performance.

Presently, COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide biohazard, and a nosocomial outbreak can occur in any hospital at any time. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding hospital preparedness, the initial management of COVID-19, and the surveillance of healthcare workers (HCWs) to find information that would be generally useful for physicians when confronted with COVID-19. In terms of hospital preparedness, each hospital should develop an incident management system and establish a designated multidisciplinary medical team. To initiate case management, COVID-19 should be suspected based on patient symptoms and/or high-risk history and then should be confirmed by viral testing, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Although some patients will become critically ill, the guidelines for respiratory failure and septic shock for non-COVID-19 cases can be followed for supportive treatment. Antiviral medications should be carefully selected because the available information is confused by the large volume of preprint literature and unreliable data. HCWs who have come into contact with patients with COVID-19 can generate new in-hospital clusters of COVID-19 cases. Quarantine following contact tracking with risk stratification is effective in preventing transmission, and the essentials of medical surveillance include monitoring different types of symptoms, delegation of supervision, and continuation of surveillance regardless of the RT-PCR results.

However, the mechanism of interaction between endothelium and haemostasis in COVID-19 remains unclear. PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between each link of clot formation process (endothelial function, plasma coagulation, platelet aggregation) with the severity of the disease. METHODS: 58 COVID-19 patients were included in our study. Patients were divided into moderate (n=39) and severe (n=18) subgroups. All patients underwent a flow-mediated dilation (FMD) test, impedance aggregation, rotational thromboelastometry, thrombodynamics and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF: Ag) quantification. All measurements were repeated on days 3 (point 2) and 9 (point 3) of hospitalization. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients demonstrated the enhanced plasma coagulation (clotting time, s 613,0 [480; 820], clot growth rate, m/min 32,75 [29,3; 38,7]). At point 1 no significant difference in parameters of plasma coagulation between patients' subgroups was noted.

There were no significant differences in the FMD-test results between the patient subgroups. FMD-test results were predominantly within the reference ranges (7,1 [4,0; 8,8]). Patients in the severe subgroup had significantly higher levels of vWF: Ag (228,0 [205,3; 240,7] vs 232,0 [226,0; 423,0], p=0,03).

No specific vaccines or drugs have been approved to treat FIP. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s) play a pivotal role in viral transcription and replication, making them an ideal target for drug development. Here, we report the crystal structure of FIPV M(pro) in complex with dual inhibitors, a zinc ion and a Michael acceptor. The complex structure elaborates a unique mechanism of two distinct inhibitors synergizing to inactivate the protease, providing a structural basis to design novel antivirals and suggesting the potential to take advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against CoV-associated diseases.

The relevance of the above tasks is determined by the need for the full use of medical data in the analysis of large repositories of information of medical organizations and the provision of verified multidimensional assessments of biomedical systems to doctors from a large range of patient health indicators. A statistical method has been applied to verify the correctness of imputation data sets using discriminant analysis procedures. Further, the imputed data set was processed to obtain a symmetric correlation matrix optimized in a certain way and the accompanying logarithms of criterion functions that are individual system assessments of the condition of each patient in different groups of patients at a certain point in the study. After that, to identify differences in the logarithms of the criterion functions of the acid-base state parameters between groups of patients with different outcomes, the authors used the method of calculating multidimensional Hotelling T2 statistics. The correctness of the application of discriminant analysis procedures to verify the imputation of data sets is shown. Differences in the logarithms of the criteria functions of the acid-base state indicators between venous and arterial blood by patient outcome groups were revealed. Significant differences in the parameters of acid-base state based on the multidimensional statistics of T2 Hotelling between groups of patients with different outcomes were revealed. It is found that data imputation significantly increases the volume and representativeness of the sample under study. It is demonstrated that the substituted data make it possible to carry out a systematic statistical assessment of the totality of body parameters based on the calculation of the logarithms of the criterion functions of the acid-base state. Such logarithms make it possible to reliably distinguish patients in different groups of patients by outcomes in three groups: discharged, deceased, transferred to another medical institution. 100 % differences of biochemical parameters according to the multivariate T2 Hotelling statistics between these three groups of patients with COVID-19 are shown. The results of the study can be applied in the development of information systems of individual medical biochemical and hematological devices and analyzers and corresponding artificial intelligence systems in the future. ?

While the magnitude of tissue neutrophil accumulation in innate immune responses is profoundly greater in males than females, fundamental aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. METHODS: We investigated sex differences in neutrophil stimulation and recruitment in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; mesenteric or renal) or carrageenan pleurisy in rats or mice, as well as skin injury in human volunteers. The induction of potent chemoattractive mediators (chemokines) and neutrophil adhesion molecules were measured by real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and protein assays. RESULTS: Mesenteric I/R in age-matched Wistar rats resulted in substantially more neutrophil accumulation and tissue injury at 2 h reperfusion in males than females. Using intravital microscopy, we show that the immediate (<30 min) neutrophil response to I/R is similar in males and females but that prolonged neutrophil recruitment occurs in males at sites local and distal to inflammatory insult partly due to an increase in circulating neutrophil populations with elevated surface expression of adhesion molecules. Sex differences in neutrophil kinetics were correlated with sustained induction of chemokine Cxcl5 in the tissue, circulation, and bone marrow of males but not females. Furthermore, blockade of Cxcl5 in males prior to ischemia resulted in neutrophil responses that were similar in magnitude to those in females. Conversely, administration of Cxcl5 to males in the absence of I/R was sufficient to increase levels of systemic neutrophils. Cxcl5 treatment of bone marrow neutrophils in vitro caused substantial induction of neutrophil-mobilizing cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and expression of 2 integrin that accounts for sexual dimorphism in circulating neutrophil populations in I/R. Moreover, male Cxcl5-stimulated bone marrow neutrophils had an increased capacity to adhere to 2 integrin ligand ICAM-1, implicating a greater sensitivity of male leukocytes to Cxcl5-mediated activation. Differential induction of Cxcl5 (human CXCL6) between the sexes was also evident in murine renal I/R, rat pleurisy, and human skin blisters and correlated with the magnitude of neutrophil accumulation in tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that sex-specific induction of chemokine Cxcl5/CXCL6 contributes to sexual dimorphism in neutrophil recruitment in diverse acute inflammatory responses partly due to increased stimulation and trafficking of bone marrow neutrophils in males.

As of January 2022 WHO statistics shows more than 5.6 million death and about 350 million infection by SARS-CoV-2. One of the life threatening aspects of COVID-19 is secondary infections and reduced efficacy of antibiotics against them. Since the beginning of COVID-19 many researches have been done on identification, treatment, and vaccine development. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) could offer novel approaches to detect, treat and control COVID-19. Phage therapy and in particular using phage cocktails can be used to control or eliminate the bacterial pathogen as an alternative or complementary therapeutic agent. At the same time, phage interaction with the host immune system can regulate the inflammatory response. In addition, phage display and engineered synthetic phages can be utilized to develop new vaccines and antibodies, stimulate the immune system, and elicit a rapid and well-appropriate defense response. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 new variants like delta and omicron has proved the urgent need for precise, efficient and novel approaches for vaccine development and virus detection techniques in which bacteriophages may be one of the plausible solutions. Therefore, phages with similar morphology and/or genetic content to that of coronaviruses can be used for ecological and epidemiological modeling of SARS-CoV-2 behavior and future generations of coronavirus, and in general new viral pathogens.

METHODS This retrospective cohort study investigated the clinical characteristics, treatment methods, and outcome of COVID-19 patients aged 18 years and older who were hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, from February 20th, 2020 to June 20th, 2020. RESULTS Out of the total 367 patients with COVID-19, 104 (28%) patients were diagnosed with AKI at the time of admission or during hospitalization, 86 (23%) and 18 (5%) patients were diagnosed with the AKI on admission (early AKI) and after the first 24 h (late AKI), respectively. Concerning the AKI stages, 20 (19%) and 18 (17%) patients were in stages 2 and 3, and the cause of AKI in 52 (50%) patients was renal. Moreover, out of all patients with AKI, 25 (24%) and 29 (28%) patients had transient (Kidney function improvement within 48 h) and persistent AKI (kidney function improvement between 48 h to 7 days). Furthermore, 32 (31%) patients developed acute kidney damage (AKD) (no improvement in AKI after 7 days). The survival rate of AKI patients was lower in higher stages of AKI, and in cases that the reason for kidney dysfunction was renal or unknown. However, there was no difference in the mortality rate between the early and late AKI. CONCLUSION Since about one-third of the patients with AKI eventually develop AKD, it is of great importance to closely monitor all COVID-19 patients, especially the high-risk ones, for the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenia obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratoty fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Obesity pandemic during COVID-19 outbreak: Narrative review and future considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus2 (SARS-COV2) which quickly grew to a pandemic in late 2019 and led to substantial public health problems.

The magnitude of finite bandgap opening depends on the orientation of ripples, and the hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the local curvature of graphene. An adsorbed hydrogen alters the local curvature, resulting in relatively weakened adsorption on the neighboring three sites, which gives a rationale to experimentally observed dynamic equilibrium stoichiometry (H:C = 1:4) of hydrogenated graphene.

For children, the efficient way of intervention is through parents and their school environment. Therefore, the establishment of an effective health promotion model for addressing childhood blindness requires awareness building of parents and health care practices. Few studies were undertaken in Saudi Arabia to focus on the awareness of parents about childhood eye diseases and visual impairment. The aim of this study is to assess parents awareness and perception of childrens eye diseases in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, from January to December 2021. A self-administered questionnaire was randomly distributed to parents of children aged 15 and younger via WhatsApp. The survey consisted of four main sections: socio-demographic data, knowledge about eye care, knowledge about eye diseases, and eye care practice. Results The knowledge about eye diseases in children was of excellent grade in 20 parents (3.6%), good in 101 (18.2%), and poor in 434 (78.2%). Knowledge was good in 287 parents (51.7%) for amblyopia, 65 (11.7%) for childhood cataract, and 69 (12.4%) for childhood glaucoma.

To date, GCRV's strategy for evading the fish IFN response is still unknown. Here, we report that GCRV VP41 inhibits fish IFN production by suppressing the phosphorylation of mediator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (MITA). First, the activation of the IFN promoter (IFNpro) stimulated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and MITA was decreased by the overexpression of VP41, whereas such activation induced by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was not affected. Second, VP41 was colocalized in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and associated with MITA. Furthermore, as a phosphorylation substrate of TBK1, VP41 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of MITA. Truncation assays indicated that the transmembrane (TM) region of VP41 was indispensable for the suppression of IFNpro activity. Finally, after infection with GCRV, VP41 blunted the transcription of host IFN and facilitated viral RNA synthesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that GCRV VP41 prevents the fish IFN response by attenuating the phosphorylation of MITA for viral evasion.IMPORTANCE MITA is thought to act as an adaptor protein to facilitate the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1 upon viral infection, and it plays a critical role in innate antiviral responses.

METHODS: We set up the ERACODA (European Renal Association COVID-19 Database) database, which is specifically designed to prospectively collect detailed data on kidney transplant and dialysis patients with COVID-19. For this analysis, patients were included who presented between 1 February and 1 May 2020 and had complete information available on the primary outcome parameter, 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Of the 1073 patients enrolled, 305 (28%) were kidney transplant and 768 (72%) dialysis patients with a mean age of 60  13 and 67  14 years, respectively. The 28-day probability of death was 21.3% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 14.3-30.2%] in kidney transplant and 25.0% (95% CI 20.2-30.0%) in dialysis patients.

For this purpose, a new perturbation parameter ? of the initial condition is introduced, and together with the intensity of choice parameter ? determining the share of responders vs imitators, the system is researched. Depending on ? and ?, extreme reach dynamics, and coexisting attractors, periodic and chaotic trajectories are investigated through massive simulations.

We used this assay to screen more than 3100 participants and selected 20 previously infected pre-immune and 32 immunologically na?ve participants to analyze their antibody binding to RBD and viral neutralization (VN) responses following vaccination with two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. Vaccination not only elicited a more robust immune reaction than natural infection, but the level of neutralizing and anti-RBD antibody binding after vaccination is also significantly higher in pre-immune participants compared to immunologically na?ve participants (p<0.0033). Furthermore, the administration of the second vaccination did not further increase the neutralizing or binding antibody levels in pre-immune participants (p=0.69).

The quantitative survey addressed these questions among a sample of 995 homeless people living either on the streets, in homeless shelters or in squats/slums, whereas the qualitative survey was constructed from 14 homeless interviewees. Both data collections were carried out between June and July 2020. Results showed that COVID-19 infection was clearly perceived by homeless people as a risk, but the experience of being homeless placed this risk among several others. Different practices of protection were observed according to the type of living place. Lockdown of the general population severely impacted the survival systems of the populations furthest from housing, with alarming rates of people without access to water or food. 77% of homeless participants reported that they encountered significant financial difficulties. All interviewees were particularly attentive to their health, with awareness and even a familiarity with the risks of infectious diseases long before the pandemic. Using a capability framework, our study showed a predominant lack of external health-related resources for homeless people, while internal health-related resources were more developed than expected. None of the places and lifestyles studied was favourable to health: collective shelters due to a greater restriction of people's choices, slums and street life due to a greater lack of basic resources.","output":"Locked down outside: Perception of hazard and health resources in COVID-19 epidemic context among homeless people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the deepening of economic globalization, the internationalization of Chinese enterprises has also seen rapid development.

We aimed to examine whether patients infected by community transmission had extended incubation periods than the early generation patients who had direct exposures to Wuhan. METHODOLOGY: Based on 4741 patient case reports from municipal centers of disease control by February 21, 2020, we calculated the incubation periods of 2555 patients with clear epidemiological survey information and illness development timeline. All patients were categorized into five groups by their travel histories. Incubation period distributions were modeled for each group by the method of the posterior Weibull distribution estimation. RESULTS: Adults aged 30 to 59 years had the most substantial proportion of confirmed cases in China. The incubation period distribution varied slightly across patient groups with different travel histories. Patients who regularly lived in Wuhan and left to other locations before January 23, 2020 had the shortest posterior median value of 7.57 days for the incubation period, while the incubation periods for persons affected by local community transmission had the largest posterior median of incubation periods, 9.31 days. CONCLUSIONS: The median incubation period for all patients infected outside Wuhan was 9 days, a bit of more extended than the early estimated 5-day incubation period that was based on patients in Wuhan.

However, this may be related to the lower variability and hence narrower normative limits of structural tests. In this study, we ask whether a time lag exists between the true rates of change in structure and function, regardless of clinical detectability of those changes. Methods: Structural equation models were used to determine whether the rate of change in function (mean linearized total deviation, AveTDLin) or structure (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness [RNFLT]) was predicted by the concurrent or previous rate for the other modality, after adjusting for its own rate in the previous time interval. Rates were calculated over 1135 pairs of consecutive visits from 318 eyes of 164 participants in the Portland Progression Project, with mean 207 days between visits. Results: The rate of change of AveTDLin was predicted by its own rate in the previous time interval, but not by rates of RNFLT change in either the concurrent or previous time interval (both P > 0.05). Similarly, the rate of RNFLT change was not predicted by concurrent AveTDLin change after adjusting for its own previous rate. However, the rate of AveTDLin change in the previous time interval did significantly improve prediction of the current rate for RNFLT, with P = 0.005, suggesting a time lag of around six months between changes in AveTDLin and RNFLT.

RESULTS: Of 897 (80%) VP, there were 465 (41%) elderly, 380 (34%) racial/ethnic minorities, and 479 (43%) SES disadvantage patients. Imaging was performed in 88% of patients and mostly portable/bedside studies, with 87% of patients receiving chest radiographs. There were 83% hospital admissions, 25% ICU admissions, 23% intubations, and 13% deaths.

In the districts, the distribution of gross and fair incidence is related to the ones of the independent variables (Municipal Statistics and Estudio de Salud 2018, Madrid Salud). The Incidence and the r and r2 coefficients, obtained with the factors and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, are studied.

This study investigated the effect of caffeic acid ethanolamide (CAEA), a novel caffeic acid derivative, on renal remodeling after injury. The inhibitory role of CAEA on EMT was determined by western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry staining. Treating renal epithelial cells with CAEA in TGF-? exposed cell culture successfully maintained the content of E-cadherin and inhibited the expression of mesenchymal marker, indicating that CAEA prevented renal epithelial cells undergo EMT after TGF-? exposure. Unilateral renal I/R were performed in mice to induce renal remodeling models. CAEA can protect against I/R-induced renal remodeling by inhibiting inflammatory reactions and consecutively inhibiting TGF-?-induced EMT, characterized by the preserved E-cadherin expression and alleviated &#945;-SMA and collagen expression, as well as the alleviated of renal fibrosis. We also revealed that CAEA may exhibits biological activity by targeting TGFBRI. CAEA may antagonize TGF-? signaling by interacting with TGFBR1, thereby blocking binding between TGF-? and TGFBR1 and reducing downstream signaling, such as Smad3 phosphorylation.

It is known that heat and cold can influence a persons productivity and performance in simple tasks. With respect to social cognition, it has also been suggested that temperature impacts on relatively high-level forms of decision-making. For instance, previous research demonstrated that cold temperature promotes utilitarian judgment in a moral dilemma task. This effect could be due to psychological processing, when a cool temperature primes a set of internal representations (associated with coldness). Alternatively, the promotion of utilitarian judgment in cold conditions could be due to physiological interference from temperature, impeding on social cognition. Refuting both explanations of psychological or physiological processing, however, it has been suggested that there may be problems of reproducibility in the literature on temperature modulating complex or abstract information processing. To examine the role of temperature in moral decision-making, we conducted a series of experiments using ambient and haptic temperature with careful manipulation checks and modified task methodology. Experiment 1 manipulated room temperature with cool (21C), control (24C) and hot (27C) conditions and found only a cool temperature effect, promoting utilitarian judgment as in the previous study. Experiment 2 manipulated the intensity of haptic temperature but failed to obtain the cool temperature effect. Experiments 3 and 4 examined the generalizability of the cool ambient temperature effect with another moral judgment task and with manipulation of exposure duration. However, again there were no cool temperature effects, suggesting a lack of reproducibility. Despite successful manipulations of temperature in all four experiments, as measured in body temperature and the participants self-reported perception, we found no systematic influence of temperature on moral decision-making. A Bayesian meta-analysis of the four experiments showed that the overall data tended to provide strong support in favor of the null hypothesis. We propose that, at least in the range of temperatures from 21 to 27C, the cool temperature effect in moral decision-making is not a robust phenomenon.","output":"The Role of Temperature in Moral Decision-Making: Limited Reproducibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) carry significant morbidity and mortality.

RESEARCH QUESTION: We hypothesized that inhaled HMW-HA will improve outcomes in AECOPD. METHODS: We conducted a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to investigate the effect of inhaled HMW-HA in patients with severe AECOPD necessitating non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Primary endpoint was time until liberation from NIPPV. RESULTS: Out of 44 screened patients, 41 were included in the study (21 for placebo and 20 for HMW-HA). Patients treated with HMW-HA had significantly shorter duration of NIPPV. HMW-HA treated patients also had lower measured peak airway pressures on the ventilator and lower systemic inflammation markers after liberation from NIPPV. In vitro testing showed that HMW-HA significantly improved mucociliary transport in airCliquid interface cultures of primary bronchial cells from COPD patients and healthy primary cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract. INTERPRETATION: Inhaled HMW-HA shortens the duration of respiratory failure and need for non-invasive ventilation in patients with AECOPD.

Age-related epigenetic, transcriptional and metabolic deregulations are highly interconnected, which renders dissociating cause and effect complicated. However, growing amounts of evidence support the notion that aging is not only accompanied by epigenetic alterations, but also at least in part induced by those.

Finally, we summarize recent potential intervention strategies that target epigenetic mechanisms to extend healthy life span and provide an outlook on future developments in the field of longevity research.","output":"How to Slow down the Ticking Clock: Age-Associated Epigenetic Alterations and Related Interventions to Extend Life Span"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A facile continuous production of soy peptide nanogels was demonstrated using a multi-inlet vortex micromixer for the entrapment of active ingredients. The full flow regime in the micromixer was systematically studied to understand the flow impact on nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency. Ibuprofen was chosen as a model drug to demonstrate encapsulation capability. The study showed that the nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency did not alter significantly as long as the flow rates were in transition and turbulent regimes. The driving force behind the folding of peptides within the microenvironment is kinetic mixing with high flow rates, which dominates in comparison to molecular diffusion, nucleation, and growth. Moreover, the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the soy peptides determined the drug encapsulation efficiency and the drug loading efficiency, which did not vary much under different manufacturing parameters. Both characteristics are beneficial to mass production of drug-entrapped peptide. In a 50% water-ethanol mixture, the encapsulation efficiency achieved 70% and the drug loading efficiency was up to 25% in transition and turbulent flow regimes.

A rolling 7-day total value was used for volume tracking and comparison. Total imaging utilization in the ED was compared with new COVID-19 cases in our region. Utilization was first categorized by modality and then by plain films and computed tomography (CT) scans grouped by body part. CT imaging of the chest was specifically investigated by assessing both CT chest only exams and CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis (C/A/P) exams. Ultimately, matching pair-wise statistical analysis of exam volumes was performed to assess significance of volume change. RESULTS: Our multicenter health system experienced a 46% drop in imaging utilization (p < 0.0001) during the pandemic. Matching pair-wise analysis showed a statistically significant volume decrease by each modality and body part. The exceptions were non-contrast chest CT, which increased (p = 0.0053), and non-trauma C/A/P CT, which did not show a statistically significant volume change (p = 0.0633).

Mask touching, reuse and disposal occurs frequently, leading to increased risk of cross-contamination, infection and further transmission. Cuprous-oxide has potent virucidal properties. We determined the capacity of surgical face masks (type IIR) made with nonwoven fabric impregnated with cuprous-oxide microparticles (Test Fabric), to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 when in direct contact with the virus. The Test Fabric reduced the infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 by 0.73, 3.02 and 4.19 log10 within 5, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. In contrast, the infectious titers of the virus were reduced by Control Fabric by 0.24, 0.67 and 0.97 within 5, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. The reductions were significantly higher in the Test Fabric than in the Control Fabric (0.49, 2.35 and 3.22 log difference, accordingly), reaching a statistically significant difference after 5 minutes (p < 0.01). The mask filtration properties were not affected by the presence of the cuprous oxide microparticles. We conclude that the use of cuprous-oxide containing face masks in the external layers of respiratory face masks may significantly reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 cross-contamination, transmission and infection, due to masks handling and disposal, especially when used by the general population.","output":"Reduction of SARS-CoV-2 Infectious Titers by Direct Contact with Cuprous-Oxide Impregnated Face Masks External Layers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and quickly spread to the surrounding regions and neighboring countries.

In China, the outbreak lasted for 1 month until it seemed to be controlled after affecting over 81,000 individuals and causing deaths in over 4200 patients. Subsequently, and after affecting over 118,000 individuals and causing over 4200 deaths, the condition was officially announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the meantime, the epidemic curve took a downtrend in China, the original epicenter of the pandemic, but started to rise in other countries with a steep slope. Among over 215 affected countries, the USA, European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, France, the UK), Iran, and South Korea had the highest frequencies in the matters of infected patients and deaths. Importantly, different countries took different policies when encountered with an outbreak, especially in the matter of accuracy of the report and timing of the action. A part of the delays in reporting was expected, including the lag in the chain of reporting, the shortcomings of tests, missed patients, and inadequate testing facilities. However, there were also political and nontechnical reasons that caused the reporting to be inaccurate. Surveillance seems to be less of a reason for the observed in poor management, and it mostly originated from human decision-making failures and political issues. Besides, the culture of populations and their trust in their governments played an important role on how they reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic and acquired policies.

However, the incidence of bleeding, predictors of major bleeding, or the association between bleeding and mortality remain largely unknown. METHODS: We performed a cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that received intermediate- or therapeutic doses of anticoagulants from March 25 to July 22, 2020, to identify those at increased risk for major bleeding. We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to explore the risk factors associated with major bleeding. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,965 patients were enrolled. Of them, 1,347 (69%) received intermediate- and 618 (31%) therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, with a median duration of 12 days in both groups. During the hospital stay, 112 patients (5.7%) developed major bleeding and 132 (6.7%) had non-major bleeding. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate for major bleeding was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36%-54%) and for non-major bleeding 32% (95%CI: 24%-40%). Multivariate analysis showed increased risk for in-hospital major bleeding associated with D-dimer levels >10 times the upper normal range (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.38-3.59), ferritin levels >500 ng/mL (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.02-3.95), critical illness (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.14-3.18) and therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01-1.97). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 receiving intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation, a major bleeding event occurred in 5.7%.

Much data derives from early in the pandemic, when schools were uniformly remote and personal/family stressors related to the pandemic were limited. This cross-sectional study, conducted during Fall 2020, examines the correlation between mental wellbeing and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, along with influence of COVID-19-related stressors, school status (in-person versus remote), and social media use for coping purposes, among 978 U.S. adolescents. Results suggest self-reported daily social media and technology use increased significantly from prior to COVID-19 through Fall 2020. Increased social media use was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms regardless of other theoretical moderators or confounders of mental health (e.g., demographics, school status, importance of technology, COVID-19-related stress). Despite literature suggesting that remote learning may result in adverse mental health outcomes, we did not find local school reopening to be associated with current depressive/anxiety symptoms, nor with COVID-19-related increases in technology use. Self-reported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work.

The current oxygen delivery systems may fail to meet the needs of certain patients or are associated with the appearance of sequelae following their use, such as in cases receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) poses an attractive alternative to the current oxygen delivery systems available for patients with COVID-19. HBOT has been previously used in various types of infectious diseases, providing inflammatory relief and facilitating the reversal of hypoxemia, qualities that may also prove beneficial to patients with COVID-19. At present, a significant propor- tion of the population worldwide is overweight or obese, and these comorbidities are considered to increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate whether HBOT may benefit a representative sample of this aforementioned population (n=36 patients). After the first HBOT session, 7 patients were immediately relieved from shortness of breath, while in 22 patients, this symptom was markedly alleviated after 7.570.63 days of HBOT. Moreover, the remaining patients (n=7) had a slow breath recovery after performing activity, suggesting that they should continue HBOT. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that daily HBOT for 7.570.63 days improved COVID-19 symptoms in over half of the enrolled patients, indicating that it may be a useful alternative in the treatment of this illness. ? 2020 Penn State University Press.

What is the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility treatments and cumulative live births? DESIGN: The study examined annual US natality, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IVF cycle activity and live birth data from 1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live births for 2020 to 2023. RESULTS: The financial recession of 2008 caused a 4-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% confidence interval [CI] 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, compared with 4445 (95% CI 3144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years.

Because of the time-consuming nature of evidence gathering and careful truth-checking, people get confused between fallacious and trustworthy statement. So, we need a way to keep track of misinformation on social media. Most people think that all social media information is real information though, at the same time, it is a shame that some people misuse this social media platform for their own benefit by spreading misinformation. Many individuals take advantage by playing with the weaknesses of others. As a result, people around the world not only are facing COVID-19, they are also facing infodemics. To get rid of this kind of fake news, we have proposed a research model that can predict fake news related to the COVID-19 issue on social media data using classical classification methods such as multinomial na?ve bayes classifier, logistic regression classifier, and support vector machine classifier.

Methods: This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Results: Forty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission.

We analyzed novel data from 2,012 ethnically diverse Africans, 15,997 individuals of European (7,061) and African (8,916) ancestry recruited by the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and comparative data from 2,504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes project. At ACE2 we identified 41 non-synonymous variants, found to be at low frequency in most populations. However, three non-synonymous variants were frequent among Central African hunter-gatherers (CAHG) from Cameroon, and signatures of positive selection could be detected on haplotypes encompassing those variants. We also detected signatures of positive selection for variants at regulatory regions upstream of ACE2 in diverse African populations. At TMPRSS2, we identified 48 non-synonymous variants, several of which are common in global populations, and 13 amino acid changes that are fixed in the human lineage after divergence from Chimpanzee. At DPP4 and LY6E most variants were rare in global populations indicating that purifying selection is acting at these loci.

METHODS: This is a non-randomized before-after pilot study. A sample of 78 patients was recruited from two general practices in Italy and 70 among them were followed for 8 months. Standard home care was provided during the first four months period (months 1C4), followed by the educational intervention until the end of the study (months 5C8). The intervention, based on the teach-back method, consisted of by-weekly 60-min home sessions targeting aspects of the disease and its treatment, potential complications, medication adherence, and health behaviours. Rates of health services use were collected immediately before (T0), and after the interventions (T1). Differences in utilization rates were examined by the McNemars test. Potential factors associated with the risk of health services use were explored with a Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: The sample (n = 78) was predominantly female (n = 50, 64.1%), and had a mean age of 76.2 (SD = 4.8) years. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent disease (n = 27, 34.6%). McNemars test indicated a significant reduction in health services use at T1 (McNemar (2) = 28.03, P < 0.001). Cox regressions indicated that time and patient education, as well as their interaction, were the only variables positively associated with the probability of health services use. CONCLUSION: A teach-back intervention led by a family nurse practitioner has the potential to reduce health services use in older patients with chronic diseases.","output":"A family nurse-led intervention for reducing health services utilization in individuals with chronic diseases: The ADVICE pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Yinzhou Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) in China implemented an integrated health big data platform (IHBDP) that pooled health data from healthcare providers to combat the spread of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and to identify gaps in vaccination uptake among migrant children. METHODS: IHBDP is composed of medical data from clinics, electronic health records, residents annual medical checkup and immunization records, as well as administrative data, such as student registries. We programmed IHBDP to automatically scan for and detect dengue and TB carriers, as well as identify migrant children with incomplete immunization according to a comprehensive set of screening criteria developed by public health and medical experts. We compared the effectiveness of the big data screening with existing traditional screening methods. RESULTS: IHBDP successfully identified six cases of dengue out of a pool of 3972 suspected cases, whereas the traditional method only identified four cases (which were also detected by IHBDP). For TB, IHBDP identified 288 suspected cases from a total of 43,521 university students, in which three cases were eventually confirmed to be TB carriers through subsequent follow up CT or T-SPOT.TB tests. As for immunization screenings, IHBDP identified 240 migrant children with incomplete immunization, but the traditional door-to-door screening method only identified 20 ones. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated the effectiveness of using IHBDP to detect both acute and chronic infectious disease patients and identify children with incomplete immunization as compared to traditional screening methods.","output":"Infectious diseases prevention and control using an integrated health big data system in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 However, although apilimod might prevent viral invasion by inhibiting host cell proteases, the same proteases are critical for antigen presentation leading to T cell activation and there is good evidence from both in vitro studies and the clinic that apilimod blocks antiviral immune responses We therefore warn that the immunosuppression observed in many COVID-19 patients might be aggravated by apilimod","output":"The PIKfyve Inhibitor Apilimod: A Double-Edged Sword against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of this retrospective study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the laparoscopic technique for treatment of massive incisional hernias (MIHs) and to compare three different fixation devices. METHODS From January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2014, we collected retrospective data from patients with large incisional hernias (IHs). Laparoscopic IH repair is performed by applying a three-dimensional polyester knit structure mesh with a resorbable collagen barrier on peritoneal side (Parietex? Composite Mesh; Covidien, New Haven, CT). Patients were divided into three groups according to the different fixation devices. The mean follow-up was 19 (12-156) months. RESULTS The mean defect size was 12.83 cm (10-26 cm) and the mean body mass index was 30.8 kg/m2 (26-39 kg/m2). The EMS stapler? was used on 260 patients, the Protack? on 210 patients, and the AbsorbaTack? on 30 patients. The mean operative time was 69.9 minutes (38-130 minutes). Intraoperative morbidity rate was 1.6% (8 cases). Early reoperation rate was 0.2% (1 case). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.3 days (range 2-7 days). Seromas were observed in 20 patients (4.0%) and neuralgia in 10 patients (2.0%). Recurrence was observed in 12 patients (2.4%) with the majority in the absorbable tack group (10%). There were no conversions (0%) to open technique. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach seems to be safe and appropriate for treatment of MIH. The Parietex composite mesh we used guarantees excellent intraabdominal laparoscopic repair of abdominal wall defects. Absorbatack system seems to give less postoperative neuralgia, but it is related to a high recurrence rate. Protack system seems to give more postoperative neuralgia than the Endopath EMS. In our experience, the best fixation system is the latter.","output":"Massive Incisional Hernia Repair with Parietex: Monocentric Analysis on 500 Cases Treated with a Laparoscopic Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), started in 2019 in China and quickly spread into a global pandemic. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is highly conserved and the most abundant protein in coronaviruses and thus a potential target for both vaccine and point-of-care diagnostics. N Protein has been suggested in the literature as having post-translational modifications (PTMs), and accurately defining these PTMs is critical for its potential use in medicine. Reports of phosphorylation of N protein have failed to provide detailed site-specific information. We have performed comprehensive glycomics, glycoproteomics and proteomics experiments on two different N protein preparations. Both were expressed in HEK293 cells, one was in-house expressed and purified without a signal peptide sequence and the other was commercially produced with a signal peptide channeling it through the secretory pathway. Our results show completely different PTMs on the two N protein preparations. The commercial product contained extensive N- and O-linked glycosylation, as well as O-phosphorylation on site Thr393. Conversely, the native N Protein model had O-phosphorylation at Ser176 and no glycosylation, highlighting the importance of knowing the provenance of any commercial protein to be used for scientific or clinical studies. Recent studies have indicated that N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and as a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of PTMs on viral pathogenesis, vaccine design and development point-of-care diagnostics.","output":"Variable post-translational modifications of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific research has focused its attention on finding an alternative route to systemic oral and parenteral administration, to overcome their usual drawbacks, such as hepatic first-pass which decreases drug bioavailability after oral administration, off-target effects, low patient compliance and low speed of onset of the pharmacological action in first-aid cases.

RESULTS: Extremes of age are associated with increased expression of selected PRR genes, ACE2 and four genes that encode proteins that have been shown to interact with SAR2-CoV-2 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of PRR expression might provide a strategy for stratifying the risk of severe COVID-19 disease at both the individual and population levels.","output":"Extremes of age are associated with differences in the expression of selected pattern recognition receptor genes and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2: implications for the epidemiology of COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the point of apprehension by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the U.S.-Mexican border to their reunification with sponsors in U.S. communities, unaccompanied children (UC) face political, social, and economic conditions, heightening their risk for mental and physical health burdens that may be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such risk underscores the importance of social work practice and advocacy for the improved treatment and experiences of UC. This article uses a structural vulnerability conceptual lens to summarize the existing literature regarding UC and argues that UC's liminal immigration status, economic precarity, and lack of healthcare access place this group at high structural vulnerability during the pandemic. Further, this article identifies and describes three contexts of structural vulnerability of UC that are important points of social work intervention: (1) at the border, where migrant children are denied their legal right to seek protection; (2) in detention and shelter facilities; and (3) during reunification with sponsors.

An imaging study with objective clinical correlation is needed in COVID-19 anosmia in order to better understand underlying pathogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 23 patients with persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. Patients included in this study had a minimum 1-month duration between onset of olfactory dysfunction and evaluation. Olfactory functions were evaluated with Sniffin' Sticks Test. Paranasal sinus CTs and MRI dedicated to olfactory nerves were acquired. On MRI, quantitative measurements of olfactory bulb volumes and olfactory sulcus depth and qualitative assessment of olfactory bulb morphology, signal intensity, and olfactory nerve filia architecture were performed. RESULTS: All patients were anosmic at the time of imaging based on olfactory test results. On CT, Olfactory cleft opacification was seen in 73.9% of cases with a mid and posterior segment dominance. 43.5% of cases had below normal olfactory bulb volumes and 60.9% of cases had shallow olfactory sulci. Of all, 54.2% of cases had changes in normal inverted J shape of the bulb. 91.3% of cases had abnormality in olfactory bulb signal intensity in the forms of diffusely increased signal intensity, scattered hyperintense foci or microhemorrhages. Evident clumping of olfactory filia was seen in 34.8% of cases and thinning with scarcity of filia in 17.4%. Primary olfactory cortical signal abnormality was seen in 21.7% of cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate olfactory cleft and olfactory bulb abnormalities are seen in COVID-19 anosmia. There was a relatively high percentage of olfactory bulb degeneration.

This study aims to provide the current data to allow adequate consent regarding the risks of post-surgery COVID-19 infection and subsequent COVID-19-related mortality. METHODS: All orthopaedic trauma cases at the Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust from lockdown (23 March 2020) to date (15 June 2020) were collated and split into three groups. Adult ambulatory trauma surgeries (upper limb trauma, ankle fracture, tibial plateau fracture) and regional-specific referrals (periprosthetic hip fracture) were performed at a stand-alone elective site that accepted COVID-19-negative patients. Neck of femur fractures (NOFF) and all remaining non-NOFF (paediatric trauma, long bone injury) surgeries were performed at an acute site hospital (mixed green/blue site). Patients were swabbed for COVID-19 before surgery on both sites. Age, sex, nature of surgery, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, associated comorbidity, length of stay, development of post-surgical COVID-19 infection, and post-surgical COVID-19-related deaths were collected. RESULTS: At the elective site, 225 patients underwent orthopaedic trauma surgery; two became COVID-19-positive (0.9%) in the immediate perioperative period, neither of which was fatal. At the acute site, 93 patients underwent non-NOFF trauma surgery, of whom six became COVID-19-positive (6.5%) and three died. A further 84 patients underwent NOFF surgery, seven becoming COVID-19 positive (8.3%) and five died. CONCLUSION: At the elective site, the rate of COVID-19 infection following orthopaedic trauma surgery was low, at 0.9%. At the acute mixed site (typical district general hospital), for non-NOFF surgery there was a 6.5% incidence of post-surgical COVID-19 infection (seven-fold higher risk) with 50% COVID-19 mortality; for NOFF surgery, there was an 8.3% incidence of post-surgical COVID-19 infection, with 71% COVID-19 mortality.

We examined the impacts of extending the interval between two doses of mRNA vaccines in Canada in order to inform deliberations of Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization. Methods: We developed an age-stratified, deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to reproduce the epidemiologic features of the epidemic in Canada. Simulated vaccination comprised mRNA vaccines with explicit examination of effectiveness against disease (67% [first dose], 94% [second dose]), hospitalization (80% [first dose], 96% [second dose]), and death (85% [first dose], 96% [second dose]) in adults aged 20 years and older. Effectiveness against infection was assumed to be 90% relative to the effectiveness against disease. We used a 6-week mRNA dose interval as our base case (consistent with early program rollout across Canadian and international jurisdictions) and compared extended intervals of 12 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks. We began vaccinations on January 1, 2021 and simulated a third wave beginning on April 1, 2021. Results: Extending mRNA dose intervals were projected to result in 12.1-18.9% fewer symptomatic cases, 9.5-13.5% fewer hospitalizations, and 7.5-9.7% fewer deaths in the population over a 12-month time horizon. The largest reductions in hospitalizations and deaths were observed in the longest interval of 24 weeks, though benefits were diminishing as intervals extended. Benefits of extended intervals stemmed largely from the ability to accelerate coverage in individuals aged 20-74 years as older individuals were already prioritized for early vaccination. Conditions under which mRNA dose extensions led to worse outcomes included: first-dose effectiveness < 65% against death; or protection following first dose waning to 0% by month three before the scheduled 2nd dose at 24-weeks. Probabilistic simulations from a range of likely vaccine effectiveness values did not result in worse outcomes with extended intervals. Conclusion: Under real-world effectiveness conditions, our results support a strategy of extending mRNA dose intervals across all age groups to minimize symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, and deaths while vaccine supply is constrained.","output":"Modelling the impact of extending dose intervals for COVID-19 vaccines in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the BBCs Blue Planet II nature documentary series on marine ecosystems, plastic packaging has come under public fire, with consumers demanding greener alternatives.

E. faecalis ATCC 29212 preformed biofilms, on polystyrene wells and on dentin discs, were treated with 880 nm NIR irradiation and NaOCl at 4%, 2.5%, 1% and 0.5% alone and combined to each other (NIR irradiation plus NaOCl 1% or 0.5%) at 5 and 10 min. Treated biofilms were compared to the controls for (i) biofilm biomass evaluation, (ii) CFU count for the quantification of cultivable cells and (iii) cells viability. All the detected experimental conditions displayed a significant reduction of biofilm biomass (p < 0.001) and CFUs/mL (p < 0.01) in respect to the controls on both tested surfaces. The effects on the E. faecalis biomass, colony count and cell viability were not time-dependent except for NaOCl 2.5% and 1% in the biofilm biomass reductions on human dentin discs. NIR-LED irradiation alone showed a reduction of E. faecalis aggregates without interfering with cell viability whereas NaOCl alone expressed a killing effect in a concentration dependent way. The combination of NIR-LED irradiation with NaOCl 1% and 0.5% displayed a double effect of cluster disaggregation and cell killing. In particular, NIR-LED irradiation combined with NaOCl 0.5% displayed an anti-biofilm activity major than those expressed by NaOCl 0.5% alone (p = 0.001) with a reduction of biomass 93% vs 71% and 97% vs 25% after 10 min, on polystyrene wells and human dentin discs, respectively.

However, they are urgently needed to manage anaesthesia drug supply in times of drug shortages due to the pandemic. METHODS: We surveyed all Swiss anaesthesia institutions in April 2020 to determine their annual anaesthesia activity. Together with a detailed analysis on anaesthetic drug use of a large, representative Swiss anaesthesia index institution, calculations and projections for the annual need of anaesthetics in Switzerland were made. Only those drugs have been analysed that are either being used very frequently or that have been classified critical with regard to their supply by the pharmacy of the index institution or the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. RESULTS: The response rate to our questionnaire was 98%. Out of the present 188 Swiss anaesthesia institutions, 185 responded. In Switzerland, the annual number of anaesthesias was 1'071'054 (12'445 per 100'000 inhabitants) with a mean anaesthesia time of 2.03 hours. Teaching hospitals (n = 54) performed more than half (n = 572'231) and non-teaching hospitals (n = 103) provided almost half of all anaesthesias (n = 412'531). Thereby, private hospitals conducted a total of 290'690 anaesthesias. Finally, office-based anaesthesia institutions with mainly outpatients (n = 31) administered 86'292 anaesthesias. Regarding type of anaesthesia provided, two thirds were general anaesthesias (42% total intravenous, 17% inhalation, 8% combined), 20% regional and 12% monitored anaesthesia care. Projecting for example the annual need for propofol in anaesthesia, Switzerland requires 48'573 L of propofol 1% which corresponds to 5'644 L propofol 1% per 100'000 inhabitants every year.

The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines.

Objective: To map published studies until March 25, 2020, on the use of chloroquine and its derivates in patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods: We searched on PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and 15 registries from the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for theoretical and empirical research in English, Spanish, Italian, French, or Portuguese until March 25, 2020, and made a narrative synthesis of the results.

Recent data suggest prone positioning is beneficial for patients with COVID-19 who are requiring high flow oxygen. It is unknown of prone positioning is beneficial for patients not on high flow oxygen. What this study adds: Prone positioning is generally not well tolerated and innovative approaches are needed to improve adherence. Clinical and physiologic outcomes were not improved with prone positioning among hypoxic but not critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of prone positioning to reduce the risk of death or respiratory failure in non-critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 Design: Pragmatic randomized clinical trial of prone positioning of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 15 hospitals in Canada and the United States from May 2020 until May 2021. Settings: Patients were eligible is they had a laboratory-confirmed or a clinically highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, required supplemental oxygen (up to 50% fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2]), and were able to independently prone with verbal instruction. (NCT04383613). Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, mechanical ventilation, or worsening respiratory failure defined as requiring at least 60% FiO2 for at least 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included the change in the ratio of oxygen saturation to FiO2 (S/F ratio). Results: A total of 248 patients were included. The trial was stopped early on the basis of futility for the pre-specified primary outcome. The median time from hospital admission until randomization was 1 day, the median age of patients was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR] 45,65), 36% were female, and 90% of patients were receiving oxygen via nasal prongs at the time of randomization. The median time spent prone in the first 72 hours was 6 hours total (IQR 1.5,12.8) for the prone arm compared to 0 hours (0,2) in the control arm. The risk of the primary outcome was similar between the prone group (18 [14.3%] events) and the standard care group (17 [13.9%] events), odds ratio 0.92 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.92). The change in the S/F ratio after 72 hours was similar for patients randomized to prone compared to standard of care. Conclusion: Among hypoxic but not critically patients with COVID-19 in hospital, a multifaceted intervention to increase prone positioning did not improve outcomes. Adherence to prone positioning was poor, despite multiple efforts.

In order to inform the policy dialogue on strengthening human resources for health, we conducted three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys, adapted from tools used in other fragile contexts. This article focuses on the health worker survey. We found that the locational job preferences of health workers in Guinea are particularly influenced by opportunities for training, working conditions, and housing. Most staff are satisfied with their work and with supervision, however, financial aspects and working conditions are considered least satisfactory, and worrying findings include the high proportion of staff favouring emigration, their high tolerance of informal user payments, as well as their limited exposure to rural areas during training. Based on our findings, we highlight measures which could improve rural recruitment and retention in Guinea and similar settings. These include offering upgrading and specialization in return for rural service; providing greater exposure to rural areas during training; increasing recruitment from rural areas; experimenting with fixed term contracts in rural areas; and improving working conditions in rural posts.

We thus investigated the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in nasal tissues of CRSwNP patients, and their associations with inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. METHODS: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was assessed in nasal tissues of control subjects and eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP) and nonECRSwNP patients. The correlations between ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and inflammatory indices of CRSwNP endotypes were evaluated. Regulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression by inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids was investigated. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was significantly increased in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients compared to ECRSwNP patients and control subjects, and positively correlated with the expression of IFN-?3, but negatively correlated with tissue infiltrated eosinophils, and expression of IL5 and IL13. IFN-?3 up-regulated ACE2 expression while glucocorticoid attenuated this increase in cultured nasal epithelial cells. Genes co-expressed with ACE2 were enriched in pathways relating to defence response to virus in nasal tissue. TMPRSS2 expression was decreased in nasal tissues of CRSwNP patients compared to control subjects and not correlated with the inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. Glucocorticoid treatment decreased ACE2 expression in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients, but not in ECRSwNP patients, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was not affected.

METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre study included participants with laboratory-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital from Feb 11 to Feb 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analysed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until discharge or Feb 26, 2020, whichever came first. We defined asymptomatic infection as SARS-CoV-2 infection with no history of clinical signs and symptoms, severe COVID-19 as clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnoea, tachypnoea, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <93%, and need for oxygen therapy), and mild COVID-19 as all other symptoms. Clinical features on admission were compared among patients with different disease severity, including asymptomatic infection, at the end of observation. We used univariable analysis to identify factors associated with symptomatic illness among asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. FINDINGS: Among the 104 participants included in the final analysis, the median age was 68 years (IQR 47C75) and 54 (52%) were male. On admission, 43 (41%) participants were classified as asymptomatic, 41 (39%) as having mild COVID-10, and 20 (19%) as having severe COVID-19. At the end of observation, 33 (32%) participants were confirmed as being asymptomatic, 43 (41%) as having mild COVID-19, and 28 (27%) as having severe COVID-19. Serum lactate hydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in the ten participants who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with the 33 participants who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period (five [50%] vs four [12%] participants; odds ratio 725, 95% CI 143C3670; p=0020). Compared with patients with mild disease at the end of observation, patients with severe COVID-19 were older (median age 73 years [IQR 55C77] vs 60 years [40C71]; p=0028) and had more frequent consolidation on chest CT (13 [46%] of 28 vs nine [21%] of 43; p=0035) and lymphopenia (16 [57%] vs ten [23%]; p=00055) on admission. INTERPRETATION: Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to improved clinical management.

Metformin (MET) increases insulin sensitivity, but it is associated with unsatisfactory weight loss. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide has been shown to reduce weight and IR in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of exenatide once-weekly (QW) combined with MET on body weight, as well as metabolic and endocrinological parameters in overweight/obese women with PCOS. METHODS: Fifty overweight/obese women with PCOS diagnosed via the Rotterdam criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups: MET (500 mg three times a day [TID]) or combination treatment (COM) (MET 500 mg TID, exenatide 2 mg QW) for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were anthropometric changes associated with obesity, and the secondary outcomes included changes in reproductive hormone levels, glucose and lipid metabolism, and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Forty (80%) patients completed the study. COM therapy was superior to MET monotherapy in reducing weight (P = 0.045), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.041), and waist circumference (P = 0.023). Patients in the COM group on an average lost 3.8  2.4 kg compared with 2.1  3.0 kg in the MET group. In the COM group, BMI and waist circumference decreased by 1.4  0.87 kg/m(2) and 4.63  4.42 cm compared with 0.77  1.17 kg/m(2) and 1.72  3.07 cm in the MET group, respectively. Moreover, levels of fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 2-h glucose, and OGTT 2-h insulin were significantly lower with COM therapy than with MET (P < 0.050). Mild and moderate gastrointestinal reactions were the most common adverse events in both groups.

In specific clinical situations, e.g., at bony edges, bridging of the hernial orifice with reduced overlap might be necessary. To gain insight into the durability of various applications, two different meshes with the best tissue grip known so far were assessed. METHODS The model uses dynamic intermittent strain and comprises the repetition of submaximal impacts delivered via a hydraulically driven plastic containment. Pig tissue simulates a ventral hernia with a standardized 5 cm defect. Commercially available meshes classified as primarily stable at recommended overlap were used to bridge this defect at recommended and reduced overlap. RESULTS Using Parietex Progrip?, the peritoneum adds sufficient stability at least to a 2.5 cm overlap. Using Dynamesh Cicat?, four gluing spots with Glubran? are sufficient to stabilize a 3.75 cm overlap. A 2.5 cm overlap is stabilized with eight bonding spots Glubran? and 8 bonding spots combined with four sutures stabilize a 1.25 cm overlap.

We aimed to quantify this backlog nationally for England and assess how various interventions might mitigate the backlog. METHODS: We did a national analysis of data for colonoscopies, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and gastroscopies from National Health Service (NHS) trusts in NHS England's Monthly Diagnostic Waiting Times and Activity dataset. Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 95% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (845% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775C181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398C130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564C215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 154%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 438%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 825% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 g haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022.

In 2019, the early winter influenza season coincided with mid-year school breaks, enabling us the unusual opportunity to examine how influenza incidence changed during school closure dates. Methods: The weekly influenza data from five Australian state and one territory health departments for the period of week 19 (mid-May) to week 35 (early September) 2019 were compared to each state's public school closure dates. We used segmented regression to model the weekly counts and a negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion due to autocorrelation. The models' goodness-of-fit was assessed by plots of observed versus expected counts, plots of residuals versus predicted values, and Pearson's Chi-square test. The main exposure was the July two-week school vacation period, using a lag of one week. The effect is estimated as a percent change in incidence level, and in slope. We also dichotomized the change in weekly counts into decreases versus increases (or no change). The proportion of decreases were then compared for each of three periods (pre-vacation, vacation, post-vacation) using Fishers exact test. Results: School holidays were associated with significant declines in influenza incidence. The models showed acceptable goodness-of-fit. The numbers and percentages of decreases in weekly influenza counts from the previous week for all states combined were: 19 (33%) pre-vacation; 11 (92%) decreases during the vacation; and 19 (59%) decreases post-vacation (P=0.0002). The first decline during school holidays is seen in the school aged (5-19 years) population, with the declines in the adult and infant populations being smaller and following a week later. Conclusions: Given the significant and rapid reductions in incidence, these results have important public health implications. Closure or extension of holiday periods could be an emergency option for state governments.","output":"Australian state influenza notifications and school closures in 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the domestic experience in nuclear medicine, radiobiology, radiotoxicology, radiation protection, and health maintenance of nuclear industry workers and residents of the region of location of radiation hazardous facilities of the Russian Federation.

The objective of this work is to investigate the action plan on breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 and her newborn. METHODS A literature search has been conducted through the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, BVS, and Cuiden databases. The methodological quality of the articles has been assessed using the \\"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\\" (GRADE). This study has not been registered in PROSPERO. RESULTS A total of 14 documents have been found, of which 9 are observational empirical studies. Most of the studies were conducted in China, Italy, the USA, and Australia. A total of 114 mothers infected with coronavirus with their respective newborns have been assessed. The analyzed investigations state that it is best for the newborn to be breastfed; given that mother's milk samples were analyzed, detecting the presence of antibodies of the coronavirus in them, being a protective factor against infection. CONCLUSIONS Breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the newborn, if the health of the mother and newborn allow it. When direct breastfeeding is favoured, the appropriate respiratory hygiene measures always have to be considered. Whether the mother's health does not permit direct breastfeeding, her breast milk should be previously extracted and kept unpasteurized.

Population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. This study examined the incidence and etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization in a population-based cohort as well as risk factors and outcomes for specific etiologies. METHODS: Consecutive admissions due to CAP in Reykjavik, Iceland were studied. Etiologic testing was performed with cultures, urine-antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of airway samples. Outcomes were length of stay, intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: The inclusion rate was 95%. The incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was 20.6 cases per 10000 adults/year. A potential pathogen was detected in 52% (164 of 310) of admissions and in 74% (43 of 58) with complete sample sets. Streptococcuspneumoniae was the most common pathogen (61 of 310, 20%; incidence: 4.1/10000). Viruses were identified in 15% (47 of 310; incidence: 3.1/10000), Mycoplasmapneumoniae were identified in 12% (36 of 310; incidence: 2.4/10000), and multiple pathogens were identified in 10% (30 of 310; incidence: 2.0/10000). Recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of M pneumoniae (P < .001), whereas a lack of recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of S pneumoniae (P = .02). Symptoms and outcomes were similar irrespective of microbial etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococci, M pneumoniae, and viruses are the most common pathogens associated with CAP requiring hospital admission, and they all have a similar incidence that increases with age.

It is vital to know the changes that occur due to the biological structure of the person than the disease effect in these tests to manage the fatal disease better. Method Blood samples were taken on the first, third, and fifth days from 30 healthy volunteers, 15 of whom were smokers, 15 were non-smokers, and D-dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen tests were studied with repeated measurements. After the data was processed for normality and homogeneity and removing extreme values, CVA, CVI, CVG, CVT, RCV, II, I%, B%, TE% values were calculated via a complete nested ANOVA design, according to Callum G, Fraser, and EFLM. Results CVI and CVG values of D-dimer were calculated as 49.07% and 40.69% for all individuals, 49.26% and 27.71% for smokers, 48.80% and 51.67% for non-smokers, respectively. In terms of fibrinogen, the same analyzes for all individuals were calculated as 11.18% and 10.62%, 3.25% and 20.17% for smokers, 9.11% and 6.79% for non-smokers, respectively. The same ferritin analyses were calculated as 23.74% and 63.31% for all individuals, 34.98% and 35.24% for smokers, 30.53% and 74.87% for non-smokers, respectively. Conclusion Changes in D-dimer measurements every other day in healthy individuals can be observed depending on the biological characteristics of the individuals, and the population-based reference interval may be insufficient for clinical evaluation. Therefore, each individual should be evaluated within themselves. When assessing the results of ferritin and fibrinogen in non-smoking individuals, it should be taken into account that significant differences may occur between individuals. Besides, it should be kept in mind that there may be considerable changes due to biological variation in the repeated measurements of ferritin every other day.","output":"A biological variation-based approach to the day-to-day changes of D-dimer, Fibrinogen, and Ferritin levels that are crucial in the clinical course of COVID-19 in healthy smokers and non-smokers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Big data has been reported widely to facilitate epidemic prevention and control in health care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Our screening system integrates data sources in four dimensions, which includes Health Quick Response (QR) code, abroad travelling history, transportation close contact personnel and key surveillance personnel. Its screening targets cover all patients, care partner and staff who come to the hospital. As of November 2021, nearly 690 000 people and 5.79 million person-time had used automated COVID-19 risk screening and monitoring. A total of 10 376 person-time (0.18%) with abnormal QR code were identified, 242 person-time with abroad travelling history were identified, 925 person-time were marked based on the data of key surveillance personnel, no transportation history personnel been reported and no COVID-19 nosocomial infection occurred in the hospital.

The cecropin-like region from heteroscorpine-1 (CeHS-1) is similar to cecropin B, but it lost its glycine-proline hinge region. The bioinformatics prediction was used to help the designing of mutant peptides. The addition of glycine-proline hinge and positively charged amino acids, the deletion of negatively charged amino acids, and the optimization of the hydrophobicity of the peptide resulted in two mutant peptides, namely, CeHS-1 GP and CeHS-1 GPK. The new mutant peptide showed higher antimicrobial activity than the native peptide without increasing toxicity. The interaction of the peptides with the membrane showed that the peptides were capable of disrupting both the inner and outer bacterial cell membrane.

This outbreak not only affected healthcare systems but the resultant economic losses were also enormous. COVID-19 has demanded that the health care systems globally evolve, develop new strategies, identify new models of functioning, and at times, fall back on the old conservative methods of orthopedic care to decrease the risk of disease transmission. Although, the majority of hospitals are refraining from performing elective surgeries, emergent and urgent procedures cannot be delayed. Various strategies have been developed at the institute level to reduce the risk of infection transmission among the theatre team from an unsuspected patient (asymptomatic and presymptomatic) during the perioperative period. Material and methods The present study is a part of an ongoing project which is being conducted in a tertiary level hospital after obtaining research review board approval. All patients admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The present study included 13 patients (nine males and four females) with an average age of 35.4 years The oldest patient was of 63 years which is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 infection. Results Eight patients (61.5%) presented with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to vertebral fracture with fall from height (87.5%) as the most common etiology. Among the traumatic SCI patients, six (75%) were managed surgically with posterior decompression and instrumented fusion with pedicle screws while two patients (25%) were managed conservatively. There were four patients (30.8%) of tuberculosis of the spine of whom two (50%) were managed with posterior decompression, debridement, and stabilization with pedicle screws, samples for culture, biopsy, and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) were collected during the procedure; for the remaining two patients (50%), a trans-pedicular biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis for initiation of anti-tubercular therapy. Prolapsed intervertebral disc causing cauda equina syndrome was the reason for emergency surgery in one patient (7.7%). COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed in four patients (30.8%), in whom the most common symptom was fever (two patients (50%)). These patients were residents of high prevalence area for COVID-19 infection. Sore throat (25%), fatigue (25%), and low oxygen saturation (25%) were present in one patient which prompted us to get the COVID-19 test. All patients were reported negative for COVID-19. Conclusion The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce infection risk and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched available medical resources. These precautions helped us to reduce transmission and exposure to COVID-19 in health care workers (HCW) and patients in our institute.

Moreover, it is to be noted that cytokine storm has become an important cause for the rising mortality. However, the efforts for the development of drugs, vaccines and treatment has also been intervened due to poor understanding of host's defense mechanism and also due to the development of cytokine storm against this viral infection. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the immune dysregulation and cytokine storm development might give us clues for the clinical management of the severe cases. Hence, we have implemented differential gene expression analysis together with protein-protein interaction and Gene Ontology (GO) studies with the help of Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) data sets such as GSE1739 and GSE33267 to give us more knowledge on the host immune response for the pathogenic coronavirus which in turn reduces the mortality. A total of 79 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in our data set using the filters such as P-value and log2 fold change values of less than 0.05 and 1.5 respectively. Further, network analysis and GO studies showed that differential expression of two hub genes namely ELANE and LTF which could induce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. We are certain that differential expression of ELANE and LTF results in an excessive inflammatory reaction known as the cytokine storm and ultimately leading to death. Therefore, targeting these key drivers of cytokine storm genes appears to be the potential therapeutic targets for combating the Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection ultimately resulting in reduced mortality. Indeed, this predictive view may open new insights for designing an immune intervention for COVID-19 in the near future resulting in the mitigation of mortality rate.","output":"Gene expression profiling of corona virus microarray datasets to identify crucial targets in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: We present the development of a day-case total hip arthroplasty (THA) pathway in a UK National Health Service institution in conjunction with an extensive evidence-based summary of the interventions used to achieve successful day-case THA to which the protocol is founded upon.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from United States residents in New Jersey, New York, and Washington who requested medication abortion from 3 family physicians using the online service from Aid Access between April and November 2020. This study seeks to examine individual characteristics, motivations, and geographic locations of patients receiving abortion care through the Aid Access platform. RESULTS: Over 7 months, three family physicians using the Aid Access platform provided medication abortion care to 534 residents of New Jersey, New York, and Washington. There were no demographic differences between patients seeking care in these states. A high percentage (85%) were less than 7 weeks gestation at the time of their request for care. The reasons patients chose Aid Access for abortion services were similar regardless of state residence. The majority (71%) of Aid Access users lived in urban areas. Each family physician provided care to most counties in their respective states. Among those who received services in the three states, almost one-quarter (24%) lived in high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) counties, with roughly one-third living in medium-high SVI counties (33%), followed by another quarter (26%) living in medium-low SVI counties. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians successfully provided medication abortion in three states using asynchronous online consultations and medications mailed directly to patients.

ED encounters from the only academic medical center in Mississippi were extracted from March-December 2019 and 2020, totaling 2,842 pediatric (ages 4C17) and 17,887 adult (ages 18C89) patients. Visits were coded based on primary ED diagnosis. For adults, there were fewer depression/anxiety ED visits during the pandemic, not moderated by any demographic factor, but no differences for serious mental illness or alcohol/substance use. For youth, there were significantly fewer ED visits for behavior problems during the pandemic among children in the lower socioeconomic status (SES) category; there were no differences for depression/anxiety. Regardless of year, adults in the lower SES category were more likely to visit the ED for mental health, Black adults were less likely to visit the ED for depression/anxiety or alcohol/substance use, and Black children were less likely to visit the ED for behavioral concerns. Results suggest that access to outpatient and telehealth services remains critical for mental health care during the pandemic and underline the importance of race- and SES-related factors in use of the ED for mental health concerns beyond the pandemic.","output":"Racial and demographic disparities in emergency department utilization for mental health concerns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Gated communities (GCs) in China are less commonly perceived as a negative and segregated urban form of community compared to other contexts, owing to their wide variety and relative openness. Yet, the enhanced security zone function and the popularity of GCs, along with the heightened segregation and exclusion effects, mean they are most likely to emerge in post-pandemic urban China because of the perceived effectiveness of GCs in preventing health risks by excluding outsiders during the pandemic. Drawing on empirical data from Beijing, this research presents strong evidence for a strengthened perceived security zone effect of GCs during the pandemic. Given that rigid pandemic control measures were organized at the community level, a large-scale household survey in Beijing suggests that residents commonly recognise the effectiveness of GCs in security control and show a strong preference for GCs over open communities after the pandemic, even though there is a lack of direct evidence of reduced COVID-19 risk in GCs. The heightened perceived security zone function of GCs has shown a significant impact on the housing market, evidenced by an increase of 2% in the housing prices for GCs, compared with those of open communities. The rising popularity of GCs is also evidenced by a significant increase in property viewings by potential homebuyers and smaller price discounts in actual transactions in gated communities vis--vis open communities. We argue that the rising risk-averse sentiment in the post-pandemic era has given rise to the popularity of GCs. This study provides timely and fresh insights into the changing meaning of GCs in post-pandemic China.","output":"The Heightened Security Zone Function of Gated Communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Changing Housing Market Dynamic: Evidence from Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anatomic variations and congenital anomalies involving the gallbladder position, shape, and number are frequently encountered on routine abdominal imagings and at surgery. However, most have no clinical significance, but their recognition is important because they may predispose to gallbladder diseases, serve as a potential source of confusion and diagnostic pitfalls for radiologists and surgeons, and increase the risk of inadvertent injury during biliary tract surgery or intervention. We observed an intra-mesocolic gallbladder found unexpectedly during the cholecystectomy in a 65-year-old male patient who was being operated on for acute calculous cholecystitis. An abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan reported no anomalous or malpositioned gallbladder pre-operatively. As the location of this organ could not be definitely clarified in his previous operation elsewhere, we performed an explorative lapa-rotomy. There was no gallbladder at the normal position. The organ was found embedded deeply within the proximal portion of the transverse mesocolon, and then it was successfully excised.

We considered an experiment where microcosms were inoculated with natural seawater and the selection regime was switched from K-selection (by continuous feeding) to r-selection (by pulse feeding) and vice versa. We found the networks of significant co-occurrences to contain clusters of taxonomically related bacteria having positive associations. Comparing this with the time dynamics, we found that the clusters most likely were results of similar niche preferences of the involved bacteria. In particular, the distinction between r- or K-strategists was evident. Each selection regime seemed to give rise to a specific pattern, to which the community converges regardless of its prehistory. Furthermore, the results proved robust to parameter choices in the analysis, such as the filtering threshold, level of random noise, replacing absolute abundances with relative abundances, and the choice of similarity measure. Even though our data and approaches cannot directly predict ecological interactions, our approach provides insights on how the selection regime affects the composition of the microbial community, providing a basis for aquaculture experiments targeted at eliminating opportunistic fish pathogens.","output":"Robust bacterial co-occurence community structures are independent of r- and K-selection history"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host functional receptor for the new virus SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 ACE2 is expressed in 72 different cell types Some factors that can affect the expression of the ACE2 are: sex, environment, comorbidities, medications (e g anti-hypertensives) and its interaction with other genes of the renin-angiotensin system and other pathways Different factors can affect the risk of infection of SARS-CoV-2 and determine the severity of the symptoms The ACE2 enzyme is a negative regulator of RAS expressed in various organ systems It is with immunity, inflammation, increased coagulopathy, and cardiovascular disease In this review, we describe the genetic and molecular functions of the ACE2 receptor and its relation with the physiological and pathological conditions to better understand how this receptor is involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 In addition, it reviews the different comorbidities that interact with SARS-CoV-2 in which also ACE2 plays an important role It also describes the different factors that interact with the virus that have an influence in the expression and functional activities of the receptor The goal is to provide the reader with an understanding of the complexity and importance of this receptor","output":"ACE2: the molecular doorway to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of lentiviral vectors in curing fatal genetic and acquired diseases has opened a new era in human gene therapy.

Two closely but biologically distinct variants have been described. HHV-6 variant B causes the common childhood disease exhanthem subitum, and although the pathologic characteristics for HHV-6 variant A are less well defined, HHV-6A has been suggested to be more neurotropic. We studied the effect of both HHV-6 variants in an oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3.13). Infection of M03.13 was monitored by cytopathic effect (CPE), quantitative TaqMan PCR for viral DNA in cells and supernatant, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) to detect viral protein expression. HHV-6A infection induced significantly more CPE than infection with HHV-6B. HHV-6B induced an abortive infection associated with a decrease of the initial viral DNA load over time, early RNA expression, and no expression of viral antigen. In contrast, infection with HHV-6A DNA persisted in cells for at least 62 days. During the acute phase of infection with HHV-6A, intracellular and extracellular viral load increased and cells expressed the viral protein IE-2 and gp116/54/64. No HHV-6A RNA or protein was expressed after 30 days post infection, suggesting that HHV-6A formed a latent infection. These studies provide in vitro support to the hypothesis that HHV-6 can actively infect oligodendrocytes. Our results suggest that HHV-6A and HHV-6B have different tropism in MO3.13 cells and that an initially active HHV-6A infection can develop latency.

A cohort from three French University Hospitals was analysed in ICUs between 15th of March and the 15th of April 2020. Patients admitted to ICU with positive COVID-19 test and mechanically ventilated were recruited. RESULTS: Among the 133 patients included in the study, 95 (71%) were male patients and median age was 63 years old (interquartile range: 54-71). Overall ICU mortality was 11%. Mode of transport included train (48 patients), ambulance (6 patients), and plane plus helicopter (14 patients). During their ICU stay, 7 (10%) transferred patients and 8 (12%) non-transferred patients died (p = 0.71). Median SAPS II score at admission was 33 (interquartile range: 25-46) for the transferred group and 35 (27-42) for non-transferred patients (p = 0.53). SOFA score at admission was 4 (3-6) for the transferred group versus 3 (2-5) for the non-transferred group (p = 0.25). In the transferred group, median PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) value in the 24 h before departure was 197 mmHg (160-250) and remained 166 mmHg (125-222) in the first 24 h post arrival (p = 0.13).

This work deals with the question how to verify global compliance if affected tasks are not fully visible. Our idea is to decompose GCRs into so called assertions that can be checked by each affected partner whereby the decomposition is both correct and lossless. The algorithm exploits transitivity properties of the underlying rule specification, and its correctness and complexity are proven, considering advanced aspects such as loops.

It is the first HSU score based on item response theory (IRT) and has demonstrated favorable psychometric properties in first analyses. The PROPr combines the seven PROMIS domains: cognition, depression, fatigue, pain, physical function, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. It was developed based on preferences of the US general population. The aim of this study was to validate the PROPr in a German inpatient sample and to compare it to the EQ-5D. METHODS: We collected PROPr and EQ-5D-5L data from 141 patients undergoing inpatient treatment in the rheumatology and psychosomatic departments. We evaluated the criterion and convergent validity, and ceiling and floor effects of the PROPr and compared those characteristics to those of the EQ-5D. RESULTS: The mean PROPr (0.26, 95% CI: 0.23; 0.29) and the mean EQ-5D (0.44, 95% CI: 0.38; 0.51) scores differed significantly (d = 0.18, p < 0.001). Compared to the EQ-5D, the PROPr scores were less scattered across the measurement range which has resulted in smaller confidence intervals of the mean scores. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two scores was r = 0.72 (p < 0.001). Both scores showed fair agreement with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.48 (p < 0.05). The PROPr and EQ-5D demonstrated similar discrimination power across sex, age, and conditions. While the PROPr showed a floor effect, the EQ-5D showed a ceiling effect. CONCLUSION: The PROPr measures HSU considerably lower than the EQ-5D as a result of different construction, anchors and measurement ranges. Because QALYs derived with the EQ-5D are widely considered state-of-the-art, application of the PROPr for QALY measurements would be problematic.

RESULTS: The present study revealed that within a 10 year duration the private clinic gives anti-TB treatment coverage for 582 patients whereas the governmental health center treats 510 patients. The treatment success rate of the private clinic is 98.1% which is 1.03-fold that of the governmental health center (95.3%); while the treatment failure of the private clinic was 0.2%, but there was no treatment failure in the governmental health center. CONCLUSION: Both sectors achieved the expected WHO targets by newly recommended strategy for TB treatment, DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) and treatment success is much better to standard. This shows good progress of DOTS strategy and a decrease of noncompliance in this area. Age, educational level, and the types of TB diagnosis and treatment outcome of the patients were statistically associated in both sectors. Better counseling and awareness about the disease should have to be given for every anti-TB treatment receiving patients, despite their educational level and occupational status in both sectors.","output":"Comparing the Treatment Outcomes of Tuberculosis Patients in a Private Clinic with a Governmental Health Center in Jimma City, Ethiopia: Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility of contamination of human skin by infectious virions plays an important role in indirect transmission of respiratory viruses but little is known about the fundamental physico-chemical aspects of the virus-skin interactions. In the case of coronaviruses, the interaction with surfaces (including the skin surface) is mediated by their large glycoprotein spikes that protrude from (and cover) the viral envelope. Here, we perform all atomic simulations between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models. We consider an \\"oily\\" skin covered by sebum and a \\"clean\\" skin exposing the stratum corneum. The simulations show that the spike tries to maximize the contacts with stratum corneum lipids, particularly ceramides, with substantial hydrogen bonding. In the case of \\"oily\\" skin, the spike is able to retain its structure, orientation and hydration over sebum with little interaction with sebum components. Comparison of these results with our previous simulations of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with hydrophilic and hydrophobic solid surfaces, suggests that the\\"soft\\" or \\"hard\\" nature of the surface plays an essential role in the interaction of the spike protein with materials.","output":"Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models: a molecular dynamics study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Inadequate pregnancy monitoring for pregnant migrant women without medical insurance (PMWMI) exposes them to severe complications during childbirth and consequences for the health of their child (e.g. preterm delivery, low birth weight, etc.).

To our knowledge, trypsin ZT is the first thoroughly characterized group III trypsin. A more detailed understanding of trypsin ZT biochemistry may give insight into its physiological role as well as its potential use within the biotechnology sector. Stability is an important factor when it comes to practical applications of enzymes. Compared to trypsin I, trypsin ZT shows differences in pH and heat stability, sensitivity to inhibitors and sub-site substrate specificity as shown by multiplex substrate profiling analysis. Based on the analysis, trypsin ZT cleaved at arginine and lysine as other trypsins. Furthermore, trypsin ZT is better than trypsin I in cleaving peptides containing several consecutive positively charged residues. Lysine- and arginine-rich amino acid sequences are frequently found in human viral proteins. Thus, trypsin ZT may be effective in inactivating human and fish viruses implying a possible role for the enzyme in the natural defence of Atlantic cod.

Eligible studies were randomised trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardised form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included 3 randomised trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions about the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is not possible to balance the potential benefits, if any, with the adverse effects and costs.

The most dominant immune cells in the brain are microglia. Yet, the relationship between neurological manifestations, neuroinflammation, and host immune response of microglia to SARS-CoV-2 has not been well characterized. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human microglia, eliciting M1-like pro-inflammatory responses, followed by cytopathic effects. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infected human microglial clone 3 (HMC3), leading to inflammatory activation and cell death. RNA-seq analysis also revealed that ER stress and immune responses were induced in the early and apoptotic processes in the late phase of viral infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected HMC3 showed the M1 phenotype and produced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor  (TNF-), but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. After this pro-inflammatory activation, SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted both intrinsic and extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptosis in HMC3. Using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, murine microglia were also infected by intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. This infection induced the acute production of pro-inflammatory microglial IL-6 and TNF- and provoked a chronic loss of microglia. Our findings suggest that microglia are potential mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological problems and, consequently, can be targets of therapeutic strategies against neurological diseases in COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Recent studies reported neurological manifestations and complications in COVID-19 patients, which are associated with neuroinflammation. As microglia are the dominant immune cells in brains, it needs to be elucidate the relationship between neuroinflammation and host immune response of microglia to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human microglia with cytopathic effect (CPE) using human microglial clone 3 (HMC3). The infected microglia were promoted to pro-inflammatory activation following apoptotic cell death. This pro-inflammatory activation was accompanied by the high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and led to neurotoxic-M1 phenotype polarization. In vivo, murine microglia were infected and produced pro-inflammatory cytokines and provoked a chronic loss using K18-hACE2 mice. Thus, our data present that SARS-CoV-2-infected microglia are potential mediators of neurological problems in COVID-19 patients. In addition, HMC3 cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit the CPE, which can be further used to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation reported in COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Microglia Elicits Pro-inflammatory Activation and Apoptotic Cell Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 1889, The British Medical Journal published a piece titled, \\"Detective Medicine,\\" which describes feats of medical detection performed by physicians attending malingering prisoners.

Chronic exposure to such drugs might lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). AIM: To assess COVID-19 incidence and risk of hospitalisation in a cohort of patients chronically taking chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: We used linked health administration databases to follow a cohort of patients with chronic prescription of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and a control cohort matched by age, sex and primary care service area, between 1 January and 30 April 2020. COVID-19 cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes. RESULTS: We analysed a cohort of 6,746 patients (80% female) with active prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and 13,492 controls. During follow-up, there were 97 (1.4%) COVID-19 cases in the exposed cohort and 183 (1.4%) among controls. The incidence rate was very similar between the two groups (12.05 vs 11.35 cases/100,000 person-days). The exposed cohort was not at lower risk of infection compared with controls (hazard ratio (HR): 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83C1.44; p = 0.50). Forty cases (0.6%) were admitted to hospital in the exposed cohort and 50 (0.4%) in the control cohort, suggesting a higher hospitalisation rate in the former, though differences were not confirmed after adjustment (HR: 146; 95% CI: 0.91C2.34; p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Patients chronically exposed to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine did not differ in risk of COVID-19 nor hospitalisation, compared with controls.

The receptor binding is the first step of viral infection. Predicting virus-receptor interactions will be helpful for the interaction mechanism of viruses and receptors, and further find some effective ways of preventing and treating viral infectious diseases so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses. Some computation algorithms have been proposed for identifying potential virus-receptor interactions. However, a common problem in those methods is the presence of noise in the similarity network. A new computational model (Network Enhancement and the Regularized Least Squares [NERLS]) is proposed to predict virus-receptor interactions based on improving similarities by Network Enhancement (NE). NERLS integrates the virus sequence similarity, the receptor sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions. We compute the virus sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions to construct the virus similarity network. The receptor similarity network is constructed by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. To obtain the final virus similarity network and the final receptor similarity network, NE is, respectively, applied for reducing the noise of the virus similarity network and the receptor similarity network. Finally, NERLS employs the regularized least squares to predict interactions of viruses and receptors. The experiment results show that NERLS achieves the area under curve value of 0.893 and 0.921 in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, respectively, which is consistently superior to four related methods [which include Initial interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square (IILLS), Bi-random walk on a heterogeneous network (BRWH), Laplacian regularized least squares classifier (LapRLS), and Collaborative matrix factorization (CMF)].

While studies have assessed burnout globally in various individual countries, few studies directly compare or analyze gender-based physician burnout among different global regions. METHODS Female physicians attending the Medical Women's International Association (MWIA) Centennial Congress completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) which evaluates personal-, work-, and patient-related burnout using a scale of 0 to 100. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and 1-way ANOVA to compare burnout scores amongst women physicians from different global regions. RESULTS Of 100 physicians invited to participate, 76 provided responses and 71 met the inclusion criteria. Mean burnout scores were highest amongst women from Africa in all categories. Mean work-related, patient-related, and personal-related burnout scores were significantly lower for physicians in Europe compared to Africa (p = 0.05) when evaluated using a 1-way ANOVA, with no statistically significant differences between other regions. DISCUSSION The data suggests that there may be regional differences in the prevalence of burnout in women physicians. Various factors could play a role in explaining the higher burnout scores in female physicians in Africa, including younger average age, establishing practice during childbearing years, and significant physician shortage.

In relation with these measures, particularly with the staying at home, increasing rates of domestic violence are beginning to surface. Hence, this study was aimed at determining the prevalence of intimate partner violence against reproductive age women in northern Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. The data were collected during the period of April to May, 2020 using interviews and a self-administered standard questionnaire. The data were entered into the Epi-data manager version 4.2 and exported to SPSS 22 for analysis. The descriptive analysis such as frequency distribution, percentage, and measures of central tendency were used. This was followed by binary and multiple logistic regression analysis to infer the association between the outcome and independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 682 participants were included in the study. The prevalence of intimate partner violence against women was found to stood at 24.6% with psychological violence being the most prevalent (13.3%), followed by physical (8.3%) and sexual violence (5.3%). Women were more likely to suffer from violence if they were housewives (AOR, 95% CI (18.062 (10.088, 32.342))), age less than 30 (AOR, 95% CI (23.045 (5.627, 94.377))), women with arrange marriage (AOR, 95% CI (2.535 (1.572, 4.087))) and women with husband's age being \\"between\\" 31-40 (AOR, CI 95% (2.212 (1.024, 4.777))).

Existing literature does not identify the length of time between suspecting pregnancy and attending their first prenatal visit. Identifying this potential window for change is critical for clinical practice, intervention programming and policy change. METHODS: The study sample was composed of women in the United States who responded to the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Systems survey in 2016, for the following questionswhen they first suspected pregnancy, when they attended their first prenatal visit, were they able to receive prenatal care as early as they wished, and perceived barriers to receiving prenatal care. RESULTS: On average, participants became certain they were pregnant at 6.0 (SE = 0.1) weeks gestation, while participants reported having their first prenatal care visit at 9.3 (SE = 0.1) weeks, with clear health disparities by race, age, WIC participation, education level, and marital status. About 15% of women reported not receiving prenatal care as early as they wished. Structural or financial barriers in the health care system were common: 38.1% reported that no appointments available, 28.2% reported not having money or insurance to pay for the visit, 27.3% reported that the doctor or health plan would not start care, and 22.5% reported not having a Medicaid card. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study illustrates a window for opportunity to provide earlier prenatal care, which would facilitate earlier implementation of prenatal counseling. Strategies to address barriers to care on the patient, provider and systemic levels, particularly among vulnerable population groups, are warranted. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT? Seeking prenatal care early is associated with better health outcomes for women and infants. A window of opportunity exists between suspecting pregnancy and attending a first prenatal visit. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS? Clear health disparities were apparent in both recognizing their pregnancies, and receiving early prenatal care by race, age, WIC participation, education level, and marital status.

METHODS: We used a multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IFN- in 100 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at admission to University Hospital Southampton (UK). Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Age > 70 years was the strongest predictor of death (OR 28, 95% CI 5.94, 139.45). IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1 and IL-33 were significantly associated with adverse outcome.

We used machine learning (ML) methods as decision trees and cut-off points created by the OneR package to add new aspects, even in smaller cohorts. RESULTS: Among a total of 37 patients, 24 suffered higher-grade renal failure, 20 of whom required kidney replacement therapy. More than 40% of patients remained on hemodialysis after intensive care unit discharge or died (27%). Due to frequent anuria proteinuria measured in two-thirds of the patients, it was not predictive for the investigated endpoints; albuminuria was higher in patients with AKI 3, but the difference was not significant. ML found cut-off points of >31.4 kg/m(2) for BMI and >69 years for age, constructed decision trees with great accuracy, and identified highly predictive variables for outcome and remaining chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Different ML methods and their clinical application, especially decision trees, can provide valuable support for clinical decisions. Presence of proteinuria was not predictive of CKD or AKI and should be confirmed in a larger cohort.","output":"COVID-19 and the kidney: A retrospective analysis of 37 critically ill patients using machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks remain a threat to polio eradication. To reduce cases of polio from cVDPV of serotype 2, the serotype 2 component of the vaccine has been removed from the global vaccine supply, but outbreaks of cVDPV2 have continued. The objective of this work is to understand the factors associated with later detection in order to improve detection of these unwanted events. Methods: The number of nucleotide differences between each cVDPV outbreak and the oral polio vaccine (OPV) strain was used to approximate the time from emergence to detection. Only independent emergences were included in the analysis. Variables such as serotype, surveillance quality, and World Health Organization (WHO) region were tested in a negative binomial regression model to ascertain whether these variables were associated with higher nucleotide differences upon detection. Results: In total, 74 outbreaks were analysed from 24 countries between 2004 and 2019. For serotype 1 (n=10), the median time from seeding until outbreak detection was 284 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 284-2008) days, for serotype 2 (n=59), 276 (95% UI 172-765) days, and for serotype 3 (n=5), 472 (95% UI 392-603) days. Significant improvement in the time to detection was found with increasing surveillance of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and adequate stool collection. Conclusions: cVDPVs remain a risk globally; all WHO regions have reported at least one VDPV outbreak since the first outbreak in 2001. Maintaining surveillance for poliomyelitis after local elimination is essential to quickly respond to both emergence of VDPVs and potential importations. Considerable variation in the time between emergence and detection of VDPVs were apparent, and other than surveillance quality and inclusion of environmental surveillance, the reasons for this remain unclear.","output":"The impact of surveillance and other factors on detection of emergent and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe courses of COVID-19 are associated with elevated levels of interleukin 6. However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective single-center registry, we included SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 24) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative control (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of interleukin-6 in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The data from this registry reveals that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while interleukin-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.","output":"Serum protein profiling reveals a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States despite decades of treatment advances. While death rates have fallen for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, death rates remain high for the majority of malignancies, primarily given the late stage at which they are diagnosed. The US Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends routine screening for just 4 cancers: breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung (for high-risk individuals); for prostate cancer, recommendations support individual decision making. However, cancers without recommended screening tests account for 71% of cancer deaths in the United States. In addition, screening rates remain below national goals, with numerous barriers to population-based screening. Recently, initial results of studies on blood-based multicancer early detection tests, which rely on measurement of a range of analytes, demonstrate the potential to identify multiple cancers in a single blood test and detect many cancers for which no screening tests are currently recommended. Blood-based tests have the potential to be more accessible and easier to disseminate than organ-specific tests. However, it remains unclear if their use can reduce deaths from these cancers. Other issues include cost-effectiveness, the impact of false-positive and false-negative results on patients and costs, and uptake among individuals and clinicians.

Closures of schools, sport clubs and facilities because of COVID-19 reduced the opportunities to participate in PA. We aimed to examine physical activity levels of late adolescents, the contexts to be physical active and its changes during the spring 2020 lockdown. METHODS: A national representative sample of late adolescents in general upper secondary school (n = 2408, females = 64%, mean age = 17.2y, SD = 0.63) completed self-report online surveys on PA behaviours between March and June 2020. Multinominal logistic regression analyses were performed to identify correlates with PA, and decision tree analyses to ascertain the perceived changes on PA during lockdown based on sport club aspirations and levels of PA. RESULTS: Among the late adolescents, the distribution of PA frequency was 23% (0-2 days/week), 35% (3-4 days/week), 30% (5C6 days/week) and 12% (7 days/week), and differences between males and females were not statistically significant. Participation in both indoor and outdoor PA were 50 times more likely to report daily PA (OR = 54.28, CI = 15.16C194.37) than non-participation. A quarter of late adolescents were not part of a sports club, yet their PA levels increased. Although sports club members generally perceived they did less PA during lockdown, over a third of sport club members with competitive aspirations reported daily PA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, most late adolescents reported their PA levels decreased during lockdown.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) is an ideal target for viral antigen-based detection. A rapid and convenient method was developed based on fluorescence immunochromatographic (FIC) assay to detect the SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen. However, the accuracy of this diagnostic method needs to be examined. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out between February 10 and 15, 2020 in 7 hospitals of Wuhan and 1 hospital of Chongqing, China. Participants with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. NP antigen testing by FIC assay and nucleic acid (NA) testing by RT-PCR were performed simultaneously in a blind manner with the same nasopharyngeal swab sample. The diagnostic accuracy of NP antigen testing was calculated by taking NA testing of RT-PCR as reference standard, in which samples with cycle threshold (Ct) value  40 were interpreted as SARS-CoV-2 positives. RESULTS: A total of 253 participants were enrolled and 2 participants were excluded from the analyses due to invalid NP testing results. Of 251 participants (99.2%) that were included in the diagnostic accuracy analysis, a total of 201 participants (80.1%) had a Ct value 40.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (R(obs)) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate R(obs). RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of 5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and R(obs) for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases.

Dysregulated metabolism might lead to excessive inflammatory and autoimmune responses as observed in severe and long COVID-19 patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing of patient-derived lung and mucosal samples show differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels.

In addition to common investigation, examination of troponin T (n = 18) and anti-heart antibodies (AHA, n = 34) were used. The average hospital period was 14 [12; 18] days. RESULTS: The incidence of cardiovascular disease and symptoms was 45.3%. Arrhythmias, heart failure, low-QRS voltage, repolarization disorders, and pericardial effusion were the typical for coronavirus cardiac injury. The level of AHA was increased in 73.5%. Significant (p < 0.05) correlations of AHA level with inflammatory activity, pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac symptoms, and death were found. D-dimer >0.5 g/mL had a sensitivity of 79.2% and specificity of 60% in the prediction of cardiovascular manifestations. Cardiac failure was one of the causes of death in 3/8 patients (37.5%). Lethality in the presence of cardiovascular pathology was 17.9 versus 2.2% without it, p < 0.05. The most powerful prognostic model includes age, diabetes, oxygen therapy volume, maximum leukocyte level, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer (correlation coefficient 0.871, p < 0.001).

However, concerns have been raised regarding the potential unintended impacts of gene-drive systems. This Review summarizes the phenomenal progress in this field, focusing on optimal design features for full-drive elements (drives with linked Cas9 and guide RNA components) that either suppress target mosquito populations or modify them to prevent pathogen transmission, allelic drives for updating genetic elements, mitigating strategies including trans-complementing split-drives and genetic neutralizing elements, and the adaptation of drive technology to other organisms. These scientific advances, combined with ethical and social considerations, will facilitate the transparent and responsible advancement of these technologies towards field implementation.","output":"Gene drives gaining speed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They are therefore recommended to follow a healthy diet and be physically active in order to reduce that risk. However, achieving and maintaining these behaviours in the postpartum period is challenging. This study sought to explore womens views on suggested practical approaches to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and physical activity to reduce T2DM risk. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in Cambridgeshire, UK were conducted at three to 48 months after GDM. The participants current diet and physical activity, intentions for any changes, and views on potential interventions to help manage T2DM risk through these behaviours were discussed. Framework analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. The interview schedule, suggested interventions, and thematic framework were based on a recent systematic review. RESULTS: Most of the participants wanted to eat more healthily and be more active. A third of the participants considered that postpartum support for these behaviours would be transformative, a third thought it would be beneficial, and a third did not want additional support. The majority agreed that more information about the impact of diet and physical activity on diabetes risk, support to exercise with others, and advice about eating healthily, exercising with a busy schedule, monitoring progress and sustaining changes would facilitate a healthy diet and physical activity. Four other suggested interventions received mixed responses. It would be acceptable for this support to be delivered throughout pregnancy and postpartum through a range of formats. Clinicians were seen to have important roles in giving or signposting to support. CONCLUSIONS: Many women would appreciate more support to reduce their T2DM risk after GDM and believe that a variety of interventions to integrate changes into their daily lives would help them to sustain healthier lifestyles.","output":"Post-GDM support would be really good for mothers: A qualitative interview study exploring how to support a healthy diet and physical activity after gestational diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kinesin Family Member 23 (KIF23), a cell cycle regulator, has a key task in cytokinesis. KIF23 over-expression in cancer has been associated with tumor growth, progression, and poor prognosis, indicating a potential to be a cancer biomarker. A mutation in KIF23 (c.2747C > G, p.P916R) was shown to cause congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type III (CDA III). To-date, fifteen KIF23 transcripts have been annotated, but their expression is poorly investigated. We hypothesized that tissue specific expression of a particular transcript can be critical for CDA III phenotype. In this study, we quantified expression of alternative Kif23 transcripts in a mouse model with human KIF23 mutation and investigated its association with a regulator of alternative splicing, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). We confirmed presence of an additional exon 8 in both human and mouse KIF23 transcripts. A transcript lacking exons 17 and 18 was ubiquitously expressed in mice while other isoforms were common in human tissues however in bone marrow of knock-in mice a transcript without exon 18 was prevalent as it was in bone marrow of a CDA III patient. We conclude that the possibility that the tissue specific expression of KIF23 alternative transcripts influence the CDA III phenotype cannot be neglected.","output":"Differential tissue specific expression of Kif23 alternative transcripts in mice with the human mutation causing congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrathin necklace-like Ag2Te nanowires with a diameter of 10 nm and a length of several micrometers are fabricated by a simple solution-based process at low temperature, and the Ag2Te nanowire films are fabricated by a Langmuir-Blodgett technique.

This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p < 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p = 0.011).

It is primarily based on two conventional methods - absorption spectra and colorimetric. While the low figure of merit (FoM) of the LSPR and high-concentration AuNPs requirement restrict their limit of detection (LOD), which is around ng to g per mL in antibody detection if there is no other signal or analytes amplification. By now, the improvement of sensitivity has bogged down for years. It also reveals a great challenge of the current LSPR immunoassay in biosensing - pushing the boundary of the current LOD. Results: : In this work, we developed a spectral image contrast-based flow digital nanoplasmon-metry(FDNM) to push the LOD boundary. Comparing the scattering image brightness of AuNPs in two neighboring wavelength bands near the LSPR peak, the signal of peak shift is extremely amplified and quickly detected. Introducing the digital analysis, the FDNM provides an ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio and less sample volume requirement. Compared to conventional analog LSPR immunoassay, FDNM has a LOD down to 1 pg mL -1 within only a 15-minute detection time and 500 L sample volume. Antibody against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva that contained various proteins was also conducted to validate the detection of FDNM in complicated samples. Of the detection, FDNM shows significant discrimination with a LOD of 10 pg mL -1 and a broad dynamic detecting range of five orders of magnitude. Conclusion: Together with the quick readout time and simple operation, this work outstandingly demonstrated the high sensitivity and selectivity of the developed FDNM in rapid antibody detection. The spectral image contrast and digital analysis further provide a new generation LSPR immunoassay of AuNPs.","output":"Spectral Image Contrast Based Flow Digital Nanoplasmon-metry For Ultrasensitive Antibody Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic has had a great impact on various health sectors including pregnancy and infertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF), in utero insemination (IUI), ovulation-induction, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, and assisted reproductive techniques (ART) Due to the current situation in the COVID-19 pandemic and the relaxation permitted by the government, allowing nonessential services in a gradual manner, infertility services are being resumed according to the guidelines set by the ministry of health and family welfare To meet the demands of current situation, the patient and the staff should be triaged Only those patients should be undertaken who are tested or screened negative Diagnostic evaluation is done using RT-PCR and the testing should be done at the commencement of treatment, that is, on day 2 of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle Repeat test is done before the hCG trigger The husband also needs testing at least once during the cycle, preferably at the start of the cycle If the donor tests positive for COVID-19, the cycle should be cancelled Universal good practices should be followed in laboratory also by each staff, which includes use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) like eye protectors, FFP-2 or N-95 face masks, double gloves, shoe covers, disposable impermeable gowns, and face shields The sanitization of the laboratory environment, equipment and devices should be done with appropriate nonembryotoxic disinfectants at the end of each procedure COVID-19 has actually changed the way infertility treatment is being provided, keeping in view the safety of both the doctors and the patient","output":"Infertility Treatment in COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the performance of Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) and Holt's models to forecast the weekly COVID-19 reported cases in six units of a large hospital.

Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets -CovidDialog- (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bears high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogues about COVID-19.

The conspiracy hermeneutics of the modern pandemic situation forms new mythologemes, including those arising as a result ofthe convergence ofthe mythologeme of harmful vaccination and the mythologeme of eschatological chipping: this is the origin of the concepts of a liquid chip and a nanochip, which were not previously recorded in the studied discourse. One of the basic mythologemes of the modern medical vaccinophobic myth is the mythologeme of chipping. The article examines its semantic structure. It comprises the following conceptions: total use of chips is an eschatological omen;everything marked with a \\"chip\\" becomes ritually impure and potentially dangerous;people marked with a chip become easily suggestible and generally easy to control;the chip is in a semiotic relationship with the \\"seal oft he Antichrist\\", being either its metaphor or its symbol. Within the framework of the vaccinophobic discourse, the mythologemes of chipping are presented in several versions, namely: (1) mythologeme \\"Liquid Chip\\" injected into the human body under the guise of a vaccine against coronavirus infection;(2) the mythologeme \\"Nanochip\\" does not differ significantly from the mythologeme \\"Liquid Chip\\" and is, in fact, its semiotic duplication;(3) mythologemes of forced chipping which are in an explicit semantic relationship with the theologeme \\"Seal of the Antichrist\\". In addition to the mythologemes associated with chipping, in the modern vaccinophobic discourse we have identified the following stable semantic complexes of varying degrees of mythologisation. These are \\"infection through disinfection\\";\\"secret collection of biological material\\";a complex of conspiracy mythologemes of malicious concealment of ways of simple and safe treatment of Coronavirus infection;connection of vaccination with \\"secret eugenics\\".

Therefore, colleges of pharmacy across the country likely included virtual advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) to fulfill experiential education requirements. The objective of this paper is to evaluate students' perceptions of virtual APPEs during the 2020-2021 academic year. Methods: Experiential directors and faculty at 3 colleges of pharmacy in the south Florida region developed a survey to assess students' perceptions of their virtual APPE rotations during the 2020-2021 academic year. Students who took at least one fully virtual APPE rotation were asked about their perceptions of these rotations. Results: A total of 349 students were invited to take the survey and 92 (26.3%) completed the survey. Of these, 77 students (83.7%) completed at least one virtual rotation. These students completed a total of 152 virtual rotations, with elective and ambulatory care rotations being the most frequent. Most students agreed that rotation objectives were clear, and preceptors offered resources needed to be successful during the rotation. Responses regarding engagement during virtual rotations, rotation expectations being met, and rotations expanding students' knowledge were mixed. Conclusions: Virtual rotations may present unique experiential opportunities for students. Colleges of pharmacy and preceptors can benefit from additional guidance regarding how to incorporate virtual rotations into the experiential curriculum.

We report a population-based analysis of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 with prior or current solid cancer versus those without cancer. METHODS: We analysed data of adult patients registered until 24 May 2020 in the Belgian nationwide database of Sciensano. The primary objective was in-hospital mortality within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with solid cancer versus patients without cancer. Severe event occurrence, a composite of intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation and/or death, was a secondary objective. These endpoints were analysed across different patient subgroups. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse the association between cancer and clinical characteristics (baseline analysis) and the effect of cancer on in-hospital mortality and on severe event occurrence, adjusting for clinical characteristics (in-hospital analysis). RESULTS: A total of 13 594 patients (of whom 1187 with solid cancer (8.7%)) were evaluable for the baseline analysis and 10 486 (892 with solid cancer (8.5%)) for the in-hospital analysis. Patients with cancer were older and presented with less symptoms/signs and lung imaging alterations. The 30-day in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with solid cancer compared with patients without cancer (31.7% vs 20.0%, respectively; adjusted OR (aOR) 1.34; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58). The aOR was 3.84 (95% CI 1.94 to 7.59) among younger patients (<60 years) and 2.27 (95% CI 1.41 to 3.64) among patients without other comorbidities. Severe event occurrence was similar in both groups (36.7% vs 28.8%; aOR 1.10; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: This population-based analysis demonstrates that solid cancer is an independent adverse prognostic factor for in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. This adverse effect was more pronounced among younger patients and those without other comorbidities.

Contrary to the focus of most contemporary work on disinformation, our findings suggest that this highly effective disinformation campaign, with potentially profound effects for both participation in and the legitimacy of the 2020 election, was an elite-driven, mass-media led process. Social media played only a secondary and supportive role.Our results are based on analyzing over fifty-five thousand online media stories, five million tweets, and seventy-five thousand posts on public Facebook pages garnering millions of engagements. They are consistent with our findings about the American political media ecosystem from 2015-2018, published in Network Propaganda , in which we found that Fox News and Donald Trumps own campaign were far more influential in spreading false beliefs than Russian trolls or Facebook clickbait artists. This dynamic appears to be even more pronounced in this election cycle, likely because Donald Trumps position as president and his leadership of the Republican Party allow him to operate directly through political and media elites, rather than relying on online media as he did when he sought to advance his then-still-insurgent positions in 2015 and the first half of 2016.Our findings here suggest that Donald Trump has perfected the art of harnessing mass media to disseminate and at times reinforce his disinformation campaign by using three core standard practices of professional journalism. These three are: elite institutional focus (if the President says it, its news);headline seeking (if it bleeds, it leads);and balance , neutrality, or the avoidance of the appearance of taking a side. He uses the first two in combination to summon coverage at will, and has used them continuously to set the agenda surrounding mail-in voting through a combination of tweets, press conferences, and television interviews on Fox News. He relies on the latter professional practice to keep audiences that are not politically pre-committed and have relatively low political knowledge confused, because it limits the degree to which professional journalists in mass media organizations are willing or able to directly call the voter fraud frame disinformation. The president is, however, not acting alone. Throughout the first six months of the disinformation campaign, the Republican National Committee (RNC) and staff from the Trump campaign appear repeatedly and consistently on message at the same moments, suggesting an institutionalized rather than individual disinformation campaign. The efforts of the president and the Republican Party are supported by the right-wing media ecosystem, primarily Fox News and talk radio functioning in effect as a party press. These reinforce the message, provide the president a platform, and marginalize or attack those Republican leaders or any conservative media personalities who insist that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in voting.The primary cure for the elite-driven, mass media communicated information disorder we observe her is unlikely to be more fact checking on Facebook. Instead, it is likely to require more aggressive policing by traditional professional media, the Associated Press, the television networks, and local TV news editors of whether and how they cover Trumps propaganda efforts, and how they educate their audiences about the disinformation campaign the president and the Republican Party have waged.","output":"Mail-In Voter Fraud: Anatomy of a Disinformation Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are several recent publications criticizing the failure of COVID-19 forecasting models, with swinging over predictions and underpredictions, which have made it difficult for decision and policy making. Observing the failures of several COVID-19 forecasting models and the alarming spread of the virus, we seek to use some stable response for forecasting COVID-19, viz., ratios of COVID-19 cases to mortalities, rather than COVID-19 cases or fatalities. A trend of low COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios calls for urgent attention: the need for vaccines, for instance. Studies have shown that there are influences of weather parameters on COVID-19; and COVID-19 may have come to stay and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases. In this paper, the influences of some weather, geographical, economic and demographic covariates were evaluated on COVID-19 response based on a series of Granger-causality tests. The effect of four weather parameters, viz., temperature, rainfall, solar irradiation and relative humidity, on daily COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios of 36 countries from 5 continents of the world were determined through regression analysis. Regression studies show that these four weather factors impact ratios of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality differently. The most impactful factor is temperature which is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases-to-mortality responses in 24 out of 36 countries. Temperature minimally affects COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios in the tropical countries. The most influential weather factor C temperature C was incorporated in training random forest and deep learning models for forecasting the cases-to-mortality rate of COVID-19 in clusters of countries in the world with similar weather conditions. Evaluation of trained forecasting models incorporating temperature features show better performance compared to a similar set of models trained without temperature features. This implies that COVID-19 forecasting models will predict more accurately if temperature features are factored in, especially for temperate countries. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods Data of 43,995 Brazilian adults from a cross-sectional, nationwide behavior research were used. Participants reported the frequency on loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen or depressed) and anxiety (feel worried, anxious or nervous) feelings during the pandemic period. Frequency and duration of physical activity as well as duration of TV-viewing before and during the pandemic period were also reported. We created four categories of reported changes in physical activity (1-consistently active, 2-become active, 3-become inactive or 4-consistently inactive) and TV-viewing (1-consistently high, 2-become low, 3-become high or 4-consistently high). Participants also reported previous diagnoses of depression [yes (PD) or no (nPD). Logistic regression models separating people with and without depression were created. Results Compared to consistently active participants, to become inactive during the pandemic was associated with a higher odds for loneliness [nPD:OR:1.32 (95%CI,1.02C1.70); PD:2.22 (1.21C4.06)], sadness [nPD:1.34 (1.01C1.77); PD:2.88 (1.54C5.36)], and anxiety [nPD:1.71 (1.30C2.25); PD:2.55 (1.20C5.42)]. Also, people with depression and consistently physically inactive presented higher odds for loneliness and sadness.

But their positive and negative appraisals, and coping behaviour could prevent or ameliorate future problems. OBJECTIVE To explore the emotional experiences, thought processes and coping behaviours of people with existing mental health problems and carers living through the pandemic. METHODS UK participants who identified as a mental health service user (N18), a carer (N5) or both (N8) participated in 30-minute semi-structured remote interviews (31 March 2020 to 9 April 2020). The interviews investigated the effects of social distancing and self-isolation on mental health and the ways in which people were coping. Data were analysed using a framework analysis. Three service user researchers charted data into a framework matrix (consisting of three broad categories: \\"emotional responses\\", \\"thoughts\\" and \\"behaviours\\") and then used an inductive process to capture other contextual themes. RESULTS Common emotional responses were fear, sadness and anger but despite negative emotions and uncertainty appraisals, participants described efforts to cope and maintain their mental wellbeing. This emphasised an increased reliance on technology, which enabled social contact and occupational or leisure activities. Participants also spoke about the importance of continued and adapted mental health service provision, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with changes in their living environment, life schedule and social interactions. CONCLUSION This study builds on a growing number of qualitative accounts of how mental health service users and carers experienced and coped with extreme social distancing measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of endoscopy during LRYGB surgery in assessing the gastric pouch and anastomosis for air leak, bleeding, and structure at the beginning of a bariatric surgery program. Patients who underwent LRYGB for morbid obesity between May 2008 and May 2009 were included in this study. After the completion of the anastomosis, an endoscopic examination was carried out. The transection line and anastomosis site were examined for bleeding and patency and inspected for air leak under laparoscopic vision. Thirteen morbidly obese patients (mean body mass index, 48.0  6.8 kg/m(2)) were evaluated by endoscopic examination during the LRYGB operation. None of the cases had bleeding at the transection line or anastomosis site. In two patients, air leak test was positive and the anastomosis was reinforced with additional sutures. All the patients, including those with positive air leak test, were discharged from the hospital with no leak complications. After a mean follow-up of 9.1  5.5 months, except for the patient who underwent balloon dilatation, no other patient had anastomotic stricture. Intraoperative endoscopy is invaluable in the assessment of bleeding, anastomotic patency, and air leak during LRYGB, and it might be a helpful auxiliary tool to decrease morbidity during the learning curve period. Also, it helps solve intraoperative problems during the surgery so that postoperative complications might be prevented.","output":"Intraoperative endoscopic assessment of the pouch and anastomosis during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incubation period of infectious diseases, the time from infection with a microorganism to onset of disease, is directly relevant to prevention and control. Since explicit models of the incubation period enhance our understanding of the spread of disease, previous classic studies were revisited, focusing on the modeling methods employed and paying particular attention to relatively unknown historical efforts. The earliest study on the incubation period of pandemic influenza was published in 1919, providing estimates of the incubation period of Spanish flu using the daily incidence on ships departing from several ports in Australia. Although the study explicitly dealt with an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure, which had an equal probability of infection, were too long, and thus, likely resulted in slight underestimates of the incubation period. After the suggestion that the incubation period follows lognormal distribution, Japanese epidemiologists extended this assumption to estimates of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak. Although the reason why the incubation period of acute infectious diseases tends to reveal a right-skewed distribution has been explored several times, the validity of the lognormal assumption is yet to be fully clarified. At present, various different distributions are assumed, and the lack of validity in assuming lognormal distribution is particularly apparent in the case of slowly progressing diseases. The present paper indicates that (1) analysis using well-defined short periods of exposure with appropriate statistical methods is critical when the exact time of exposure is unknown, and (2) when assuming a specific distribution for the incubation period, comparisons using different distributions are needed in addition to estimations using different datasets, analyses of the determinants of incubation period, and an understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.","output":"Early efforts in modeling the incubation period of infectious diseases with an acute course of illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rituximab is safe and effective for treating relapsingCremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) according to phase II and observational studies. There are limited data on disease activity after discontinuation and dose reduction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on inflammatory disease activity after discontinuation or dose reduction of rituximab in patients with RRMS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included all RRMS and CIS patients ever treated with rituximab at the University Hospital of Ume? who had either; (1) discontinued treatment at any time or (2) reduced the dose to a mean of < 1000 mg yearly. The patients served as their own controls by contributing patient years on full dose, reduced dose, and off treatment. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients treated with mean (SD) 6256 (2456) mg rituximab during mean (SD) 6.5 (2.0) years were included. There were no differences regarding the annualized relapse rates during full dose versus reduced dose or off treatment (0.02 versus < 0.01 and 0.02, p = 0.09), neither regarding proportion MRI scans with new or enlarged T2 lesions (0.03 versus 0.01 and 0.03, p = 0.37) or contrast-enhancing lesions (< 0.01 versus 0 and 0.02, p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that rituximab has long-term effects on inflammatory disease activity and that disease reactivation is rare in MS patients who discontinued treatment for any reason.

Nowadays, it has been found that EVs secreted by different cells play a vital role in cellular communication and are usually secreted in both physiological and pathological conditions.

Home care services reflect this emergent preference, allowing older adults to 'age in place' in familiar settings rather than receiving care for chronic health conditions or ageing needs in an institutionalized setting. Numerous social factors, generally studied in isolation, have been associated with home care utilization. Even so, social circumstances are complex and how these factors collectively influence home care use patterns remains unclear. OBJECTIVES To provide a broad and comprehensive overview of the social factors influencing home care utilization; and to evaluate the influence of discrete social factors on patterns of home care utilization in community-dwelling older adults in high-income countries. METHODS A scoping review was conducted of six electronic databases for records published between 2010 and 2020; additional records were obtained from hand searching review articles, reference lists of included studies and documents from international organisations. A narrative synthesis was presented, complemented by vote counting per social factor, harvest plots and an evaluation of aggregated findings to determine consistency across studies. RESULTS A total of 2,365 records were identified, of which 66 met inclusion criteria. There were 35 discrete social factors grouped into four levels of influence using a socio-ecological model (individual, relationship, community and societal levels) and grouped according to outcome of interest (home care propensity and intensity). Across all studies, social factors consistently showing any association (positive, negative, or equivocal in pattern) with home care propensity were: age, ethnicity/race, self-assessed health, insurance, housing ownership, housing problems, marital status, household income, children, informal caregiving, social networks and urban/rural area. Age, education, personal finances, living arrangements and housing ownership were associated with home care intensity, also with variable patterns in utilization. Additional community and societal level factors were identified as relevant but lacking consistency across the literature; these included rurality, availability of community services, methods of financing home care systems, and cultural determinants. CONCLUSION This is the first literature review bringing together a wide range of reported social factors that influence home care utilization. It confirms social factors do influence home care utilization in complex interactions, distinguishes level of influences at which these factors affect patterns of use and discusses policy implications for home care reform.","output":"Social factors influencing utilization of home care in community-dwelling older adults: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are currently no proven or approved treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high-quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto-immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID-19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease. In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.","output":"Rethinking the role of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Middle-aged and older adults are more vulnerable to hospitalization and mortality if they are infected with the COVID-19 virus.

The role of corticosteroids (CS) treatment in these patients is still controversial. Some studies evidenced a possible role of an early short-term course of CS treatment in the treatment of severe pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study considering the patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 9(th) March and 15(th) June 2020. Two groups were considered: early high-dose of methyl-prednisolone (eHDM; n=31) and the control group (n=52). Patients in the eHDM group received the dose of 5-8mg/kg/day of methyl-prednisolone for 2 consecutive days. Primary outcome was the mortality evaluation; secondary outcomes were clinical improvement, side-effects and laboratory/radiographic changes. RESULTS: Significant differences between the two groups were: length of hospitalization (21.5 vs 28.4 days, p=0.026), length of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (11.5 vs 14.5 days, p=0.031), death (5 vs 12, p=0.006) and clinical improvement (16 vs 11, p=0.018). The following factors were related to in-hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis: comorbidities (OR=2.919; 95%CI=1.515-16.705; p<0.001), days from the onset of symptoms and the hospital admission (OR=1.404; 95%CI=1.069-12.492; p=0.011), PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio (OR=3.111; 95%CI=2.334-16.991; p=0.009) and eHDM treatment (OR=0.741; 95%CI=0.129-0.917; p=0.007).

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We have performed a literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till May 12, 2020, with following keywords: \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"HLH\\", \\"HScore\\", \\"coagulopathy\\", \\"D-dimer\\", \\"cytokine storm\\", \\"children\\" and \\"pediatrics\\" with interposition of Boolean operator \\"AND\\". RESULTS: Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use 'high D-dimer' (> 3 g/mL) instead of 'low fibrinogen' to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSION: HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression. Children with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, especially those with documented thrombocytopenia or chilblains, should be regularly monitored for coagulopathy.","output":"COVID-19-associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Coagulopathy: Targeting the Duumvirate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Restrictions in face-to-face contact during the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated the conversion to online teachingClearning activities.

Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether positive RVP testing is associated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. RESULTS: Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have a preoperative structural airway diagnosis (P =.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (P =.0464). The most common reason for DLB was the need to assess the airway due to concern for structural pathology. Anatomic abnormalities were seen in a majority of encounters (77.3%) Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. CONCLUSIONS: Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.","output":"Respiratory viral panels and pediatric airway evaluation: The role of testing for upper respiratory infections to stratify perioperative risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, an emerging viral infection COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, and became a global pandemic. Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variants sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 68 recurrent mutations, including ten hotspot non-synonymous mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed that certain genotypes are specific to geographic locations. We also identified co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2. The phylogentic analysis identified two major Clades C1 and C2 harboring mutations L3606F and G614D, respectively and both emerging for the first time in China. On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets.

PURPOSE: To compare the change in PAA in patients with COVID-19 with the computed tomography (CT) severity index using follow-up imaging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 81 patients who were followed up and underwent CT assessment more than once at our hospital's pandemic department were evaluated retrospectively. Patients with progression were separated into three groups: progression ranging from mild-to-mild infiltration (Group A, CT severity index of 0-2); progression from mild to severe infiltration (Group B, CT severity index of 0-2 to 3-5); and progression from severe-to-severe infiltration (Group C, CT severity index of 3-5). The PAAs were calculated separately. RESULTS: The mean age was 56  12 years. In terms of those patients showing progression in the CT images, the number of patients in Groups A, B, and C was 29, 40, and 12 in the right lung; 32, 45, and 4 in the left lung; 23, 45, and 13 on both lungs, respectively.

We aimed to estimate the cumulative attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in hemodialysis patients in China using a serological test. METHODS: We enrolled all hemodialysis patients from 8 hemodialysis facilities in Honghu and Jingzhou of Hubei province and Guangzhou and Foshan of Guangdong province in China. We screened these patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection by both a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for viral RNA and a serological test for IgG and IgM antibodies. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics were collected by means of case report forms. We also enrolled the health care workers (HCWs) from the participating hospitals and compared the seropositive rate between hemodialysis patients and HCWs in the same region. RESULTS: Among 1542 hemodialysis patients, 5 (0.32%) and 51 (3.3%) tested positive by the RT-PCR test and the serological test, respectively. The seropositive rate in Hubei (3.6%) was higher than that in Guangdong (2.8%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.5). Most of the seropositive patients were asymptomatic. Independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were age greater than 65 years, a manifestation of lung infection on imaging examinations, and a lower level of serum albumin. In comparison, the seropositive rate in 3205 health care workers was 1.2%, which was significantly lower than that observed in the hemodialysis patients (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The cumulative rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients in China was high, at 3.3%.

Methods: Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM2.5 long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. Results: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level.

However, the enforcement of a nationwide lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can possibly provide a ray of hope. We analyze the lockdown's impact on the water quality status of this stretch using a combination of measured parameters and satellite image derived indices. Class C Water Quality Index estimates of nine stations indicate an improvement of 37% during the lockdown period. The Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand values reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown phase, while Faecal Coliform declined by over 40%. Similar analysis of 20 major drains that meet the Yamuna revealed declining effluent loads and discernable improvements in drain contaminant status were ascertained via a hierarchical cluster analysis. Reach-wise suspended particulate matter content, turbidity and algal signatures were derived from multi-temporal Landsat-8 images of prior and ongoing lockdown periods for 117 channel segment zones. These parameters also declined notably within most stretches, although their extents were spatially varied. While the partial/non-operational status of most industries during the lockdown enabled significant reduction in effluent loads and a consequent betterment in the river water quality, its spatial variations and even deterioration in some locations resulted from the largely undiminished inflow of domestic sewage through multiple drains. This study provides an estimate of possible river recovery extents and degree of improvement if deleterious polluting activities and contaminants are regulated properly.","output":"Some respite for India's dirtiest river?

So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions have not been systematically studied. Methods This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. Results Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age >=65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications - as judged by two independent reviewers - determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","output":"COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and mode of death in a dynamic and non-restricted tertiary care model in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since their proposal in 2016, the FAIR principles have been largely discussed by different communities and initiatives involved in the development of infrastructures to enhance support for data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse.

This study aims to identify the suicide-related risk factors and stressors to determine the groups at a greater risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: This retrospective study examined 29 cases of attempted suicide during the 3-month COVID-19 lockdown in KSA. The suicide risk factors were evaluated using the modified sex, age, depression, previous attempt, excess alcohol, rational thinking loss, social support lacking, organized plan, no spouse, sickness (SAD PERSONS) scale along with a comprehensive assessment of the recent stressful life events. RESULTS: The lockdown stressors that may have triggered suicidal behaviours were identified as follows: psychological distress, relationship problems, financial difficulties, and extreme fear of the COVID-19 infection. While all age groups carried the risk of attempting suicide during the lockdown, patients with psychiatric disorders and women accounted for 69% and 65.5% of the cohort, respectively. Factors including hopelessness and depression were highly related to suicide attempts. The statement of future intent to repeat the attempt was made by 72.4% and 65.5%, respectively.

With most campuses being closed due to COVID-19 pandemic, many of the engineering courses labs are either cancelled, converted to a totally virtual, or remote lab setting. The paper proposes a novel hybrid virtual-physical laboratories for a control theory course that is delivered online. The virtual labs are implemented using a 3D animated digital twin of a motor. The physical labs are implemented using a low-cost take-home lab kit that was sent to students. The use of the proposed hybrid approach achieves the benefits of both virtual labs and physical labs. Specifically, the virtual labs form a sandbox where the student can safely experiment and try new designs without worrying about damaging equipment. This will also form a gentle introduction to the utilization of the physical labs. The physical labs allow the student to see the actual control system components, and hardware troubleshooting. Both the proposed virtual and physical labs can be performed by the student from home at any convenient time;and the lab is always available to the student through the whole semester. The hybrid virtual-physical labs were utilized in the fall of 2020 within an introductory control theory course offered to a third-year undergraduate students at McMaster University. Based on the students feedback, the designed labs were effective within the online course delivery and they provided deep insights and understanding of the concepts that were taught in the class. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"A Hybrid Virtual-Physical Approach for Performing Control Theory Laboratories from Home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases, both established and emerging, impose a significant burden globally.

The administration of non-cross-resistant therapies during the post-transplant phase could possibly control residual disease and delay or prevent its progression. To test this approach, 55 patients with relapsed/refractory or high-risk NHL or relapsed/refractory HD were enrolled in the following protocol: stem cell mobilization: cyclophosphamide (4.5 g/m(2)) + etoposide (2.0 g/m(2)) followed by GM-CSF or G-CSF; high-dose therapy: gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2)) on day ?5, BCNU (300 mg/m(2)) + gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2)) on day ?2, melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) on day ?1, blood stem cell infusion on day 0; post-transplant immunotherapy (B cell NHL): rituxan (375 mg/m(2)) weekly for 4 weeks + GM-CSF (250 g thrice weekly) (weeks 4C8); post-transplant involved-field radiotherapy (HD): 30C40 Gy to pre-transplant areas of disease (weeks 4C8); post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy (all patients): dexamethasone (40 mg daily)/cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2)/day)/etoposide (30 mg/m(2)/day)/cisplatin (15 mg/m(2)/day) by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days + gemcitabine (1.0 g/m(2), day 3) (months 3 + 9) alternating with dexamethasone/paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) (months 6 + 12). Of the 33 patients with B cell lymphoma, 14 had primary refractory disease (42%), 12 had relapsed disease (36%) and seven had high-risk disease in first CR (21%). For the entire group, the 2-year KaplanCMeier event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 30% and 35%, respectively, while six of 33 patients (18%) died before day 100 from transplant-related complications. The rituxan/GM-CSF phase was well-tolerated by the 26 patients who were treated and led to radiographic responses in seven patients; an eighth patient with a blastic variant of mantle-cell lymphoma had clearance of marrow involvement after rituxan/GM-CSF. Of the 22 patients with relapsed/refractory HD (21 patients) or high-risk T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (one patient), the 2-year KaplanCMeier EFS and OS were 70% and 85%, respectively, while two of 22 patients (9%) died before day 100 from transplant-related complications. Eight patients received involved field radiation and seven had radiographic responses within the treatment fields. A total of 72 courses of post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy were administered to 26 of the 55 total patients. Transient grade 3C4 myelosuppression was common and one patient died from neutropenic sepsis, but no patients required an infusion of backup stem cells. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, the EFS for the cohort of HD patients was significantly better than the EFS for an historical cohort of HD patients autografted after BEAC (BCNU/etoposide/cytarabine/cyclophosphamide) without consolidation chemotherapy (P = 0.015). In conclusion, post-transplant consolidation therapy is feasible and well-tolerated for patients autografted for aggressive NHL and HD and may be associated with improved progression-free survival particularly for patients with HD.

Exposure to an emerging pathogen generates an antibody response that can be used for preventing and treating the infection. These antibodies might have a high specificity to a target, few side effects, and are useful in the absence of an effective vaccine for treating immunocompromised individuals. The approved antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., regdanvimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab/imdevimab) have been selected from the antibody repertoire of B cells from convalescent patients using flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing, and phage display. This encourages use of these techniques especially phage display, because it does not require expensive types of equipment and can be performed on the lab bench, thereby making it suitable for labs with limited resources. Also, the antibodies in blood samples from convalescent patients can be used to screen pre-made peptide libraries to identify epitopes for vaccine development. Different types of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, including inactivated virus vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines, non-replicating vector vaccines, and protein subunits. mRNA vaccines have numerous advantages over existing vaccines, such as efficacy, ease of manufacture, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, epitope vaccination may constitute an attractive strategy to induce high levels of antibodies against a pathogen and phages might be used as immunogenic carriers of such peptides. This is a point worth considering further, as phage-based vaccines have been shown to be safe in clinical trials and phages are easy to produce and tolerate high temperatures. In conclusion, identification of the antibody repertoire of recovering patients, and the epitopes they recognize, should be an attractive alternative option for developing therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies and vaccines against emerging pathogens.","output":"Perspectives on passive antibody therapy and peptide-based vaccines against emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 developed into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide.

This study aimed to develop a system and an infrastructure that could facilitate video teleconsultation services between worker health centers and health zones, and analyze the services operation status. A video teleconsultation process based on the role of local and remote institutions was designed. Based on the designed services, a web system supporting teleconsultation and an integrated gateway guaranteeing the interface with medical equipment in the web environment was developed. After analyzing the working environment, an infrastructure consisting of networks, video equipment, medical equipment, and servers necessary for teleconsultation was designed. Statistical results from the developed system and a satisfaction survey conducted by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency were used to analyze the video teleconsultation services operation status. A system, gateway, and hardware infrastructure within 21 worker health centers and 21 health zones has been operating this service since January 1, 2018.

It influences all aspects of the life of affected individuals including social interactions, intimate relationships, family relations, peer interactions, education, employment, spirituality and religiosity. The clinical manifestations of sickle cell anaemia are protean and fall into three major categories: (i) anaemia and its sequelae; (ii) pain and related issues; and (iii) organ failure including infection. Recent studies on the pathogenesis of sickle cell anaemia have centred on the sequence of events that occur between polymerisation of deoxy haemoglobin (Hb) S and vaso-occlusion. Cellular dehydration, inflammatory response and reperfusion injury seem to be important pathophysiological mechanisms. Management of sickle cell anaemia continues to be primarily palliative in nature, including supportive, symptomatic and preventative approaches to therapy. Empowerment and education are the major aspects of supportive care. Symptomatic management includes pain management, blood transfusion and treatment of organ failure. Pain managment should follow certain priniciples that include assessment, individualisation of therapy and proper utilisation of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in order to acheive adequate pain relief. Blood selected for transfusion should be leuko-reduced and phenotypically matched for the C, E and Kell antigens. Exchange transfusion is indicated in patients who are transfused chronically in order to prevent or delay the onset of iron-overload. Acute chest syndrome is the most common form of organ failure and its management should be agressive, including adequate ventilation, multiple antibacterials and simple or exchange blood transfusion depending on its severity. Preventitive therapy includes prophylactic penicillin in infants and children, blood transfusion (preferably exchange transfusion) in patients with stroke, and hydroxyurea in patients with frequent acute painful episodes. Bone marrow and cord blood transplantation have been successful modalities of curative therapy in selected children with sickle cell anaemia. Newer approaches to preventative therapy include cellular rehydration with agents that inhibit the Gardos channel or the KCl co-transport channel.

In this report, we describe 3 clusters of COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers (HCWs), not associated with patient exposure, and the interventions undertaken to halt ongoing exposure and transmission at our cancer center. METHODS: A cluster of cases was defined as 2 or more cases of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive COVID-19 among HCWs who work in the same unit area at the same time. Cases were identified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Contact tracing, facility observations, and infection prevention assessments were performed to investigate the 3 clusters between March 1 and April 30, 2020, with subsequent implementation of containment strategies. RESULTS: The initial cluster involved HCWs from an ancillary services unit, with contacts traced back to a gathering in a break room in which 1 employee was symptomatic, although not yet diagnosed with COVID-19, with subsequent transmission to 7 employees. The second cluster involved 4 employees and was community related. The third cluster involved only 2 employees with possible transmission while working in the same office at the same time. A step-up approach was implemented to control the spread of infection among employees, including universal masking, enhanced cleaning, increase awareness, and surveillance testing.

Additional challenges may arise in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The utility of phenobarbital, a barbiturate sedative hypnotic that produces sedation through GABAA receptor agonism, in adult ECMO patients has yet to be described within the literature. DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old male (95 kg) with asthma, hyperlipidemia and recently diagnosed COVID19, was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequently initiated on VV ECMO. By day 13, his sedation regimen consisted of the following: hydromorphone 12 mg/hr, midazolam 15 mg/hr, ketamine 1.4 mg/kg/hr and dexmedetomidine 1.4 mcg/kg/min, along with oral diazepam 15 mg every 6 hours. Propofol use was limited because of hypertriglyceridemia. Despite this, he was dyschronous with the ventilator. A recommendation was made to use phenobarbital. The patient was loaded with 10 mg/kg using ideal body weight (IBW), followed by 1 mg/kg twice daily. At steady state, a serum level was checked and resulted at 10.8 ug/mL. Simultaneously, the patient was more synchronous and did not require any escalation in sedation. Following a decompensatory event, a repeat bolus of 5 mg/kg IBW was given, followed by a 2 mg/kg twice daily regimen. A second steady state level was checked and resulted at 16.7 ug/mL. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the potential role for phenobarbital in ECMO patients refractory to conventional sedation, and sheds light on pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations. Phenobarbital is a relatively lipophilic drug with a LogP value of 1.47 and limited protein binding (48% protein bound). Given this PK profile, we anticipated that the degree of sequestration in the ECMO circuit would be low. We performed therapeutic drug monitoring and obtained serum levels at steady state and compared the findings to non-ECMO patients. Although no optimal phenobarbital level for sedation has been defined, extrapolation from therapeutic levels for epilepsy (15-40 ug/mL) was made. Based on our results, we concluded that limited drug sequestration occurred within the circuit and no dosing adjustment may be needed. The standard dose may be similar to non- ECMO patients and should be guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.","output":"The use of phenobarbital in ECMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Recurring outbreaks of infectious diseases highlight the importance of population vaccination strategies We aimed to assess the impact of national vaccination strategies on vaccine-preventable infectious diseases (VPDs) in Shanghai, China and to identify vulnerable groups that may benefit from future vaccination policies Methods Infectious disease data from 1953 to 2018 was obtained from Xuhui District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai China We used joinpoint regression to show incidence, mortality and fatality trends and to determine annual percent change in incidence of 12 VPDs among three eras of national immunization strategies: (1)1953C1977, (2)1978C2007, and(3)2008C2018 Findings Incidence, mortality, and fatality from VPDs have decreased drastically over the three eras, despite the inclusion of more diseases over time Strikingly, the overall yearly incidence of VPDs shows an increasing trend from 2000 to 2018 in Shanghai (annual percentage changes, APC:7 7, p = 0 025) In the third era (2008C2018), the three VPDs with the highest incidence were varicella (80 2 cases/100,000), hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) (73 6 cases/100,000), and hepatitis (43 5 cases/100,000) A significant upward trend was also observed in hepatitis (APC:24 9, p&lt;0 001), varicella (APC:5 9, p = 0 006), and HFMD (APC:11 8, p = 0 003) from 2008C2018 Hepatitis and tuberculosis are the only VPDs with fatality cases in this period Interpretation Focus is needed in controlling adult hepatitis and tuberculosis, either by introducing adult booster vaccines or by research into more effective vaccines Varicella and HFMD are on the rise, but vaccines for these are not included in national programs Strategies funded by government agencies or encouraged by research incentives are needed for varicella and HFMD, such as two-dose and novel multi-valent vaccines, respectively Funding Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Municipal Government","output":"Changes in epidemiological features of vaccine preventable infectious diseases among three eras of national vaccination strategies from 1953 to 2018 in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet of things (IoT) devices and applications are dramatically increasing worldwide, resulting in more cybersecurity challenges Among these challenges are malicious activities that target IoT devices and cause serious damage, such as data leakage, phishing and spamming campaigns, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and security breaches In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is proposed to detect malicious traffic data, particularly malicious attacks targeting IoT devices The proposed stacked deep learning method is bundled with five pretrained residual networks (ResNets) to deeply learn the characteristics of the suspicious activities and distinguish them from normal traffic Each pretrained ResNet model consists of 10 residual blocks We used two large datasets to evaluate the performance of our detection method We investigated two heterogeneous IoT environments to make our approach deployable in any IoT setting Our proposed method has the ability to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic data and detect most IoT attacks The experimental results show that our proposed stacked deep learning method can provide a higher detection rate in real time compared with existing classification techniques","output":"A Stacked Deep Learning Approach for IoT Cyberattack Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A decade has passed since the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the ACE2Cangiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)CMas counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system (RAS).

One strategy to achieve more sustainable care for these patients is by implementing use of home-based eHealth applications. Such services support patients to take on a more active role as value-creating co-producers of their own care, in collaboration with health care professionals. Health care professionals have a key role in the value creation process, but little is known about value formation within eHealth interactions, especially from their perspective. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of how an eHealth application can function as a value-creating resource from the perspective of health care professionals. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen health care professionals (nurses, physicians and first-line managers). Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS: The findings indicate that value formation processes are strongly influenced by the organizational preconditions and by the usability and functionality of technology. The experiences of the health care professionals indicated that value was conceptualized in dimensions of meaningfulness, building of relationships, building safety and feelings of trust. Although these dimensions were mainly expressed in a positive way, such as perceived improvement of medical care, accessibility and continuity, they also had a negative side that caused value destruction. This was primarily due to patient difficulties in using the application or making measurements. Subsequent efforts at value recovery resulted in value creation, but were often time-consuming for the professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes by extending conceptualizations of value to the role of health care professionals and by highlighting technology as sometimes facilitating and sometimes hampering value formation processes. The findings indicate that the eHealth application was a value-creating resource, facilitating proactive communication and supporting patients engagement and control over their self-care. However, for the application to become a more valuable resource in practice and counteract inequity in care, it needs to be further developed to be adapted to the needs and preconditions of patients.","output":"Health care professionals experiences of how an eHealth application can function as a value-creating resource - a qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus has had devastating consequences across the globe. However, multiple clinics and hospitals have experienced a decrease in rates of acute myocardial infarction and corresponding cardiac catheterization lab activations, raising the question: Has the risk of myocardial infarction decreased during COVID? Sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, and sleep has been importantly impacted during the pandemic, possibly due to the changes in work-home life leading to a lack of structure. We conducted a social media-based survey to assess potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in risk of myocardial infarction. We used validated questionnaires to assess sleep patterns, tobacco consumption and other important health outcomes to test the hypothesis that increases in sleep duration may be occurring which have a beneficial impact on health. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in circadian rhythm, with subjects waking up 105 minutes later during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Subjects also reported going to sleep 41 minutes later during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). These shifts led to longer duration of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, information on COVID-19 was collected from social media platforms, news outlets and government announcements. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: Four themes emerged: (i) individuals were overloaded with information but lacked trusted sources, which resulted in widespread fear and unanswered questions; (ii) communities had limited ability to comply with prevention measures, such as social distancing, because access to long-term food supplies and water at home was limited and because income had to be earned daily; (iii) health-care workers perceived themselves to be vulnerable and undervalued because of a shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate pay; and (iv) other health conditions were sidelined because resources were redirected, with potentially wide-reaching implications.

Unfortunately, so far, there is no validated vaccine, and its management consists mainly of supportive care. Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are highly prevalent in patients suffering from severe COVID-19. In fact, a prothrombotic state seems to be present in most fatal cases of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, causing immune-mediated tissue damage, disruption of the endothelial barrier, and uncontrolled thrombogenesis. Thrombin is the key regulator of coagulation and fibrin formation. In severe COVID-19, a dysfunctional of physiological anticoagulant mechanisms leads to a progressive increase of thrombin activity, which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome development and a poor prognosis.

In 2016 the US Preventive Services Task Force released guidelines recommending universal screening in primary care to identify patients with depression and to link them to treatment. Feasible, acceptable, and effective strategies to implement these guidelines are needed. METHODS: This three-phased study employed rapid participatory methods to design and test strategies to increase depression screening at Penn Medicine, a large health system with 90 primary care practices. First, researchers solicited ideas and barriers from stakeholders to increase screening using an innovation tournamenta crowdsourcing method that invites stakeholders to submit ideas to address a workplace challenge. Second, a panel of stakeholders and scientists deliberated over and ranked the tournament ideas. An instant runoff election was held to select the winning idea. Third, the research team piloted the winning idea in a primary care practice using rapid prototyping, an approach that quickly refines and iterates strategy designs. RESULTS: The innovation tournament yielded 31 ideas and 32 barriers from diverse stakeholders (12 primary care physicians, 10 medical assistants, 4 nurse practitioners, 2 practice managers, and 4 patient support assistants). A panel of 6 stakeholders and scientists deliberated on the ideas and voted for patient self-report (i.e., through tablet computers, text message, or an online patient portal) as the winning idea. The research team rapid prototyped tablets in one primary care practice with one physician over 5 five-hour shifts to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the strategy. Most patients, the physician, and medical assistants found the tablets acceptable and feasible. However, patient support assistants struggled to incorporate them in their workflow and expressed concerns about scaling up the process. Depression screening rates were higher using tablets compared to usual care; follow-up was comparable between tablets and usual care.

In Austria, like in other European countries, informal care is carried out overwhelmingly by (non-cohabiting) relatives. Limited care services available during the pandemic, social-distancing, increased unemployment and competing care needs within households (e.g. due to school closures) may have changed the prevalence and intensity of informal caregiving. Moreover, these changes may have increased the psychological strain experienced by caregivers. Focusing on Austria, this study aims to empirically analyse the following research questions: how have the prevalence and intensity of informal care changed due to the pandemic? How has the psychological well-being of informal caregivers been affected? We use a pre- and post-onset of the pandemic research design based on a representative survey carried out in Austria in June 2020 (N = 2000) in combination with comparable 2015 data from the European Social Survey. Findings suggest that neither prevalence nor intensity of informal care changed significantly due to the pandemic. However, the psychological well-being gap between carers and non-carers increased with the start of the pandemic, especially among men. Findings are discussed in relation to the policy measures implemented and possible policy implications for the future.

Virtual remote consultations are an appropriate adjunct to conventional face-to-face patient encounters and could facilitate students to attain core learning outcomes. This article describes some of the approaches that enable remote (home) virtual patient encounters in Primary Care for medical students. These are categorised as methods that a) enable remote access into GP clinical systems, b) enable remote access into individual patient consultations and c) enable an observational-only experience. Key considerations are highlighted to enable safe and effective implementation of remote virtual consultations, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each method. These include patient consent, confidentiality, data sharing and protection, professionalism, student agreements and data gathering templates.

The European Commission is now considering a policy view to commercialize the development and extraction of methane gas from European offshore areas. Affirmation from the European Commission that offshore methane hydrates are too useful and too valuable to forego development could initiate a global response to adopt offshore methane hydrates as a new source of natural gas for heating, for electrical power supplies, and for potential new revenues. The upside? The potential rewards from offshore methane hydrates are multi-fold. Coastal states are surrounded in methane hydrate resources that if responsibly developed could enable vast amounts of methane (natural gas) to be produced for decades or centuries beyond the timelines of conventional natural gas assets. There are also massive volumes of fresh water trapped in hydrates that could aid in fighting droughts and desertification. The downside? There are novel foreseeable risks that might result from those commercial methane hydrate activities. The climate change risks and geo-physical hazards from offshore methane hydrates are quite distinct from both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons. There are new challenges to achieving safety and sustainability. In review, this paper both welcomes the discovery and confirmation of offshore methane hydrates in European waters and also raises concerns that more research is required on the optimal policy strategies for the known and foreseeable risks to best enable safe and sustainable policy choices.","output":"Hydrate occurrence in Europe: Risks, rewards, and legal frameworks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study aiming to reveal the relationship of gratitude and coping styles with depression in caregivers of children with special needs.

Among possible transmission routes, air transfer of the virus is thought to be prominent. To investigate this further, measurements were conducted at Razi hospital in Ahvaz, Iran, which was selected to treat COVID-19 severe cases in the Khuzestan province. Passive and active sampling methods were employed and compared with regard to their efficiency for collection of airborne SARS-COV-2 virus particles. Fifty one indoor air samples were collected in two areas, with distances of less than or equal to 1 m (patient room) and more than 3 m away (hallway and nurse station) from patient beds. A simulation method was used to obtain the virus load released by a regularly breathing or coughing individual including a range of microdroplet emissions. Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 11.76% (N=6) of all indoor air samples (N=51) collected in the COVID-19 ward tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, including 4 cases in patient rooms and 2 cases in the hallway. Also, 5 of the 6 positive cases were confirmed using active sampling methods with only 1 based on passive sampling. The results support airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosols in indoor air.

METHODS: For VAERS reports of individuals who were vaccinated at the age of 18 years or above between January 2010 and April 2021, we conducted a disproportionality analysis that was adjusted for age and sex.

Early efforts to predict hospital bed needs focused on deriving predictions from SIR models, largely at the level of countries, provinces, or states. In the USA, these models rely on data reported by state health agencies. However, predicting disease and hospitalization dynamics at the state level is complicated by geographic variation in disease parameters. In addition, it is difficult to make forecasts early in a pandemic due to minimal data. Bayesian approaches that allow models to be specified with informed prior information from areas that have already completed a disease curve can serve as prior estimates for areas that are beginning their curve. Here, a Bayesian non-linear regression (Weibull function) was used to forecast cumulative and active COVID-19 hospitalizations for SD, USA, based on data available up to 2020-07-22. As expected, early forecasts were dominated by prior information, which was derived from New York City. Importantly, hospitalization trends differed within South Dakota due to early peaks in an urban area, followed by later peaks in rural areas of the state.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have assessed the use of SSA in the general practice in Austria by retrospectively analysing patients with pulmonary NETs referred to our European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society centre in Vienna for second opinion or further therapy. In addition, we have analysed the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression of those patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and SSTR imaging, e.g. 68Ga-DOTANOC-positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and whether such analyses had been carried out before referral at our centre. RESULTS: Out of 34 patients (19 atypical and 15 typical carcinoids) with metastatic or advanced disease, 10/34 (29%) had been prescribed SSA before referral. No IHC for SSTR had been carried out, and only 9/34 (27%) had undergone SSTR imaging by nuclear medicine. Sufficient material for IHC was available in 29/34 (85%) patients and SSTR-IHC was rated negative in 13/29 (45%), weakly positive in 4/29 (14%), moderately positive in 5/29 (17%) and strongly positive in 7/29 (24%) patients.

To date, however, the UKs approach has been hampered by the lack of a clear strategy or consistent policy, with frequent and extreme changes in approach, together with an under-performing diplomatic presence in the country.

METHODS: We conducted a test-negative caseCcontrol study involving health care personnel across 25 U.S. states. Cases were defined on the basis of a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 and at least one Covid-19Clike symptom. Controls were defined on the basis of a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, and were matched to cases according to the week of the test date and site. Using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age, race and ethnic group, underlying conditions, and exposures to persons with Covid-19, we estimated vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination (assessed 14 days after receipt of the first dose through 6 days after receipt of the second dose) and complete vaccination (assessed 7 days after receipt of the second dose). RESULTS: The study included 1482 case participants and 3449 control participants. Vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination was 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.9 to 82.7) with the BNT162b2 vaccine (PfizerCBioNTech) and 88.9% (95% CI, 78.7 to 94.2) with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna); for complete vaccination, vaccine effectiveness was 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) and 96.3% (95% CI, 91.3 to 98.4), respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was similar in subgroups defined according to age (<50 years or 50 years), race and ethnic group, presence of underlying conditions, and level of patient contact.

Patients with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) may present with clinical signs of poor perfusion and systolic hypotension in addition to typical KD features. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzes and interprets large hospitalization databases as a mechanism for conducting national KD surveillance. METHODS The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), and the IBM MarketScan Commercial (MSC) and MarketScan Medicaid (MSM) databases were analyzed to determine KD-associated hospitalization rates and trends from 2006 to the most recent year of available data. KD and potential KDSS hospitalizations were defined using International Classification of Disease-Clinical Modification codes. RESULTS For the most recent year, the KD-associated hospitalization rates for children <5 years of age were 19.8 (95% CI: 17.2-22.3, KID: 2016), 19.6 (95% CI: 16.8-22.4, NIS: 2017), 19.3 (MSC: 2018), and 18.4 (MSM: 2018) per 100,000. There was no indication of an increase in KD rates over the time period. Rates of potential KDSS among children <18 years of age, ranging from 0.0 to 0.7 per 100,000, increased; coding indicated potential KDSS for approximately 2.8%-5.3% of KD hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Analyses of these large, national databases produced consistent KD-associated hospitalization rates, with no increase over time detected; however, the percentage of KD hospitalizations with potential KDSS increased. Given reports of increasing incidence elsewhere and the recent identification of a novel virus-associated syndrome with possible Kawasaki-like features, continued national surveillance is important to detect changes in disease epidemiology.","output":"Kawasaki Disease and Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome Hospitalization Rates in the United States, 2006-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hematological changes in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were common and included thrombocytopenia (55%) (Yang et al, Int J Mol Med. 2004). Thrombocytopenia (50%) was also present in paediatric SARS patients (Hon et al, Lancet. 2003). A number of potential mechanisms have been investigated. The lungs of patients who died of SARS infection show diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary congestion, edema, formation of hyaline membrane, and fibrosis. Viral infection, oxygen toxicity and/or barotrauma contribute to the lung damage. The lung tissue and pulmonary endothelial cell damage result in platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombi formation at the site of the injury. All these mechanisms may induce the consumption of platelets and megakaryocytes (MK). The association between lung injury and thrombocytopenia was investigated by comparing the MK and platelet counts, and platelet activation using P-selectin as a marker, between the prepulmonary (right atrial) and postpulmonary (left atrial) blood in rats with and without hyperoxic lung injury. In the healthy controls, the postpulmonary blood had lower megakaryocyte count, higher platelet count, but similar P-selectin expression. In contrast, the lung-damaged animals did not show any such differences in either MK or platelet count, but P-selectin expression was greater in the postpulmonary blood. Peripheral platelet and intra-pulmonary MK counts in the lung-damaged rats were significantly lower than those in their respective controls. Intra-pulmonary thrombi or platelet aggregation were detected in the lung-damaged rats but not in the controls. These findings showed that lung damage reduced circulating platelets through (i) failure of the lungs to retain and fragment MK to release platelets, (ii) and platelet activation leading to platelet aggregation, thrombi formation and platelet consumption. The number and morphology of circulating MK were also investigated before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in 20 patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery. Results showed that: (i) The total number of MK in central venous was higher than those of peripheral arteries during normal circulation (P<0.01). There was significant decrease of Type-4 MK (mature and large MK) number in peripheral arteries compared with that in central venous (P<0.001); and (ii) During CPB, the total MK and Type-4 MK of central venous and peripheral arteries were significant increased when compared with that in normal circulation (P<0.01). Our observation supports that the lungs may remove large MK during normal circulation. This physiological effect would be lost on CPB. On the other hand, the lungs may be the sites of platelet release from mature MK. The inflammation, the long term ventilation and/or oxygen therapy may result in pulmonary fibrosis and other pathological changes. The reduced or morphologically altered pulmonary capillary bed would affect the MK fragmentation in the lung. The increased consumption of platelet and/or the decreased production of platelet may lead to thrombocytopenia.","output":"Lung Damage May Induce Thrombocytopenia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The epidemic of misinformation about COVID-19 transmission, prevention, and treatment has been going on since the start of the pandemic However, data on the exposure and impact of misinformation is not readily available OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize and compare the start, peak, and doubling time of COVID-19 misinformation topics across 8 countries using an exponential growth model usually employed to study infectious disease epidemics METHODS: COVID-19 misinformation topics were selected from the World Health Organization Mythbusters website Data representing exposure was obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface for 8 English-speaking countries Exponential growth models were used in modeling trends for each country RESULTS: Searches for \\"coronavirus AND 5G\\" started at different times but peaked in the same week for 6 countries Searches for 5G also had the shortest doubling time across all misinformation topics, with the shortest time in Nigeria and South Africa (approximately 4-5 days) Searches for \\"coronavirus AND ginger\\" started at the same time (the week of January 19, 2020) for several countries, but peaks were incongruent, and searches did not always grow exponentially after the initial week Searches for \\"coronavirus AND sun\\" had different start times across countries but peaked at the same time for multiple countries CONCLUSIONS: Patterns in the start, peak, and doubling time for \\"coronavirus AND 5G\\" were different from the other misinformation topics and were mostly consistent across countries assessed, which might be attributable to a lack of public understanding of 5G technology Understanding the spread of misinformation, similarities and differences across different contexts can help in the development of appropriate interventions for limiting its impact similar to how we address infectious disease epidemics Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of misinformation that discourages adherence to public health interventions could be predictive of future increases in disease cases","output":"COVID-19 Misinformation Spread in Eight Countries: Exponential Growth Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This introductory article describes the genesis of the Festschrift for Leonard Bickman and of this Festschrift special issue entitled, The Future of Childrens Mental Health Services.

METHODS: A comprehensive immunological analysis was performed to explore the features of the TCR repertoire and identified TCR sequences correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens. RESULTS: we analyzed the COVID-19 patients TCR repertoires in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) which obtained before (baseline), during (acute), and after rehabilitation (convalescent) by ImmunoSEQ-technology, and found that repertoire features of TCR-chain (TCR) complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) in COVID-19 patients were remarkable difference, including decreased TCR diversity, abnormal CDR3 length, difference of TRBV/J gene usage and higher TCR sequence overlap. Besides, we identified some COVID-19 disease-associated TCR clones, and the abundance of them changed with the progression of the disease. Importantly, these disease-associated TCR clones could be used to distinguish COVID-19 patients from healthy controls with high accuracy.

Fear of COVID-19 and family communication patterns are hypothesized to influence parental feeding practices and ultimately childrens intake of healthy as well as unhealthy foods. Based on a conceptual model of direct and indirect effects among these variables, we test these hypotheses in an observational cross-sectional design. Methods: : 306 parents (51% fathers) with children in the age range 5 - 12 were recruited via a Facebook snowball sampling method. They completed questionnaires online to measure fear of COVID-19, conversation- and conformity-oriented family communication patterns, and parental controlling feeding practices. In addition, they reported on the childs intake of food categories marking healthy (fruits and vegetables) and unhealthy (juice, soda, sweets, fast foods) diets. The conceptual model was analyzed with structural equations modeling, including a multi-group analysis to discern differences between mothers and fathers. Results: : There were significantly positive associations between parental fear of COVID-19 and both conversation and conformity family communication patterns, both of which in turn were positively associated with parental controlling feeding practices. Conversation communication pattern was associated with reduced unhealthy food intake in children. For the most part, these associations occurred for both mothers and fathers. However, whereas fathers communication patterns were not related to childrens food intake, mothers conversation pattern was negatively, and conformity pattern was positively, associated with childrens unhealthy food intake. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a profound impact on families, including childrens dietary intake. These results underscore that general family patterns play an important role for childrens dietary intake. Therefore, it may be useful to help parents adopt general positive parenting approaches to influence their childrens healthy development, including dietary intake.","output":"Childrens Healthy and Unhealthy Food Intake Related to Parental Fear of the Covid-19, Family Communication Patterns, and Parental Controlling Feeding Practices (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few long-term reports have been published on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses despite their frequent involvement in extremely common infections.

METHODS: We collected data on all respiratory viruses detected from 1997 to 2020 in our institution. Clinical specimens were analyzed mainly by conventional techniques, and molecular techniques were also used. RESULTS: Of the 59,579 specimens analyzed, 21,382 (35.9%) were positive for at least one virus. The number of positive samples during cold months was significantly higher than in warm months. Respiratory virus infections were detected in patients of all ages, above all in children under 3 years of age, who were most frequently infected with the respiratory syncytial virus, whereas Influenza A virus predominated in the other groups, especially in adults. A clear demographic and seasonal pattern was established for some viruses. Circulation of other respiratory viruses during the FLUAV H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study provides new knowledge about the prevalence of respiratory viruses in a Mediterranean region.

In microbiology, the implementation of an active teaching methodology, the #Adopt project, based on the social network Facebook(?), represents an excellent option for connecting remote education with classroom activities. In 2020, the version applied in high school, Adopt a Microorganism, was adapted to meet the demands of emergency remote education owing to the suppression of face-to-face activities caused by the pandemic. In the present study, we assessed how the change in methodology impacted the discourse richness of students from high school integrated with technical education in the Business Administration program of the Federal Institute of S?o Paulo, Sorocaba Campus. Three questionnaires related to the groups of microorganisms (Archaea, Bacteria, Virus, Fungi, and Protozoan) were applied. The students responses in the 2019 and 2020 classes were compared concerning content richness and multiplicity of concepts through the application of the Shannon diversity index, an approach that is generally used to assess biodiversity in different environments.

The aim of this study was to critically evaluate the relationship between Vit D mild and severe deficiency prevalence in each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach. Research Methods & Procedures: Information on Vit D concentration/deficiency for each country was retrieved through literature search. As of June 22(nd), 2021, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per one million population as well as total recoveries were obtained. The association between Vit D deficiency and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots. Results: Non-significant correlations were observed between the number of COVID-19 infections (r=0.363; p=0.116), and recoveries (r=0.388, p=0.091) with the prevalence of mild Vit D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). Similarly, non-significant correlations were observed between COVID-19 infections (r=0.215, p=0.392) and recoveries (r=0.242, p=0.332) with the prevalence of severe Vit deficiency (<30 nmol/L).

In the present work, a Gellan Gum (GG)-based hydrogel modified with GRGDS peptide, together with adipose tissue-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), was used as a therapeutic strategy after a C2 hemisection SCI in rats. Hydrogel or cells alone, and a group without treatment, were also tested. Four weeks after injury, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were performed to assess functional phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) innervation of the diaphragm; no differences were observed amongst groups, confirming that the PhMN pool located between C3 and C5 was not affected by the C2 injury or by the treatments. In the same line, the vast majority of diaphragmatic neuromuscular junctions remained intact. Five weeks post-injury, inspiratory bursting of the affected ipsilateral hemidiaphragm was evaluated through EMG recordings of dorsal, medial and ventral subregions of the muscle. All treatments significantly increased EMG amplitude at the ventral portion in comparison to untreated animals, but only the combinatorial group presented increased EMG amplitude at the medial portion of the hemidiaphragm. No differences were observed in forelimb motor function, neither in markers for axonal regrowth (neuronal tracers), astrogliosis (GFAP) and inflammatory cells (CD68). Moreover, using Von Frey testing of mechanical allodynia, it was possible to find a significant effect of the group combining hydrogel and cells on hypersensitivity; rats with a SCI displayed an increased response of the contralateral forelimb to a normally innocuous mechanical stimulus, but after treatment with the combinatorial therapy this behavior was reverted almost to the levels of uninjured controls.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made the development of effective approaches for online education even more crucial. Here we assessed the readiness, interest and potential models for effective implementation of ICT-powered oncology education in Africa. METHODS: Building on previous work by the African Organisation for Research and Training in Cancer (AORTIC), a survey was conducted to assess the electronic learning (e-Learning) readiness of oncology health professionals using an online self-assessment tool. Components of e-Learning readiness assessed include access to computers, Internet, appropriate bandwidth and interest. As a practical test model, an ICT resource-intensive radiation oncology training programme was implemented via the Global Oncology University (GO-U) collaborative education platform. An analysis of results, challenges and opportunities resulting from these is discussed for advancing online oncology education in Africa. RESULTS: The survey showed over 92% of health professionals have access to computers, laptops or other technology that can allow them to participate in online education. Over 45% of oncology health professionals have already participated in some form of online education. Interest in online education was over 93%. Models for effective online learning in oncology include synchronous and asynchronous short-term courses for continuous education and long-term degree and residency programmes.

We found a strong link between self-intention to self-isolate and intention to make unusual purchases, providing empirical evidence that the reported consumer behavior was directly linked to anticipated time spent in self-isolation. The results further revealed exposure to online information sources led to increased information overload and cyberchondria. Information overload was also a strong predictor of cyberchondria. Perceived severity of the situation and cyberchondria had significant impacts on people's intention to make unusual purchases and voluntarily self-isolate.

While there has been much focus on T cell-mediated immune responses, limited knowledge exists on the role of mature B cells. We describe an approach, including a cell-based ELISA, to evaluate mature IgG antibody responses to melanoma from human peripheral blood B cells. We observed a significant increase in antibody responses from melanoma patients (n = 10) to primary and metastatic melanoma cells compared to healthy volunteers (n = 10) (P<0.0001). Interestingly, we detected a significant reduction in antibody responses to melanoma with advancing disease stage in our patient cohort (n = 21) (P<0.0001). Overall, 28% of melanoma patient-derived B cell cultures (n = 1,800) compared to 2% of cultures from healthy controls (n = 600) produced antibodies that recognized melanoma cells. Lastly, a patient-derived melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody was selected for further study. This antibody effectively killed melanoma cells in vitro via antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. These data demonstrate the presence of a mature systemic B cell response in melanoma patients, which is reduced with disease progression, adding to previous reports of tumor-reactive antibodies in patient sera, and suggesting the merit of future work to elucidate the clinical relevance of activating humoral immune responses to cancer.","output":"Monitoring the Systemic Human Memory B Cell Compartment of Melanoma Patients for Anti-Tumor IgG Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teacher education (TE) is not only about skills and knowledge but also about citizenship formation as student teachers are prepared for the democratic assignment of school. In a postdigital era, blurred boundaries between digital technologies and physical reality place new demands on citizenship, teacher education institutions (TEIs), and teacher educators (TEDs). This paper explores Swedish TEDs views of digital citizenship and the professional digital competence (PDC) required for teaching subject student teachers to teach for digital citizenship. Seven TEIs participated and 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with TEDs teaching a Core Education Subjects module on education and democracy mandatory for all student teachers. TEDs generally believe that the digitalization of society impacts the democratic assignment and addressing this requires specific PDC. Conceptualizations of digital citizenship tend to foreground source criticism as well as ethical, safe, and sound use of digital technologies, and to some degree also (im-)material means of democratic participation. While generally believing that TE should address questions relating to digital citizenship and that TEDs have an important role in this regard, digital technologies are discussed in the module coincidentally and TEDs are unsure to what degree student teachers receive such training. Challenges include lack of time and unclear Degree Objectives. To develop TEDs PDC to include questions relating to digital citizenship in their teaching, support is needed through policy and continuous professional development for TEDs, including reviews of course content and program structure.

The high transmission rate and pathogenicity of this virus have made COVID-19 a major public health concern globally. Basically, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is the third introduction of a highly infectious human epidemic coronavirus in the twenty-first century. Various research groups have claimed bats to be the natural host of SARS-CoV-2. However, the intermediate host and mode of transmission from bat to humans are not revealed yet. The COVID-19 cost hundreds and thousands of lives and millions are facing the consequences. The objective of this chapter was to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 and problems faced globally. METHODS All published relevant literature from scientific sources and reputed news channels are considered to write the current review. RESULTS Generally, elder persons and more particularly people with underlying medical conditions are found to be highly vulnerable to severe infection and prone to fatal outcomes. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment with clinically approved drugs or vaccines to treat this disease. Several research groups have been investigating the efficacies of several antiviral and repurposed drugs. Currently, most of the SARS-COV-2 vaccines are at the preclinical or clinical stage of development. The latest research progress on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and current status of therapeutic intervention indicates that still a specific drug or vaccine needs to come up for the effective treatment of the pandemic COVID-19. It is observed that various aspects of social life, economic status, and healthcare systems are majorly affected by this pandemic. CONCLUSION It is concluded that the outbreak of COVID-19 has severely affected each and every field, such as social, scientific, industrial, transport, and medical sectors. Irrespective of tremendous efforts globally, few vaccines are now available for the prevention of the disease. Specific drug is not available publicly for the treatment of COVID-19. Prevention of air pollution that can aggravate COVID-19 has been suggested. Therefore, as of now, social distancing and sanitization practices are the only options available for the prevention of the disease for many.","output":"Outbreak of COVID-19: A Detailed Overview and Its Consequences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study found infrequent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to healthcare workers involved in the care of the first five case-patients in Taiwan, despite a substantial number of unprotected exposures.

Methods: Country-specific data for COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic details, BCG coverage and policy, age-specific TB incidence and income level were obtained. The crude COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population were calculated and assessed against the parameters indicating immunity from BCG using linear regression analysis. Results: Univariate analysis identified higher income level of a country to be significantly associated with COVID-19 cases (p<0.0001) and deaths (p<0.0001) but not with its case fatality rate. The association between COVID-19 and TB was strongest for TB incidence in patients >65-years (Cases(r s =-0.785,p=0.0001)) and deaths (r s =-0.647,p=0.0001).Multivariate analysis identified the higher income level of a country and not having a universal BCG vaccination policy to affect the COVID-19 cases. The deaths were inversely affected by the presence of BCG vaccination policy and coverage;and positively by the TB incidence in patients >65-years.

In this study, we present an empirical work for assessing ecological responses with botanical legacy data in the Qilian Mountains of China. Plot-scale and transect-wide survey was conducted for alpine shrub communities along an elevational gradient 20 years ago. Recently, we resampled the permanent plots to investigate how the community changes may be linked to climatic variability. We found no significant temporal shifts in species richness; but the community structure underwent substantial changes, as indicated by visible shifts in the relative density of dominant shrub species and the frequency of occurrence of understory herbaceous species. This reshuffling of plant community composition reflected a series of complex responses to climate change. Specifically, wet-demanding species have become more frequent due to the recently enhanced precipitation, while the replacement of some low-statured plants with different requirements for light was indirectly regulated by climate warming via reshaping the altitudinal patterns of dominant shrubs. Climate-mediated shifts in shrub species distribution altered the expected evolutional trajectory of alpine community, which increased the complexity and nonlinearity of the responses of the communities at different altitudes to climatic variability. Our results suggested that in-depth knowledge of indirect effects can facilitate to lessen the uncertainty in predicting future community dynamics in a changing climate.","output":"Impact of climate change on alpine plant community in Qilian Mountains of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt HIV prevention services.

Methods We developed an automated algorithm to search 264 keywords derived from nine subtopics within the MCPEM category in the FOAM Search (a customized FOAM search tool) and the Social Media index. The top 100 results were extracted for each keyword. Resources underwent a manual iterative screening process, and those relevant to endocrine, metabolic, or nutritional disorders and EM were evaluated with the revised Medical Education Translational Resources: Impact and Quality (rMETRIQ) tool. Results The search yielded 36,346 resources, of which 756 met the criteria for quality assessment. After rMETRIQ tool training, four raters demonstrated an average measured intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.94 (95% confidence interval = 0.88 to 0.97, p < 0.001). A total of 121 posts (16% of posts) covering 25 subtopics were identified as high quality (rMETRIQ 16). The most covered subtopic was potassium disorders, representing 15% of all posts. Subtopics that did not have a high-quality resource identified include metabolic alkalosis, respiratory alkalosis, fluid overload, phosphorus metabolism, hyperglycemia, malabsorption, malnutrition, and thyroiditis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXR and CT findings of 50 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for S-OIV infection were reviewed by four radiologists. The final study group of 50 patients was divided into two subgroups on the basis of clinical course: group 1 consisted of 42 patients requiring noninvasive mechanical ventilation and admitted to the UTSIR; group 2 consisted of eight patients who required ICU admission and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or advanced mechanical ventilation from October 2009 to December 2009. All patients underwent CXR and thinsection multidetector CT (MDCT) scan; the initial and follow-up radiographs and CT scans were evaluated for the presentation and follow-up pattern (consolidation, groundglass opacities, nodules, reticulation), distribution and extent of abnormality. RESULTS: All patients had radiological signs of pulmonary involvement. Ground-glass opacity and consolidation, which was mainly peripheral, was the most frequent finding. In three patients, we report for the first time in viral pneumonia the reversed halo sign. Lesion extent was related to aggressiveness of the illness. More often, both lungs were involved (82%). Thoracic comorbidity was present in 18% of patients; 22% of patients was obese, and in this group, the clinical course was more aggressive than in the others with the same lesion extent at imaging. Furthermore, superinfection led to worsening of the clinical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The most common CXR and CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection were unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. On MDCT, ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation had a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution, resembling organising pneumonia; they progressed to bilateral extensive airspace disease in severely ill patients.","output":"H1N1 pneumonia: our experience in 50 patients with a severe clinical course of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use anonymized and aggregated data from Facebook to show that areas with stronger social ties to two early COVID-19 \\"hotspots\\" (Westchester County, NY, in the U.S. and Lodi province in Italy) generally have more confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 30, 2020.

However, the integrity of the endothelium barrier is compromised in an array of pathological settings, including ischemic disease and cancer, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. The resulting vascular hyperpermeability to plasma molecules as well as leukocytes then leads to tissue damaging edema formation and inflammation. The vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is a potent permeability factor, and therefore a desirable target for impeding vascular hyperpermeability. However, VEGFA also promotes angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, which is required for reperfusion of ischemic tissues. Moreover, edema increases interstitial pressure in poorly perfused tumors, thereby affecting the delivery of therapeutics, which could be counteracted by stimulating the growth of new functional blood vessels. Thus, targets must be identified to accurately modulate the barrier function of blood vessels without affecting angiogenesis, as well as to develop more effective pro- or anti-angiogenic therapies. Recent studies have shown that the VEGFA co-receptor neuropilin 1 (NRP1) could be playing a fundamental role in steering VEGFA-induced responses of vascular endothelial cells towards angiogenesis or vascular permeability. Moreover, NRP1 is involved in mediating permeability signals induced by ligands other than VEGFA. This review therefore focuses on current knowledge on the role of NRP1 in the regulation of vascular permeability signaling in the endothelium to provide an up-to-date landscape of the current knowledge in this field.","output":"Neuropilin 1 Regulation of Vascular Permeability Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic testing to identify persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is central to control the global pandemic of COVID-19 that began in late 2019.

DNA composed of 7-deaza-2-deoxyguanosine 5-triphosphate (c(7)dGTP), an analog of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), is resistant to selective restriction enzymes. This characteristic has been utilized to develop a novel strategy for target enrichment in next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: The new enrichment strategy is named target enrichment via enzymatic digestion in next-generation sequencing (TEEDseq). It combined 7-deaza-2-deoxyguanosine 5-triphosphate (c(7)dGTP)-involved primer extension, splinter-assisted intracellular cyclization, c(7)dGTP)-resistant enzymatic digestion, and two-phase rolling cycle amplification. We first estimated c7dGTP for its efficiency in PCR amplification and its resistance to three restriction enzymes, AluI, HaeIII, and HpyCH4V. We then evaluated TEEDseq using a serum sample spiked with a 1311-bp hepatitis B virus (HBV) fragment. TEEDseq achieved an HBV on-target rate of 3.31  0.39%, which was equivalent to 454 the enrichment of direct Illumina sequencing. Therefore, the current study has provided a concept proof for TEEDseq as an alternative option for clinical viral sequencing that requires an enrichment in next-generation sequencing.","output":"A novel target enrichment strategy in next-generation sequencing through 7-deaza-dGTP-resistant enzymatic digestion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Skull base osteomyelitis that is secondary to otitis media is extremely rare in the modern antibiotic era.

The pooling strategy of combining 10 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 samples into one pool (10/1) was used in this study. The results were compared with neat sample testing using the same Aptima?

However, little is known about factors associated with tuberculosis treatment outcomes in this underserved group. In this study, we aimed to investigate social and health factors associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes in young people with tuberculosis in Brazil. METHODS A national retrospective cohort study was done using data from Sistema de Informa??o de Agravos de Notifica??o (SINAN), the national tuberculosis registry in Brazil. People aged 10-24 years (young people) with tuberculosis registered in SINAN between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, were included. Unfavourable outcomes were defined as loss to follow-up, treatment failure, and death. Favourable outcome was defined as treatment success. Multiple logistic regression models estimated the association between social and health factors and tuberculosis treatment outcomes. FINDINGS 67 360 young people with tuberculosis were notified to SINAN, and we included 41 870 young people in our study. 7024 (17%) of the 41 870 included individuals had unfavourable treatment outcomes. Young people who received government cash transfers were less likely to have an unfavourable outcome (adjusted odds ratio 083, 95% CI 070-099).

It is essential to elucidate these mechanisms in non-hyperinsulinaemia healthy persons. This establishes a baseline for investigation into pathologies where these processes are dysregulated, such as in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), certain cancers and dementias. Chronic hyperinsulinaemia enforces glucose fueling, depleting the NAD+ dependent antioxidant activity that increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Consequently, beta-cell mitochondria increase uncoupling protein expression, which decreases the mitochondrial ATP surge generation capacity, impairing bolus mediated insulin exocytosis. Excessive ROS increases the Drp1:Mfn2 ratio, increasing mitochondrial fission, which increases mtROS; endoplasmic reticulum-stress and impaired calcium homeostasis ensues. Healthy individuals in habitual ketosis have significantly lower glucagon and insulin levels than T2DM individuals. As beta-hydroxybutyrate rises, hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis supply extra-hepatic glucose needs, and osteocalcin synthesis/release increases. We propose insulins primary role is regulating beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis, while the role of bone regulates glucose uptake sensitivity via osteocalcin. Osteocalcin regulates the alpha-cell glucagon secretory profile via glucagon-like peptide-1 and serotonin, and beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis via regulating basal insulin levels.

The aim of this study was to describe one otolaryngology residency program's efforts towards reformatting its journal club, evaluate how well the re-designed format enabled participants to achieve journal club goals compared to the prior format, and assess faculty and resident qualitative perceptions of both formats. DESIGN: An 11-question survey was sent to all department faculty and residents to obtain feedback regarding the original journal club format. The results of this initial survey were then used to redesign the journal club format, which consisted of 3 rotating session types: evidence-based, deep-dive, and landmark. A 6-month pilot program using the redesigned format was implemented, and surveys were sent at the halfway mark and at the conclusion of the pilot to evaluate the effectiveness of these format changes. SETTING: A single academic center with an otolaryngology residency program PARTICIPANTS: : Residents and faculty in the department of otolaryngology RESULTS: Compared to the original format, the 6-month pilot demonstrated a more consistent attainment of journal club goals and a near-unanimous preference for the new format. This preference was consistent among both faculty (90.9%) and residents (89%). All respondents agreed that the intended goals of journal club were more frequently met under the revamped format, and statistically significant differences in approval rate were observed in the specific areas of critically assessing the literature, highlighting new findings, and translating forefront knowledge.

The patients were divided into two groups as group 1 (March to August 2020) diagnosed in the first six months of the pandemic and group 2 (September 2020 to February 2021) diagnosed in the second six months. CT images of the patients were analyzed for the frequency of typical and atypical findings. Evaluation was made in terms of disease suspicion and severity by scoring methods, and the relationship between atypical findings and disease severity was examined. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the frequency and distribution patterns of typical CT findings observed in both groups. The most common atypical finding in both groups was nodular lesions. Central distribution, one of the atypical findings, was not seen in group 1, whereas it was present in nine patients in group 2 (p=0.001).

The genomes of strains aGD and GD shared high similarity (99.87 %) and most of the mutations occurred in S gene. Recombinant IBV strain rGDaGD-S, in which the S gene was replaced with the corresponding regions from aGD, showed decreased pathogenicity compared with its parental strain. In conclusion, attenuated TW-like IBV strain aGD is a potential vaccine candidate and the S gene is responsible for its attenuation. Our research has laid the foundation for future exploration of the attenuating molecular mechanism of IBV.","output":"An attenuated TW-like infectious bronchitis virus strain has potential to become a candidate vaccine and S gene is responsible for its attenuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naturally occurring phenanthroindolizidine and phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (PIAs and PQAs) are two small groups of herbal metabolites sharing a similar pentacyclic structure with a highly oxygenated phenanthrene moiety fused with a saturated or an unsaturated N-heterocycle (indolizidine/quinolizidine moieties).

Up to date, more than one hundred natural PIAs, while only nine natural PQAs had been described. PIA and PQA analogues have been applied to the development of potent anticancer agents all along because of their excellent cytotoxic activity. However, in the last two decades, other great biological properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities were revealed successively by different pharmacological assays. Especially because of their potent antiviral activity against coronavirus (TGEV, SARS CoV and MHV) and tobacco mosaic virus, PIA and PQA analogues have attracted much pharmaceutical attention again, some of them have been used to present interesting targets for total or semi synthesis, and structureCactivity relationship (SAR) study for the development of antiviral agents. In this review, natural PIA and PQA analogues obtained in the last two decades with their herbal origins, key spectroscopic characteristics for structural identification, biological activity with possible SARs and application prospects were systematically summarized.

The goal of this study was to characterize these self-reported efforts by the pediatric simulation community. DESIGN: This was a global, multicenter survey developed via a Delphi process. SETTING: International survey study. SUBJECTS: The survey was sent to 555 individual members of the three largest international pediatric simulation societies (The International Pediatric Simulation Society, International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research & Education, and Netzwerk Kindersimulation e.V.) between April 27, 2020, and May 18, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Description of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic simulation-based preparation activities of pediatric acute and critical care healthcare providers. The Delphi process included 20 content experts and required three rounds to reach consensus. The survey was completed by 234 participants (42.2%) from 19 countries. Preparation differed significantly between the geographic regions, with 79.3% of Anglo-American/Anglo-Saxon, 82.6% of Indian, and 47.1% of European participants initiating specifically coronavirus disease 2019-related simulation activities. Frequent modifications to existing simulation programs included the use of telesimulation and virtual reality training. Forty-nine percent of institutions discontinued noncoronavirus disease 2019-related simulation training. CONCLUSIONS: The swift incorporation of disease-specific sessions and the transition of standard education to virtual or hybrid simulation training modes occurred frequently. The approach used, however, depended heavily on local requirements, limitations, and circumstances. In particular, the use of telesimulation allowed education to continue while maintaining social distancing requirements.","output":"Readiness for and Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Among Pediatric Healthcare Providers: The Role of Simulation for Pandemics and Other Disasters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arid and semiarid environments of the world are prone to dramatic seasonal changes that affect the availability of scarce, patchily distributed resources such as water. In response to these changes, animals migrate or partition resources to minimize competition, resulting in temporal patterns within assemblages across multiple scales. Here, we demonstrate that the winter dry season bat assemblage in a semiarid grassland of northwest India exhibits both seasonal changes in composition and temporal avoidance between coexisting species at water bodies. Using a passive acoustic monitoring framework to quantify activity patterns at different points in the season, we show that two species (Rhinolophus lepidus and Tadarida aegyptiaca) exhibit seasonal differences in activity, being more frequently detected in the early and late parts of the dry season respectively. Two other species (Pipistrellus tenuis and Scotophilus heathii) do not exhibit seasonal changes in activity, but structure their diel activity patterns to minimize temporal overlap (and thus competition) at water bodies. These data, some of the first on bats from this region, demonstrate the complex temporal patterns structuring bat assemblages in arid and semiarid biomes.

This analysis examines crisis communication in an organization faced with major financial losses, staff redundancies, and disruption. It analyses how these and necessary crisis responses were communicated to stakeholders, using situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), as its analytical framework. While noting alternative perspectives such as crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) theory, SCCT is identified as the most widely applied theory of crisis communication, and thus warrants ongoing review in an era of media fragmentation, disinformation, and low public trust.

A single incision of 3 cm was made in an intercostal space along the anterior axillary line. Perioperative outcomes and the safety between SP-VATS and TP-VATS lobectomy for NSCLC was compared. RESULTS In the SP-VATS group, incision size was kept to a minimum, with a median of 3 cm; mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed in all patients with malignancy. Overall, median operative time was 89 minutes, and median chest tube duration was 3.1 days. The VAS on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14 was less in the SP-VATS group than that in the TP-VATS group. The VAS on days 1, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 did not differ significantly between the two groups. The number of days of use of analgesic agents after surgery was less in the SP-VATS group.

To date, studies have not compared peoples experiences with telehealth services during the pandemic in Australia to their experiences with traditional in-person visits. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare participants perceptions of telehealth consults to their perceptions of traditional in-person visits and investigate whether people believe that telehealth services would be useful after the pandemic. METHODS: A national, cross-sectional, community survey was conducted between June 5 and June 12, 2020 in Australia. In total, 1369 participants who were aged 18 years and lived in Australia were recruited via targeted advertisements on social media (ie, Facebook and Instagram). Participants responded to survey questions about their telehealth experience, which included a free-text response option. A generalized linear model was used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of having a poorer telehealth experience than a traditional in-person visit experience. Content analysis was performed to determine the reasons why telehealth experiences were worse than traditional in-person visit experiences. RESULTS: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (n=369, 61.9%) stated that their telehealth experience was just as good as or better than their traditional in-person medical appointment experience. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately useful to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic ends (mean 3.67, SD 1.1). Being male (P=.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (P=.016), and lower patient activation scores (ie, individuals willingness to take on the role of managing their health/health care) (P=.036) were significantly associated with a poor telehealth experience. In total, 6 overarching themes were identified from free-text responses for why participants telehealth experiences were poorer than their traditional in-person medical appointment experiences, as follows: communication is not as effective, limitations with technology, issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology results, reduced confidence in their doctor, additional burden for complex care, and inability to be physically examined. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our samples responses, telehealth appointment experiences were comparable to traditional in-person medical appointment experiences.

However, the diagnosis of IIVDE is challenging because the prognosis and imaging characteristics are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of tentatively diagnosed IIVDE in dogs to assess the prognostic utility of neurological grade and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. METHODS: Twenty dogs were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Nonchondrodystrophic breeds (n = 16) were more predisposed than chondrodystrophic breeds. Most dogs showed acute onset of clinical signs. Neurological examination at admission showed predominant non-ambulatory paraparesis (n = 9); paresis (n = 16) was confirmed more frequently than paralysis (n = 4). Follow-up neurological examination results were only available for 11 dogs, ten of whom showed neurological improvement and 8 showed successful outcomes at 1 month. The characteristic MRI findings include thoracic vertebra (T)2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, intramedullary linear tracts with reduced disc volume, and cleft of the annulus fibrosus. None of the MRI measurements were significantly correlated with neurological grade at admission. Neurological grade did not differ according to the presence of parenchymal hemorrhage, parenchymal contrast enhancement, and meningeal contrast enhancement. Neurological grades at admission showed a statistical correlation with those observed at the 1-month follow-up (r = 0.814, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: IIVDE is a rare form of disc extrusion commonly experienced after physical activity or trauma and most frequently affects the cranial-cervical and thoracolumbar regions of nonchondrodystrophic dog breeds.

SETTING: A selected Rohingya camp situated in Coxs Bazar, a southeastern district of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Information was collected from 416 conveniently selected FDMNs who were aged 60 years and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was misconceptions related to the spread, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Information on 14 different locally relevant misconceptions was gathered, each was scored as one, and obtained a cumulative score, ranging from 0 to 14, with a higher score indicating a higher level of misconceptions. A multiple linear regression model explored the factors associated with misconceptions. RESULTS: The participants had an average of five misconceptions. The most prevalent misconceptions were: everyone should wear personal protective equipment when outside (84.6%) and its prevention by nutritious food (62.5%) and drinking water (59.3%). Other notable misconceptions included the spread of COVID-19 through mosquito bites (42%) and its transmissions only to the non/less religious person (31.4%).

Methods This was an observational study that comprised all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University Hospital of Modena, Italy from 21 February to 6 April 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed with PCR positive nasopharyngeal swabs while the presence of pneumonia was radiologically confirmed. Patients received standard of care according to national guidelines for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients' full medical history, demographic and epidemiological features, clinical data, complete blood count, coagulation, inflammatory and biochemical markers were routinely collected and aggregated in a clinically-oriented logical framework in order to build different datasets.

Efficient inactive, subunit, or viral-like particle vaccines usually rely on a safe and potent adjuvant to boost the immune response to the antigen.

The development of adjuvants has paralleled our increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms for the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated activation of immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a group of PRRs that recognize microbial pathogens to initiate a hosts response to infection. Activation of TLRs triggers potent and immediate innate immune responses, which leads to subsequent adaptive immune responses. Therefore, these TLRs are ideal targets for the development of effective adjuvants. To date, TLR agonists such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and CpG-1018 have been formulated in licensed vaccines for their adjuvant activity, and other TLR agonists are being developed for this purpose. The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated clinical research of vaccines containing TLR agonist-based adjuvants.

Being the rate-limiting (i.e., the slowest) step, the host Furin cleavage is instrumental in the abrupt increase in transmissibility in COVID-19, compared to earlier onsets of respiratory viral diseases. In such a context, the current paper entraps a disorder-to-order transition of the FLCS(Spike) (concomitant to an entropy arrest) upon binding to Furin. The interaction clearly seems to be optimized for a more efficient proteolytic cleavage in SARS-CoV-2. The study further shows the formation of dynamically interchangeable and persistent networks of salt-bridges at the SpikeCFurin interface in SARS-CoV-2 involving the three arginines (R682, R683, R685) of the FLCS(Spike) with several anionic residues (E230, E236, D259, D264, D306) coming from Furin, strategically distributed around its catalytic triad. Multiplicity and structural degeneracy of plausible salt-bridge network archetypes seem to be the other key characteristic features of the SpikeCFurin binding in SARS-CoV-2, allowing the system to breathea trademark of protein disorder transitions. Interestingly, with respect to the homologous interaction in SARS-CoV (2002/2003) taken as a baseline, the SpikeCFurin binding events, generally, in the coronavirus lineage, seems to have preference for ionic bond formation, even with a lesser number of cationic residues at their potentially polybasic FLCS(Spike) patches. The interaction energies are suggestive of characteristic metastabilities attributed to SpikeCFurin interactions, generally to the coronavirus lineage, which appears to be favorable for proteolytic cleavages targeted at flexible protein loops. The current findings not only offer novel mechanistic insights into the coronavirus molecular pathology and evolution, but also add substantially to the existing theories of proteolytic cleavages.","output":"Capturing a Crucial Disorder-to-Order Transition at the Heart of the Coronavirus Molecular PathologyTriggered by Highly Persistent, Interchangeable Salt-Bridges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented healthcare crisis with various governmental healthcare policies enforced to redirect medical prioritization and minimize the spread of COVID19 infection.

The Alterra Prestent internally reduces and reconfigures the RVOT, providing a stable landing zone for the 29-mm SAPIEN 3 THV. METHODS: Eligible patients had moderate or greater PR, weighed >20 kg, and had RVOT diameter 27 to 38 mm and length >35 mm. The primary endpoint was device success, a 5-item composite: 1 Alterra Prestent deployed in the desired location, 1 SAPIEN 3 THV implanted in the desired location within the Prestent, right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery peak-to-peak gradient <35 mm Hg after THV implantation, less than moderate PR at discharge, and no explantation 24 h post-implantation.

Early identification of later converters is crucial for optimal treatment decisions. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive potential of OCT measures in individuals with RIS regarding conversion to MS. METHODS This prospective observational cohort study included 36 individuals with RIS and 36 healthy controls (HC) recruited from two German MS centers. All individuals received a baseline OCT and clinical examination and were longitudinally followed over up to six years. The primary outcome measure was the conversion to MS. RESULTS During clinical follow-up of 46 (26-58) months (median, 25%-75% interquartile range), eight individuals with RIS converted to MS. Individuals converting to MS showed a thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and the common ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIP) at baseline and during follow-up. Individuals with a pRNFL of 99 m or lower or a GCIP of 1.99 mm3 or lower were at a 7.5 and 8.0-fold risk for MS conversion, respectively, compared to individuals with higher measures. After correction for other known risk factors, Cox proportional hazards regression revealed a hazard ratio of 1.08 for conversion to MS for each 1 m decline in pRNFL. CONCLUSIONS Reduction of the pRNFL might be a novel and independent risk factor for conversion to MS in individuals with RIS.

We analysed 64 clusters to make inferences on serial interval and potential role of pre\\\\symptomatic transmission. RESULTS: We estimated an epidemic doubling time of 5.3 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.3, 6.7) and a median incubation period of 4.6 days (95% CI: 4.0, 5.2). We estimated a serial interval distribution with mean 5.7 days (95% CI: 4.7, 6.8) and standard deviation 3.5 days, and effective reproductive number was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.35). We estimated that 32/80 (40%) of transmission events were likely to have occurred prior to symptoms onset in primary cases. Secondary cases in clusters had less severe illness on average than cluster primary cases.

Using mathematical modelling, we updated estimates for those living with chronic HCV in Australia, new cases of decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related mortality among the HCV-cured and viraemic populations from 2015 to 2030. We considered various DAA treatment scenarios incorporating annual treatment numbers to 2020, and subsequent uptake per year of 6,790 (pessimistic), 8,100 (intermediate), and 11,310 (optimistic). We incorporated the effects of excess alcohol consumption and reduction in progression to DC and HCC among cirrhosis-cured versus viraemic individuals. At the end of 2020, we estimated 117,810 Australians were living with chronic HCV. New cases per year of DC, HCC, and liver-related mortality among the HCV viraemic population decreased rapidly from 2015 (almost eliminated by 2030). In contrast, the growing population size of those cured with advanced liver disease meant DC, HCC, and liver-related mortality declined slowly. The estimated reduction in liver-related mortality from 2015 to 2030 in the combined HCV viraemic and cured population is 25% in the intermediate scenario.

Rehabilitating begins following the diagnosis and throughout any additional treatment processes, especially vis--vis consulting with physical, occupational, and/or speech pathology therapist(s). Therapy uses daily administration of either the dopamine precursor levodopa (with carbidopa) or a dopamine agonist, compounds that preserve residual dopamine, and other specific motor/non-motor-related compounds. Restorative uses strenuous aerobic exercise programs that can be neuroprotective. Maintenance uses complementary and alternative medicine substances that potentially support and protect the brain microenvironment.

Results: The 166 patients meeting inclusion criteria had an average age of 64.1 ( 14.8). No significant difference in mortality was identified with male vs. female gender (57.9% vs. 42.1%, p=0.852) or BMI (8.4  0.9 vs. 12.1  1.5, p=0.727). The majority of the patient cohort was identified as black (68.2%). The overall mortality of our cohort was 38.2%. Hyperlipidemia (p=0.011), coronary artery disease (0.034), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.006) were all associated with higher mortality. Prone positioning was utilized in 42.8% of all patients, and ECMO in 6.0%. There was a significant difference of mortality between those with higher observed ventilator plateau pressures at 24 hours (25.7 vs. 23.1, p=0.010) and driving pressures at 24 hours (13.4 vs. 11.7, p=0.036). Conclusion: Covid-19 associated ARDS is associated with significant mortality. Physicians should be aware of pre-existing conditions that are potentially associated with worse outcomes so that they receive appropriate level of care in a timely manner. Lower plateau and driving pressures were associated with improved outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to guide Covid-19 associated ARDS management.","output":"Icu outcomes in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS: A retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the worldwide emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been international concerns about the possible viral evolution into variants with underlying mutations that may contribute to their increased transmissibility, disease severity, risk of death, and their potential escape from the immune response or may even lead to its extinction.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ERAS combined with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in CRC surgery. Methods This was a retrospective study of patients with CRC who underwent surgery between April 2018 and April 2020 in Ruijin Hospital(North), Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. The patients were divided into three groups: group A (n=138), patients who underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic colectomy with conventional perioperative management; group B (n=63), patients who underwent SILS; and group C (n=51), patients who underwent SILS with ERAS. Results Overall, 252 participants were included in the retrospective study. The median operation time (min) in group B and group C was shorter than that in group A (group A 134.0  42.5; group B 117  38.9; group C 111.7  35.4, p=0.004). The estimated surgical blood loss (ml) was lower in groups B and C than in group A (group A 165.1  142.2; group B 122.0  79.4; group C 105.2  55.8, p=0.011). The length of surgical incision (cm) was shorter in groups B and C than in group A (group A 7.34  1.05; group B 5.60  0.80; group C 5.28  0.52, p<0.001). The time before first flatus (hours) in group C was shorter than in groups A and B (group A 61.85  21.14; group B 58.30  20.08; group C 42.06  23.72; p<0.001). The days prior to the administration of free oral fluids in group C was shorter than in groups A and B (group A 4.79  1.28; group B 4.67  1.11; group C 2.62  0.64; p<0.001). The days of prior solid diet was less in group C than in groups A and B (group A 7.22  3.87; group B 7.08  3.18; group C 5.75  1.70; p=0.027). The postoperative length of stay (LOS) was less in group C compared with that in groups A and B (group A 9.46  4.84 days; group B 9.52  7.45 days; group C 7.20  2.37 days; p=0.023). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores on day 0, 1, and 2 in groups B and C were lower than those in group A (day 0, p<0.001; day 1, p<0.001; day 2, p=0.002), while the VAS score on day 3 showed no differences in the three groups (group A 1.29  1.38; group B 0.98  1.24; group C 0.75  0.64, p=0.018). Conclusion The findings suggest that SILS combined with ERAS may be a feasible and safe procedure for CRC surgery because it provides favorable cosmetic results, early dietary resumption, shorter hospital stays, and appropriate control of postoperative pain without increases in complications or readmission rates compared to conventional perioperative care with SILS or conventional laparoscopic surgery(CLS) of CRC.

The objective of this study is to help comprehend RFA heat treatment through thermal lesion formation using computer simulation, and thus to provide helpful assistance in planning RFA. METHODS RFA heat treatment is a popular \\"minimally invasive\\" treatment method for both primary and metastatic liver tumors, and the heat treatment is studied by numerical calculation. A finite difference model is used to solve all partial differential equations for a simple three-dimensional cubic geometry model. Maximum tissue temperature is used as a critical index for reaching thermal lesion during RFA. Cylindrical RF cool-tip electrode is internally cooled at constant water temperature. RFA thermal lesion is studied at various impacts by single and countercurrent blood vessel(s) traversing the thermal lesion. Several factors are considered, such as location, diameter, and orientation of the blood vessel(s) to the electrode. RESULTS Results show the thermal lesion size decreases as the lesion blood perfusion rate increases. And, single large blood vessel which is orthogonal to RF electrode will cause less undercooled volume in the thermal lesion than one which is parallel to RF electrode. Furthermore, convective energy may easily damage parallel vessel and its surrounding normal tissues during RFA. Small blood vessels (or larger vessels with slow blood flow rate) during RFA could form \\"tail-like\\" thermal lesion formation, which could damage vessel downstream spots. CONCLUSIONS Studies suggested that incomplete RF tumor ablation still exists within 1 cm distance between large blood vessel and RF electrode in a liver. This could have significant impact on local tumor recurrence rates. Second, if thermally significant vessel existed inevitably within the lesion, avoiding the RF cool-tip electrode placement next to the parallel large blood vessel would have a better heat treatment during RF heating. Additionally, reduced blood flow rate could help reduce significant cooling by large blood vessel.","output":"Influence of blood vessel on the thermal lesion formation during radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine how juvenile justice-involved youth of Haitian descent in Miami-Dade County cope with structural racism and its impact on their mental health.

We use critical race theory and theory of practice to understand youths' perceptions as racialized bodies and stigmatized selves, highlighting the experiences and perspectives of a particular black immigrant group, ethnic beings caught up in the everyday practices of racialization, sociocultural marginalization, and racism. We frame these experiences as a variation of the complex continuum of structural racism and racial domination in the US. These experiences have caused anger, fear, anxiety, chronic anticipatory distress, and hopelessness among youth of Haitian descent.

We determined the crystal structure of two anti-idiotypes in complex with iglb12 and used these anti-idiotypes to identify rare naive human B cells expressing B cell receptors with similarity to iglb12. Immunization with a multimerized version of this anti-idiotype induced the proliferation of transgenic murine B cells expressing the iglb12 heavy chain in vivo, despite the presence of deletion and anergy within this population.

Consideration of partially recovered carriers is hypothesized to play a leading role in the persistence of the disease and its introduction to new areas. A model for transmission of COVID-19 by symptomless partially recovered carriers is proposed and analysed. It is shown that key parameters can be identified such that below a threshold level, built on these parameters, the epidemic tends towards extinction, while above another threshold, it tends towards a nontrivial epidemic state. Moreover, optimal control analysis of the model, using Pontryagin's maximum principle, is performed. The optimal controls are characterized in terms of the optimality system and solved numerically for several scenarios. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number, R c , indicate that the disease is mainly driven by parameters involving the partially recovered carriers rather than symptomatic ones. Moreover, optimal control analysis of the model, using Pontryagin's maximum principle, is performed. The optimal controls were characterized in terms of the optimality system and solved numerically for several scenarios. Numerical simulations were explored to illustrate our theoretical findings, scenarios were built, and the model predicted that social distancing and treatment of the symptomatic will slow down the epidemic curve and reduce mortality of COVID-19 given that there is an average adherence to social distancing and effective treatment are administered.

Numerous nucleic acid detection kits are being rapidly developed and approved for viral etiological diagnosis;however, these are limited by the number of false negatives produced in clinical practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish serological detection methods to serve as supplementary diagnostics. Methods We (1) performed a conservation and specificity analysis of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is the main target of serological diagnosis;(2) integrated various B-cell epitope prediction methods to obtain possible dominant epitope regions for the N protein;(3) applied ELISA to analyze differences in the serological antibody levels for different epitopes;and (4) identified N protein epitopes for IgG and IgM with high specificity. Results SARS-CoV-2 strains showed low mutation rates for the N protein, and the construction of a phylogeny was a good characterization of its molecular evolutionary lineage in relation to other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 showed the closest genetic relationship with SARS-CoV, which showed multiple consecutive long conserved regions at the amino acid level, but differed substantially from other coronaviruses. Tests targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N protein produced strong positive results in SARS-CoV patients in recovery. Of the five epitope dominant regions, using N18-39 and N183-197 for IgG and IgM detection, respectively, can effectively overcome the limitations of cross-reactivity. Conclusions The patients infected with both SARS viruses may exhibit cross-reactivity when using the N protein for antibody detection. However, there are regions of the N protein that can be used for antibody detection and some of these regions showed good specificity even between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the antibody levels detected were consistent with those detected by the complete N protein. These findings provide a basis for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients, and research ideas for developing vaccines.","output":"High-Specificity Targets in SARS-CoV-2 N Protein for Serological Antibody Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children is assessed by quantification of hypopnea and apnea events. Little is known, however, about respiratory timing and breath-to-breath variability during sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory parameters across sleep stages in children with SDB before and after treatment compared with healthy children. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) was conducted in 40 children with SDB prior to and 6 mo following adenotonsillectomy. For comparison, a control group of 40 healthy sex- and age-matched children underwent two PSGs at equivalent time points but without intervention. The following variables were measured breath by breath during obstruction-free periods in stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM), stage 4 NREM, and REM sleep: inspiratory time (Ti), expiratory time (Te), total time (Ttotal), inspiratory duty cycle (DC; =Ti/Ttotal), respiratory frequency (fR), and SD of the parameters Ti, Te, fR, and DC. Variability in waveform morphology was also computed using the residue of respiratory patterns. The severity of SDB was relatively mild in the study cohort (obstructive apnea hypopnea index: baseline, 5.1  9.4 vs. 0.1  0.2, P < 0.001; follow-up, 0.3  0.3 vs. 0.8  1.0, P < 0.01). Compared with healthy controls, children with SDB showed significantly longer Ti and Te and a lower fR at the baseline study. These differences were not significant after adenotonsillectomy. Sleep stages were associated with significant differences in all of the respiratory measures in both groups of children. In conclusion, children with relatively mild SDB showed prolonged inspiration and expiration indicative of chronic narrowing of the upper airway. Treatment of SDB normalizes respiratory timing. Documentation of these parameters may aid in both understanding and management of children with SDB.","output":"Respiratory timing and variability during sleep in children with sleep-disordered breathing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In this chapter the problem of the interaction between groups of subjects singularly characterized by a specific infectious disease is addressed. The dynamical characteristics of an isolated population are preliminary studied, with particular reference to the equilibrium points and their stability. Then, the effects of constant inputs on the dynamics are deeply analyzed also by numerical simulations; this analysis is propaedeutic to the study of the interaction between the groups. The interactions between the different populations are modeled as additional input/output to the single group dynamics introducing total averaged effects including all the external migration effects. This approach focuses on the changes in the dynamics of one population when interactions are present without showing the global migration fluxes, but stressing the influences on each populations. Besides the simplifications of the model, this point of view may be fruitful also with respect of the design of control actions, assuming that each group can adopt the best control strategy for her/his own specific social characteristics. The epidemic case analyzed is HIV-AIDS. This choice has been made since this virus is present all over the world, but with different levels of dangerousness and number of infected patients depending on the economic, social, and cultural habits. The model used is a recently introduced one, which describes this epidemic spread considering two compartments of susceptible people, distinguished by the level of attention with respect to the virus transmission, one of the infected individuals not aware of their status, and two classes of patients, divided according to the level of infection. Additional inputs have been introduced to model fluxes of susceptible individuals and infected but not aware individuals. These effects have been reported in numerous figures showing the results of numerical simulations.","output":"8 Epidemic modeling and control of HIV/AIDS dynamics in populations under external interactions: A worldwide challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the fight against COVID-19, there remains unmet needs in developing point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing tools that can rapidly and sensitively detect the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus to control disease transmission and improve patient management.

METHODS Patients with post-operative neuroimaging and follow-up of at least one year were included. In EEG-fMRI responses, we defined as \\"primary\\" the cluster with the highest absolute t-value located in the cortex, and evaluated three levels of confidence for the results. The threshold for low confidence was t  3.1 (p < 0.005); the one for medium confidence corresponded to correction for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05; and a result reached high confidence when the primary cluster was much more significant than the next highest cluster. Concordance with the resection was determined by comparison to post-operative neuroimaging. RESULTS We evaluated 106 epilepsy surgeries in 84 patients. An increasing association between concordance and surgical outcome with higher levels of confidence was demonstrated. If the peak response was not resected, the surgical outcome was likely to be poor: for the high confidence level, no patient had a good outcome; for the medium and low levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome. The positive predictive value remained low for all confidence levels, indicating that removing the maximum cluster did not ensure seizure freedom. CONCLUSION Resection of the primary EEG-fMRI cluster, especially in high confidence cases, is necessary to obtain a good outcome, but not sufficient.

In 131 untreated, acute COVID-19 patients at emergency room arrival, monocytes showed decreased surface molecule expression, including low HLA-DR, in association with an inflammatory cytokine status and limited anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response. Most of these alterations had normalized in post-COVID-19 patients 6 months after discharge. Acute COVID-19 monocytes transcriptome showed upregulation of anti-inflammatory tissue repair genes such as BCL6, AREG and IL-10 and increased accessibility of chromatin. Some of these transcriptomic and epigenetic features still remained in post-COVID-19 monocytes. Importantly, a poorer expression of surface molecules and low IRF1 gene transcription in circulating monocytes at admission defined a COVID-19 patient group with impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response and increased risk of requiring intensive care or dying.

Lipoabdominoplasty is one of the precarious aesthetic treatments with risk for thrombosis. COVID-19 convalescent patients may have an abnormally high rate of thrombotic events, which should be studied further. Patients with a history of COVID-19 infection who undergo the aesthetic procedure may have a greater risk of thrombosis than non-COVID-19 patients who undergo lipoabdominoplasty. Methods: Thirty-seven patients who underwent lipoabdominoplasty were followed retrospectively for the occurrence of thrombotic events postoperatively and their relationship to previous COVID-19 infection. The study design comprised an examination of their medical records for prior COVID-19 infection, a history of thrombotic events before, during, or following COVID-19 infection, and D-dimer levels during and after COVID-19 infection. Thrombotic signs were studied in COVID-19 convalescent and non-COVID-19 patients following lipoabdominoplasty. The universal prophylactic measures for anticoagulation were followed. Results: Four patients out of 37 (10.18%) had thrombotic manifestations, with a high incidence in the COVID-19 convalescent group. The occurrence rate in COVID-19 patients was 30.7%, much higher than the global rate (0.2%). The presence of D-dimers was discovered to be abundant.

Clinical features and time to recovery of admitted clients vary across settings. Therefore showing clinical features and recovery time from COVID-19 in a different setting is necessary to design appropriate treatment and preventive measures. So, this study attempted to investigate the clinical features and time to recovery of admitted clients to Dilla University Referral Hospital treatment center, Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective study design was conducted in 220 patients confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction and admitted to Dilla University Referral Hospital treatment center from September 2020 to July 2021. Data were collected from the patients record. Data entry was done by an Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0 and analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 software. Descriptive statistics were used for clinical features, and median time to recovery was computed by using KaplanCMeier. Results Common clinical features were cough 209 (95%), shortness of breath 153 (69.5%), fever 133 (60.5%), headache 75 (34.1%), easy fatigue 68 (30.9%), joint pain 56 (25.5%), tachypnea 197 (89.5%), hypoxia 95 (43.2%), and tachycardia 83 (37.7%). The overall median recovery time for admitted cases was 5 days. There was significant difference between recovery probability of severe and moderate cases, severe and mild cases (p=0.00), who had normal body temperature and hypothermic (p=0.05), who had normal breathing rate and bradypnea patients (p= 0.014). Conclusion COVID-19 patients frequently show cough, shortness of breath, fever, headache, easy fatigue and joint pain. Median time to recovery was 5 days. Having a normal body temperature, normal breathing rate, and severe disease status had statistically significant association with median recovery time.

Carpooling is a subset of the sharing economy, in which individuals share their vehicle with commuters to save travel expenses. In recent decades, carpooling has been promoted as a feasible alternative to car ownership with the potential to alleviate traffic congestion, parking demand, and environmental problems. Unstable economic conditions, cultural norms, and lack of infrastructure make cultural exchange activities and mobility habits different in developing nations to those in developed countries. The rapid evolution of sharing mobility has reshaped travelers behavior and created a dire need to determine the travel patterns of commuters living in megacities in developing countries. To obtain data, a web-based stated choice (SC) experiment was used in this study. It used mode-related variables, socioeconomic demographic variables, and a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) precautionary measure variable. Logit models, namely the mixed logit regression model (ML) and the multinomial logit regression model (MNL), were applied to analyze the available data. According to modeling and survey data, economic variables associated with modes of transport, such as trip time and trip cost, were determined to be significant. Additionally, the results revealed that commuters were more conscious of COVID-19 preventive measures, which was determined to be highly significant. The findings showed that the majority of residents in the COVID-19 pandemic continue to rely on automobiles and motorcycles. It is noteworthy that individuals with more than two members in their family and a travel distance of less than seven miles were more likely to prefer a carpooling service. This studys findings will provide a basis for researchers to aid existing operators in the field of transportation, as well as offer guidelines for governments in developing countries to enhance the utility of transportation networks.","output":"Exploring the Effects of Carpooling on Travelers Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Metropolitan City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide ideation detection on social media is a challenging problem due to its implicitness.

In order to control its spread and alleviate its impact governments have been faced with a range of policy options in terms of containment and closure, ramping up healthcare, and mitigating its economic effects. In this paper, we explore the stringency as well as the speed of policy response as a function of leaders' personality traits, accounting for party-political orientation. To do this, we construct a text corpus composed of 26 country leaders' rhetoric on Covid-19 collected from 10 days before the first recorded death in their respective countries until 90 days after, and use a pre-trained machine classifier to generate the Big Five personality traits for each leader. We find two general patterns: (1) one around neuroticism, a trait associated with negative stress response, which is associated with leniency in containment and health policy measures;and (2) some evidence that conscientiousness, a trait associated with risk aversion, is associated with quicker policy response. We conclude by suggesting analysis on the sub-national level in order to increase test power, and more work on validation linking our estimates of Big Five to expert ratings of personality.

A cross-sectional study was used from a questionnaire survey in hospitals affiliated with the Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Questionnaire was distributed online including demographic information, cognitive attitudes, and personal protective behaviors. Moreover, personal protective behaviors such as wearing protective equipment were compared between different academic major and gender, respectively. A total of 176 valid questionnaires were obtained. Of the medical post-graduates in this study, (1) 89.67% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on their clinical internships, and 40.34% expressed concerns about their infection on inadequate personal protection; (2) 91.48% took personal protection in hospital and 86.36% enhanced personal hygiene; (3) There were no statistically differences in the personal protection by academic major and gender (p > 0.05). This study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the medical post-graduates' clinical practice, and affected their cognitive attitudes and behaviors. As such, universities and hospitals should increase pandemic prevention training and investment, provide more psychological counseling to their medical post-graduates to reduce their psychological burden, and take measures to reduce the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their medical post-graduates' clinical practice.","output":"Investigation of the Cognitive Attitudes and Behaviors of Medical Post-graduates in Clinical Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"-Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 hijack coatomer protein-I (COPI) for spike protein retrograde trafficking to the progeny assembly site in endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).

Varieties of diagnostic protocols are being developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Many of these diagnostic protocols however, have limitations such as for example unacceptable no of false-positive and false-negative cases, particularly during the early stages of infection. At present, the real-time (quantitative) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, RT-PCR based tests are complex, expensive, time consuming and involve pre-processing of samples. A swift, sensitive, inexpensive protocol for mass screening is urgently needed to contain this pandemic. There is urgent need to harness new powerful technologies for accurate detection not only of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also combating the emergence of pandemics of new viruses as well. To overcome the current challenges, the authors propose a diagnostic protocol based on Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with microfluidic devices containing integrated microchannels functionalized either with vertically aligned Au/Ag coated carbon nanotubes or with disposable electrospun micro/nano-filter membranes. These devices have the potential to successfully trap viruses from diverse biological fluids/secretions including saliva, nasopharyngeal, tear etc. These can thus enrich the viral titre and enable accurate identification of the viruses from their respective Raman signatures. If the device is successfully developed and proven to detect target viruses, it would facilitate rapid screening of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals of COVID-19. This would be a valuable diagnostic tool not only for mass screening of current COVID-19 pandemic but also in viral pandemic outbreaks of future.","output":"Development of integrated microfluidic platform coupled with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.570018.].","output":"Corrigendum: Blocking of the High-Affinity Interaction-Synapse Between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 Proteins Likely Requires Multiple High-Affinity Antibodies: An Immune Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present paper, we aimed to determine the influence of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) enforced during the first wave of COVID-19 across countries on the spreading rate of COVID-19 during the second wave.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate initial Danish experiences with robot-assisted anti-reflux surgery compared to conventional laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery incorporating follow-up and evaluation of possible learning curve. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients undergoing primary RAAS or CLAS at The Department of Surgery A, Odense University Hospital and The Department of General Surgery, Kolding Hospital from April 2013 to April 2015 was included. Demographic data, comorbidity, docking time, length of procedure, type of fundic wrap as well as perioperative complications and postoperative complications, need for reoperation or any upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from surgery to final follow-up was retrospectively extracted from patient records. RESULTS 103 patients were included in this study. 39 patients underwent RAAS and 64 patients underwent CLAS. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data or comorbidities except distribution of heart disease (RAAS: 5.1% vs. CLAS: 18.8%, p = 0.05) and previous abdominal surgery (RAAS: 28.2% vs. CLAS: 48.4%, p = 0.04). Duration of surgery was significantly increased in patients undergoing RAAS (RAAS: 135  27 min vs. CLAS: 86  19 min, p < 0.01). There was no statistical significant difference in intraoperative complications (p = 0.20), 30-day postoperative complication rate (p = 0.20) or mortality (p = 1.00).

In this review, we provide an overview of the implications of SARS-CoV-2 for blood safety and sufficiency. SUMMARY: Approximately one-third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. The reported mean incubation period typically varies from 2 to 11 days, but longer periods up to 22 days have been reported. The blood phase of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be brief and low level, with RNAaemia detectable in only a small proportion of patients, typically associated with more severe disease and not demonstrated to be infectious virus. A small number of presymptomatic and asymptomatic blood phase cases have been reported. Transfusion-transmission (TT) of SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported. Therefore, the TT risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 is currently theoretical. To mitigate any potential TT risk, but more importantly to prevent respiratory transmission in donor centers, blood services can implement donor deferral policies based on travel, disease status, or potential risk of exposure and encourage staff vaccination. KEY MESSAGES: The TT risk of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low. The biggest risk to blood services in the current COVID-19 pandemic is to maintain the sufficiency of the blood supply while minimizing respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to donors and staff while donating blood.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Blood Safety: An Updated Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is a critically endangered species endemic to the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD). Important for the conservation of this species is understanding the physiological and ecological impacts contributing to their population decline, and current studies lack information on embryonic development. Changes in patterns of salinity across the SFBD may be a particularly important environmental stressor contributing to the recruitment and survival of the species. Throughout their ontogeny, delta smelt may exhibit unique requirements and tolerances to environmental conditions including salinity. Here, we describe 22 stages of embryonic development of H. transpacificus that characterize early differentiation from the fertilized egg until hatching, allowing the identification of critical morphological features unique to this species. Additionally, we investigated aspects of physiological tolerance to environmental salinity during development. Embryos survived incubation at salinity treatments between 0.4 and 20 ppt, yet had lower hatch success at higher salinities. Prior to hatching, embryos exposed to higher salinities had increased osmolalities and reduced fractions of yolk implying that the elevated external salinity altered the physiology of the embryo and the environment internal to the chorion. Lastly, egg activation and fertilization appear to also be impacted by salinity. Altogether, we suggest that any potential tolerance to salinity during embryogenesis, a common feature in euryhaline teleost species, impacts life cycle transitions into, and out of, embryonic development. Results from this investigation should improve conservation and management practices of this species and further expand our understanding of the intimate relationship between an embryo and its environment.","output":"Developmental Staging and Salinity Tolerance in Embryos of the Delta Smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer care is rapidly changing with advances in genomic testing, the development of next-generation targeted kinase inhibitors, and the continued broad study of immunotherapy in new settings and potential combinations.

Here, we report a novel type of nucleic acid-based antiviral system that exists in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which suppresses RNA virus infection by DNA-mediated RNA cleavage. We found that the viral RNA of encephalomyocarditis virus can be reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (vcDNA) by the reverse transcriptase (RTase) encoded by endogenous retrovirus-like elements in mESCs. The vcDNA is negative-sense single-stranded and forms DNA/RNA hybrid with viral RNA. The viral RNA in the heteroduplex is subsequently destroyed by cellular RNase H1, leading to robust suppression of viral growth. Furthermore, either inhibition of the RTase activity or depletion of endogenous RNase H1 results in the promotion of virus proliferation. Altogether, our results provide intriguing insights into the antiviral mechanism of mESCs and the antiviral function of endogenized retroviruses and cellular RNase H. Such a natural nucleic acid-based antiviral mechanism in mESCs is referred to as ERASE (endogenous RTase/RNase H-mediated antiviral system), which is an addition to the previously known nucleic acid-based antiviral mechanisms including CRISPR/Cas in bacteria and RNAi in plants and invertebrates.","output":"Endogenous reverse transcriptase and RNase H-mediated antiviral mechanism in embryonic stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the world population has been battling with the SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-2019) pandemic. The pandemic has continued to impact negatively on peoples livelihoods and also on students education. This qualitative study established from students in a previously disadvantaged university, their challenges and needs pursuant to the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown in South Africa. A total of 312 (male = 141;female = 171) registered students were conveniently sampled and completed an online survey questionnaire. Thematically analysed data revealed that student education and health have been impacted since the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Participants went on to recommend several measures which, if implemented, could improve their well-being and access to education. Study findings imply that students from previously disadvantaged universities, who in their majority are from impoverished rural communities, have been struggling to access remote learning due to amongst others, the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) devices and network connectivity problems. It, therefore, requires rural-based universities to work together with the government and the private sector and join hands in addressing student challenges and needs during the on-going lockdown in the country. This would be one way of ensuring that in spite of students socioeconomic status, cultural location or background, their right to education is protected.","output":"Measures to Enhance Student Learning and Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives of Students from a Historically Disadvantaged University"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) offering an early treatment option for COVID-19, blood collectors needed to quickly overcome obstacles to recruiting and qualifying eligible donors. We provide attributes of CCP donors and products and compare to standard donors and products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on CCP donors was gathered from the American Red Cross qualification website through product collection. Data from 2019 for standard plasma/platelet apheresis (SA) and whole blood (WB) donor demographics and SA donations including product disposition and reactions were used for comparison. RESULTS: Of almost 59K donors registering on the website, 75% reported an existing COVID-19 diagnostic PCR or an antibody test. The majority (56.2%) of 10,231 CCP donors were first-time donors in contrast to SA or WB donor populations, which were only 3.0 and 30.6%, respectively, first-time donors. The number of female donors was 12% higher than SA donors. Older (> 65 years) and younger (16-19 years) were comparatively underrepresented in CCP donors. Deferral (10.2%) and Quantity Not Sufficient rates (6.4%) for presenting CCP donations were higher than SA (8.2 and 1.1%, respectively). HLA antibody reactivity was the highest cause of product loss for CCP donations vs. SA donations (9.6 vs. 1.3%). Acute adverse events also occurred at a higher rate among both first-time and repeat CCP donations compared to SA. CONCLUSION: CCP donors were more likely to be first-time and female than WB or SA donors. CCP donations had a higher rate of donor adverse reactions, deferrals, and product loss than SA donations.","output":"Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Donor Characteristics, Product Disposition and Comparison With Standard Apheresis Donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global health is under heavy threat by a worldwide pandemic caused by a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) since its rapid spread in China in 2019 [1]. Currently, there are no approved specific drugs and effective treatment for COVID-19 infection, but several available drugs are known to facilitate tentative treatment. Since drug design, development and testing procedures are time-consuming [2], [1], [2], [3], virtual screening studies with the aid of available drug databases take the initiative at this point and save the time. Besides, drug repurposing strategies promises to identify new agents for the novel diseases in a time-critical fashion. In this study, we used structure based virtual screening method on FDA approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials. As a result of this study we choose three most prominent compounds for further studies. Here we show that these three compounds (dobutamine and its two derivatives) can be considered as promising inhibitors for COVID-19 main protease and results also demonstrate the possible interactions of dobutamine and its derivatives with COVID main protease (6W63) [6].

It was first notified by China from Wuhan on 31 December 2020 and transmission to healthcare workers was first reported on 20 January 2020. Human-to-human transmission is mainly by droplet infection. At present no effective vaccine is available. Our speciality needs to collectively address the urgent issue of risk of transmission in dermatology practice. A case series of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan described that 41.3% of their patients may have acquired the infection from the hospital. Of all the infected health care workers, 77.5% worked in general wards and departments. These data highlight the significant risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 and also the higher risk in general wards and departments compared to the emergency room or intensive care unit. Dermatology patients are generally seen in clinics and in outpatient departments in hospitals. Patients wait together in the waiting area, intermingle and then are seen by the physician in their chamber. This can cause transmission of the pathogen among patients and from patient to physician. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment are important for preventing the spread of infection and dermatology practices also have to incorporate these aspects. Telemedicine is becoming an important tool for the management of dermatology patients in these times. At-risk patients in dermatology also need to be given priority care.

Understanding mechanisms that intrinsically modulate the immune responses to transplants is vital to develop rational treatment for rejection. Here, we have investigated the impact of programed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein, a negative co-stimulatory receptor, on the rejection of MHC incompatible kidney transplants in mice. T cells were found to rapidly infiltrate the kidneys of A/J mice transplanted to C57BL/6 mice, which peaked at six days and decline by day 14. The T cells primarily encircled tubules with limited infiltration of the tubular epithelium. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a marker of tubular injury, also peaked in the urine at day six and then declined. Notably, flow cytometry demonstrated that most of the T cells expressed PD-1 (over 90% of CD8 and about 75% of CD4 cells) at day six. Administration of blocking antibody to PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1, before day six increased T cell infiltrates and urinary LCN2, causing terminal acute rejection. In contrast, blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions after day six caused only a transient increase in urinary LCN2. Depleting CD4 and CD8 T cells virtually eliminated LCN2 in the urine in support of T cells injuring tubules. Thus, our data indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are not just related to chronic antigenic stimulation of T cells but are critical for the regulation of acute T cell responses to renal transplants.","output":"Early T cell infiltration is modulated by programed cell death-1 protein and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) interactions in murine kidney transplants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adipose tissue is a central regulator of metabolism and an important pharmacological target to treat the metabolic consequences of obesity, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Among the various cellular compartments, the adipocyte cell surface is especially appealing as a drug target as it contains various proteins that when activated or inhibited promote adipocyte health, change its endocrine function and eventually maintain or restore whole-body insulin sensitivity. In addition, cell surface proteins are readily accessible by various drug classes. However, targeting individual cell surface proteins in adipocytes has been difficult due to important functions of these proteins outside adipose tissue, raising various safety concerns. Thus, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of adipose selective surface proteins and/or targeting reagents. Here, we discuss several receptor families with an important function in adipogenesis and mature adipocytes to highlight the complexity at the cell surface and illustrate the problems with identifying adipose selective proteins. We then discuss that, while no unique adipocyte surface protein might exist, how splicing, posttranslational modifications as well as protein/protein interactions can create enormous diversity at the cell surface that vastly expands the space of potentially unique epitopes and how these selective epitopes can be identified and targeted.","output":"Identification and characterization of adipose surface epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has taken a terrible toll on the nursing home population.

Because these norms and associated practices are completely novel, it is unknown how children assess what kinds of interventions are appropriate under what circumstances and what principles they draw upon in their decisions. We investigated childrens reasoning about interventions against individuals who failed to adhere to COVID-19 norms. In this pre-registered study (N = 128), 4-to-7-year-olds heard stories about a norm violator, i.e., a person who refuses to wear a mask in class (COVID condition) or wear indoor shoes in class when his/her shoes are muddy (Muddy Shoes condition). Children evaluated four different interventions giving a mask/indoor shoes (Giving), preventing the person from entering (Exclusion), throwing a paper ball at the person (Throwing), or not intervening (Doing Nothing) in terms of its rightness, niceness, and effectiveness. We found that across measures, children evaluated Giving most positively, while they viewed Throwing most negatively. Doing nothing and Exclusion received mixed evaluations across measures, revealing nuanced judgments of these interventions in children. In most measures, there was no difference between COVID and Muddy Shoes condition, suggesting that childrens evaluations are not specific to the novel COVID-19 context. Together, our results show that children dynamically evaluate each intervention, taking multiple factors into account.

Urinary proteinuria profile could be a non-invasive tool of interest to scrutinize the pathophysiological process underlying AKI in COVID-19 patients. Material and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study between March 2020 and April 2020. All patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and without end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy before ICU admission were included. Our objectives were to assess the incidence and risk factors for AKI and to describe its clinical and biological characteristics, particularly its urinary protein profile. Results: Seventy patients were included; 87% needed mechanical ventilation and 61% needed vasopressor during their ICU stay; 64.3% of patients developed AKI and half of them needed dialysis. Total and tubular proteinuria on day 1 were higher in patients with AKI, whereas glomerular proteinuria was similar in both groups. The main risk factor for AKI was shock at admission (OR = 5.47 (1.74C17.2), p < 0.01). Mortality on day 28 was higher in AKI (23/45, 51.1%) than in no-AKI patients (1/25, 4%), p < 0.001. Risk factors for 28-days mortality were AKI with need for renal replacement therapy, non-renal SOFA score and history of congestive heart failure.

Vitamin D deficiency is one of the risk factors for increased susceptibility to COVID-19. This study aimed to examine the correlation between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates among the adult population in European and Asian continents. METHODS: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in each country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed? database for the last ten years. As of December, 31st 2020, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per million population were extracted from the 'real time' statistics of the Worldometer website. The association between both vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infections and mortalities were explored. RESULTS: Forty seven countries were included in the analysis. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency ranged from 6.9 to 81.8% in European countries and 2.0-87.5% in Asian countries. Significantly positive correlations were observed for both COVID-19 infection (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and mortality rates (r = 0.75; p < 0.001) in the Asian continent. The correlation values for the infections and mortality rates in the European continent were (r = 0.37; p = 0.08) and (r = 0.43; p = 0.04) respectively. When both the continents were combined, the correlation results for both infection (r = 0.42; p = 0.003) and mortality (r = 0.35; p = 0.016) rates with vitamin D deficiency values remained significant. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with the mortality rate of COVID-19 in Europe and Asia. The association between the infection rate and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significant for Asia only. Both the associations were significant when the two continents were combined in the analysis.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: It is believed that our findings will guide hospital managers to make improvements in personal, administrative, and institutional areas, and that they will provide a reference and inspiration for nurses with regard to public health emergencies in the future.","output":"Experiences of clinical first\\\\line nurses treating patients with COVID\\\\19: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 is closely related to the structure of human social networks. Based on 237 cases, by using epidemiological retrospective statistics, data visualization, and social network analysis methods, this paper summarized characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Shaanxi, China, and analyzed these patients dynamic contact network structure. The study found that there are many clustered infections through strong ties, about one-third of cases are caused by relatives' infection. In early stages of the epidemic, imported cases were the most, and in the later stages, local infection cases were the most. The infected people were mostly middle-aged men. Symptoms of imported cases occurred on average of 3 days after they arrived, and medical measures were taken 5 days later on average. All cases showed symptoms in less than 2 days on average and were then taken to medical treatment. The contact network can be divided into multiple disconnected components. The largest component has 12 patients. The average degree centrality in the network is 0.987, average betweenness degree is 0, average closeness degree is 0.452, and average PageRank index is 0.0042.

The purpose of our study is to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and the healthcare system in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of COVID-19 patients through the Ontario healthcare system. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and healthcare capacity. Outcomes include numbers of patients needing admission to the ward, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and requiring ventilation; days to resource depletion; and numbers of patients awaiting resources and deaths associated with limited access to resources. Findings: We demonstrate that with effective early public health measures system resources need not be depleted. For scenarios considering late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, health system resources would be depleted within 14-26 days. Resource depletion was also avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to rapidly increase ICU, ventilator, and acute care hospital capacity. Interpretation: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures the Ontario healthcare system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19, despite the rapid capacity increase. This overall lack of resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease via ongoing public health measures and having increased healthcare capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its health care system.","output":"Potential magnitude of COVID-19-induced healthcare resource depletion in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic drug administration has conventionally been prescribed to alleviate persistent local inflammation which is prevalent in chronic diseases. However, this approach is associated with drug-induced toxicity, particularly when the dosage exceeds that necessitated by pathological conditions of diseased tissues. Herein, we developed a modular hybrid hydrogel which could be triggered to release an anti-inflammatory drug upon exposure to elevated protease activity associated with inflammatory diseases. Modular design of the hybrid hydrogel enabled independent optimization of its protease-cleavable and drug-loaded subdomains to facilitate hydrogel formation, cleavability by matrix-metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), and tuning drug release rate. In vitro study demonstrated the protease-triggered enhancement of drug release from the hybrid hydrogel system for effective inhibition of TNF-&#945; production by pro-inflammatory macrophages and suggested its potential to mitigate drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using non-invasive imaging to monitor the activity of reactive oxygen species in biomaterial-induced host response, we confirmed that the hybrid hydrogel and its constituent materials did not induce adverse immune response after 5 days following their subcutaneous injection in immuno-competent mice. We subsequently incorporated this hybrid hydrogel onto a commercial wound dressing which could release the drug upon exposure to MMP-9. Together, our findings suggested that this hybrid hydrogel might be a versatile platform for on-demand drug delivery via either injectable or topical application to modulate inflammation in chronic diseases.","output":"Modular design of a hybrid hydrogel for protease-triggered enhancement of drug delivery to regulate TNF- production by pro-inflammatory macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2, like its? cousin SARS-CoV, uses a variety of entry receptors including angiotensin converting enzyme?2 (ACE2), L-SIGN (CD209L), and DC-SIGN and others The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host cell proteins is the first and decisive step in establishing a COVID-19 infection This fact inspired us to create ViruClear, a molecularly designed biomimetic proteolipid bilayer decoy receptor nanosponge (100 nm nanospheres) containing an optimal combination of receptors and factors used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind host cells Antiviral medicine (and most vaccines) often target a single viral target and may be rendered ineffective as the virus accumulates mutations and escapes treatments By contrast, ViruClear nanosponges display as ?decoys? the same set of receptors and factors that the SARS-CoV-2 depend on for cellular entry and infection As such, the ViruClear platform is agnostic to viral mutations and potentially viral variant species, as long as the entry receptors overlap with those of SARS-CoV-2 Our preliminary data validate that the ViruClear decoy can multivalently trap viral particles and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections in animal and human cells ViruClear is a novel ?game changing? decoy receptor nanosponge optimized for multivalent capture of SARS-CoV-2 in the body (IV injection) or as a preventive measure in nebulized formats (e g , molecular PPE) Its preclinical and clinical translation will lead paradigm shifts in countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses","output":"ViruClear: Molecularly designed biomimetic nanosponges for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-related restrictions may have a serious impact on patients with eating disorders.

Since this pathogen may possess a latent period after infection, which sometimes leads to misdiagnosis by traditional diagnosis methods, the establishment of a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method is crucial for transmission prevention and timely treatment. Herein, a novel detection method was established for M. pneumoniae detection. The method, which improves upon a denaturation bubble-mediated strand exchange amplification (SEA) that we developed in 2016, is called accelerated SEA (ASEA). The established ASEA achieved detection of 1% M. pneumoniae genomic DNA in a DNA mixture from multiple pathogens, and the limit of detection (LOD) of ASEA was as low as 1.0  10(?17) M (approximately 6.0  10(3) copies/mL). Considering that the threshold of an asymptomatic carriage is normally recommended as 1.0  10(4) copies/mL, this method was able to satisfy the requirement for practical diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. Moreover, the detection process was finished within 20.4 min, significantly shorter than real-time PCR and SEA. Furthermore, ASEA exhibited excellent performance in clinical specimen analysis, with sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 100%, respectively, compared with the gold standard real-time PCR. More importantly, similar to real-time PCR, ASEA requires only one pair of primers and ordinary commercial polymerase, and can be carried out using a conventional fluorescence real-time PCR instrument, which makes this method low-cost and easy to accomplish. Therefore, ASEA has the potential for wide use in the rapid detection of M. pneumoniae or other pathogens in large numbers of specimens.

Bioinformatic network analysis identified activation of p38 MAPK, NFkB, ERK as top canonical pathways relevant for biological processes linked to cell migration and osteoblastic differentiation in ELDL-treated cells. Functional studies confirmed increased migration of HCASMC upon stimulation with ELDL (10 g/ml) or Angiopoietin like protein 4, (ANGPTL4, 5 g/ml), and gain in osteoblastic gene profile with significant increase in mRNA levels for DMP-1, ALPL, RUNX2, OPN/SPP1, osterix/SP7, BMP and reduction in mRNA for MGP and ENPP1. Enhanced calcification of HCASMC by ELDL was demonstrated by Alizarin Red staining. In summary, ELDL is highly potent in inducing foam cells in HCASMC and mediates a phenotypic switch with enhanced migration and osteoblastic gene profile.

Besides the physiological effects related to the high-caffeine content of EDs, long-term emotional, social, and behavioral effects have been recently receiving attention. However, a few systematic reviews have focused on the critical yet understudied periods of childhood and adolescence. We have undertaken a comprehensive systematic review of the evidence on any psychosocial correlates of ED consumption in 0-18-year-old subjects, as published up to April 1, 2021, in MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Reviews and Central Register of Controlled Trials. Of the initial 789 records, 104 original articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy percent of them were published from 2016 onwards; among investigated topics, substance use ranked first, followed by psychological and socio-educational factors; the less investigated topic was risky behaviors. Taste and energy-seeking were the main drivers of consumption, which generally happened at home or during sport/recreational activities, without perception of health-related risks. Positive associations with ED consumption were found for sensation seeking, irritability/anger, and suicide ideation, plan, or attempts. Finally, participants with lower grades, a low parental monitoring, or bad influences from peers were more likely to consume EDs. Conclusion: With ~ 70% of papers published since the 2 comprehensive reviews on children/adolescents were carried out, an update of the literature with a broad focus is of great importance. Consumption of EDs by children/adolescents lies in the potential interplay between personality traits, school performance, and influences by family members and peers. What is Known: ?

The importance of utilizing point of care (POC) health technology for individualized patient management is salient. The foundation of effective home INR monitoring is establishing patient knowledge about their therapy and INR testing proficiency. The eKITE series was developed to support patients in establishing foundational knowledge required for VKA (warfarin) management and INR monitoring. The primary objectives were to evaluate eKITE, a patient-oriented innovative online education program for warfarin therapy, participant learning stress, and patient preference for online learning. This multi-center prospective study provided patients access to warfarin online education. Participants were required to complete written quizzes assessing warfarin knowledge of key concepts proficiency and identifying knowledge deficits. Patient preference, evaluating calm (lack of anxiety) while learning, and an INR on a home meter was completed. Participants performed INR tests at home and reported INRs by telephone. The analysis included 144 children and caregivers enrolled at five US and CDN sites. Most indications for anticoagulation were cardiac (congenital or acquired heart disease) with varied INR target ranges. Mean knowledge scores for warfarin and INR self-testing modules were 97%, with low anxiety with TTR of 84%.

We collected and analyzed demographic, diagnosis, and laboratory data for 69,939 patients with positive COVID-19 PCR tests across three countries from 1 January 2020 through 30 September 2021. We analyze overall missing laboratory measurements across sites, missingness stratification by demographic variables, temporal trends of missingness, correlations between labs based on missingness indicators over time, and clustering of groups of labs based on their missingness/ordering pattern. Results. With these analyses, we identified mapping issues faced in seven out of 15 sites. We also identified nuances in data collection and variable definition for the various sites. Temporal trend analyses may support the use of laboratory test result missingness patterns in identifying severe COVID-19 patients. Lastly, using missingness patterns, we determined relationships between various labs that reflect clinical behaviors. Conclusion. This work elucidates how missing data patterns in EHRs can be leveraged to identify quality control issues and relationships between laboratory measurements.

The primary endpoint was time to intubation, with secondary endpoints of success rate, perceived difficulty and preferred technique. We also investigated the relationship between level of training and prior training and experience with the techniques on the primary outcome. The mean (95% CI) time to intubation using a direct tracheal tube technique of 37 (31-42) s was significantly shorter than either the Aintree intubation catheter technique at 70 (60-80) s, or a guidewire technique at 126 (110-141) s (p < 0.001).

Following Michel Bitbol, I suggest one way to mitigate this crisis of faith may be for science to become more epistemically modest, renouncing some of its claims to describe reality as it objectively is, and adopting an intransitive rather than a transitive approach to Nature. This was the attitude adopted by the Greco-Roman medical school of the Empirics, which may also be of assistance in combatting the urgent problem of Fake News. The epistemology of Skepticism and the scientific methodology of the closely related Medical Empiricism shows that an epistemically modest, non-interventionist approach to science is quite compatible with a robust and sophisticated proto-experimental scientific methodology. ? 2021, University of Warsaw.

The analysis is done keeping in mind the close interaction between the health and economic shocks of COVID-19. The study combines descriptive and qualitative approaches using figures and graphs with quantitative methods that estimate the plotted relationships and econometric estimation that attempts to explain cross-country variation in COVID-19 incidence, deaths and case fatality rates. The study seeks to answer a set of questions on COVID-19 such as: what are the economic effects of COVID-19, focussing on international inequality and global poverty? How effective was lockdown in curbing COVID-19? What was the effect of lockdown on economic growth? Did the stimulus packages work in delinking the health shocks from the economic ones? Did better governed countries with greater public trust and those with superior health care fare better than others? Did countries that have experienced previous outbreaks such as SARS fare better than those who have not? The study provides mixed messages on the effectiveness of lockdowns in controlling COVID-19. While several countries, especially in the East Asia and Pacific region, have used it quite effectively recording low infection rates going into lockdown and staying low after the lockdown, the two spectacular failures are Brazil and India. In contrast to lockdown, the evidence on the effectiveness of stimulus programs in avoiding recession and promoting growth is unequivocal. The effectiveness is much greater in the case of emerging/developing economies than in the advanced economies. Multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF need to work out a coordinated strategy to declare immediate debt relief and provide additional liquidity to the poorer economies to help them announce effective stimulus measures. COVID-19 will lead to a large increase in the global pool of those living in extreme poverty. A poignant feature of our results is that while a significant share of health shocks from COVID-19 is borne by the advanced economies, the burden of COVID-19 poverty will almost exclusively fall on two of the poorest regions, namely, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.","output":"COVID-19: facts, figures, estimated relationships and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe present study examined whether subjective accelerated aging moderated the relationship between COVID-19 health worries and COVID-19 peritraumatic distress among older adults MethodThe sample consisted of 277 older adults (M = 69 58, s d = 6 73, range 60C92) who answered an online questionnaire during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel Participants completed the measures of background characteristics, exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 health worries, subjective accelerated aging and COVID-19-based peritraumatic distress ResultsHigher levels of COVID-19 health worries were correlated with higher levels of peritraumatic distress symptoms among older adults Moreover, those reporting accelerated aging also reported a higher level of peritraumatic distress Finally, the interaction between COVID-19 health worries and subjective accelerated aging predicted peritraumatic distress, suggesting that COVID-19 worries were associated with peritraumatic distress to a stronger degree among older adults who felt they were aging faster ConclusionsThese findings indicate that negative views of aging may serve as an amplifying factor for traumatic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic Although preliminary, the findings provide insight for potential screening and interventions of older adults at risk of developing peritraumatic distress symptoms during the global pandemic","output":"Subjective accelerated aging moderates the association between COVID-19 health worries and peritraumatic distress among older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To retrospectively assess the impact of regular yearly administration of recombinant influenza and single administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on the occurrence of serious respiratory infection including COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged via the expected practice approach to home or quarantine housing with supplemental home oxygen. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 621 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were discharged from 2 large urban public hospitals caring primarily for patients receiving Medicaid from March 20 to August 19, 2020. Patients were included in the analysis cohort if they received emergency or inpatient care for COVID-19 and were discharged with home oxygen. INTERVENTIONS: Patients receiving at least 3 L per minute of oxygen, stable without other indication for inpatient care, were discharged from either emergency or inpatient encounters with home oxygen equipment, educational resources, and nursing telephone follow-up within 12 to 18 hours of discharge. Nurses provided continued telephone follow up as indicated, always with physician back-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality and all-cause 30-day return admission. RESULTS: A total of 621 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (404 male [65.1%] and 217 female [34.9%]) were discharged with home oxygen. Median age of these patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 45-61 years), with 149 (24.0%) discharged from the emergency department and 472 (76%) discharged from inpatient encounters. The all-cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.5%) and the 30-day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-10.7%) with a median follow-up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15-55 days). No deaths occurred in the ambulatory setting. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged on home oxygen had low rates of mortality and return admission within 30 days of discharge. Ambulatory management of COVID-19 with home oxygen has an acceptable safety profile, and the expected practice approach may help optimize outcomes, by ensuring right care in the right place at the right time and preserving access to acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mortality and Readmission Rates Among Patients With COVID-19 After Discharge From Acute Care Setting With Supplemental Oxygen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of dexamethasone in patients infected with Strongyloides stercoralis can cause severe complications.

METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal, descriptive study was undertaken to review all patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Spain, during 1 MarchC31 December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2567 patients received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Eighty-six patients from endemic areas were included. Seven patients had strongyloidiasis. Five patients were female. The mean age (SD) was 39 (10.8) y. Six patients were Latin-American and only one patient was from Africa. Six patients had previous symptoms compatible with strongyloidiasis infections. Only three patients received dexamethasone (6 mg once daily) for 10 d. In all cases, the clinical courses of the patients were satisfactory. No patient died or was admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Screening programmes using serological techniques should be implemented in COVID-19 patients to prevent strongyloidiasis.

Pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population: an opinion from the point of view of the virus-host relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Inclusion health focuses on people in extremely poor health due to poverty, marginalisation, and multimorbidity. We aimed to review morbidity and mortality data on four overlapping populations who experience considerable social exclusion: homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. We included only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes, were published in English, from high-income countries, and were done in populations with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, sex work, or substance use disorder (excluding cannabis and alcohol use). Studies with only perinatal outcomes and studies of individuals with a specific health condition or those recruited from intensive care or high dependency hospital units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. Primary outcomes were measures of morbidity (prevalence or incidence) and mortality (standardised mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates). Summary estimates were calculated using a random effects model. FINDINGS Our search identified 7946 articles, of which 337 studies were included for analysis. All-cause standardised mortality ratios were significantly increased in 91 (99%) of 92 extracted datapoints and were 1186 (95% CI 1042-1330; I2=941%) in female individuals and 788 (703-874; I2=991%) in men. Summary SMR estimates for the International Classification of Diseases disease categories with two or more included datapoints were highest for deaths due to injury, poisoning, and other external causes, in both men (789; 95% CI 640-937; I2=981%) and women (1872; 1373-2371; I2=915%). Disease prevalence was consistently raised across the following categories: infections (eg, highest reported was 90% for hepatitis C, 67 [65%] of 103 individuals for hepatitis B, and 133 [51%] of 263 individuals for latent tuberculosis infection), mental health (eg, highest reported was 9 [4%] of 227 individuals for schizophrenia), cardiovascular conditions (eg, highest reported was 32 [13%] of 247 individuals for coronary heart disease), and respiratory conditions (eg, highest reported was 9 [26%] of 35 individuals for asthma). INTERPRETATION Our study shows that homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals experience extreme health inequities across a wide range of health conditions, with the relative effect of exclusion being greater in female individuals than male individuals. The high heterogeneity between studies should be explored further using improved data collection in population subgroups. The extreme health inequity identified demands intensive cross-sectoral policy and service action to prevent exclusion and improve health outcomes in individuals who are already marginalised.

Granular estimates of infection are important for understanding population-level immunity. We examined seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Pune city in India and its implication for protective immunity. Methods Seroprevalence was estimated during July 20-August 5, 2020 from 1659 randomly selected individuals recruited from five administrative Pune sub-wards (combined population 366,984). Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were estimated and along with correlates of virus neutralisation. Findings Seropositivity was extensive (51.3%; 95%CI 39.9-62.4) but varied widely in the five localities tested, ranging from 35.8% to 66.4%. Seropositivity was higher in crowded living conditions in the slums (OR 1.91), and was lower in those 65 years or older (OR 0.59). The infection-fatality ratio was estimated at 0.28%. Post survey, COVID-19 incidence was lower in areas noted to have higher seroprevalence. Substantial virus-neutralising activity was observed in seropositive individuals, but with considerable heterogeneity in the immune response and possible age-dependent diversity in the antibody repertoire. Interpretation Despite crowded living conditions having facilitated widespread transmission, the variability in seroprevalence in localities that are in geographical proximity indicates a heterogenous spread of infection. Declining infection rates in areas with high seropositivity suggest population-level protection and is supported by substantial neutralising activity in asymptomatically infected individuals. The heterogeneity in antibody levels and neutralisation capacity indicates the existence of immunological sub-groups of functional interest.","output":"Community prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and correlates of protective immunity in five localities in an Indian metropolitan city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The important molecule tryptophan and its derivatives serotonin and melatonin have vital functions in human and plant biosystem.

In the present study, a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a DNA vaccine, to prevent the infection of V. anguillarum in flounder fish, investigated. We verified the expression of the VAA protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish. The protective effects of pcDNA3.1-VAA (pVAA) were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sIgM(+), CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), CD8(+) lymphocytes, and the production of VAA-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the DNA vaccine. Histopathological changes in immune related tissues, bacterial load, and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with V. anguillarum, were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pVAA DNA vaccine candidate. Fish intramuscularly immunized with pVAA showed a significant increase in CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), and CD8(+) T lymphocytes at days 9, 11, and 14 post-vaccination, reaching peak T-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization. The percentage of sIgM(+) lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4C5 post-immunization. Specific anti-V. anguillarum or anti-rVAA antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28C35 post-immunization. The liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish. Additionally, a lower bacterial burden in the liver, spleen, and kidney were observed in pVAA protected fish in response to bacterial challenge, compared with pcDNA3.1 vector control injected fish. Moreover, the pVAA vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following V. anguillarum infection. In summary, this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the T lymphocyte response, followed by B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of DNA immunization of flounder.

As initial teacher educators at a public University in South Africa we noted that the sudden move to working online has presented various challenges to first year students overall well-being which has further exacerbated issues of exclusion and marginalization for many. We argue that it is against this backdrop that this paper explores how the move to online learning has affected first year students overall well-being, at one teacher education institution.

This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of acute pulmonary hypertension (aPH) as per established trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) criteria in Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care and to explore whether short-term outcomes are affected by the presence of aPH. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patients treated in the intensive care units at a tertiary university hospital over a month. The presence of aPH on the TTE was noted, and plasma NTproBNP and troponin were measured as markers of cardiac failure and myocardial injury, respectively. Follow-up data were collected 21 d after the performance of TTE. RESULTS: In total, 26 of 67 patients (39%) had an assessed systolic pulmonary artery pressure of > 35 mmHg (group aPH), meeting the TTE definition of aPH. NTproBNP levels (median [range]: 1430 [102-30 300] vs. 470 [45-29 600] ng L-1 ; P = .0007), troponin T levels (63 [22-352] vs. 15 [5-407] ng L-1 ; P = .0002), and the 21-d mortality rate (46% vs. 7%; P < .001) were substantially higher in patients with aPH compared to patients not meeting aPH criteria. CONCLUSION: TTE-defined acute pulmonary hypertension was frequently observed in severely ill Covid-19 patients.

This study investigated whether the routine use of methylene blue intraoperatively identified leaks to reduce the postoperative proportion of clinical leaks. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed consecutive total gastrectomies performed from January 2007 to December 2014 in a university hospital setting by a general surgical group that exclusively used the methylene blue test. All surgeries were performed for gastric or junctional cancers (n = 198). All reconstructions (Roux-en Y esophagojejunostomy) were performed using a stapler. The methylene blue test was used in 108 cases (group 1) via a nasojejunal tube. No test was performed for the other 90 cases (group 2). Intraoperative leakage rate, postoperative clinical leakage rate, length of hospitalization, and mortality rate were the outcome measures. RESULTS The intraoperative leakage rate was 7.4% in group 1. The postoperative clinical leakage rate was 8.6%. The postoperative clinical leakage rate was 3.7% in group 1 and 14.4% in group 2 (p = 0.007). There were no postoperative clinical leaks when an intraoperative leak led to concomitant intraoperative repair. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days in group 1 and 8 days in group 2 (p < 0.001). One death occurred in each group. No test-related complications were observed. CONCLUSION The methylene blue test for esophagojejunostomy is a safe and reliable method for the assessment of anastomosis integrity, especially in cases with difficult esophagojejunostomic construction.","output":"Intraoperatively Testing the Anastomotic Integrity of Esophagojejunostomy Using Methylene Blue."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung diseases belong to the major causes of death worldwide.

METHODS: We obtained monthly state-level volumes of HCV antibody, RNA and genotype testing, and HCV treatment initiation, stratified by age and gender, spanning January 2019 until December 2020 from 2 large national laboratories. We performed segmented regression analysis for each state from a mixed-effects Poisson regression model with month as the main fixed predictor and state as a random intercept. RESULTS: During the preCCOVID-19 period (January 2019CMarch 2020), monthly HCV antibody and genotype tests decreased slightly whereas RNA tests and treatment initiations remained stable. Between March and April 2020, there were declines in the number of HCV antibody tests (37% reduction, P < .001), RNA tests (37.5% reduction, P < .001), genotype tests (24% reduction, P = .023), and HCV treatment initiations (31%, P < .001). Starting April 2020 through the end of 2020, there were significant increases in month-to-month HCV antibody (P < .001), RNA (P = .035), and genotype tests (P = .047), but only antibody testing rebounded to preCCOVID-19 levels. HCV treatment initiations remained low after April 2020 throughout the remainder of the year. CONCLUSIONS: HCV testing and treatment dropped by >30% during April 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but although HCV testing increased again later in 2020, HCV treatment rates did not recover.

Since ASF has been introduced into Europe and Asia, the major pig-raising areas, posing a huge threat to the pork industry worldwide. Currently, prevention and control of ASF are basically dependent on strict biosecurity measures and stamping-out policy once ASF occurs. MAIN TEXT: The major risks of ASF spread are insufficient biosecurity measures and human behaviors. Therefore, a safe and effective vaccine seems to be a reasonable demand for the prevention and control of ASF. Due to the efficacy advantage over other types of vaccines, live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), especially virulence-associated genes deleted vaccines, are likely to be put into emergency and conditional use in restricted areas if ASF is out of control in a country with a huge pig population and pork consumption, like China. However, the safety, efficacy, and genetic stability of current candidate ASF LAVs require comprehensive clinical evaluations prior to country-wide field application. Several critical issues need to be addressed to commercialize an ideal ASF LAV, including a stable cell line for manufacturing vaccines, differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA), and cross-protection from different genotypes. CONCLUSION: A safe and effective DIVA vaccine and an accompanying diagnostic assay will facilitate the prevention, control, and eradication of ASF, which is quite challenging in the near future.

Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we analyzed the medical records of international migrant workers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Singapore from April 21 to June 1, 2020. We determined the prevalence of DM and pre-diabetes, and analyzed the risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia and electrolyte abnormalities, based on age and diagnosis of DM, and pre-diabetes. Results: Two hundred and fouty male migrant workers, with mean age of 44.2 years [standard deviation (SD), 8.5years], were included. Twenty one patients (8.8%) were diagnosed with pre-diabetes, and 19 (7.9%) with DM.

DESIGN AND SETTING: ZVL was funded in Australia for adults aged 70 years from November 2016, with a time-limited catch up programme for those up to 79 years. This cohort study monitored safety in the first two programme years through active surveillance at 246 sentinel surveillance immunisation sites. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 70C79 years vaccinated with ZVL who responded to an opt-out survey sent via automated short message service (SMS) 3 days following vaccination (n=17 458) or contributed supplementary data through a separate, opt-in online survey at 16 and 24 days following vaccination (n=346). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of overall and prespecified adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) by sex, concomitant vaccination and underlying medical condition. Signal detection methods (fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian updating analyses) were applied to reports of medical attendance. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 72 years; 53% were female. The response rate following automated SMS was high (73% within 7 days of vaccination). Females were more likely than males to report any adverse event within 7 days of vaccination (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.31); injection site reaction was the most commonly reported (2.3%, n=377). Concomitant vaccination was not associated with higher adverse event rates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18). Rates of medical attendance were low (0.3%) with no safety signals identified. Supplementary opt-in survey data on later onset adverse events did not identify any difference in AEFI rates between those with and without underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: ZVL has a very good safety profile in the first week after vaccination in older adults. Active, participant-based surveillance in this primary care cohort is an effective method to monitor vaccine safety among older adults and will be used as a key component of COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance in Australia.","output":"Safety of live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in Australian adults 70C79 years of age: an observational study using active surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are no definitive therapies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients (n = 6; age range 19-75 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, n = 5) with PaO2/FiO2 ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43-2991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89-1029.90 ng/ml).

ART can dramatically reduce HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), but inconsistent drug access and adherence, as well as primary maternal HIV infection during pregnancy and lactation are major barriers to eliminating vertical HIV transmission. Thus, immunologic strategies to prevent MTCT, such as an HIV vaccine, will be required to attain an HIV-free generation. A primary goal of HIV vaccine research has been to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) given the ability of passive bnAb immunization to protect against sensitive strains, yet we previously observed that HIV-transmitting mothers have more plasma neutralization breadth than non-transmitting mothers. Additionally, we have identified infant transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses that escape maternal bnAb responses. In this study, we examine a cohort of postpartum HIV-transmitting women with neutralization breadth to determine if certain maternal bnAb specificities drive the selection of infant T/F viruses. Using HIV pseudoviruses that are resistant to neutralizing antibodies targeting common bnAb epitopes, we mapped the plasma bnAb specificities of this cohort. Significantly more transmitting women with plasma bnAb activity had a mappable plasma bnAb specificity (six of seven, or 85.7%), compared to that of non-transmitting women with plasma bnAb activity (seven of twenty-one, or 33.3%, p=0.029 by 2-sided Fisher exact test). Our study suggests that having multispecific broad activity and/or uncommon epitope-specific bnAbs in plasma may be associated with protection against the vertical HIV transmission in the setting of maternal bnAb responses. Importance As mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV plays a major part in the persistence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and bnAb-based passive and active vaccines are a primary strategy for HIV prevention, research in this field is of great importance. While previous MTCT research has investigated the neutralizing antibody activity of HIV-infected women, this is to our knowledge the largest study identifying differences in bnAb specificity of maternal plasma between transmitting and non-transmitting women. Here, we show that among HIV-infected women with broad and potent neutralization activity, more postpartum-transmitting women had a mappable plasma broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) specificity, compared to that of non-transmitting women, suggesting that the non-transmitting women more often have multi-specific bnAb responses or bnAb responses that target uncommon epitopes. Such responses may be required for protection against vertical HIV transmission in the setting of maternal bnAb responses.","output":"Vertical HIV-1 transmission in the setting of maternal broad and potent antibody responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-COVID syndrome also known as long COVID refers to symptoms persisting for more than three weeks after the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Fatigue is the most common symptom reported in 17.5-72% of post-COVID cases, followed by residual dyspnea with an incidence ranging from 10-40%. Mental problems, chest pain, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may affect up to 26%, 22% and 11% of patients, respectively.

We hypothesized that a mandibular nerve block would decrease the need for systemic analgesics both intraoperatively and postoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fourteen adult male Yucatan pigs were purchased. Pigs were chemically restrained with ketamine, midazolam, and dexmedetomidine and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. Pigs were randomized to receive a mandibular block with either bupivacaine (bupivacaine group) or saline (control group). A nerve stimulator was used for administration of the block with observation of masseter muscle twitch to indicate the injection site. Invasive BP and HR were measured with the aid of an arterial catheter in eight pigs. A rescue analgesic protocol consisting of fentanyl and lidocaine was administered if HR or BP values increased 20% from baseline. Postoperative pain was quantified with a customized ethogram. HR and BP were evaluated at base line, pre-rescue, 10 and 20 min post-rescue. RESULTS Pre-rescue mean BP was significantly increased (p = .001) for the bupivacaine group. Mean intraoperative HR was significantly lower (p = .044) in the bupivacaine versus saline group. All other parameters were not significant.

An antigenic determinant that was highly conserved in both the primary amino acid sequence and secondary structure of all strains was identified between amino acid positions 240 to 255. A synthesized peptide corresponding to this region was found to react with all polyclonal antisera examined from various IBV strains and with one monoclonal antibody (MAb), 9B1B6, out of nine known to react with the S of Gray. The specificity of the interaction with MAb 9B1B6 was confirmed by competitive ELISA using bound and unbound peptide. Interestingly, the previously described epitope for 9B1B6 had been characterized as cross-reactive with several strains of IBV, as conformation-independent but reacting only with intact whole S, and as associated with the functional integrity of other epitopes, including neutralizing epitopes on the S protein. The apparent critical functional and structural nature of this highly immunogenic determinant suggests a potential contribution in developing protective, cross-reactive subunit vaccines to IBV.","output":"A highly conserved epitope on the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Student enrollment in online learning is increasing.

Additionally, we examined whether effects of oxytocin and vasopressin administration on neural reactivity were moderated by fathers' early childhood experiences. Neural reactivity to infant cry sounds (versus control sounds) was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, participants reported on their childhood experiences of parental harsh discipline and parental love withdrawal. Whole brain analyses revealed no significant effect of vasopressin or oxytocin administration on neural activation in response to infant cry sounds. Region of interest analyses showed decreased amygdala activation in both the oxytocin condition and the vasopressin condition as compared to placebo. We found no moderating effects of fathers' early childhood experiences. Our findings suggest that oxytocin administration may decrease feelings of anxiety or aversion to a crying infant. Whether decreased amygdala activation after vasopressin administration might be explained by contextual factors (e.g., absence of high levels of threat, unfamiliarity of the infant) or represents an affiliative response to infant distress warrants further investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 116 patients that for suspected COVID-19 infection were subjected to the reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. A computer-aided tool was used to calculate on chest CT images healthy residual lung parenchyma, emphysema, GGO and consolidation volumes for both right and left lung. Expert radiologists, in consensus, assessed the CT images using a structured report and attributed a radiological severity score at the disease pulmonary involvement using a scale of five levels. Nonparametric test was performed to assess differences statistically significant among groups. RESULTS: GGO was the most represented feature in suspected CT by COVID-19 infection; it is present in 102/109 (93.6%) patients with a volume percentage value of 19.50% and a median value of 0.64 L, while the emphysema and consolidation volumes were low (0.01 L and 0.03 L, respectively). Among quantified volume, only GGO volume had a difference statistically significant between the group of patients with suspected versus non-suspected CT for COVID-19 (p < < 0.01). There were differences statistically significant among the groups based on radiological severity score in terms of healthy residual parenchyma volume, of GGO volume and of consolidations volume (p < < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that, using a computer-aided tool, the COVID-19 pneumonia was mirrored with a percentage median value of GGO of 19.50% and that only GGO volume had a difference significant between the patients with suspected or non-suspected CT for COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 pneumonia: computer-aided quantification of healthy lung parenchyma, emphysema, ground glass and consolidation on chest computed tomography (CT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Healthcare workers (HCWs) awareness of disease outbreak, and working efficiently in a changed environment is vital to fight pandemic How an institution responds to the crisis depends on HCWs response This study aims to find out awareness of COVID-19 and work satisfaction of HCWs at Patan Hospital (PH), Nepal Method: A cross-sectional questionnaires base descriptive study was conducted at PH, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Nepal, in April 2020 The HCWs were grouped in to technical staff, doctors, and support staff There were 20 questions each in the awareness of COVID-19 and work satisfaction domain Ethical approval was obtained Result: Of all the staff, 223 various level staffs responded to the questionnaire There were 80 (35 9%) technical staff, 77 (34 5%) doctors and 66 (29 6%) support staff in the study In the technical staff group 1106 (69 2%) responses were in favour of having good awareness and 1337 (83 5%) responses were in favour of satisfaction In the doctors group 1233 (80 1%) responses were in favour of having good awareness and 1000 (65%) responses were in favour of satisfaction In the support staff group 236 (17 7%) responses were in favour of having good awareness and 347 (26 2%) responses were in favour of satisfaction Conclusion: Our study showed that technical staff and doctors had higher levels of perception of work satisfaction and awareness for COVID-19 Keyword: awareness, COVID-19, health care workers, perception, work satisfaction","output":"Awareness of COVID-19 and perception of work satisfaction among healthcare workers at Patan Hospital, Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microarray technology has come of age for use in high-throughput operations and large-scale studies.

Colombia has also been affected by the pandemic, including by the cancellation of medically necessary surgical procedures that were categorized as nonessential. The objective of this study was to show the results of the program implemented in two institutions in Bogot, Colombia, in April 2020 to support the performance of elective essential and nonessential low- and medium-complexity orthopedic surgeries during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved a presurgical clinical protocol without serological or molecular testing. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study of a cohort of patients who underwent elective orthopedic surgery at two institutions in the city of Bogota, Colombia, in April 2020. We implemented a preoperative clinical protocol that did not involve serological or molecular tests; the protocol consisted of a physical examination, a survey of symptoms and contact with confirmed or suspected cases, and presurgical isolation. We recorded the types of surgeries, the patients scores on the medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTs) scale, the presence of signs, symptoms, and mortality associated with COVID-19 developed after the operation. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients underwent orthopedic surgery. The average age was 47 years (Shapiro-Wilk, P = 0.021), and the range was between 18 and 81 years. There was a female predominance (61.5%). With regard to the types of surgeries, 86 (48%) were knee operations, 42 (23.5%) were hand surgeries, 34 (19%) were shoulder surgeries, and 17 (9.5%) were foot and ankle surgeries. The average MeNTs score was 44.6 points. During the 2 weeks after surgery, four patients were suspected of having COVID-19 because they developed at least two symptoms associated with the disease. The incidence of COVID-19 in the postoperative period was 2.3%. Two (1.1%) of these four patients visited an emergency department where RT-PCR tests were performed, and they tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No patients died or were hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Through the implementation of a presurgical clinical protocol consisting of a physical examination; a clinical survey inquiring about signs, symptoms, and epidemiological contact with suspected or confirmed cases; and presurgical isolation but not involving the performance of molecular or serological diagnostic tests, positive results were obtained with regard to the performance of low- and medium-complexity elective orthopedic surgeries in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The contaminations, first constrained in the Kerala state, have inevitably spread to every single other area. The possibility to cause dangerous respiratory disappointment and quick transmission puts COVID-19 in the rundown of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There is a flow overall break out of the novel coronavirus Covid-19, which started from Wuhan in China and has now spread to more than 212 countries including 14,753,034 cases, as of 12:20 AM on July 21, 2020.

US is taught through a combination of self-directed learning, didactic lectures, and in-person training sessions. Hands-on formal instruction is thought to be a vital component of US skill acquisition. However, during a pandemic and social distancing practices, in-person ultrasound training sessions are not possible. Display of ultrasound machine image and probe positioning can be shared in real time through virtual platforms, which allows for direct instructor education and feedback. This virtual method of US teaching may be complementary to traditional US teaching methods in the future. ABSTRACT: Hands-on teaching is an important part of sports ultrasound (US) education in sports medicine fellowships. However, physical distancing requirements during a global pandemic have resulted in cancellation and/or postponement of in-person educational sessions, US conferences, and clinical diagnostic and interventional US cases that enhance US training. In order for hands-on sports US teaching to continue during these uncertain times, the educational model must be adapted. The use of virtual meeting platforms to display US images is possible, and this not only allows for instructor demonstration, but also gives the instructor an opportunity to observe the learner scanning and provide direct feedback in real-time. Moving forward, virtual US teaching methods will likely continue to be of educational value, as they provide increased access to individualized instruction from skilled instructors and eliminate travel time and cost of conferences and instructional sessions.","output":"Sports Ultrasound Training During a Pandemic: Developing a Hands-On Skill Through Distance Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus epidemic is still on a surge and has harsh impacts on various factors across the globe including the economy and health.

In the past surgery aimed to control recurrences. Nowadays it is important to avoid postoperative chronic pain and thus several studies have examined the potential role of meshes in causing postoperative pain. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the early and long-term results after Lichtenstein tension-free repair using a self-adhesive mesh (Parietex ProgripTM - Covidien, Germany) in a single center. METHODS The study enrolled 211 patients, 199 males (94.3%) and 12 females (5.7%), mean age 62 years (28-90 years), between January 2008 and December 2011. Of these, 206 had primary inguinal hernias while 5 were recurrences following previous tension repair. Ten different general surgeons, including residents, performed Lichtenstein hernia repair using a 12 x 8-cm Parietex ProgripTM mesh. In 88.1% of patients no additional fixation was used, while in 11.9% a single 2-0 polypropylene stitch was placed on the pubic bone. A 1-10 visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess postoperative pain, evaluating it at 1 week, 1 month and 12, 24 and 36 months. Local paresthesia was assessed at same intervals. Any pain sensation lasting longer than 3 months postoperatively, or requiring injection of analgesics was defined as chronic pain. RESULTS Mean operating time was 64.1 minutes (SD  21.14). There were no intraoperative complications. Early postoperative complications included hematoma-seroma (5.7% cases), superficial wound infection (1%), urinary retention (0.5%), and scrotal swelling (1%). The main follow-up period was 3 years, although patients operated between 2009 and 2011 underwent a shorter follow-up. At one-year follow-up, 17 patients reported groin discomfort, but did not require analgesics. Three patients reported moderate pain, requiring occasional use of oral analgesics, and 2 of these described a discontinuous pain mainly during movement. One patient reported severe pain requiring local injection of analgesics. At 2-year follow-up, 3 patients reported groin discomfort. Five of the 17 patients who reported discomfort at 1 year were lost to the 2-year follow-up. One patient kept reporting a high VAS score (6), though slightly reduced from the previously reported at 1-year follow-up. Recurrence was observed in 0.5% at 1 year and in 2.4% at 2 years. At 3 years only half of the patients (102) were still on follow-up. Of these, 1 reported mild discomfort and 3 developed hernia recurrence. Globally a decrease in pain and local discomfort was observed. No cases of seroma, testicular complications or mesh infection were reported at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Self-gripping mesh for inguinal hernia repair is a good and safe option, easy to handle and with a low incidence of chronic pain (<3%). A sutureless fixation seems to prevent the development of postoperative chronic pain, without increasing recurrence rates. Using a self-adhesive mesh also slightly reduce operating times, and costs are lower when compared to biological glue used to fix the mesh. In conclusion, our experience with the self-gripping mesh is limited but positive, randomized clinical trials are warranted to confirm our results.","output":"Self-adhesive mesh for Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair.

The prevailing hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interactions lead to an imbalance of the RAS, favoring proinflammatory angiotensin II (ANG II)-related signaling at the expense of the anti-inflammatory ANG-(1-7)-mediated alternative pathway. Indeed, multiple clinical trials targeting this pathway in COVID-19 are underway. Therefore, precise measurement of circulating RAS components is critical to understand the interplay of the RAS on COVID-19 outcomes. Multiple challenges exist in measuring the RAS in COVID-19, including improper patient controls, ex vivo degradation and low concentrations of angiotensins, and unvalidated laboratory assays. Here, we conducted a prospective pilot study to enroll 33 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 and physiologically matched COVID-19-negative controls to quantify the circulating RAS. Our enrollment strategy led to physiological matching of COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive moderate hypoxic respiratory failure cohorts, in contrast to the severe COVID-19 cohort, which had increased severity of illness, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased mortality. Circulating ANG II and ANG-(1-7) levels were measured in the low picomolar (pM) range. We found no significant differences in circulating RAS peptides or peptidases between these three cohorts. The combined moderate and severe COVID-19-positive cohorts demonstrated a mild reduction in ACE activity compared with COVID-19-negative controls (2.2  0.9  105 vs. 2.9  0.8  105 RFU/mL, P = 0.03). These methods may be useful in designing larger studies to physiologically match patients and quantify the RAS in COVID-19 RAS augmenting clinical trials.","output":"A pilot study to assess the circulating renin-angiotensin system in COVID-19 acute respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the spread of COVID-19 and the worsening global prevention and control situation, the risk of infection faced by health workers has been unprecedented. It is necessary to fully understand the occupational risks of health workers to protect them and reduce their risk of infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to obtain comprehensive and detailed information on occupational risk factors of infectious diseases for HWs in different dimensions and to propose control strategies for three risk dimensions to protect HWs who are at high risk of infection during the pandemic. METHODS: A total number of 619 articles published from 2010 to 2021 were searched to conduct bibliometric analysis, which were retrieved in the Web of Science database with defined search terms. There were 26 articles met the criteria, and they were screened to identify occupational risk factors. RESULTS: We conducted an analysis of cited institutions, co-citation network analysis of journals, and references from bibliometric analysis. Nine risk factors were extracted, and they were classified and sorted into three dimensions. Infection control strategies for each dimension were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of infection faced by HWs is unprecedented. Medical institutions should pay more attention to the nine risk factors that we identified and use the three risk dimensions to carry out risk identification and infection control to reduce the infection risk of HWs and protect them better.","output":"Occupational risk factors of contracting COVID-19 among health workers: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To retrospectively explore the prognostic indicators of COVID?19 patients with diabetes. Methods: The clinical data of COVID?19 patients with diabetes admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 2020 to April 2020 was collected. Patients were divided into survival group and death group according to their outcomes. The differences of various indexes between the two groups were compared and the prognostic factors were screened by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the prognostic value of these factors. Results: Of the 80 patients, 49 were males and 31 were females, with an average age of 65.2 years. There were 61 cases discharged after treatment and 19 cases died. Age, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C?reactive protein (CRP), D?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), urea nitrogen, serum albumin, and serum sodium were significantly different between the survival group and the death group ( P <0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CRP ( OR =1.030, 95% CI =1.011?1.048, P =0.002) and LDH ( OR =1.015, 95% CI =1.006?1.025, P =0.002) correlated significantly with the mortality risk of the patients. The ROC curve analysis showed that the area under curve ( AUC ) of CRP was 0.884, when the optimal cut?off value in predicting death events was 40.335 mg/L, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 78.9%, 82.0%, and 81.3%, respectively. The AUC of lactate dehydrogenase was 0.930, when the optimal cut?off value in predicting death events was 273.450 U/L, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 94.7%, 86.9%, and 88.8%, respectively.

METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven participants suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were included in a multicentric cohort. All patients underwent simultaneous polysomnography (PSG) and PAT HSAT, and all PSG data were independently double scored using both the recommended 1A rule for hypopnea, requiring a 3% desaturation or arousal (3% Rule), and the acceptable 1B rule for hypopnea, requiring a 4% desaturation (4% Rule). The double-scoring of PSG enabled a comparison of the agreement between PAT HSAT and PSG to the inter-rater agreement of PSG. Clinical endpoint parameters were selected to evaluate the devices ability to determine the OSA severity category. Finally, a correction for near-boundary apneaChypopnea index values was proposed to adequately handle the inter-rater variability of the PSG benchmark. RESULTS: For both the 3% and the 4% Rules, most endpoint parameters showed a close agreement with PSG. The 4-way OSA severity categorization accuracy of PAT HSAT was strong, but nevertheless lower than the inter-rater agreement of PSG (70% vs 77% for the 3% Rule and 78% vs 81% for the 4% Rule). CONCLUSIONS: This paper reported on a multitude of robust endpoint parameters, in particular OSA severity categorization accuracies, while also benchmarking clinical performances against double-scored PSG.

These data are challenging to model due to noise that is present, which arises from failures in reporting, false positive tests, etc., and the spatial dependence between regions. In this work, we extend a recently developed Bayesian modeling framework for inference of functional data to jointly estimate and cluster daily reported cases data from US states, while accounting for spatial dependence between US states. Shape-restriction allows us to directly infer the number of extrema of a smooth infection rate curve that underlies noisy data. Other parameters in the model account for the relative timing of extrema, and the magnitude and severity of infection rates. We incorporate mobility behavior of each US states population into an informative prior model to account for the spatial dependence between US states. Our model corroborates past work that shows that different US states have indeed experienced COVID-19 differently, but that there are regional patterns within the US. The modeling results can be used to assess severity of infection in individual US states and trends of neighboring US states to aid pandemic planning.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also performed with B3LYP method in the gas phase. The DFT and spectral analysis specified that the Pd(II) atom is found in a square-planar geometry. HOMO/LUMO analysis, quantum chemical parameters and MEP surface of the complex were investigated to acquire an intuition about the nature of the compound. Partition coefficient and water solubility determination showed that both lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of the compound are more than cisplatin. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) value was evaluated against K562 cancer cells, the obtained result has revealed a promising cytotoxic effect. DNA and BSA binding of the complex were explored through multi-spectroscopic (UVCVis, fluorescence, FRET, and CD) and non-spectroscopic (gel electrophoresis, viscosity and docking simulation) techniques. The obtained findings demonstrated that the complex strongly interacts with CT-DNA by hydrophobic interactions and possesses medium interaction with BSA via hydrogen bond and van der Waals forces, thus BSA could efficiently carry out complex transportation. Furthermore, the results of docking simulation agree well with the experimental findings. In conclusion, the new Pd(II) complex has cytotoxic activity and could interact with DNA and BSA effectively.

Alternative equally valid strategies address what the treatment effect is if the patient actually takes the treatment or does not use specific alternative medication. There is no single right answer to which strategy is most appropriate, the solution depends on the key clinical question of interest.

In some cases, a considerable drop in energy consumption was observed, anticipating a scenario of sizable low-cost energy generation, from renewable sources, expected only for years later. In this paper, the impact of governmental restrictions on electrical load, generation and transmission was investigated in 16 European countries. Using the indices provided by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, precise restriction types were found to correlate with the load drop. Then the European grid was analysed to assess how the load drop was balanced by the change in generation and transmission patterns. The same restriction period from 2020 was compared to previous years, accounting for yearly variability with ad-hoc statistical technique. As a result, generation was found to be heavily impacted in most countries with significant load drop. Overall, generation from nuclear, and fossil coal and gas sources was reduced, in favour of renewables and, in some countries, fossil gas. Moreover, intermittent renewables generation increased in most countries without indicating an exceptional amount of curtailments. Finally, the European grid helped balance those changes with an increase in both energy exports and imports, with some net exporting countries becoming net importers, notably Germany, and vice versa. Together, these findings show the far reaching implications of the COVID-19 crisis, and contribute to the understanding and planning of higher renewables share scenarios, which will become more prevalent in the battle against climate change.","output":"Impact analysis of COVID-19 responses on energy grid dynamics in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented a dramatic challenge to healthcare systems.

Long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of these 2 treatment strategies from the perspective of the US healthcare system have not been compared. METHODS AND RESULTS Between 2009 and 2014, the ATTRACT trial (Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) randomized 692 patients with acute proximal DVT to PCDT plus anticoagulation (n=337) or standard treatment with anticoagulation alone (n=355). Costs (2017 US dollars) were assessed over a 24-month follow-up period using a combination of resource-based costing, hospital bills, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the Drug Topics Red Book. Health state utilities were obtained from the Short Form-36. In-trial results and US life tables were used to develop a Markov cohort model to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness. For the PCDT group, mean costs of the initial procedure were $13 600; per-patient costs associated with the index hospitalization were $21 509 for PCDT and $3877 for standard care (difference=$17 632; 95% CI, $16 117-$19 243). The 24-month difference in costs was $20 045 (95% CI, $16 093-$24 120). Utility scores increased significantly between baseline and 6 months for both groups, with no significant differences between groups at any follow-up time point. Projected differences in lifetime costs of $16 740 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.08, yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCDT of $222 041/QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that PCDT would achieve a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/QALY or <$150 000/QALY was 1% and 25%, respectively. For iliofemoral DVT, QALY gains with PCDT were greater, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $137 526/QALY; for femoral-popliteal DVT, standard therapy was an economically dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$200 000/QALY gained, PCDT is not an economically attractive treatment for proximal DVT.

METHODS: This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating our COVID-19 vaccine messaging platforms in seven hospital EDs (mix of academic, community, and safety-net EDs) in four US cities. Within each study site, we randomized 30 1-week periods to the intervention and 30 1-week periods to the control. Adult patients who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine are eligible with these exclusions: (1) major trauma, intoxication, altered mental status, or critical illness; (2) incarceration; (3) psychiatric chief complaint; and (4) suspicion of acute COVID-19 illness. Participants receive an orally administered Intake survey. During intervention weeks, participants then receive three COVID-19 vaccine messaging platforms (4-min video, one-page informational flyer and a brief, scripted face-to-face message delivered by an ED physician or nurse); patients enrolled during non-intervention weeks do not receive these platforms. Approximately, an hour after intake surveys, participants receive a Vaccine Acceptance survey during which the primary outcome of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in the ED is ascertained. The other primary outcome of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine within 32 days is ascertained by electronic health record review and phone follow-up. To determine whether provision of vaccine messaging platforms is associated with a 7% increase in vaccine acceptance and uptake, we will need to enroll 1290 patients.

Most adults with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization, but the subsequent risk of post-COVID condition, including associated psychological and cognitive dysfunction, remains poorly understood among non-hospitalized versus hospitalized cases. Objective. To assess the prevalence and duration of post-COVID condition, including physical, psychological and cognitive symptoms. Design. Case series and case-control study between December 2020 and May 2021 Setting. Healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada Participants. Eligible cases were symptomatic healthcare workers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 between July 2020 and May 2021. Among 17,717 contacted cases, 6061 (34%) participated. A random sample of symptomatic healthcare workers with negative PCR result between November 2020 and May 2021 served as controls. Among 11,498 contacted controls, 4390 (38%) participated. Exposures. In multivariable models, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as vaccine history, were evaluated as potential risk factors. Prevalence ratios compared self-reported cognitive dysfunctions (difficulty concentrating; difficulty organizing oneself; forgetfulness; loss of necessary items) among cases with post-COVID condition to controls, adjusting for psychological distress and fatigue. Outcomes. Post-COVID condition was defined by symptoms persisting []4 weeks or []12 weeks after COVID-19 onset. Results. Four-week and 12-week post-COVID condition prevalences of 46% (2,746/5,943) and 40% (653/1,746), respectively, were observed among non-hospitalized cases and 76% (90/118) and 68% (27/37), respectively, among hospitalized cases. Hospitalization, female sex and age were associated with higher risk. A substantial proportion of non-hospitalized cases with 4-week post-COVID condition often or very often reported cognitive dysfunction, including concentration (33%) or organizing (23%) difficulties, forgetfulness (20%) and loss of necessary items (10%), with no decline at 12 weeks. All four aspects of cognitive dysfunction were 2.2 to 3.0 times more prevalent among cases with post-COVID condition than in controls, but also independently associated with psychological distress and fatigue. Conclusions and relevance. Post-COVID condition may be a frequent sequela of ambulatory COVID-19 in working-age adults, with important effects on cognition. With so many healthcare workers infected since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing implications for quality healthcare delivery could be profound should cognitive dysfunction and other severe post-COVID symptoms persist in a professionally-disabling way over the longer term.","output":"Physical, psychological and cognitive profile of post-COVID condition in healthcare workers, Quebec, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this case series study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a subacute rehabilitation program for mechanically ventilated patients with severe consequences of COVID-19 infection.

Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight \\"window of opportunity\\" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections -so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines- action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.","output":"A novel COVID-19 epidemiological model with explicit susceptible and asymptomatic isolation compartments reveals unexpected consequences of timing social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pneumomediastinum, an uncommon entity, has been on the rise with increasing cases of COVID-Acute respiratory distress syndrome. It has been unclear whether this entity represents an indicator of poor clinical outcome or not. The aims of this study were to find out the incidence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-Acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, describe their clinical characteristics and try to explain its plausible mechanisms.. METHODS A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out in the ICU of our hospital among 280 patients admitted with COVID-Acute respiratory distress syndrome over a period of 6 months. Demographics along with various clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters were analyzed. Relevant statistical analyses were done to summarize our findings. RESULTS The incidence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-ARDS patients was 2.8%. All patients were male, none had pulmonary co-morbidities and six of them (60%) were on invasive mechanical ventilation. All intubated patients were on lung protective mechanical ventilation. The median PEEP, peak airway pressure and plateau pressure were 10 (IQR: 4), 29 (IQR: 8) and 28 (IQR: 4) respectively. The mean CT severity score was 22.7 (SD: 1.64). Five patients died after 6.8 days (SD: 4.8) of diagnosis. The average hospital stay was of 34 days. CONCLUSIONS Pneumomediastinum is a possible complication of COVID-Acute respiratory distress syndrome which could signify the disease severity and vice versa.

This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference.

COVID-19 induces an inflammatory response and, in severe cases, a cytokine storm that can damage the CNS. Antimalarials have unique properties that distinguish them from other anti-inflammatory drugs. (A) They are very lipophilic, which enhances their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Hence, they have the potential to act not only in the periphery but also in the CNS, and could be a useful addition to our limited armamentarium against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (B) They are non-selective inhibitors of phospholipase A(2) isoforms, including cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)). The latter is not only activated by cytokines but itself generates arachidonic acid, which is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Free radicals are produced in this process, which can lead to oxidative damage to the CNS. There are at least 4 ways that antimalarials could be useful in combating COVID-19. (1) They inhibit PLA(2.) (2) They are basic molecules capable of affecting the pH of lysosomes and inhibiting the activity of lysosomal enzymes. (3) They may affect the expression and Fe(2+)/H(+) symporter activity of iron transporters such as divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), hence reducing iron accumulation in tissues and iron-catalysed free radical formation. (4) They would affect viral replication. The latter may be related to their effect on inhibition of PLA(2) isoforms. Inhibition of cPLA(2) impairs an early step of coronavirus replication in cell culture. In addition, a secretory PLA(2) (sPLA(2)) isoform, PLA2G2D, has been shown to be essential for the lethality of SARS-CoV in mice.

We compared longitudinal viral shedding dynamics in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults. SARS-CoV-2-infected adults were enrolled within 5 days of symptom onset and nasal specimens were self-collected daily for two weeks and intermittently for an additional two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and infectious virus were analyzed relative to symptom onset stratified by vaccination status. We tested 1080 nasal specimens from 52 unvaccinated adults enrolled in the pre-Delta period and 32 fully vaccinated adults with predominantly Delta infections. While we observed no differences by vaccination status in maximum RNA levels, maximum infectious titers and the median duration of viral RNA shedding, the rate of decay from the maximum RNA load was faster among vaccinated; maximum infectious titers and maximum RNA levels were highly correlated. Furthermore, amongst participants with infectious virus, median duration of infectious virus detection was reduced from 7.5 days (IQR: 6.0-9.0) in unvaccinated participants to 6 days (IQR: 5.0-8.0) in those vaccinated (P=0.02). Accordingly, the odds of shedding infectious virus from days 6 to 12 post-onset were lower among vaccinated participants than unvaccinated participants (OR 0.42 95% CI 0.19-0.89).

This new situation has changed peoples habits and significantly affected the pregnant population. Decreased exercise and increased psychophysical stress are associated with excessive weight gain, diabetes, and gestational cardiovascular complications that affect the mother, fetus, and newborn. Recent research shows that the dynamics of maternal blood pressure is one of the most important control factors during pregnancy. Thus, prevention of these type of pathologies through interventions without maternal-fetal risks is important. OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of a virtual exercise program on maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized clinical trial design was used (NCT04563065). Data from 72 pregnant women without obstetric contraindications under confinement conditions in the Madrid area were collected. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). They previously signed informed consent forms. A moderate exercise program was performed as an intervention from 8C10 to 38C39 weeks of pregnancy. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) maternal blood pressure were measured during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, as well as before and immediately after delivery in both study groups. RESULTS: No differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the first, second and third trimesters were found between groups. Significant differences in SBP were found immediately before delivery (IG = 119.83  10.16 vs. CG = 125.6  10.91; p = 0.047) and immediately after delivery (IG = 115.00  11.18 vs. CG = 122.24  15.71; p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Results show lower SBP values for the IG during delivery than CG. A virtual exercise program throughout pregnancy during COVID-19 confinement can help to control systolic blood pressure before and immediately after delivery in healthy pregnant women.","output":"Effectiveness of a Virtual Exercise Program During COVID-19 Confinement on Blood Pressure Control in Healthy Pregnant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critically ill patients manifest many of the same immune features seen in COVID-19, including both \\"cytokine storm\\" and \\"immune suppression.\\" However, direct comparisons of molecular and cellular profiles between contemporaneously enrolled critically ill patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 are limited.

We enrolled a multi-site prospective cohort of patients admitted under suspicion for COVID-19 who were then determined to be SARS-CoV-2-positive (n = 204) or -negative (n = 122). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher plasma levels of CXCL10, sPD-L1, IFN-g, CCL26, CRP, and TNF-a relative to SARS-CoV-2-negative patients adjusting for demographics and severity of illness (Bonferroni p-value < 0.05). In contrast, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17A were not significantly different between the two groups. In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, higher plasma levels of sPD-L1 and TNF-a were associated with fewer ventilator-free days and higher mortality rates (Bonferroni p-value < 0.05).

Recent findings An increase in measles cases have been reported in various parts of the world for different reasons related to the regional context of the outbreak. With reduction in measles vaccine doses since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future risk of SSPE can only accelerate. In recent years, subsequent cases of SSPE have been reported in the period following documented measles outbreaks in different settings.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in pediatric vaccinations administered by the PNI, as a proxy of adherence to vaccinations during 2020. METHODS: Data on the number of vaccines administered to children under 10 years of age nationally and in each of Brazils five regions were extracted from Brazils federal health delivery database. Population adjusted monthly vaccination rates from 2015 through 2019 were determined, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were used to forecast expected vaccinated rates in 2020. We compared the forecasts to reported vaccine administrations to assess adequacy of pediatric vaccine delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: From January 2015 to February 2020, the average rate of vaccine administration to children was 53.4 per 100,000. After February 2020, this rate decreased to 50.4, a 9.4% drop compared to 2019 and fell outside of forecasted ranges in December 2020. In Brazil's poorest region, the North, vaccine delivery fell outside of the forecasted ranges earlier in 2020 but subsequently rebounded, meeting expected targets by the end of 2020. However, in Brazil's wealthiest South and Southeast regions, initial vaccine delivery fell and remained well below forecasted rates through the end of 2020 CONCLUSION: In Brazil, despite a model national pediatric vaccination program with an over 95% national coverage, vaccination rates decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Infected and vaccinated individuals generate antibodies against spike, which can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1; however, antibodies against other regions of spike have also been isolated. The variation between infected individuals in domain specificity of the antibodies and in their relative neutralization efficacy is still poorly characterized. To this end, we tested serum and plasma samples from 85 COVID-19 convalescent subjects using 7 immunoassays that employ different domains, subunits and oligomeric forms of spike to capture the antibodies. Samples were also tested for their neutralization of pseudovirus containing SARS-CoV-2 spike and of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. We observed strong correlations between the levels of NTD- and RBD-specific antibodies, with a fixed ratio of each type to all anti-spike antibodies. The relative potency of the response (defined as the measured neutralization efficacy relative to the total level of spike-targeting antibodies) also exhibited limited variation between subjects, and was not associated with the overall amount of anti-spike antibodies produced. Accordingly, the ability of immunoassays that use RBD, NTD and different forms of S1 or S1/S2 as capture antigens to estimate the neutralizing efficacy of convalescent samples was largely similar. These studies suggest that host-to-host variation in the polyclonal response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 spike is primarily limited to the quantity of antibodies generated rather than their domain specificity or relative neutralization potency. IMPORTANCEInfection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD, NTD and S2. Different infected individuals generate vastly different amounts of anti-spike antibodies. By contrast, as we show here, there is a remarkable similarity in the properties of the antibodies produced. Different individuals generate the same proportions of antibodies against each domain of the spike protein. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of anti-spike antibodies produced and their neutralization efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved. Therefore, the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or relative antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.","output":"Limited variation between SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in domain specificity and relative potency of the antibody response against the spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a large\\\\scale study, 128176 non\\\\pregnant patients (228 studies) and 10000 pregnant patients (121 studies) confirmed COVID\\\\19 cases included in this Meta\\\\Analysis.

The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3C16), and the rate of positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID\\\\19 is 8% (4C16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID\\\\19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID\\\\19 suggest a possible association between COVID\\\\19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID\\\\19 pregnant patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID\\\\19 and comparison with control patients: A systematic review and meta\\\\analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Au dbut de la pandmie de COVID-19, plusieurs tudes ont signal une diminution des sjours hospitaliers hors COVID-19.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unique challenges to the rheumatology community. It is known that many individuals with rheumatic disease are at increased risk of severe disease from other infections, sparking a similar fear for COVID-19. In addition, medications routinely used in rheumatology practice are being trialled as treatments, with the potential for drug shortages for rheumatology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Underlying comorbidities and active disease are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. Tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine have not proven to be effective treatments in the management of COVID-19. Telehealth has become an essential tool for the rheumatology community to monitor patients during the pandemic. In this article, we summarise the available COVID-19 evidence that is of relevance to the rheumatology community. We discuss the risk of contracting COVID-19 in individuals with rheumatic disease, along with presenting features and clinical outcomes. We provide an overview of the treatments for COVID-19 which have significance for rheumatology. We highlight published recommendations which can guide our management of rheumatic disease populations during this pandemic.

METHODS: The research was developed with the Fulni-? people in the municipality of guas Belas, Agreste of Pernambuco, Northeast of Brazil. In order to do this, we applied snowball sampling to select the participants. Data from potentially useful game species were obtained from lists and semi-structured interviews to register their particular kind of uses, capture periods (daytime, night, or both), preferences, and perceived abundance. The hunters who allowed their game meat captured to be weighed and identified were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Our records pointed to a vast repertoire of potentially hunting animals. However, we did not verify relationships between the abundance, seasonality, and biomass of the animals that were hunted by the Fulni-?. We observed a total of 209,866 (kg) of game meat hunted in the studied group, belonging to 23 species, distributed in three taxonomic groups, the birds being the most representative group with 59% of total reported. CONCLUSION: Such consumption by the group is well below in terms of biomass when compared to other ethnic or local groups in other regions of Brazil, or in Caatinga areas, characterizing an activity much more of cultural character than subsistence. Also, the use of game meat among the Fulni-? seems to be actively directed to the preferred species, suggesting that in the case of an urbanized indigenous community, where other sources of income are available, the demand for game meat is lower when compared to other ethnic groups.","output":"Use of game fauna by Fulni-? people in Northeastern Brazil: implications for conservation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biologically active environmental pollutants have significant impact on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.

Microplastics and nanoplastics have been shown to cause increased oxidative stress, inflammation, altered metabolism leading to cellular damage, which ultimately affects tissue and organismal homeostasis in numerous animal species and human cells. However, the full impact of these plastic particles on living organisms is not completely understood. The ability of MPs/NPs to carry contaminants, toxic chemicals, pesticides, and bioactive compounds, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals, present an additional risk to animal and human health. This review will discusses the current knowledge on pathways by which microplastic and nanoplastic particles impact reproduction and reproductive behaviors from the level of the whole organism down to plastics-induced cellular defects, while also identifying gaps in current knowledge regarding mechanisms of action.

The current study sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on urban mobility, atmospheric pollutants, and Pakistans climate. For the air pollution assessment, total column ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and tropospheric column nitrogen dioxide (NO2) data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and dust column mass density (PM2.5) data from the MERRA-2 satellite were used. Furthermore, these datasets are linked to climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation, wind speed). The KruskalCWallis H test (KWt) is used to compare medians among k groups (k >2), and the Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test (WRST) is for analyzing the differences between the medians of two datasets. To make the analysis more effective, and to justify that the variations in air quality parameters are due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used. The findings revealed that the limitations on human mobility have lowered emissions, which has improved the air quality in Pakistan. The results of the study showed that the climatic parameters (precipitation, Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean) have a positive correlation and wind speed has a negative correlation with NO2 and AOD. This study found a significant decrease in air pollutants (NO2, SO2, O3, AOD) of 30C40% in Pakistan during the strict lockdown period. In this duration, the highest drop of about 28% in NO2 concentrations has been found in Karachi. Total column O3 did not show any reduction during the strict lockdown, but a minor decline was depicted as 0.38% in Lahore and 0.55% in Islamabad during the loosening lockdown. During strict lockdown, AOD was reduced up to 23% in Islamabad and 14.46% in Lahore. The results of KWt and WRST evident that all the mobility indices are significant (p <0.05) in nature.

Meanwhile, more cost-effective and precise COVID-19 detection methods are being preferred worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Machine vision-based COVID-19 detection methods, especially deep learning as a diagnostic method in the early stages of the pandemic, have been assigned great importance during the pandemic. This study aimed to design a highly efficient computer-aided detection (CAD) system for COVID-19 by using a neural search architecture network (NASNet)-based algorithm. METHODS: NASNet, a state-of-the-art pretrained convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, was adopted to identify patients with COVID-19 in their early stages of the disease. A local data set, comprising 10,153 computed tomography scans of 190 patients with and 59 without COVID-19 was used. RESULTS: After fitting on the training data set, hyperparameter tuning, and topological alterations of the classifier block, the proposed NASNet-based model was evaluated on the test data set and yielded remarkable results. The proposed model's performance achieved a detection sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.999, 0.986, and 0.996, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model achieved acceptable results in the categorization of 2 data classes. Therefore, a CAD system was designed on the basis of this model for COVID-19 detection using multiple lung computed tomography scans. The system differentiated all COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 ones without any error in the application phase. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based CAD system can greatly help radiologists detect COVID-19 in its early stages. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of a CAD system as a screening tool would accelerate disease detection and prevent the loss of health care resources.","output":"Deep Convolutional Neural Network-Based Computer-Aided Detection System for COVID-19 Using Multiple Lung Scans: Design and Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of serological testing and dynamic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In these settings, a non-adaptive group testing algorithm is designed to rule out sure-negative samples. Then, on the reduced problem, a compressive sensing algorithm is applied to decode the positives without requiring any further testing besides the initial test matrix designed for the group testing phase.

Identifying intermediate host species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that reflects the adaptability of virus to host.

This study investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values.

Results: We quantify in each region the following reductions in the observed effective reproduction numbers of the pandemic: i) reduction due to decrease in mobility (as captured in Google mobility reports); ii) reduction due to mask wearing and mask compliance; iii) reduction due to other NPI's, over and above the ones identified in i) and ii).

Beyond the first waves, mask mandates and compliance, together with social-distancing measures (which we refer to as other NPI's) have allowed some control of subsequent disease spread. The methodology we propose here is novel and can be applied to other respiratory diseases such as influenza or RSV.","output":"Human behaviour, NPI and mobility reduction effects on COVID-19 transmission in different countries of the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission features of the COVID-19 epidemic have still not been properly recognized in the sense of global environmental changes. Likewise, the pace of global development, increased population size, nuanced encounters, and lack of medical security in developing countries all contribute to the complexities of COVID-19 prevention and regulation. The COVID-19 seems to have a greater impact on the global economy when compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurs in 2013. The bone of contention is how to fight the spread of these infectious diseases and how to contains it spread from human-to-human. Most countries depended on the observation of classic steps to monitor diseases and public health to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to those used with SARS in 2003. Data in the healthcare sector are usually huge and not easy to handle, this results from the enormous way by which data grows in the healthcare sector, the rate at which data are been produced, and the variety of various data in the healthcare system contributed to this growth. Also, the rate at which these data are been captured, stored, analyzed, and retrieved in healthcare has swiftly from the aged paper-based storage technique to the use of digital techniques and methods. Hence, the application of advanced technologies which includes virtualization and cloud computing allows for huge and effective data processing in the healthcare system. Thereby rapidly turning the healthcare system into a big data industry. Nevertheless, in these modern days, the improvement in the information and communication technologies (ICT) brings the advancement of varied data from new sources in the healthcare system. Therefore, this chapter discusses the possible application of big data and analytics to improve conventional public health approaches to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic to control, manage, identify and avoid COVID-19 and reduce the effect on health implicitly associated with COVID-19. The significant applications of big data and challenges are presented.

In our study, we included 174 women for whom spectral mammography was performed for diagnostic purposes. The relationship between enhancement in CESM and blood vessel density (BVD), lymphatic vessel density (LVD) or the percentage of fields with at least one lymphatic vessel (distribution of podoplanin-positive vessels - DPV) and other related parameters was assessed in 55 cases. BVD, LVD and DPV were assessed immunohistochemically, applying podoplanin and CD31/CD34 as markers of lymphatic and blood vessels, respectively. The sensitivity (in detection of malignant lesions) of CESM was 100%, while its specificity - 39%. We found a significant positive correlation between the intensity of enhancement in CESM and BVD (p = 0.007, r = 0.357) and a negative correlation between the intensity of enhancement in CESM and DPV (p = 0.003, r = -0.390). Lesions with the highest enhancement in CESM showed a high number of blood vessels and a low number of lymphatics. CONCLUSIONS 1) CESM is a method characterized by high sensitivity and acceptable specificity; 2) the correlation between CESM results and blood/lymphatic vessel density confirms its utility in detection of tissue angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis.","output":"Correlation between blood and lymphatic vessel density and results of contrast-enhanced spectral mammography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite an improvement of water quality across Europe there are many pollution hotspots for both nitrates and PPPs, mainly due to agricultural activities. The BMPs and MMs to reduce pollution from agriculture are well known, and there are policy instruments in place to ensure drinking water standards, but the current approach has not been efficient enough. Within the H2020 Water Protect project the premise was that there is a need for a multi-actor, participatory approach to tackle the issue from a new angle, and to assess why the uptake of known BMPs and MMs was not better among farmers. Seven Action Labs were selected that represent major physical, socio-economical, cultural and farming settings across Europe. A methodology of multi-actor engagement was chosen but with different approaches due to the local context. Initially the level of farmers' awareness about water quality issues was matched to the observed uptake rates of BMPs and MMs. In a second survey barriers hindering the uptake of measures were identified. The first survey revealed a low general awareness on the potential pollution to drinking water sources. Despite this, between 24% to 88% of the surveyed farmers per Action Lab were already voluntarily adopting one quarter of the selected BMPs and MMs. The second survey demonstrated the need to address organisational, legislative, sociological and technical barriers. The lack of coordination between different institutional bodies promoting measures and the financial incentives needed to invest and operate these often-costly measures need to be considered. The multi-actor, participatory approach with its improved awareness and collaboration made it possible to identify the crucial factors for improvement - to build a social acceptance among all actors and communicate the issues and solutions from the start.","output":"A multi-actor, participatory approach to identify policy and technical barriers to better farming practices that protect our drinking water sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In this study, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) membranes containing Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) were prepared by electrospinning and grafted copolymerization with 3,3,4,4-benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid (BPTA) to provide better mechanical properties, lower water vapor transmittance, and higher antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) than the PVA/AgNPs membrane. The PVA/AgNPs/BPTA membrane showed higher antibacterial activity than the other membranes, and it produced inhibition zones with diameters of 18.12  0.08 and 16.41  0.05 mm against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively.

In the filtration test, the electrospun nanofibrous membranes showed high filtration efficiencies of 99.98% for sodium chloride (NaCl). In addition, these membranes maintained a relatively low pressure drop of 168 Pa with a basis weight of 2.1 g m?2.

This 2C substitution alone (even in the absence of replacements in 3D) increased FMDV fitness mainly in the presence of ribavirin, prevented an incorporation bias in favor of A and U associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, and conferred the ATPase activity of 2C decreased sensitivity to ribavirin-triphosphate. Since in previous studies we described that 2C with I248T was selected under different selective pressures, this replacement qualifies as a joker substitution in FMDV evolution.

Continuous monitoring of the virus has become a cornerstone to make rational decisions on implementing societal and sanitary measures to curtail the virus spread. Additionally, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have increased the need for genomic surveillance to detect particular strains because of their potentially increased transmissibility, pathogenicity and immune escape. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing of wastewater has been explored as an epidemiological surveillance method for the competent authorities. Few quality criteria are however available when sequencing wastewater samples, and those available typically only pertain to constructing the consensus genome sequence. Multiple variants circulating in the population can however be simultaneously present in wastewater samples. The performance, including detection and quantification of low-abundant variants, of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the detection and quantification of mutations present at low abundances using the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (alpha variant) defining mutations as a case study. Real sequencing data were in silico modified by introducing mutations of interest into raw wild-type sequencing data, or by mixing wild-type and mutant raw sequencing data, to mimic wastewater samples subjected to WGS using a tiling amplicon-based targeted metagenomics approach and Illumina sequencing. As anticipated, higher variation, lower sensitivity and more false negatives, were observed at lower coverages and allelic frequencies. We found that detection of all low-frequency variants at an abundance of 10%, 5%, 3% and 1%, requires at least a sequencing coverage of 250X, 500X, 1500X and 10,000X, respectively. Although increasing variability of estimated allelic frequencies at decreasing coverages and lower allelic frequencies was observed, its impact on reliable quantification was limited. This study provides a highly sensitive low-frequency variant detection approach, which is publicly available at https://galaxy.sciensano.be, and specific recommendations for minimum sequencing coverages to detect clade-defining mutations at specific allelic frequencies.","output":"Strategy and performance evaluation of low-frequency variant calling for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using targeted deep Illumina sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The emergency hemodialysis is a very common situation in nephrology and is characterized by high morbi-mortality. The aim of this work was to determine the indications for emergency hemodialysis, the clinical and paraclinical profiles of the patients, as well as the parameters of the session of hemodialysis and the perdialytic complications. METHOD: This is a prospective descriptive and analytical study carried out over a period of 3 months (March 3, 2020 - June 6, 2020). This period coincides with the coronavirus pandemic. This study was included all patients who have undergone Emergency hemodialysis. The study was done in the hemodialysis unit of the nephrology department of the CHU Fattouma Bourguiba Monastir. RESULTS: We collected 68 patients, the majority are male (70%). The average age was 60 + -14.4 years. The original department was the emergency room in 42.6% of cases, the intensive care unit in 10.29% and a surgical department in 13.23% of cases. 40% of patients were diabetic and 22% had coronary insufficiency. 60.5% were a chronic renal failure, 16% were end-stage and 34% were on hemodialysis. The indications for emergency hemodialysis were acute lung edema, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis in 31%, 50% and 50% of cases, respectively. Poorly tolerated uremia and anuria more than 12 hours were the indication in 11.8% and 10.3% of cases, respectively, drug or toxic intoxication (methanol) was in 5.9% of cases and hypercalcaemia in 4.4% of cases. The average duration of the sessions was 2.95 hours [2C4 hours]. Ultrafiltration was necessary in 44.11% of cases. Per-dialysis anticoagulation was used in 38.23% of patients. The vascular access was a femoral catheter in 67.6% of cases and an arteriovenous fistula in 28% of cases. The per-dialytic complications were hypotension in 10 cases (14.7%) and the session was stopped in 4 cases. hypoglycemia was noted in 2 cases (2.9%) and seizures in 2 cases. Cardiopulmonary arrest was reported in 2.9% of sessions. The incidence of bleeding complications occurring within 72 hours after the hemodialysis session was 5.8%.The death rate was 13.2%. Our univariate analysis concluded that diabetes, heart failure and coronary artery disease, history of gastrointestinal bleeding and active infection are risk factors for mortality. The multivariate analysis showed that diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding was the two factors of mortality.

METHODS: Patients affected by solid cancer treated in a top comprehensive cancer center in Italy during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave, and negative for COVID-19-symptoms since the first detection of COVID-19 in Italy, were prospectively evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 serology in the period between April 14th and June 23rd 2020. Follow-up serologies were performed, every 21C28 days, until August 23rd 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 IgM + patients underwent confirmatory nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). PBMCs from a subset of SARS-CoV-2 IgM + patients were collected at baseline, at 2 months, and at 7 months for transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed on 446 of the 466 recruited patients. A total of 14 patients (3.14%) tested positive for at least one SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin in the period between April 14th and August 23rd 2020. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM decreased from 1.48% in the first month of the accrual to 0% in the last month. Viral RNA could not be detected in any of the NPS. PBMC serial transcriptomic analysis showed progressive downregulation of interleukin 6 upregulated signatures, chemokine-mediated signaling and chemokine-chemokine receptor KEGG pathways. B- and T-cell receptor pathways (p-values = 0.0002 and 0.017 respectively) were progressively upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in asymptomatic patients affected by solid cancer is consistent with that of asymptomatic COVID-19 assessed in the general population through NPS at the peak of the first wave. Transcriptomic features over time in IgM + asymptomatic cases are suggestive of previous viral exposure.

From previous studies, dexamethasone has led to a decrease in mortality in patients who required oxygen supplementation mainly invasive mechanical ventilation;at the same time, it is unknown if another corticosteroid can be effective when used and what is the optimal dose and its duration, to achieve improvement in clinical outcome. The cornerstone of the study was to compare the differences in clinical outcome and laboratory results in intensive care patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with dexamethasone 6 mg/day: doses versus those treated with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day infusion. Materials and methods A prospective cohort study with a survival analysis of 414 patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, for SARS-CoV-2 according to the Berlin definition of ARDS, who were admitted in the intensive care unit in the Helwan University Hospitals;the duration is from June 2020 till October 2021. Patients included in the study were mechanically ventilated with radiological confirmation of pneumonia by chest tomography;patients were included in the study according to the Berlin definition of ARDS and met the inclusion criteria of the study;222 patients were treated with methylprednisolone infusion with a dose of 2 mg/kg/day versus 192 patients treated with dexamethasone 6 mg/day;both groups were treated for 10 days and were mechanically ventilated;the clinical out come and differences in the laboratory results were evaluated during the 10-day course for each group.

DESIGN A prospective, controlled, sequential two-arm clinical study. SETTING German university medical centre with more than 2500 cardiac surgery interventions per year. PATIENTS Sixty elective on-pump cardiac surgery patients. INTERVENTION In group Sevo1.8% (n = 29), the sedation depth was maintained with a sustained inspired concentration of sevoflurane 1.8% before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In group SevoBIS (n = 31), the inspired sevoflurane concentration was titrated to maintain a BIS target between 40 and 60. OUTCOME MEASURES SPC during CPB and the intraoperative administration of noradrenaline. Additional analyses were performed on intraoperative awareness, postoperative blood lactate concentration, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay and kidney injury. RESULTS Mean inspired sevoflurane concentration was 0.8% in group SevoBIS, representing a 57.1% reduction (P < 0.001) compared with group Sevo1.8%. The mean SPC was 42.3 g ml(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.0 to 44.6] in group Sevo1.8% and 21.0 g ml(-1) (95% CI 18.8 to 23.3) in group SevoBIS, representing a 50.2% reduction (P < 0.001). During CPB, the mean cumulative dose of noradrenaline administered was 13.48 g kg(-1) (95% CI 10.52 to 17.19) in group Sevo1.8% and 4.06 g kg(-1) (95% CI 2.67 to 5.97) in group SevoBIS (P < 0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient (between the cumulative applied dosage of sevoflurane calculated from the area under the curve of the SPC over time and the administered cumulative noradrenaline dose) was 0.607 (P < 0.001).

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%.

While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS.

Methods: We developed and validated a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect IgG binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, which was then applied for surveillance. ELISA results were compared to a set of complimentary serologic assays using a large panel of clinical research samples. Results: The RBD ELISA exhibited robust performance in ROC curve analysis (AUC> 0.99; Se = 89%, Sp = 99.3%). Antibodies were detected in 23/353 (6.5%) healthcare workers, 6/9 RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19 cases, and 0/30 non-COVID-19 cases from an ambulatory site. RBD ELISA showed a positive correlation with neutralizing activity (p = <0.0001, R(2) = 0.26). Conclusions: We applied a validated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG ELISA in multiple contexts and performed orthogonal testing on samples. This study demonstrates the utility of a simple serologic assay for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as a tool for efficiently testing large numbers of samples as in population surveillance.

In this study, we investigated whether in ovo LTA delivery leads to the induction of antiviral responses against post-hatch infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection. We first delivered the LTA into embryo day (ED)18 eggs via in ovo route so that the compound is available at the respiratory mucosa. Then the LTA treated and control ED18 eggs were allowed to hatch and the hatched chicken was infected with ILTV intratracheally on the day of hatch. We found that in ovo delivered LTA reduces ILTV infection post-hatch. We also found that in ovo delivery of LTA significantly increases mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in pre-hatch embryo lungs as well as mononuclear cell infiltration, predominantly macrophages, in lung of post-hatch chickens. Altogether, the data suggest that in ovo delivered LTA could be used to reduce ILTV infection in newly hatched chickens.","output":"In ovo delivery of Toll-like receptor 2 ligand, lipoteichoic acid induces pro-inflammatory mediators reducing post-hatch infectious laryngotracheitis virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detect the presence of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR.

Four of the NBFRs (ATE, BTBPE, TBPH, and DBDPE) were detected in all wastewater and biosolid samples. The dominant compound in both wastewater and biosolid samples was DBDPE, with concentrations in the ranges of 6.4-18 ng/L and 83-288 ng/g dry weight (dw), respectively. A mass flow analysis indicated that the overall removal efficiencies were 3118% for ATE, 971.5% for DPTE, 7911% for BTBPE, 875.3% for TBPH, and 933.3% for DBDPE, but the removal efficiency in aqueous phase only ranged from -43 (ATE) to 57% (DBDPE). The low and negative removal efficiencies of ATE were possibly due to the transformation of DPTE during the anaerobic treatment processes. Under the aerobic conditions, BTBPE, TBPH and DBDPE underwent a very slow biodegradation. A total of 68-91% of the initial mass loadings of ATE, BTBPE, TBPH and DBDPE were found in the biosolid samples, suggesting that the four NBFRs were removed mainly via sorption in the WWTP.The biosolid was a huge reservoir of target NBFRs, and effective removal of NBFRs during treatment in the WWTP is critical.","output":"Occurrence and mass balance of emerging brominated flame retardants in a municipal wastewater treatment plant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We conducted usability studies on commercially available molecular diagnostic (MDX) test reports to identify strengths and weaknesses in content and form that drive clinical decision making. Given routine genomic testing in cancer medicine, oncologists must interpret MDX reports as well as evidence concerning clinical utility of biomarkers accurately for treatment or trial selection. This work aims to evaluate effectiveness of MDX reports in facilitating cancer treatment planning. METHODS: Fourteen clinicians at an academic tertiary care medical facility, with a wide range of experience in oncology and in the use of molecular testing, participated in this study. Three commercially available, widely used, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited test reports (labeled Laboratories A, B, and C) were used. Eye tracking, surveys, and think-aloud protocols were used to collect usability data for these MDX reports focusing on ease of comprehension and actionability. RESULTS: Clinicians found two primary areas in molecular diagnostic reports most useful for patient care: therapy options with benefit or lack of benefit to patients, including enrolling clinical trials; and pathogenic tumor molecular anomalies detected. Therapeutic implications and therapy classes such as US Food and Drug Administration-approved off-label, on-label, clinical trials were critical for decision making. However, all reports had usability and comprehension issues in these areas and could be improved. CONCLUSION: Focused usability studies can help drive our understanding of the clinical workflow for use of molecular diagnostic tests in cancer care. This in turn can have major effects on quality of care, outcomes, costs, and patient satisfaction. This study demonstrates the use of specific usability techniques (eye tracking and think-aloud protocols) to help clinical laboratories improve MDX report design in a precision oncology treatment setting.","output":"Eye-Tracking Study to Enhance Usability of Molecular Diagnostics Reports in Cancer Precision Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social workers are trained to respond to national disasters but, during the emergence of the novel Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, their traditional face-to-face methods of responding to client needs were not accessible.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the presenting signs, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of horses diagnosed with rib fracture. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHOD: The clinical records and diagnostic images of all adult horses diagnosed with a rib fracture at three referral centres over a 15-year period were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy-three horses met the inclusion criteria. Horses presented due to either resistance to ridden work and poor performance (n = 41), lameness (n = 21) or trauma (n = 7). In 4 horses the presenting complaint was not recorded. Clinical assessment and palpation localised the site of injury in 18/47 cases where recorded. Nuclear scintigraphic examination identified all fracture sites in which it was performed (59/59). In 10/24 horses radiographic examination confirmed rib fracture. Ultrasonographic examination confirmed rib fracture in 58/59 horses (98%; 95% CI 92-100%). Six horses underwent surgery due to ongoing clinical signs and non-healing fracture; all other horses were managed conservatively. Fifty-five horses were available for long term follow up (>1 year) of which 28 (51%; 95% CI 38-64%) returned to their previous level of exercise. Twelve horses did not return to their previous level of exercise due to lameness unrelated to the rib fracture and 7 horses were subjected to euthanasia, of which 3 were as a result of the rib fracture. Eight horses did not return to their previous level of exercise for other reasons. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Incomplete data set due to retrospective case series CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, rib fractures should be considered in cases of reduced performance or resistance during ridden exercise. Palpation may be unrewarding. Scintigraphy and ultrasonography are useful in identifying the fracture site.

These figures, however, do not represent the transmission capacity or behavior of asymptomatic cases. Understanding asymptomatic transmission's contribution to SARS-CoV-2 spread is of great importance to disease control and prevention. OBJECTIVE Identify the epidemiological implications of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Havana, Cuba, during the first wave of the epidemic in 2020. METHODS We carried out a cross-sectional study of all confirmed COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Havana, Cuba, from March 16 through June 30, 2020. The information was obtained through review of the standardized form for investigation of suspected and confirmed cases. Examined variables included age, sex, occupation, case type and source of infection. Cases were divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, and transmission was characterized through the creation of a contact matrix. Analysis was carried out in Epidat and R. RESULTS We studied 1287 confirmed cases, of which 57.7% (743) were asymptomatic, and 42.3% (544) were symptomatic. Symptomatic presentation was the most common for both imported and introduced cases, while asymptomatic presentation was more common in autochthonic cases and infections from an undetermined source. Asymptomatic infection was more common in groups aged ?20 and 20-59 years, while symptomatic infection was more common in those aged ?60 years. In the contact matrix, 34.6% of cases (445/1287) were not tied to other cases, and 65.4% (842/1287) were infectious-infected dyads, with symptomatic-symptomatic being the most common combination. The majority of primary cases (78.5%; 1002/1276) did not generate secondary cases, and 85.6% (658/743) of asymptomatic cases did not lead to other cases (although one asymptomatic superspreader led to 90 cases in a single event). However, 63.2% (344/544) of symptomatic primary cases generated secondary cases, and 11 symptomatic superspreaders spawned 100 secondary cases in different events. CONCLUSIONS Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was the most common form of COVID-19 in Havana during the study period, but its capacity for contagion was lower than that of symptomatic individuals. Superspreader events under specific conditions played an important role in sustaining the epidemic.","output":"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Havana, Cuba, March-June 2020: Epidemiological Implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The construction of mathematical models that allow comprehensive approach of decision-making in situations of absence of robust evidence is important.

Secondary analysis in a randomized trial of a Facebook-delivered adolescent health campaign targeting mothers with posts on HPV vaccination was undertaken with the aims of (a) determining whether the preCpost-change occurred in self-reports of the mothers on HPV vaccination of their adolescent daughters; (b) describing the comments and reactions to vaccine posts; (c) exploring the relationship of campaign engagement of the mothers assessed by their comments and reactions to posts to change in the self-reports of the mothers of HPV vaccination. Materials and Methods: Mothers of daughters aged 14C17 were recruited from 34 states of the US (n = 869). A social media campaign was delivered in two Facebook private groups that differed in that 16% of posts in one were focused on indoor tanning (IT) and 16% in the other, on prescription drug misuse, assigned by randomization. In both groups, posts promoted HPV vaccination (n = 38 posts; no randomization) and vaccination for other disease (e.g., influenza, n = 49). HPV and other vaccination posts covered the need for a vaccine, the number of adolescents vaccinated, how vaccines are decreasing the infection rates, and stories of positive benefits of being vaccinated or harms from not vaccinating. Guided by social cognitive theory and diffusion of innovations theory, posts were intended to increase knowledge, perceived risk, response efficacy (i.e., a relative advantage over not vaccinated daughters), and norms for vaccination. Some vaccination posts linked to stories to capitalize on identification effects in narratives, as explained in transportation theory. All mothers received the posts on vaccination (i.e., there was no randomization). Mothers completed surveys at baseline and 12- and 18-month follow-up to assess HPV vaccine uptake by self-report measures. Reactions (such as sad, angry) and comments to each HPV-related post were counted and coded. Results: Initiation of HPV vaccination (1 dose) was reported by 63.4% of mothers at baseline, 71.3% at 12-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001), and 73.3% at 18-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001). Completion of HPV vaccination (two or three doses) was conveyed by 50.2% of mothers at baseline, 62.5% at 12-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001), and 65.9% at 18-month posttest (pre/post p < 0.001). For posts on HPV vaccines, 8.1% of mothers reacted (n = 162 total), and 68.4% of posts received a reaction (63.2% like; 13.2% love, 7.9% sad). In addition, 7.6% of mothers commented (n = 122; 51 unfavorable, 68 favorable, 1 neutral), and 50.0% of these posts received a comment. There were no differences in preCpost change in vaccine status by the count of reactions or comments to HPV vaccine posts (Ps > 0.05). Baseline vaccination was associated with the valence of comments to HPV vaccine posts (7.2% of mothers whose daughters had completed the HPV series at baseline made a favorable comment but 7.6% of mothers whose daughters were unvaccinated made an unfavorable comment). Conclusion: Effective strategies are needed in social media to promote HPV vaccines and counter misinformation about and resistance to them. Mothers whose daughters complete the HPV vaccine course might be recruited as influencers on HPV vaccines, as they may be predisposed to talk favorably about the vaccine. Comments from mothers who have not been vaccinated should be monitored to ensure that they do not spread vaccine-critical misinformation. Study limitations included lack of randomization and control group, relatively small number of messages on HPV vaccines, long measurement intervals, inability to measure views of vaccination posts, reduced generalizability related to ethnicity and social media use, and use of self-reported vaccine status.

Alveolar Type II (TII) cells have immunomodulatory functions, but whether Type I (TI) cells, which comprise approximately 95% of the alveolar epithelium, also play a role in immunity is unknown. Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS. Alveolar TI cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat lungs that had been injured with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. PCR was performed to determine whether TI cells expressed transcripts for TNF-, IL-6, or IL-1 at baseline and after lung injury. Immunocytochemical and protein analysis detected angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACE2, as well as angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Type 2 receptor (AT2R), in TI cells. To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response.

We reviewed the impacts of Big Events with relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic on drug-related risk and harms and access to drug treatment and harm reduction services. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods literature relating to the following Big Events: respiratory infection pandemics, natural disasters, financial crises, and heroin shortages. Included studies reported data on changes to risks, harms, and/or service provisioning for people who use illicit drugs (other than cannabis) in the context of these Big Events. Searches were conducted in PubMed in May 2020, and two reviewers screened studies for inclusion. Peer-reviewed studies published in English or French were included. We used a narrative synthesis approach and mapped risk pathways identified in the literature. RESULTS: No studies reporting on respiratory infection pandemics were identified. Twelve studies reporting on natural disaster outcomes noted marked disruption to drug markets, increased violence and risk of drug-related harm, and significant barriers to service provision caused by infrastructure damage. Five studies of the 2008 global financial crisis indicated increases in the frequency of drug use and associated harms as incomes and service funding declined. Finally, 17 studies of heroin shortages noted increases in heroin price and adulteration, potentiating drug substitutions and risk behaviors, as well as growing demand for drug treatment. CONCLUSION: Current evidence reveals numerous risk pathways and service impacts emanating from Big Events. Risk pathway maps derived from this literature provide groundwork for future research and policy analyses, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the findings, we recommend responding to the pandemic with legislative and financial support for the flexible delivery of harm reduction services, opioid agonist treatment, and mental health care.","output":"A rapid review of the impacts of \\"Big Events\\" on risks, harms, and service delivery among people who use drugs: Implications for responding to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE).

To this end, we controlled the contributions from receptor binding and other host proteases, thereby attributing coronavirus entry solely or mainly to the efficiency of lysosomal proteases in activating coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion. Our results showed that lysosomal proteases from bat cells support coronavirus spike-mediated pseudovirus entry and cell-cell fusion more effectively than their counterparts from human cells. Moreover, purified lysosomal extracts from bat cells cleave cell surface-expressed coronavirus spikes more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. Overall, our study suggests that different lysosomal protease activities from different host species and tissue cells are an important determinant of the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are capable of colonizing new species, as evidenced by the recent emergence of SARS and MERS coronaviruses; they can also infect multiple tissues in the same species. Lysosomal proteases play critical roles in coronavirus entry by cleaving coronavirus surface spike proteins and activating the fusion of host and viral membranes; they also play critical roles in cell physiology by processing cellular products. How do different lysosomal protease activities from different cells impact coronavirus entry? Here, we controlled the contributions from known factors that function in coronavirus entry so that lysosomal protease activities became the only or the main determinant of coronavirus entry. Using pseudovirus entry, cell-cell fusion, and biochemical assays, we showed that lysosomal proteases from bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. Our study provides the first direct evidence supporting lysosomal proteases as a determinant of the species and tissue tropisms of coronaviruses.","output":"Lysosomal Proteases Are a Determinant of Coronavirus Tropism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic forced governments to temporarily sacrifice economic prosperity for the health and well-being of their citizens.

Patients with COVID-19 most commonly present with respiratory symptoms. However, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can also occur. We aimed to study the relationship between GI symptoms and disease prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In a single-center and retrospective cohort study, the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with or without GI symptoms were compared. The propensity score is a conditional probability of having a particular exposure (COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms vs. without GI symptoms) given a set of baseline measured covariates. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and any differences in survival were evaluated with a stratified log-rank-test. To explore the GI symptoms associated with ARDS, non-invasive ventilator treatment, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and CRRT, univariable and multivariable COX regression models were used. Results: Among 1,113 eligible patients, 359 patients with GI symptoms and 718 without GI symptoms had similar propensity scores and were included in the analyses. Patients with GI symptoms, as compared with those without GI symptoms, were associated with a similar risk of death, but with higher risks of ARDS, non-invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients, respectively.

Despite the high sensitivity of RT-PCR, not only it was reported that 20C67% of infected patients had false-negative results. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used as a point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 detection in pharyngeal and blood specimens. Its more appealing since its less time-consuming, doesnt seem to be as expensive, and doesnt need any specific training, but the poor sensitivity is the major limitation. Several reports indicated the rapid test of blood and pharyngeal samples has the same sensitivity as the RT-PCR, but some reports have lower sensitivity, especially in asymptomatic patients. METHODS: In the present survey, we investigate the eligible studies for the sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests and explore the factors that influence the result to help better diagnose COVID-19 infection. 20 studies met the inclusion criteria which imposed 33 different tests. RESULTS: Our findings showed the type of sample, the type of assay, the time of sampling, and the load of virus influence on the sensitivity of RDTs. CONCLUSION: This research extends our knowledge of how to improve the sensitivity of RDTs to better diagnose the infected patients to address the controlling COVID-19 pandemic.

CASE AND OUTCOMES: We present three cases involving the care of children who required mask fitting for noninvasive ventilation (NIV). LTV team consultations were delivered via videoconference or phone.

Regenerative therapy with alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) holds promise as an alternative option to organ transplantation. AECs are usually co-cultured with mouse-derived 3T3 feeder cells, but the use of xenogeneic tissues for regenerative therapy raises safety concerns. Fabrication of AEC sheets under feeder-free conditions would avoid these safety issues. We describe a novel feeder-free method of fabricating AEC sheets that may be suitable for pulmonary regenerative therapy. METHODS: Lung tissues excised from male outbred rats or transgenic rats expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were finely minced and dissociated with elastase. The isolated AECs were cultured under four different feeder-free conditions according to whether a rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor was included in the low-calcium medium (LCM) and whether the tissue culture dish was coated with recombinant laminin-511 E8 fragment (rLN511E8). The expanded cells were cultured on temperature-responsive dishes and subsequently harvested as AEC sheets. Engraftment of GFP-AEC sheets after their transplantation onto a partially resected region of the left lung was assessed in athymic rats. RESULTS: AECs proliferated and reached confluence when cultured in LCM containing a ROCK inhibitor on tissue culture dishes coated with rLN511E8. When both the ROCK inhibitor and rLN511E8-coated culture dish were used, the number of AECs obtained after 7 days of culture was significantly higher than that in the other three groups. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that aquaporin-5, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-C, SP-D and Axin-2 were expressed by the cultured AECs. AEC sheets were harvested successfully from temperature-responsive culture dishes (by lowering the temperature) when the expanded AECs were cultured for 7 days in LCM + ROCK inhibitor and then for 3 days in LCM + ROCK inhibitor supplemented with 200 mg/L calcium chloride. The AEC sheets were firmly engrafted 7 days after transplantation onto the lung defect and expressed AEC marker proteins. CONCLUSIONS: AEC sheets fabricated under feeder-free conditions retained the features of AECs after transplantation onto the lung in vivo. Further improvement of this technique may allow the bioengineering of alveolar-like tissue for use in pulmonary regenerative therapy.","output":"A novel alveolar epithelial cell sheet fabricated under feeder-free conditions for potential use in pulmonary regenerative therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, fewer in-person clinic visits have resulted in fewer point-of-care (POC) A1c measurements in youth with T1D.

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones. Intra-uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls (5.1 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.7 [95 % CI 1.4-45.9). Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth, none tested positive (0/108). When tested between 25 and 42 h after delivery, 4/29 (13.7 %) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases. Their risks of post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients. They also presented a higher risk of intra-uterine fetal demise.

The limited availability of highly qualified instructors and tight economic conditions complicates the delivery of these life-saving trainings. Consequently, innovative and resource-efficient approaches are needed to minimize or eliminate contagion while maintaining high training standards and managing learner anxiety related to infection risk. METHODS: In a non-inferiority trial 346 first-year medical, dentistry, and physiotherapy students underwent BLS training at AIXTRACompetence Center for Training and Patient Safety at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen. Our objectives were (1) to examine whether peer feedback BLS training supported by tele-instructors matches the learning performance of standard instructor-guided BLS training for laypersons; and (2) to minimize infection risk during BLS training. Therefore, in a parallel group design, we compared arm (1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) BLS training (Historical control group of 2019) with arm (2) a Tele-Instructor Supported Peer-Feedback (TPF) BLS training (Intervention group of 2020). Both study arms were based on Peyton's 4-step approach. Before and after each training session, objective data for BLS performance (compression depth and rate) were recorded using a resuscitation manikin. We also assessed overall BLS performance via standardized instructor evaluation and student self-reports of confidence via questionnaire. Non-inferiority margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with SIF. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. RESULTS: The results confirmed non-inferiority of TPF to SIF for all tested outcome parameters. A follow-up after 2 weeks found no confirmed COVID-19 infections among the participants. CONCLUSION: Tele-instructor supported peer feedback is a powerful alternative to in-person instructor feedback on BLS skills during a pandemic, where infection risk needs to be minimized while maximizing the quality of BLS skill learning.

With this in mind, modelling the spread of COVID-19 remains important for responding effectively. To date research has focused primarily on modelling the spread of COVID-19 on national and regional scales with just a few studies doing so on a city and sub-city scale. However, no attempts have yet been made to design and optimize a model explicitly for accurately forecasting the spread of COVID-19 at sub-city scale. This research aimed to address this research gap by developing an experimental LSTM-ANN deep learning model. The model is largely autoregressive in nature as it considers temporally lagged borough-level COVID-19 cases data from the last 9 days, but also considers temporally lagged (i) borough-level NO(2) concentration data, (ii) government stringency data, and (iii) climatic data from the last 9 days, as well as non-temporally variable borough-level urban characteristics data when modelling and forecasting the spread of the disease. The model was also encouraged to learn the spatial relationships between boroughs with regards to the spread of COVID-19 by a novel MSE-Morans I loss function. Overall, the models performance appears promising and so the model represents a useful tool for assisting the decision making and interventions of governing bodies within cities. A sensitivity analysis also indicated that of the non COVID-19 variables, the government stringency is particularly important in the modelling process, with this being closely followed by the climatic variables, the NO(2) concentration data, and finally the urban characteristics data. Additionally, the introduction of the novel MSE-Morans I loss function appeared to improve the models forecasting performance, and so this research has implications at the intersection of deep learning and disease modelling. It may also have implications within spatio-temporal forecasting more generally because such a feature may have the potential to improve forecasting in other spatio-temporal applications","output":"Borough-level COVID-19 forecasting in London using deep learning techniques and a novel MSE-Morans I loss function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Aim Psychological disorders are an important health problem worldwide. A healthy diet is recommended as one of the measures to prevent and control mental disorders. Epidemiological studies have shown important associations between the consumption of diets rich in nutrients and a lower risk of developing anxiety and depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and food consumption, according to degree of processing, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An epidemiological household survey was conducted in two cities in Brazil. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using validated scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item/Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and food consumption was assessed using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire referring to consumption within the last 3 months. The foods were categorized according to the NOVA classification for fresh/minimally processed food and ultra-processed food, using the average weekly consumption as the cutoff. For data analysis, adjusted Poisson regression with robust variance was utilized to estimate the prevalence ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods above the weekly average frequency was associated with a lower prevalence of symptoms of depression (PR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3; 0.7). Consumption above the weekly average of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety (PR: 1.5 and 95% CI: 1,03; 2,3) and depression symptoms (PR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0; 2.1, p = 0.034). Conclusion Increased consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher occurrence of depression symptoms; therefore, we recommend an increase in the consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods, as endorsed by the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population.","output":"Ultra-processed and fresh food consumption and symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID C 19 pandemic: COVID INCONFIDENTES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, like much of the rest of the world, we went into lockdown.

Public health communication during these periods, especially on social media, aims to encourage individuals to improve their health by practicing healthy behaviors. However, the management of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly influenced by misinformation. This study aimed to understand how selected demographic factors in Nigeria influenced engagement with COVID-19 pandemic information on social media. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Data on demography, information source and media consumption patterns, and information accuracy and responsibility were collected through snowballing technique and promotions through emails and social networking sites. RESULTS A total of 1127 respondents participated, 59% male, 85% aged 18C45 years, and 92.1% had an undergraduate degree or above. Most participants used social media, especially Twitter (39.4%). About 93.1% received misinformation about COVID-19, 82.9% believed social media were the primary source of inaccurate information, while 59.7% took action to verify the accuracy of the information received on protection. Most preferred Twitter, while older people preferred WhatsApp, and those with the highest education used both platforms evenly. Younger people considered international organizations most responsible for information accuracy but also highlighted individuals were also responsible. CONCLUSIONS Similar perceptions and engagement with COVID-19 pandemic information were observed across different demographic groups in Nigeria, with all groups relying significantly on social media. To ensure the availability of accurate information and appropriate responses to COVID-19 management, more meaningful social media engagement is required to reduce the risk of harmful misinformation, particularly related to vaccination. ? 2021.

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed two-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than two-fold higher rate for death as compared to White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well-documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared to White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors and health co-morbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are under-represented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on post-diagnosis economic viability for African Americans.

In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation dispatch scheme has been proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing; however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for computing and communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises server and dispatch communication system, proposes and implements a cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation continuity regardless of local infrastructure's availability and accessibility. Through its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is independent and fault-tolerant, providing grid monitoring and control capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or when operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to serverless, the burden of the server provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model.

This paper focuses on the development of a prototype of portable ventilators with remote control. These ventilators are based on the slider-crank mechanism operated remotely as well as manually. The slider-crank mechanism compresses resuscitator (AMBU bag) and delivers the compressed air to lungs through a pipe and face mask.

The range of BPM can be controlled 10-45 BPM where deliverable tidal volume is 250C750 mL. To deliver the contactless treatment to a patient and save the doctor from the disease transmission, we have developed the android application to operate ventilator remotely. Arduino-based Wi-Fi controller is used to create control over BPM. Wi-Fi controller integrates the mobile application with ventilators to establish remote and contactless control.

To limit the spread of the disease, families were typically prohibited from visiting the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the approach clinicians should take when engaging with families in times when they cannot visit the hospital. METHODS: Surrogates of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who participated in a clinical trial at a single academic center were contacted after ICU discharge to participate in a follow up study dealing with their ICU experience. Upon enrollment in this post-ICU discharge study, the subject (surrogate of the ICU patient) completed the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI) questionnaire and participated in a semi-structured telephone interview. The CCFNI questionnaire includes 14 questions dealing with aspects of the ICU experience that are important to family members. The answers to each question range from 1 (almost all the time) to 4 (none of the time), with lower scores indicating a better experience. Telephone interviews were transcribed and coded using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Of the 58 subjects enrolled from September 2020 to December 2020, 23 (40%) respective patients were deceased. Subjects of deceased patients had higher median CCFNI scores than subjects of surviving patients, reflecting greater dissatisfaction with the ICU experience (1.82 [1.45-2.00] vs 1.45 [1.27-1.72], respectively, p=0.009). Subjects recollected that they typically received at least one medical update from the patient's ICU team each day. While many subjects felt that telephone communication with the ICU team was adequate, some believed they were unable to fully understand the patient's condition. In addition, some subjects feared the patient was clinically worsening when they did not receive frequent updates, which had a negative impact on their experience. Nearly all subjects reported that visitor restrictions made the ICU experience more difficult. Some subjects believed that the medical decisions that were made and the care the patient received were negatively impacted by not having family present at the bedside. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, families of critically ill patients typically received medical updates by phone daily because they were unable to visit. These aspects of ICU care delivery had differential effects on the ICU experience of families, with more negative experiences among families of deceased patients. These data suggest that more individualized approach to family engagement is needed during times of visitor restrictions.","output":"Recollections of the intensive care unit experience among families of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient with COVID-19 who developed simultaneous pulmonary, intracardiac and peripheral arterial thrombosis.

Initial imaging revealed COVID-19 pneumonia but no pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The patient subsequently developed respiratory failure and left foot ischaemia associated with a rising D-dimer. Repeat CTPA and lower limb CT angiography revealed simultaneous bilateral PTE, biventricular cardiac thrombi and bilateral lower limb arterial occlusions. This case highlights a broad range of vascular sequalae associated with COVID-19 and the fact that these can occur despite a combination of prophylactic and treatment dose anticoagulation.","output":"COVID-19 associated with extensive pulmonary arterial, intracardiac and peripheral arterial thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, is a significant cause of the pandemic. This outbreak is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also commonly known as COVID-19. A typical symptom includes cough and fever, but a considerable number of patients can manifest gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, which can be the initial presentations and may or may not present with respiratory symptoms or fever. COVID-19 virus may be present in stool samples of patients infected with COVID-19, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for this virus, which is substantially present in GI epithelial cells. The wide availability of this receptor facilitates COVID-19 infection to be proactive and multiply in the GI tract. Although no antiviral treatments have been approved, several approaches have been proposed, and at present, optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. Elective endoscopic procedures should be delayed, but the urgent procedures should be performed as indicated.

However, the hyper-parameters of VAEs depend, to a significant extent, on artificial settings, which is regarded as a common and key problem in existing deep learning models. Additionally, its anti-noise capability may face a decline when VAE is used to analyze bearing vibration data under loud environmental noise. Therefore, in order to improve the anti-noise performance of the VAE model and adaptively select its parameters, this paper proposes an optimized stacked variational denoising autoencoder (OSVDAE) for the reliable fault diagnosis of bearings. Within the proposed method, a robust network, named variational denoising auto-encoder (VDAE), is, first, designed by integrating VAE and a denoising auto-encoder (DAE). Subsequently, a stacked variational denoising auto-encoder (SVDAE) architecture is constructed to extract the robust and discriminative latent fault features via stacking VDAE networks layer on layer, wherein the important parameters of the SVDAE model are automatically determined by employing a novel meta-heuristic intelligent optimizer known as the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA). Finally, the extracted latent features are imported into a softmax classifier to obtain the results of fault recognition in rolling bearings. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of analysis indicate that the proposed method not only can achieve a high identification accuracy for different bearing health conditions, but also outperforms some representative deep learning methods.","output":"Reliable Fault Diagnosis of Bearings Using an Optimized Stacked Variational Denoising Auto-Encoder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are the spectrum of severe epilepsies characterized by early-onset, refractory seizures occurring in the context of developmental regression or plateauing. Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) is one of the earliest forms of DEE, manifesting as frequent epileptic spasms and characteristic electroencephalogram findings in early infancy. In recent years, next-generation sequencing approaches have identified a number of monogenic determinants underlying DEE. In the case of EIEE, 85 genes have been registered in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man as causative genes. Model organisms are indispensable tools for understanding the in vivo roles of the newly identified causative genes. In this review, we first present an overview of epilepsy and its genetic etiology, especially focusing on EIEE and then briefly summarize epilepsy research using animal and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. The Drosophila model, which is characterized by easy gene manipulation, a short generation time, low cost and fewer ethical restrictions when designing experiments, is optimal for understanding the genetics of DEE.

However, their efficacy is threatened by new adversarial attacks, whereby malware attempts to evade detection, e.g., by performing feature-space manipulation. In this work, we propose an explainability-guided and model-agnostic framework for measuring the efficacy of malware detectors when confronted with adversarial attacks. The framework introduces the concept of Accrued Malicious Magnitude (AMM) to identify which malware features should be manipulated to maximize the likelihood of evading detection. We then use this framework to test several state-of-the-art malware detectors' ability to detect manipulated malware. We find that (i) commercial antivirus engines are vulnerable to AMM-guided manipulated samples; (ii) the ability of a manipulated malware generated using one detector to evade detection by another detector (i.e., transferability) depends on the overlap of features with large AMM values between the different detectors; and (iii) AMM values effectively measure the importance of features and explain the ability to evade detection.

That is because, in todays rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy efficiency has become a greater field of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To fill this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboards goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most profit. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy efficiency, we have chosen that to be our dashboards goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system.

The disease has been expanding rapidly with a high variety of phenotypes from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, multiple organ system dysfunction, and death. Neurological manifestations also appear in patients with COVID-19, such as headache, seizures, a decrease of consciousness, and paralysis. The hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is associated with the thromboembolic incident including ischemic strokes, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary artery embolism, and many further. Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is a rare neurovascular emergency that is often found in critically ill patients. We report two cases of CSVT with different onsets, neurologic manifestations, and prognoses. CASE PRESENTATION: Two cases of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis in COVID-19 patients were reported, following respiratory, hematology, and coagulation disarrangements, which was triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The first patient, which was presented with a seizure, had hypertension and diabetes mellitus as comorbidities. The latter case had no comorbidity but showed more severe presentations of COVID-19 such as brain and lung thrombosis, although already had several days of intravenous anticoagulant administrations. These two cases also have a different course of disease and outcomes, which were interesting topics to study. CONCLUSIONS: CSVT is one of the neurological complications of the COVID-19 when the brainstem venous drainage is involved. Despite successful alteration to the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 through the rt-PCR test, thrombogenesis and coagulation cascade continuing. Therefore, a high level of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) are paramount indicators of poor prognosis.","output":"Case reports of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused more than 52.775.271 million confirmed cases, 1.293.106 deaths, globally, and afflicted 208 countries, areas, or territories; and almost three months have passed since the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.

However, most HIV-positive persons initiate ART when their CD4 count decreases below 500  109 cells/L. Consequences of delayed ART on risk for non-AIDS-defining and AIDS-defining cancer, one of the most common reasons for death in HIV, are unclear. OBJECTIVE To estimate the long-term risk difference for cancer with the immediate ART strategy. DESIGN Multinational prospective cohort study. SETTING The D:A:D (Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs) study, which included HIV-positive persons from Europe, Australia, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS 8318 HIV-positive persons with at least 1 measurement each of CD4 cell count and viral load while ART-naive (study period, 2006 to 2016). MEASUREMENTS The parametric g-formula was used, with adjustment for baseline and time-dependent confounders (CD4 cell count and viral load), to assess the 10-year risk for non-AIDS-defining and AIDS-defining cancer of immediate versus deferred (at CD4 counts <350 and <500  109 cells/L) ART initiation strategies. RESULTS During 64 021 person-years of follow-up, 231 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer and 272 of AIDS-defining cancer occurred among HIV-positive persons with a median age of 36 years (interquartile range, 29 to 43 years). With immediate ART, the 10-year risk for non-AIDS-defining cancer was 2.97% (95% CI, 2.37% to 3.50%) and that for AIDS-defining cancer was 2.50% (CI, 2.37% to 3.38%). Compared with immediate ART initiation, the 10-year absolute risk differences when deferring ART to CD4 counts less than 500  109 cells/L and less than 350  109 cells/L were 0.12 percentage point (CI, -0.01 to 0.26 percentage point) and 0.29 percentage point (CI, -0.03 to 0.73 percentage point), respectively, for non-AIDS-defining cancer and 0.32 percentage point (CI, 0.21 to 0.44 percentage point) and 1.00 percentage point (CI, 0.67 to 1.44 percentage points), respectively, for AIDS-defining cancer. LIMITATION Potential residual confounding due to observational study design. CONCLUSION In this young cohort, effects of immediate ART on 10-year risk for cancer were small, and further supportive data are needed for non-AIDS-defining cancer.

While IGF1R signaling is implicated in myogenesis and muscle lipid metabolism, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the regulation of IGF1R by miR-100 during bovine muscle satellite cell (BMSC) myogenesis and lipid deposition. MiR-100 was confirmed to target the IGF1R 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) by luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, expression of miR-100 and IGF1R was reciprocal during BMSC differentiation, suggesting a crosstalk between the two. Correspondingly, miR-100 mimic (agomiR) suppressed the levels of IGF1R, PI3K/AKT pathway signaling, myogenic gene MYOG, muscle structural components MYH7 and MYH8, whereas the inhibitor (antagomiR) had no clear stimulating effects. The IGF1R inhibitor (BMS-754807) curtailed receptor levels and triggered atrophy in muscle myotubes but did not influence miR-100 expression. AgomiR increased oleic acid-induced lipid deposition in BMSC myotubes supporting its involvement in intramuscular fat deposition, while antagomiR had no effect. Moreover, mitochondrial beta-oxidation and long-chain fatty acid synthesis-related genes were modulated by agomiR addition.

Psychotropic drugs are often prescribed to manage responsive behaviours but contravene guidance as they increase the rate of strokes and death in people with dementia (Gustafsson et al., 2013). However, the use of psychotropic drugs for behaviour management may potentially increase during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic (Howard et al., 2020). Therefore, it is imperative to understand how responsive behaviours are managed to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing non\\\\pharmacological approaches. METHOD: During the Covid\\\\19 pandemic, 25 interviews were conducted with managers, nurses and care assistants from 21 care homes across Ireland. All participants provided written informed consent. Themes emerging from thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) conceptualised understanding of how care home staff managed responsive behaviours during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Ethics approval was obtained from Lancaster University Faculty of Health and Medicine Research Ethics Committee (FHMREC20099). RESULT: Residents with dementia were perceived to be more depressed during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic due to the absence of family visits. However, care home staff reported that psychotropic drugs were not used more frequently for behaviour management than before the pandemic and that a person\\\\centred care approach was taken which involved supporting residents to participate in activities in smaller groups. Maintaining adequate staffing levels was challenging due to recruitment of nurses and care assistants from private care homes to acute public hospitals during the pandemic. Moreover, psychiatry and mental health support were difficult to access in rural regions of Ireland during COVID\\\\19 restrictions. Another emerging theme demonstrated that care assistants rarely contributed to equitable decision\\\\making, posing a barrier to implementing non\\\\pharmacological strategies to manage responsive behaviours. CONCLUSION: This study recommends that care homes should be prioritised in public health planning for Covid\\\\19, particularly to ensure optimal staffing levels and access to mental health support. In addition, care assistants should be provided with opportunities to contribute to decision\\\\making including case conferences. These recommendations will inform development of Department of Health policy and dementia care guidelines to facilitate implementation of non\\\\pharmacological strategies to manage responsive behaviours in dementia.","output":"Managing responsive behaviours of care home residents with dementia during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How is China viewed by citizens of other countries?

Methods: Adult patients admitted to Naval Medical Center Portsmouth with the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were eligible for enrollment. TEG was performed on admission and trended daily with other laboratory tests through the hospitalization. Charts were reviewed for demographic, medical history, daily progress notes, clinical status, lab values, and anticoagulation medication use for each patient. Treatment teams were blinded to TEG values. Results: A total of 53 patients were enrolled, with three patients having two separate admissions. There were 31 males and 22 females with a mean age of 48. The preponderance of individual TEG components showed progression towards hypercoagulation as days of illness progressed, with 92% of subjects having at least one TEG value outside the reference range, even with the vast majority of patients receiving either therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulants. The maximum amplitude (MA) and TEG coagulation indexes (CI) best correlated with day of illness (r = 0.45 and r = 0.32, respectively). Peak CI also correlated with length of hospital stay (r = 0.38).

To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Methods Participants were Australians aged 18 + years that were employed in paid work prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey from 27(th) March to 12(th) June 2020 as part of a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Outcome measures include Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score < = 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results The cohort consisted of 2,603 respondents, including groups who had lost their job (N = 541), were not working but remained employed (N = 613), were working less (N = 660), and whose work was unaffected (N = 789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 2.22C3.66), poor mental (AOR = 1.78C2.27) and physical health (AOR = 2.10C2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 5.43C8.36), poor mental (AOR = 1.92C4.53) and physical health (AOR = 1.93C3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources.

This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the epidemic's time-course, forecasted health care needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions. Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12 750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak. Conclusions: Use of modeling and forecasting to guide the national response proved to be a successful strategy, reducing the toll of the epidemic to a manageable level for the health care system.","output":"Mathematical modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Qatar and its impact on the national response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, now more than ever, remote solutions for assessing and monitoring individuals with cognitive impairment are urgently needed. Older adults in particular, living in isolated rural areas or so-called 'medical deserts', are facing major difficulties in getting access to diagnosis and care. Telemedical approaches to assessments are promising and seem well accepted, reducing the burden of bringing patients to specialized clinics. However, many older adults are not yet adequately equipped to allow for proper implementation of this technology. A potential solution could be a mobile unit in the form of a van, equipped with the telemedical system which comes to the patients' home. The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of such mobile unit settings for remote cognitive testing. Methods and analysis: eight participants (aged between 69 and 86 years old) from the city of Digne-Les-Bains volunteered for this study. A basic neuropsychological assessment, including a short clinical interview, is administered in two conditions, by telemedicine in a mobile clinic (equipped van) at a participants' home and face to face in a specialized clinic. The administration procedure order is randomized, and the results are compared with each other. Acceptability and user experience are assessed among participants and clinicians in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Measurements of stress indicators were collected for comparison. RESULTS: The analysis revealed no significant differences in test results between the two administration procedures. Participants were, overall, very satisfied with the mobile clinic experience and found the use of the telemedical system relatively easy. CONCLUSION: A mobile unit equipped with a telemedical service could represent a solution for remote cognitive testing overcoming barriers in rural areas to access specialized diagnosis and care.","output":"Pilot Study to Assess the Feasibility of a Mobile Unit for Remote Cognitive Screening of Isolated Elderly in Rural Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize the electrophysiological features and plasma biomarkers of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIN) and myopathy (CIM) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW). METHODS: An observational ICU cohort study including adult patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, from March 13th to June 8th 2020. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological and plasma biomarker data between COVID-19 patients who developed CIN/CIM and those who did not. Electrophysiological characteristics were also compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients. RESULTS: 111 COVID-19 patients were included, 11 of whom developed CIN/CIM. Patients with CIN/CIM had more severe illness; longer ICU stay, more thromboembolic events and were more frequently treated with invasive ventilation for longer than 2 weeks. In particular CIN was more frequent among COVID-19 patients with ICUAW (50%) compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort (0%, p = 0.008). Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) levels were higher in the CIN/CIM group compared with those that did not develop CIN/CIM (both p = 0.001) and correlated with nerve amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS: CIN/CIM was more prevalent among COVID-19 ICU patients with severe illness. SIGNIFICANCE: COVID-19 patients who later developed CIN/CIM had significantly higher NfL and GFAp in the early phase of ICU care, suggesting their potential as predictive biomarkers for CIN/CIM.","output":"Critical illness polyneuropathy, myopathy and neuronal biomarkers in COVID-19 patients: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) is characterized by chronic progressive degeneration of the joint cartilage, with high prevalence. Patients present with pain at the base of the thumb, morning stiffness, and muscle weakness, symptoms that affect hand function and therefore interfere in activities and social participation. Movements that involve grip or lateral pinch are the most affected and directly impact independence, self-care, and leisure activities. In the literature consulted, several protocols with exercises for these patients were found. However, most do not compare the same intervention modality and only provide basic methodological information, with no consistent information on training load and load progression. In addition, most protocols only address the strengthening of the abductor and extensor thumb muscles and pinching or grasping exercises. However, some biomechanical and electromyographic studies have demonstrated the important role of the first dorsal interosseous muscles as stabilizers of the thumb carpometacarpal joint. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, and parallel clinical trial that will include 56 participants, over 40 years old, with radiographic evidence of thumb base osteoarthritis. Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: control and intervention. The following evaluations will be conducted: the Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, Nine-Hole Peg Test, grip and pinch strength associated with muscle activation assessment, and Bilateral Upper Limb Function Test at four different times: baseline, session 13, session 18, and follow-up. Treatment will take place over 6 weeks, with reassessments in the fourth and sixth weeks and 3 months after the end of the intervention (follow-up). Qualitative variables will be expressed as frequency and percentage, and quantitative variables as mean and standard deviation. Intergroup comparison of the intervention will be performed by repeated measures ANOVA, considering the effect of the two groups and four assessments, and interactions between them. DISCUSSION: This study will demonstrate whether the specific strengthening of the first dorsal interosseous muscle has a superior and positive effect on the clinical picture of patients with CMC OA. Additionally, if specific strengthening of the muscle is not superior to the traditional protocol in the literature, it will also be determined whether the two protocols are equivalent in terms of the best clinical picture.

A total of 31 inpatients with suspected COVID-19 were identified at our hospital. The depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) mental health self-assessment questionnaire were used to assess depression, anxiety, and overall mental health. Among the patients, 32.3% had symptoms of depression and 19.4% had symptoms of anxiety. Levels of anxiety and fear varied. In comparing the PHQ-9 and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale scores of suspected and confirmed patients, there was no significant difference in the distribution of severity of anxiety or depression in the 2 groups. The PHQ-9 scores indicated mild depression symptoms in 25.8% of suspected patients, moderate symptoms in 0%, and severe symptoms in 6.5%. Overall, 50% of confirmed patients had symptoms, with 30.8% classified as mild, 15.4% classified as moderate, and 3.8% classified as severe. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale scores in the group of suspected patients showed that 9.7% had mild symptoms, 0% had moderate symptoms, and 9.7% had severe symptoms. In the group of confirmed patients, 38.4% had symptoms (34.6% mild, 0% moderate, and 3.8% severe). Diagnosed patients had more visible symptoms of depression and different total PHQ-9 scores. During the COVID-19 epidemic, suspected and diagnosed patients had different levels of mental health problems. Diagnosed patients had more visible symptoms. The performance of suspected patients was higher, but their mental state was more polarized. It may thus be important to monitor the psychological state of suspected patients as early as possible to enable timely interventions that promote psychological rehabilitation.","output":"Investigation of the psychological status of suspected patients during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To examine the general publics views around willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines and concerns regarding their safety.

Main outcomes measures: The proportion of adults reporting: willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination; concern regarding side-effects from vaccinations; concerns over contraction COVID-19, and beliefs around vaccine provision in their country. Changes between the November and January surveys are also reported. Results: Across the 15 countries, the proportion of respondents reporting they would have the COVID-19 vaccine increased from 40.7% (range: 25.0-55.1) to 55.2% (range: 34.8-77.5), proportion reporting worried about the side-effects of vaccine decreased from 53.3% (range: 42.1-66.7) to 47.9% (range: 28.0-66.1). On the second survey, willingness to receive vaccine remained low in females (49.4%, range: 30.2-79.1), aged 18-39 years (42.1%, range: 25.9-71.7), those not working or unemployed (48.9, range: 18.8-67.0), students (45.9%, range: 22.8-70.0), and those with children at home (46.5%, range: 32.4-68.9). Concerns regarding safety of vaccine remained high in females (53.7%, range: 31.8-70.4), aged 18-39 years (50.8%, range: 28.2-60.7), aged 40-64 years (51.3%, range: 30.7-68.5), those working (50.5%, range: 26.7-65.0), those not working or unemployed (53.3, range: 35.4-73.8) and those with children at home (55.8%, range: 36.5-64.7).

Pol  expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this elementthe anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNACprotein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol  mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer.

Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is modest, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference.

The purpose of our study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 who present to a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) with an emphasis on addressing institutional adaptations to rapidly changing medical evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study conducted on a prospectively maintained cohort. The MTF is a 52-bed hospital within an urban setting. Patients were included in the cohort if they had laboratory-confirmed severe or life-threatening COVID-19 with positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Severe disease was defined as dyspnea, respiratory frequency &#8805;30/min, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on ambient air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, or lung infiltrates involving >50% of lung fields within 24-48 hours. Life-threatening COVID-19 was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction. The cohort included patients admitted from June 1 through November 13. Data were collected retrospectively via chart review by a resident physician. RESULTS: In total, our MTF saw 14 cases of severe or life-threatening COVID-19 from June 1 to November 13. Patients had a median age of 70.5 years, with 7% being active duty personnel, 21% dependents, and 71% retired military members.

Here, we investigated the possibility that perception may reflect embedded statistical knowledge of physical interaction between objects for specific combinations of displays and layouts. We used a novel display with two ambiguously rotating gears and an ambiguous walker-on-a-ball display. Both stimuli produce a physically congruent perception when an interaction is possible (i.e., gears counterrotate, and the ball rolls under the walkers feet). Next, we gradually manipulated the stimuli to either introduce abrupt changes to the potential physical interaction between objects or keep it constant despite changes in the visual stimulus. We characterized the data using four different models that assumed (1) independence of perception of the stimulus, (2) dependence on the stimuluss properties, (3) dependence on physical configuration alone, and (4) an interaction between stimulus properties and a physical configuration. We observed that for the ambiguous gears, the perception was correlated with the stimulus changes rather than with the possibility of physical interaction. The perception of walker-on-a-ball was independent of the stimulus but depended instead on whether participants responded about a relative motion of two objects (perception was biased towards physically congruent motion) or the absolute motion of the walker alone (perception was independent of the rotation of the ball). None of the two experiments supported the idea of embedded knowledge of physical interaction.

Furthermore, platinum coils cause strong beam-hardening artifacts, hampering subsequent image analyses. OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of flow-diverting, stent-assisted microsphere embolization of fusiform and sidewall aneurysms in vitro and in vivo. METHODS Using a recirculating pulsatile in vitro flow model, 5 different aneurysm geometries (inner/outer curve, narrow/wide neck, and fusiform) were treated (each n = 1) by flow-diverting stent (FDS) implantation and subsequent embolization through a jailed microcatheter using calibrated microspheres (500-900 m) larger than the pores of the FDS mesh. Treatment effects were analyzed angiographically and by micro computed tomography. The fluid of the in vitro model was filtered to ensure that no microspheres evaded the aneurysm. The experiment was repeated once in vivo. RESULTS In vitro, all 5 aneurysms were safely and completely occluded by FDS-assisted microsphere embolization. Virtually complete aneurysm occlusion was confirmed by angiography and micro computed tomography. No microspheres escaped into the circulation. The experiment was successfully repeated in 1 pig with a sidewall aneurysm generated by vessel occlusion. An embolic protection system placed distally of the FDS in vitro and in vivo (each n = 1) contained no microspheres after the embolization. Thus, no microspheres were lost in the circulation, and the use of an embolic protection system seems feasible to provide additional safety. CONCLUSION FDS-assisted microsphere embolization of fusiform and sidewall aneurysms is feasible and yields virtually complete aneurysm occlusion while avoiding coil-associated beam-hardening artifacts.","output":"Feasibility, Safety, and Efficacy of Flow-Diverting Stent-Assisted Microsphere Embolization of Fusiform and Sidewall Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive mold infections (IMIs) are difficult to diagnose.

The advantage of molecular protein or gene expression (mRNA) marker lies in their capability for early (1-3 day after irradiation), high-throughput and point-of-care diagnosis, required for the prediction of the acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in radiological or nuclear scenarios. These molecular marker in most cases respond differently regarding exposure characteristics such as e.g. radiation quality, dose, dose rate and most importantly over time. Changes over time are in particular challenging and demand certain strategies to deal with. With this review, we provide an overview and will focus on already identified and used mRNA gene expression and protein markers of the peripheral blood related to the ARS. These molecules are examined in light of \\"ideal\\" characteristics of a biomarkers (e.g. easy accessible, early response, signal persistency) and the validation degree. Finally, we present strategies on the use of these markers considering challenges as their variation over time and future developments regarding e.g. origin of samples, point of care and high-throughput diagnosis.","output":"Early molecular markers for retrospective biodosimetry and prediction of acute health effects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pneumonia is the leading cause of hospital admission and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), attributed to a cytokine storm. The objective of our study is to characterize this profile to identify the cytokines responsible for lung damage and mortality. Methods: : Plasma samples of 108 prospectively recruited COVID-19 patients were collected between March and April 2020. Patients were divided into four groups according to the severity of respiratory symptoms: 34 mild (no oxygen support), 26 moderate (low oxygen support using nasal cannula), 16 severe (high oxygen support) and 32 critical (mechanical ventilation). A 45-plex Human XL Cytokine Luminex Performance Panel kit was used in duplicate for each plasma sample. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were used for normalization of the results. Results: Multiple cytokines showed statistically significant differences when comparing mild and critical patients (HGF, PDGFBB, PIGF-1, IL-1, MCP-1, VEGFA, IL-15 and IL-2). The best multivariable model included HGF, IL-1, IL-2 and IL-27. High HGF levels were associated with the critical group (OR = 3.51;p < 0.001;95%CI = 1.95C6.33). Moreover, high IL-1 (OR = 1.36;p = 0.01;95%CI = 1.07C1.73) and low IL-27 (OR = 0.58;p < 0.005;95%CI = 0.39C0.85) greatly increased the risk of ending up in the severe group. This model was especially sensitive in order to predict critical status (AUC = 0.794;specificity = 69.74%;sensitivity = 81.25%). Furthermore, high levels of HGF and IL-1 showed significant results in the survival analysis ( p = 0.033 and p = 0.011, respectively). Conclusions: : Our study showed that HGF, IL-1 and IL 27 at hospital admission were strongly associated with severe/critical COVID-19 patients and therefore are excellent predictors of bad prognosis.

Adaption of additive manufacturing strategy to electrospinning permits precise fiber deposition and predefining pattern construction. This manuscript critically presents the potential of electrospun nanofibers in healthcare applications. Research community drew impetus from the similarity of electrospun nanofibers to the morphology and mechanical properties of fibrous extracellular matrices (ECM) of natural human tissues. Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds act as ECM analogs for specific tissue cells, stem cells, and tumor cells to realize tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, and in vitro tumor model construction. The large surface-to-volume ratio of electrospun nanofibers offers a considerable number of bioactive agents binding sites, which makes it a promising candidate for a number of biomedical applications. The applications of electrospinning in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, controlled drug delivery, biosensors, and cancer diagnosis are elaborated.

METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis who underwent CCY versus PC were reviewed from the U.S. Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2008-2014. Measured variables including age, race/ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), hospital type/region, insurance payer, household income, length of stay (LOS), hospital cost, and mortality were compared using chi-square and ANOVA. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify specific predictors of cholecystitis treatment. RESULTS A total of 1,492,877 patients (CCY:n=1,435,255 versus PC:n=57,622) were analyzed. The majority of patients that received PC were at urban teaching hospitals (65.2%). LOS was significantly longer with higher associated costs for PC [(11.111.0 versus 4.55.3 days; P<0.001) and ($99577138850 versus $4839958330; P<0.001)]. Mortality was also increased for patients that received PC compared to CCY (8.8% versus 0.6%; P<0.001). Multivariable regression demonstrated multiple socioeconomic and healthcare-related factors influencing the utilization of PC including male gender, Black or Asian race/ethnicity, Medicare payer status, urban hospital location, and household income (all P<0.001).

Across the tree of life, there is extensive variation in age-specific performance and changes to key life-history traits. These changes occur on a spectrum from classic senescence, where performance declines with age, to juvenescence, where performance improves with age. Reproduction, mortality, and immune function are also important factors influencing the spread of infectious disease, yet there exists no comprehensive investigation into how the aging spectrum of these traits impacts epidemics. We used a model laboratory infection system to compile an aging profile of a single organism, including traits directly linked to pathogen susceptibility and those that should indirectly alter pathogen transmission by influencing demography. We then developed generalizable epidemiological models demonstrating that different patterns of aging produce dramatically different transmission landscapes: in many cases, aging can reduce the probability of epidemics, but it can also promote severity. This work provides context and tools for use across taxa by empiricists, demographers, and epidemiologists, advancing our ability to accurately predict factors contributing to epidemics or the potential repercussions of senescence manipulation.","output":"Pathogen Dynamics across the Diversity of Aging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Diagnosis of lung cancer at advanced stages can result in missed treatment opportunities, worse outcomes, and higher health care costs.

Use of diagnostic tests and time to diagnosis were examined. The rates of health care utilization and per-patient per-month (PPPM) health care costs were calculated. RESULTS A total of 1,210 patients with NSCLC were included in the analysis. Most patients (93.6%) had evidence of diagnostic tests beginning 5 to 6 months prior to diagnosis, and most were diagnosed at an advanced stage (23% Stage IIIb and 46% Stage IV). The PPPM total health care costs in USD pre- and postdiagnosis were $2,407$3,364 (meanstandard deviation) and $16,577$33,550, respectively. PPPM total health care costs and utilization after lung cancer diagnosis were significantly higher among patients diagnosed at Stage IV disease and lowest among patients diagnosed at Stage I disease ($7,239 Stage I, $9,484 Stage II, $11,193 Stage IIIa, $17,415 Stage IIIb, and $21,441 Stage IV). CONCLUSION This study showed that most patients experienced long periods of delay between their first diagnostic test for lung cancer and a definitive diagnosis, and the majority were diagnosed at advanced stages of disease. Costs associated with the management of lung cancer increased substantially with higher stages at diagnosis. Procedures that diagnose lung cancer at earlier stages may allow for less resource use and costs among patients with lung cancer.","output":"A retrospective analysis of delays in the diagnosis of lung cancer and associated costs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis catheter embedment consists of implanting the catheter far in advance of anticipated need, with the external tubing buried under the skin. The catheter is externalized when initiation of dialysis is required. Details of the surgical procedure and management of associated complications are generally lacking. METHODS A total of 84 catheters including conventional and extended catheters were embedded and externalized during the study period. Factors influencing duration of embedment, functionality upon externalization, and long-term outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Mean duration of embedment was 13.9 months (median 9.4; range .5 to 68.5). Immediate function was exhibited in 85.7% of catheters. Employing laparoscopic revision, 98.8% of embedded catheters were successfully used for peritoneal dialysis. Extended catheters and duration of embedment were important determinants of catheter functionality. CONCLUSIONS Catheters can be embedded for prolonged periods and still result in functional dialysis access when needed.

Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are based on mRNA and lipid nanoparticles requiring low temperature storage. The Pfizer vaccine requires ultra-low temperature storage (between ?80C and ?60C), while the Moderna vaccine requires ?30C storage. Pfizer has designed a reusable package for transportation and storage that can keep the vaccine at the target temperature for 10 days. However, the last stage of distribution is quite challenging, especially for rural or suburban areas, where local towns, pharmacy chains and hospitals may not have the infrastructure required to store the vaccine. Also, the need for a large amount of ultra-low temperature refrigeration equipment in a short time period creates tremendous pressure on the equipment suppliers. In addition, there is limited data available to address ancillary challenges of the distribution framework for both transportation and storage stages. As such, there is a need for a quick, effective, secure, and safe solution to mitigate the challenges faced by vaccine distribution logistics. The study proposes an effective, secure, and safe ultra-low temperature refrigeration solution to resolve the vaccine distribution last mile challenge. The approach is to utilize commercially available products, such as refrigeration container units, and retrofit them to meet the vaccine storage temperature requirement. Both experimental and simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the technical merits of this solution with the ability to control temperature at ?30C or ?70C as part of the last mile supply chain for vaccine candidates.","output":"COVID 19 vaccine distribution solution to the last mile challenge: experimental and simulation studies of ultra-low temperature refrigeration system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute IH is a common surgical presentation. Despite new guidelines being published recently, a number of important questions remained unanswered including the role of taxis, as initial non-operative management. This is particularly relevant now due to the possibility of a lack of immediate surgical care as a result of COVID-19. The aim of this review is to assess the role of taxis in the management of emergency inguinal hernias. METHODS: A review of the literature was undertaken. Available literature published until March 2019 was obtained and reviewed. 32,021 papers were identified, only 9 were of sufficient value to be used. RESULTS: There was a large discrepancy in the terminology of incarcerated/strangulated used. Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients. The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind. Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged. CONCLUSIONS: The use of taxis in emergency inguinal hernia is a useful first line of treatment in areas or situations where surgical care is not immediately available, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

We examined their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine and implemented an intervention to increase vaccination uptake. DESIGN: Before-and-after trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Healthcare personnel at a 790-bed tertiary-care center in Tokyo, Japan. INTERVENTIONS: A prevaccination questionnaire was administered to HCP to examine their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine. A multifaceted intervention was then implemented involving (1) distribution of informational leaflets to all HCP, (2) hospital-wide announcements encouraging vaccination, (3) a mandatory lecture, (4) an educational session about the vaccine for pregnant or breastfeeding HCP, and (5) allergy testing for HCP at risk of allergic reactions to the vaccine. A postvaccination survey was also performed. RESULTS: Of 1,575 HCP eligible for enrollment, 1,224 (77.7%) responded to the questionnaire, 533 (43.5%) expressed willingness to be vaccinated, 593 (48.4%) were uncertain, and 98 (8.0%) expressed unwillingness to be vaccinated. The latter 2 groups were concerned about the vaccine's safety rather than its efficacy. After the intervention, the overall vaccination rate reached 89.7% (1,413 of 1,575), and 88.9% (614 of 691) of the prevaccination survey respondents answered \\"unwilling\\" to or \\"unsure\\" about eventually receiving a vaccination.

METHODS We screened 12,778 participants at high risk of type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). People with screen-detected type 2 diabetes were randomised in a parallel, three-arm, controlled trial with up to 46 months of follow-up, with a control arm (CON), a group-based lifestyle intervention of 6 core and up to 15 maintenance sessions (INT), or the same intervention with additional support from volunteers with type 2 diabetes trained to co-deliver the lifestyle intervention (INT-DPM). The pre-specified primary end point was mean HbA1c compared between groups at 12 months. RESULTS We randomised 432 participants (CON 149; INT 142; INT-DPM 141) with a mean (SD) age of 63.5 (10.0) years, body mass index (BMI) of 32.4 (6.4) kg/m2, and HbA1c of 52.5 (10.2) mmol/mol. The primary outcome of mean HbA1c at 12 months (CON 48.5 (9.1) mmol/mol, INT 46.5 (8.1) mmol/mol, and INT-DPM 45.6 (6.0) mmol/mol) was significantly lower in the INT-DPM arm compared to CON (adjusted difference -2.57 mmol/mol; 95% CI -4.5, -0.6; p = 0.007) but not significantly different between the INT-DPM and INT arms (-0.55 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.46, 1.35; p = 0.57), or INT vs CON arms (-2.14 mmol/mol; 95% CI -4.33, 0.05; p = 0.07). Subgroup analyses showed the intervention had greater effect in participants < 65 years old (difference in mean HbA1c compared to CON -4.76 mmol/mol; 95% CI -7.75, -1.78 mmol/mol) than in older participants (-0.46 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.67, 1.75; interaction p = 0.02). This effect was most significant in the INT-DPM arm (-6.01 mmol/mol; 95% CI -9.56, -2.46 age < 65 years old and -0.22 mmol/mol; 95% CI -2.7, 2.25; aged > 65 years old; p = 0.007).

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

Visual search is also used in professional contexts, such as medical diagnostic imaging and airport baggage screening. These contexts are often characterised by low-prevalence or rare targets. Here we tested whether individual differences in the detection of targets in visual search could be predicted from variables derived from the rich informational source of participants' subjective experience of their cognitive and attentional function in everyday life. We tested this in both low-prevalence (Experiment 1) and high-prevalence (Experiment 2) visual search conditions. In both experiments, participants completed a visual search with arrays containing multiple photorealistic objects, and their task was to detect the presence of a gun. Following this, they completed the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and the Attentional Control Scale (ACS). In Experiment 1, the target was present on 2% of trials, while in Experiment 2, it was present on 50%. In both experiments, participants' scores on the False Triggering component of the CFQ were negatively associated with accuracy on target-present trials, while participants' scores on the Forgetfulness component of the CFQ were positively associated with target-present accuracy.

The V2 T-cells expansion and their cytotoxic activity against ZIKV-infected cells were tested in vitro and analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We found that ZIKV infection was able to induce V2 T-cells expansion and sensitized A549 cells to V2-mediated killing.

There was no significant effect in immune indexes (IgA, IgG, and IgM) among different treatments after weaning at 6 weeks for piglets (p > 0.10). The 16S rRNA sequencing of ileal and cecal microbiota revealed that only the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota at the phyla level was significantly greater in the ileum of the A group compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05). There was a clear effect on seven bacteria in the top 30 genera of ileum and cecum for five groups (p < 0.05). The result of PICRUSt predicted that the intestinal microbe was mainly involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, membrane transport, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. Besides, adding calcium citrate to a weaned piglet diet is better than other choices from the third week to the fourth week. In conclusion, diets with different calcium sources changed ADFI and some intestinal microbial composition of weaned piglets but had little effect on intestinal microbial function.","output":"Effects of Different Sources of Calcium in the Diet on Growth Performance, Blood Metabolic Parameters, and Intestinal Bacterial Community and Function of Weaned Piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, WHO declared a global public health emergency due to the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As many of the special needs population live in a communal environment, they were at higher risk of being infected with and dying from COVID-19. Consequently, their access to medical and dental services was limited to emergency care. A method of reaching these populations evolved by the expansion of telehealth, including dentistry, to provide diagnosis, management, prevention, and provision of psychosocial support for patients. When dental care was resumed, many changes were adopted, including improved air filtration using UV light and EPA filters, enhanced PPE, and surface disinfection.

The purpose of this study was to compare risks of hospitalization of Black and non-Black COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department and, of those hospitalized, to compare mortality and acute kidney injury. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 831 adult COVID-19 patients (68.5% Black) who presented to the emergency departments of four academic hospitals, March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020. The primary outcome was risk of hospitalization among Blacks vs. non-Blacks. Secondary outcomes were mortality and acute kidney injury, among hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The crude odds of hospitalization were not different in Black vs. non-Black patients; however, with adjustment for age, Blacks had 55% higher odds of hospitalization. Mortality differed most in the model adjusted for age alone. Acute kidney injury was more common in the Black hospitalized patients, regardless of adjustment. Stratified analyses suggested that disparities in the risk of hospitalization and of in-hospital acute kidney injury were highest in the youngest patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that Black and non-Black patients presenting to the emergency department with COVID-19 had similar risks of hospitalization and, of those who were hospitalized, similar mortality when adjusted for multiple factors. Blacks had higher risk of acute kidney injury. Our results suggest that examination of disparities without exploration of the individual effects of age and comorbidities may mask important patterns. While stratified analyses suggest that disparities in outcomes may differ substantially by age and comorbid conditions, further exploration among these important subgroups is needed to better target interventions to reduce disparities in COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","output":"Age, Comorbid Conditions, and Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in people with pre-existing mental health disorders is unclear. In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. METHODS: Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006-16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. FINDINGS: The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose-response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. INTERPRETATION: People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

For instance, more than 200 million people are estimated to have died due to Black Death (bubonic plague) alone. This situation has not changed in near history either. Diseases such as influenza, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as today, have emerged and threatened the modern human life. The common feature of these diseases can be listed as having a high risk of infection and transmission, rapidly spreading to large areas, and having high mortality rates and causing permanent damage to the body because of the low immunity profile of the exposed population. If the number of cases increases rapidly for these diseases, the capacity of healthcare services can be exceeded and healthcare services can be threatened as well. These characteristics of pandemic diseases force the authorities to take extraordinary precautions such as isolation and quarantine to reduce the risk of infection. However, these applications can make it difficult to provide proper health services to patients. The development of information technologies provides patients an easy and remote access to healthcare services via telemedicine applications. Telemedicine is used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases by following the same practices used in clinics. It also provides care givers a real-time and remote monitoring of their patients, which can be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of infections and maintaining healthcare services during a pandemic. Authorities can also use these telemedicine applications to track infected patients and get necessary precaution to minimize the infection risk.

High cervical and skull base dissections are often more challenging to treat because of the distal location and tortuous anatomy. The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) may be a reasonable treatment option for this indication. OBJECTIVES To report a case series of patients treated with the PED for high cervical and skull base dissections, focusing on their presentation, indications for treatment, dissection revascularization success, and pseudoaneurysm obliteration evaluated by imaging, and to review available pertinent literature. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all cases of high cervical and skull base dissections treated with a PED at our institution. Patient clinical characteristics, presentation, procedural and follow-up imaging, and clinical course were analyzed to evaluate for procedure complications, dissection revascularization success, pseudoaneurysm obliteration, and clinical outcome. RESULTS This is a retrospective case series including 11 patients with 13 carotid dissections treated in our center. There were nine traumatic and four spontaneous dissections. The most common presentation was cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack (CVA/TIA; 5 patients) and headache/face pain (4 patients). Eleven dissections were associated with pseudoaneurysms. Three patients failed medical management with anticoagulation, although flow-limiting stenosis was the main indication for endovascular intervention. Up to three PEDs per vessel were deployed. Angioplasty was used in 10 cases. Complete revascularization (<10% residual stenosis) was achieved in 91% of vessels and 50% of pseudoaneurysms were completely or near completely obliterated immediately after PED(s) deployment. Proximal iatrogenic dissection was the only intraoperative complication. Follow-up imaging was available for nine treated vessels and demonstrated patent PEDs without significant in-stent stenosis up to 9 months after intervention. 75% of pseudoaneurysms were completely obliterated at follow-up. One PED partially collapsed but had no neurological consequences. There were no new CVA/TIAs. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience with treatment of high cervical and skull base dissections with the PED appears to show that this technique may be a safe and viable treatment option. However, long-term results are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of such treatment.","output":"Pipeline Embolization Device for treatment of high cervical and skull base carotid artery dissections: clinical case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, declared by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, has claimed over 2.7 million lives worldwide.

Policymakers and health professionals prefer to use summarized evidence of practice recommendations. The aim of this scoping review is therefore to identify available guidelines, consensus statements, the standard of practice and practice recommendations on reproductive health service provision during the COVID-19 pandemics. Methods: : We searched guideline databases and websites of professional associations and international organizations working on sexual and reproductive health. We looked for guidelines, protocols, consensus statements and practice recommendations on sexual reproductive health services (SRH) during COVID-19 pandemics. Additionally, we searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. Data extraction was done by two independent reviewers using a customized tool that was developed to record the key information of the source thats relevant to the review question. The difference between the two authors on data extraction was resolved by discussion. Results: : A total of 20 records were included in the review. Identified recommendations were classified into thematic areas. The records addressed approaches to the antenatal care, labour and delivery, postnatal care, safe abortion, contraception, gender-based violence and artificial reproduction. We havent employed any of the quality assessment tools as the pandemic is new clinical entity and evidences are based on expert opinion and limited clinical evidence. Conclusions: : There were consistent consensus statements and recommendations that there should be access to sexual and reproductive health services like antenatal care(ANC), postnatal care(PNC), contraception service, safe abortion care and clinical management of rape survivors during the COVID-19 pandemics with the concerted effort of service re-organization. The practice recommendations focus on innovative ways of service provision to minimize patient and staff exposure to COVID-19 as well as alleviate the burden on the health care system.

METHODS: Prospective data was collected on all patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary ICU in South Africa during 2017. Development of AKI (before or during ICU admission) was recorded and renal recovery 90 days after ICU discharge was determined. RESULTS: Of 849 admissions, the mean age was 42.5 years and mean SAPS 3 score was 48.1. Comorbidities included hypertension (30.5%), HIV (32.6%), diabetes (13.3%), CKD (7.8%) and active tuberculosis (6.2%). The most common reason for admission was trauma (26%). AKI developed in 497 (58.5%). Male gender, illness severity, length of stay, vasopressor drugs and sepsis were independently associated with AKI. AKI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 31.8% vs 7.23% in those without AKI. Age, active tuberculosis, higher SAPS 3 score, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support and sepsis were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for death. HIV was not independently associated with AKI or hospital mortality. CKD developed in 14 of 110 (12.7%) patients with stage 3 AKI; none were dialysis-dependent.

METHODS: This multicentre study, included 2733 outpatients (1397 IBD patients and 1336 controls), from eight major gastrointestinal centres in Lombardy, Italy. Patients were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire regarding demographic, historical and clinical features over the previous 6weeks. The prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization for COVID-19 was assessed. RESULTS: 1810 patients (64%) responded to the questionnaire (941 IBD patients and 869 controls). IBD patients were significantly younger and of male sex than controls. NSAID use and smoking were more frequent in controls. IBD patients were more likely treated with vitamin-D and vaccinated for influenza. Highly probable COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms and signs was less frequent in the IBD group (3.8% vs 6.3%; OR:0.45, 95%CI:0.28C0.75).

Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland. An in-corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety. The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus). Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively). All relevant histological slides are linked as open-source scans in supplementary files. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID-19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID-19.

These people have varied health needs and face several barriers in accessing health services. Nevertheless, there are limited studies that synthesised these challenges. This study aimed to explore issues and challenges in accessing health services among CALD populations in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature published from 1(st) January 1970 to 30(th) October 2021 in four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Web of Science. The search strategy was developed around CALD populations and the health services within the Australian context. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for selection and Arksey and OMalley framework for analysis of relevant articles. A narrative synthesis of data was conducted using inductive thematic analysis approach. Identified issues and challenges were described using an adapted socioecological model. RESULTS: A total of 64 studies were included in the final review. Several challenges at various levels were identified to influence access to health services utilisation. Individual and family level challenges were related to interacting social and health conditions, poor health literacy, multimorbidity, diminishing healthy migrants effect. Community and organisational level challenges were acculturation leading to unhealthy food behaviours and lifestyles, language and communication problems, inadequate interpretation services, and poor cultural competency of providers. Finally, challenges at systems and policy levels included multiple structural disadvantages and vulnerabilities, inadequate health systems and services to address the needs of CALD populations. CONCLUSIONS: People from CALD backgrounds have multiple interacting social factors and diseases, low access to health services, and face challenges in the multilevel health and social systems. Health systems and services need to focus on treating multimorbidity through culturally appropriate health interventions that can effectively prevent and control diseases. Existing health services can be strengthened by ensuring multilingual health resources and onsite interpreters. Addressing structural challenges needs a holistic policy intervention such as improving social determinants of health (e.g., improving living and working conditions and reducing socioeconomic disparities) of CALD populations, which requires a high level political commitment.

A pathological thoracic CT image is first segmented based on multi-scale superpixels, and deep features, texture, and intensity features extracted from superpixels are taken as inputs of a group of RF classifiers. With the fusion of classification results of RFs by a fractional-order gray correlation approach, we capture an initial segmentation of pathological lungs.

Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic CT images affected with interstitial lung diseases. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a high segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 96.45% and PPV of 95.07%. Compared with several existing lung segmentation methods, our algorithm exhibits a robust performance on pathological lung segmentation.

Ones of the most important challenges are medical resources allocation and a duty to treat, often addressed to medical personnel. This paper suggests that there are good reasons to rethink our health-care ethics for future global catastrophic risks. Current pandemic shows how challenging can be an issue of resources allocation even in a relatively small kind of catastrophic event such as covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, the authors show that any future existential bigger catastrophe may require new guidelines for the allocation of medical resources. The idea of assisted dying is considered as a hypothetical scenario. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual work based on conceptual analysis at the intersection of risk studies, health-care ethics and future studies. This study builds the argument on the assumption that the covid-19 pandemic should be treated as a sort of global catastrophic risk. Findings show that there are no such attempts in currently published peer-reviewed academic literature. This is crucial concept for the meta-analysis. This study shows why and how current pandemic can be interpreted in terms of global catastrophic risk even if, literally, covid-19 does not meet all criteria required in the risk studies to be called a global catastrophe. Findings We can expect an emergence of discriminatory selection policy which will require some actions taken by future patients like, for example, genetic engineering. But even then it is inevitable that there will still be a large number of survivors who require medical assistance, which they have no chance of receiving. This is why this study has considered the concept of assisted dying understood as an official protocol for health-care ethics and resources allocation policy in the case of emergency situations. Possibly more controversial idea discussed in this paper is an idea of assisted dying for those who cannot receive required medical help. Such procedure could be applied in a mass-scale during a global catastrophic event. Research limitations/implications Philosophers and ethicists should identify and study all possible pros and cons of this discrimination rule. As this study's findings suggested above, a reliable point of reference is the concept of substantial human enhancement. Human enhancement as such, widely debated, should be studied in that specific context of discrimination of patients in an access to limited medical resources. Last but not least, scientific community should study the concept of assisted dying which could be applied for those survivors who have no chance of obtaining medical care. Such criteria and concepts as cost-benefit analysis, the ethics of quality of life, autonomy of patients and duty of medical personnel should be considered. Practical implications Politicians and policymakers should prepare protocols for global catastrophes where these discrimination criteria would have to be applied. The same applies to the development of medical robotics aimed at replacing human health-care personnel. We assume that this is important implication for practical policy in healthcare. Our prediction, however plausible, is not a good scenario for humanity. But given this realistic development trajectory, we should do everything possible to prevent the need for the discriminatory rules in medical care described above. Originality/value This study offers the idea of assisted dying as a health-care policy in emergency situations. The authors expect that next future global catastrophes - looking at the current pandemic only as a mild prelude - will force a radical change in moral values and medical standards. New criteria of selection and discrimination will be perceived as much more exclusivist and unfair than criteria applied today.","output":"Covid-19 pandemic and future global catastrophic risks as a challenge for health-care ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe testing of saliva samples for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA has become a useful and common method to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, there are limited examples of serial testing with correlated clinical metadata, especially in the outpatient setting. MethodWe developed a method to collect serial saliva samples on ordinary white printer paper, which can be subsequently analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures. The collection systems consisted of a biological diary (CoronaCal) where subjects dab their saliva onto ovals printed onto paper. The dried samples are covered with a sticker that includes a symptom checklist to create a biological diary. Each sheet of letter paper can accommodate up to 14 serial samples. ResultsIn a pilot study, ten subjects used CoronaCals for durations of nine to 44 days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted and detected in CoronaCals from nine of nine people with either Covid-19 symptoms or exposure to someone with Covid-19, and in zero of one asymptomatic person. The CoronaCals were stored for up to 70 days at room temperature during collection and then frozen for up to four months before analysis, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is stable once dried onto paper. Interestingly, the temporal pattern of symptoms was not well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial daily collections for up to 44 days. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was discontinuous over time in most cases but persisted for up to 24 days. ConclusionsWe conclude that sampling of saliva on simple paper CoronaCals may provide a useful method to study the natural history and epidemiology of Covid-19. The CoronaCal collection and testing method we developed is also easy to implement, inexpensive, non-invasive, and scalable. More broadly, the approach can be used to archive biological samples for retrospective analysis to deepen epidemiological understanding during viral disease outbreaks and to provide information about the natural history of emerging infections.","output":"The Coronavirus Calendar (CoronaCal): a Simplified SARS-CoV-2 Test System for Sampling and Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The peroxisome is responsible for a variety of vital pathways in primary metabolism, including the very long-chain fatty-acid oxidation and plasmalogen lipid biosynthesis. Autosomal recessive disorder of the Zellweger spectrum (ZSD) is a major subset of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) that can be caused by mutations in any of the 14 PEX genes. Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is the foremost common and severe phenotype within the heterogeneous ZSD. However, missense mutations encode proteins with residual functions, which are associated with phenotypes that are milder than ZS. Mutations in the PEX1 gene are among the most prevalent. PEX1 and PEX6 proteins, belonging to the AAA family of ATPases, form a hexameric complex, which is associated with peroxisome membranes and essential for peroxisome biology. In this study, a two-month-old Iranian boy with hypotonia, poor feeding, and difficulty in breathing was diagnosed with Zellweger syndrome. The parents of the patient were second cousins and healthy and no similar cases were observed in the parents' family. The PEX1 gene was sequenced in the patient and his parents. The compound heterozygous mutations, p. Arg949Trp and p. Gly970Ala, were identified in the patient, while the parents were heterozygous for these alleles. Sequence analysis of the mutant PEX1 D2 domain revealed that mutation p. Arg949Trp precisely occurred in a conserved arginine residue (P4 Arg), which hinders the substrate processing of the complex. Several database records have reported mutation p. Arg949Trp(R949W) but its clinical significance is given as uncertain. We report here a novel mutation, p. Gly970Ala, which is not recorded before and may prevent proper interaction of PEX1 and PEX6 proteins. In summary, the clinical findings and peroxisome profile of the patient suggested that compound heterozygosity for these two missense mutations resulted in a nonfunctional PEX1/PEX6 complex causing the severe ZS phenotype.","output":"Compound heterozygous p.

The Bgp isoforms are generated through alternative splicing of the mouse Bgp1 gene that has two allelic forms called MHVR (or mmCGM1), expressed in MHV-susceptible mouse strains, and mmCGM2, expressed in SJL/J mice, which are resistant to MHV. We here report the cloning and characterization of a new Bgp-related gene designated Bgp2. The Bgp2 cDNA allowed the prediction of a 271-amino-acid glycoprotein with two immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane, and a putative cytoplasmic tail. There is considerable divergence in the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal domains of the proteins coded by the Bgp1 gene from that of the Bgp2-encoded protein. RNase protection assays and RNA PCR showed that Bgp2 was expressed in BALB/c kidney, colon, and brain tissue, in SJL/J colon and liver tissue, in BALB/c and CD1 spleen tissue, in C3H macrophages, and in mouse rectal carcinoma CMT-93 cells. When Bgp2-transfected hamster cells were challenged with MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, or MHV-3, the Bgp2-encoded protein served as a functional MHV receptor, although with a lower efficiency than that of the MHVR glycoprotein. The Bgp2-mediated virus infection could not be inhibited by monoclonal antibody CC1 that is specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR. Although CMT-93 cells express both MHVR and Bgp2, infection with the three strains of MHV was blocked by pretreatment with monoclonal antibody CC1, suggesting that MHVR was the only functional receptor in these cells. Thus, a novel murine Bgp gene has been identified that can be coexpressed in inbred mice with the Bgp1 glycoproteins and that can serve as a receptor for MHV strains when expressed in transfected hamster cells.","output":"Bgp2, a new member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related gene family, encodes an alternative receptor for mouse hepatitis viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The ultimate goal of T cell-engaging immunotherapy is to endorse the activity of a persons own cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment, finally destroying cancer cells. Several types of immunotherapy are either approved for use or are under study in clinical trials to determine their effectiveness in treating various types of cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is rapidly emerging in the field and has shown unprecedented success in the treatment of hematological malignancies. It entails the collection of a patients T cells to genetically engineer them in the lab to express CARs that target surface antigens on tumors to help identify and eradicate the tumor. However, major issues remain to be solved to enable generalized CART cell therapies in the clinic. Novel approaches to tackle these problems are being developed rapidly and are reviewed in this publication. ABSTRACT: In the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell technology has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. This strategy uses synthetic CARs to redirect the patients own immune cells to recognize specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. The unprecedented success of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy against B cell malignancies has resulted in its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. However, major scientific challenges still remain to be addressed for the broad use of CAR T cell therapy. These include severe toxicities, limited efficacy against solid tumors, and immune suppression in the hostile tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, CAR T cell therapy is a personalized medicine of which the production is time- and resource-intensive, which makes it very expensive. All these factors drive new innovations to engineer more powerful CAR T cells with improved antitumor activity, which are reviewed in this manuscript.","output":"T Cell Engaging Immunotherapies, Highlighting Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare professionals have experienced a wide range of psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline workers and trainees are particularly vulnerable to such effects. This study aimed to share the experience of Cognitive Restructuring workshops for COVID-19 induced Stress in Post-graduate Trainees, highlighting their stress levels and effect of cognitive behavior therapy intervention in processing and managing stress. Methods: Workshops based on a Cognitive Behavior Therapy model were introduced to trainees at the Aga Khan University Hospital to self-assess stress and identify coping mechanisms. We collected data from the stress scale and workshop responses along with a focus group discussion. We performed item analysis of the stress scale and a documentary analysis of participant responses to assess the effectiveness of this intervention. Results: The majority of the participants had moderate stress. A statistically significant relationship was observed between stress level and perceived helplessness ( p value 0.002). The feedback of the workshop was largely positive based on sharing of adverse experiences, developing a different perspective and a newer way of processing feelings;about 10% of the participants did not find this workshop useful. In the focus group discussion, the participants described stress scale to be helpful for stress quantification, ABC tool to be useful with repeated practice and reframing technique to reduce stress over time. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress in healthcare workers and impacted professional and personal lives.

These studies were performed in viral diseases where public T cell receptors (TCR) appear to confer better protective responses. Selective pressures generating common TCR clonotypes are currently not well understood, but it is believed that they confer a growth advantage. As very little is known about public TCR clonotypes in cancer, here we set out to determine the extent of shared TCR clonotypes in the intra-tumor microenvironments of virus- and non-virus-driven head and neck cancers using TCR sequencing. We report that tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes were indeed shared across individuals with the same cancer type, where the majority of shared sequences were specific to the cancer type (i.e., viral versus non-viral). These shared clonotypes were not particularly enriched in EBV-associated nasopharynx cancer but, in both cancers, exhibited distinct characteristics, namely shorter CDR3 lengths, restricted V- and J-gene usages, and also demonstrated convergent V(D)J recombination. Many of these shared TCRs were expressed in patients with a shared HLA background. Pattern recognition of CDR3 amino acid sequences revealed strong convergence to specific pattern motifs, and these motifs were uniquely found to each cancer type. This suggests that they may be enriched for specificity to common antigens found in the tumor microenvironment of different cancers. The identification of shared TCRs in infiltrating tumor T cells not only adds to our understanding of the tumor-adaptive immune recognition but could also serve as disease-specific biomarkers and guide the development of future immunotherapies.

Participants completed baseline assessments and qualitative interviews/focus groups before and after the 10-week intervention. Qualitative interview data and facilitator notes were integrated in a thematic analysis. RESULTS: 12/17 participants approached completed baseline assessments, attended 100/120 (83.3%) intervention sessions and met 140/170 (82.4%) of goals set. Most had not used video calling before. In the thematic analysis, our overarching theme was social connectedness. Three sub-themes were as follows: Retaining independence and social connectedness: social connectedness could not be at the expense of independence; Adapting social connectedness in the pandemic: participants strived to compensate for previous social connectedness as the pandemic reduced support networks; Managing social connections within and through the intervention: although there were tensions, for example, between sharing of achievements feeling supportive and competitive, participants engaged with various lifestyle changes; social connections supported group attendance and implementation of lifestyle changes.

The nosocomial infections included 5/15 (33%) 'severe' RVIs (3 influenza viruses, 1 parainfluenza virus, and 1 adenovirus) as well as 10/15 (66%) non-severe virus infections (including human rhinovirus and human coronavirus). CONCLUSION In approximately 10% of auto-SCT transplantation episodes, an RVI with likely nosocomial origin was detected and included 'severe viruses' such as influenza.

While hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased exponentially in the last year, several reports have indicated declines in ER use due to common non-COVID related problems. There is currently a dearth of literature examining the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency room use for acute burn injuries. Thus, we performed a retrospective database analysis using the TriNetX database to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on United States ER visits for acute burn injuries. We hypothesize that ER visits due to burn injury decreased, especially in patients with severe burn injuries- defined as burned total burn surface area (TBSA) >20%. Methods Patients who visited the ER from 2010-2020 due to burn injury were identified using ICD-10 codes. We then stratified these patients by age (< 18 and 18), severe ( >20% TBSA) vs. non-severe (< 20% TBSA) burn injury, and by change over time in 1-year intervals from 2010 to 2020. Extracted data was analyzed using chi-square with p< .05 considered significant. Results We identified a total of 24,620,393 ER visits from 2010-2020. Of these, 142,007 (0.58%) were due to burn injury. A large majority of burn-related ER visits were for non-severe burns (n=134,120, 94.4%). ER visits for acute burn injury decreased by 21.6% during 2020 when compared to years prior. Stratification by age group revealed that pediatric patients (< 18) had more significant decreases in ER Visits than adult patients (18). Pediatric patients visited the ER 71.6% less than adults during 2020. When stratified by burn severity, patients with severe burns ( >20% TBSA) and patients with non-severe burns (< 20% TBSA) had similar decreases in ER usage during 2020 when compared to years prior (21.7% and 24.6%, respectively). Further age analysis revealed that both pediatric patients with severe burns and pediatric patients with non-severe burns visited the ER less than their adult counterparts (71.4% and 60.9%, respectively). All of the above differences were statistically significant (p< .05). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a sharp decrease in ER usage by patients with severe and non-severe burn injuries. This decrease was particularly salient in pediatric populations across all TBSA data points measured.","output":"Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Room Visits for Burn Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While it is well understood that the emerging Social Internet of Things (SIoT) offers a description of a new world of billions of humans which are intelligently communicate and interact with each other.

At the same time, quarantine and physical isolation can intensify feelings of dispositional loneliness that, by focusing on thoughts of disconnection from others, can trigger intense anxiety. Anxiety, generated by both fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness, can activate negative expectations and thoughts of death, potentially generating alarming depressive symptoms. However, the anxiety-buffer hypothesis suggests that self-esteem acts as a shield (buffer) against mental health threats - fear and loneliness - thus hampering anxiety and depressive symptoms. Objective: This study aims to test the process - triggered by COVID-19 fear and loneliness - in which self-esteem should buffer the path leading to anxiety symptoms, then to depression. Methods: An observational research design with structural equation models was used. A sample of 1200 participants enrolled from the general population answered an online survey comprising: the fear of COVID-19 scale, the UCLA loneliness scale, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the anxiety and depression scales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Results: Structural equation models showed the link between anxiety symptoms (mediator) with both the fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness (predictors), as well as its association with consequent depressive symptomatology (outcome). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, self-esteem mediated the relationship between the predictors and their adverse psychological consequences. Conclusion: Self-esteem represents a protective factor from the antecedents of depression. Targeted psychological interventions should be implemented to minimize the psychological burden of the disease whilst promoting adaptation and positive psychological health outcomes.","output":"The Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis in the Time of COVID-19: When Self-Esteem Protects From the Impact of Loneliness and Fear on Anxiety and Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pesticides use in Southeast Asia has increased steadily, driven by the growth of large-scale commercial farming, as well as a desire to maximise food production in rural subsistence economies. Given that use of chemical pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, has known potential health impacts, there are concerns about the safety of agricultural workers, and a need for a better evidence base to underpin regulation and worker education. This study, undertaken in 9 districts in Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam, will interview agricultural workers to investigate how they use pesticides, their knowledge of risks and self-protective practices, and their self-reported illness symptoms. In each district researchers will recruit and interview 120 participants engaged in vegetable farming, who have recently used pesticides, making a total of 1080 subjects divided equally between the three study countries. Workers degree of pesticides exposure will be determined from acetyl cholinesterase concentrations in capillary blood samples collected using field test kits, and these data will be analysed together with the interview findings.

Our hospital's policy mandated that all staff, be certified in IC practices through a competency based educational program. A multi-disciplinary educational module, derived from a SARS specific model used to educate the SARS designated care team; was developed. Essential components included basic IC principles, specimen collection, use of protective clothing, high risk procedures, modified protocols for ventilator management and oxygen/aerosol therapy, transportation and care of equipment and the environment.

The Dominican Republic (DR) exhibits one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean despite the fact that 99% of registered births in the country are reportedly attended by a skilled birth attendant. This paradox implies that programs to support healthcare worker knowledge and skills improvement are vital to improving maternal health outcomes in the DR. Helping Mothers Survive (HMS) is a provider training program developed by Jhpiego and global partners. The goal of HMS is to combat maternal mortality by contributing to quality improvement efforts that reinforce maternal health skills of local healthcare workers. Methods: An international, multisectoral group of stakeholders collaborated in the implementation of two HMS curricula, Bleeding After Birth (BAB) and pre-eclampsia & eclampsia (PE&E). Demographic information as well as pre- and post-training knowledge scores were recorded for each participant. Knowledge score improvement was assessed in order to support effectiveness of the program on knowledge acquisition of healthcare workers. Results: Three hundred and twenty healthcare workers participated in the HMS training workshops between October 2016CAugust 2020. Of the 320 participants, 132 were trained as master trainers. The majority of participants identified as attending physicians, followed by residents/interns, nurses, students, and other. A significant improvement in knowledge scores was observed for both the BAB and PE&E curricula, with a 21.24 and 30.25% change in average score (pre- to post-test), respectively. In response to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, flexibility of the local team led to a PE&E virtual training pilot workshop in August 2020. Discussion/Conclusions: Simulation-based training improved the knowledge levels of healthcare workers for both HMS curricula. These results suggest that simulation-based workshops have an impact on knowledge acquisition and skills of healthcare workers immediately following training. For the PE&E curriculum, no significant difference in knowledge acquisition was observed between in-person and virtual training sessions. The ongoing pandemic poses challenges to program implementation; however, these preliminary results provide evidence that conducting virtual workshops may be a viable alternative to in-person training.","output":"Helping Mothers Survive: Program Evaluation and Early Outcomes of Maternal Care Training in the Dominican Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a recently emerged tickborne virus in east Asia with over 8,000 confirmed cases. With a high case fatality ratio, SFTSV has been designated a high priority pathogen by the WHO and the NIAID. Despite this, there are currently no approved therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent SFTS. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) represents an FDA-approved vaccine platform that has been considered for numerous viruses due to its low sero-prevalence in humans, ease in genetic manipulation and promiscuity in incorporating foreign glycoproteins into its virions. In this study, we developed a recombinant VSV (rVSV) expressing the SFTSV glycoproteins Gn/Gc (rVSV-SFTSV) and assessed its safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in mice. We demonstrate that rVSV-SFTSV is safe when given to immunocompromised animals and is not neuropathogenic when injected intracranially into young immunocompetent mice. Immunization of Ifnar-/- mice with rVSV-SFTSV resulted in high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against lethal SFTSV challenge. Additionally, passive transfer of sera from immunized Ifnar-/- mice into na?ve animals was protective when given pre- or post-exposure. Finally, we demonstrate that immunization with rVSV-SFTSV cross protects mice against challenge with the closely related Heartland virus despite low neutralizing titers to the virus. Taken together, these data suggest that rVSV-SFTSV is a promising vaccine candidate. Importance Tick borne diseases are a growing threat to human health. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and Heartland viruses are recently recognized, highly-pathogenic, tick-transmitted viruses. The fatality rates for individuals infected with SFTSV or HRTV are high and there are no therapeutics or vaccines available. The recent introduction of the tick vector for SFTSV (Haemaphysalis longicornis) to the eastern half of the United States and Austrailia raises concerns for SFTSV outbreaks outside East Asia. Here we report the development of a potential vaccine for SFTSV and HRTV based on the viral vector platform that has been successfully used for an Ebola vaccine. We demonstrate that the rVSV-SFTSV protects from lethal SFTSV or HRTV challenge when given as a single dose. We evaluated possible pathogenic effects of the vaccine and show that it is safe in immune compromised animlas and when introduced into the central nervous system.","output":"Safety, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of a Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Vectored Vaccine Against Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus and Heartland Bandaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess the treatment position of all patients who have had an anti-VEGF injection in 2020, prior to the UK lockdown on 23 March. To assess methods of service quality evaluation in setting benchmarks for comparison after the situation stabilized. To consider what proportion could be delayed based on national guidelines and varying vision parameters. Finally, to measure how many patients actually attended. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of data collected from our electronic medical record was performed. Age, sex, reason for injection, visual acuity (VA) for both treated and untreated eyes and number of injections were recorded. The proportion of patients and eyes with  70 letters were calculated as an assessment of quality of service provision. The proportion of patients that could be delayed was estimated based on published guidelines and varying the parameters of difference between treated and untreated eyes. Finally, the number of patients who actually attended was recorded. RESULTS: About 3364 eyes (2229 neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 427 diabetic macular oedema (DMO), 599 retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and 109 other) from 2924 patients were analysed. At the last appointment with injection, 64.4% of patients achieved  70 letters in their better-seeing eye. Mean VA of the treated eye was 61.5 letters, and 36.9% achieved  70. The mean number of injections was 16, 90% with aflibercept. Of the patients receiving treatment to one eye, 57.6% was receiving treatment to their worse seeing eye. In 18.2% this eye was > 20 letters worse and in 5.07% > 40 letters worse than the untreated eye. Using Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) guidelines, (treat nAMD 8 weekly, delay majority of RVO and DMO) 24.8% would be delayed. From 2738 appointments during the first 4 weeks of lockdown (booked prior to lockdown), doctors rescheduled 1025 and patients did not attend 820, leaving 893 who were seen (33%). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the treatment position of patients prior to COVID-19 lockdown enables objective stratification for prioritization for continued treatment. If RCOphth guidelines were followed 24.8% could be delayed and if treating the worse seeing eye up to 57.6%. Many scheduled patients elected not to attend, with 67% not seen in the first 4 weeks.

This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCLC), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. RESULTS: It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.","output":"The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Defensins are a class of cationic disulfide-bridged antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) present in many eukaryotic organisms and even in bacteria. They primarily include two distinct but evolutionarily related superfamilies (cis and trans). Defensins in fungi belong to the members of the cis-superfamily with the cysteine-stabilized -helical and -sheet fold. To date, many fungal defensin-like peptides (fDLPs) have been found through gene mining of the genome resource, but only a few have been experimentally characterized. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of Pyronesin4 (abbreviated as Py4), a fDLP previously identified by genomic sequencing of the basal filamentous ascomycete Pyronema confluens. Chemically, synthetic Py4 adopts a native-like structure and exhibits activity on an array of Gram-positive bacteria including some clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus warneri, a conditioned pathogen inhabiting in human skin. Py4 markedly altered the bacterial morphology and caused cytoplasmic accumulation of the cell-wall synthesis precursor through binding to the membrane-bound Lipid II, indicating that it works as an inhibitor of cell-wall biosynthesis. Py4 showed no hemolysis and high mammalian serum stability. This work identified a new fungal defensin with properties relevant to drug exploration. Intramolecular epistasis between mutational sites of fDLPs is also discussed.","output":"A Fungal Defensin Inhibiting Bacterial Cell-Wall Biosynthesis with Non-Hemolysis and Serum Stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become a global challenge based on its replication within the host cells that relies on non-structural proteins, protease (Mpro).

To investigate what makes healthcare system resilient and physicians better at coping during a crisis situation, our study investigated the role risk exposure, such as working at COVID-19 entry points, sleep, and perceived work safety played in reducing negative psychological functioning at work, as well as their effects on adverse and potentially fatal incidences of compromised safety and medical errors. METHODS: Our study included a representative sample of 1,189 physicians, from all 12 Slovenian regions and all medical occupations, as registered by the Medical Chamber of Slovenia. For the purposes of this study, a Questionnaire of Sleep and Psychological Functioning at Work was developed in the form of an online retrospective self-report. Additionally, our study included items assessing physicians perceived work safety and frequency of negative outcomes (compromised safety and medical errors) during the first month of the Covid-19 epidemic. RESULTS: Physicians working at COVID-19 entry points were more likely to experience night awakening, slept less than 5 h per night, experience nightmares, and had lower levels of psychological functioning in comparison to other physicians. Both hypothesized models showed adequate fit. A higher score on the sleep scale (sleep quantity, sleep quality, and shorter sleep latency) has been shown to predict lower levels of negative psychological functioning at work and, indirectly, reduced incidences of compromised safety and medical errors. Contrary to our expectations, no significant direct effect of sleep on compromised safety and medical errors was found. When perceived work safety was added into the model, the model showed improved fit, with perceived work safety predicting better sleep, less negative psychological functioning at work, and less compromised safety. CONCLUSION: Sleep and safety both play an important role in reducing negative psychological functioning at work and, by doing so, decreasing the negative and potentially fatal incidents during the pandemic, such as compromised safety and medical errors. Further, research is needed to see how medical guidelines can be updated to ensure physicians sleep and that their safety is protected.","output":"Sleep and Safety Improve Physicians Psychological Functioning at Work During Covid-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and its effect on adverse clinical outcomes, parameters of im","output":"Vitamin D Sufficiency Reduced Risk for Morbidity and Mortality in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the global pandemic, teachers are trying hard to sustain education online but, paradoxically, they could become dispensable when students take the decisive role in digital learning In addition, digital learning easily deprives the embodied participation and humanness of the learning process For educators, the challenge ahead is how to make education in the pandemic - the digital home schooling - more 'humane' and 'embodied' by creating a balance between technology use and humanity in education","output":"'Digital Home Schooling' During the Pandemic: Possibilities and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Caring for patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Annual influenza vaccination is an important public health measure to prevent influenza infections and is strongly recommended for cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients, especially in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning model to identify Korean adult CVD patients with low adherence to influenza vaccination METHODS: Adults with CVD (n = 815) from a nationally representative dataset of the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V) were analyzed. Among these adults, 500 (61.4%) had answered \\"yes\\" to whether they had received seasonal influenza vaccinations in the past 12 months. The classification process was performed using the logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) machine learning techniques. Because the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Korea offers free influenza immunization for the elderly, separate models were developed for the < 65 and  65 age groups. RESULTS: The accuracy of machine learning models using 16 variables as predictors of low influenza vaccination adherence was compared; for the  65 age group, XGB (84.7%) and RF (84.7%) have the best accuracies, followed by LR (82.7%) and SVM (77.6%).

Twelve patients with PV who experienced relapse from March 2020 to January 2022 were included. The patients were asked whether they experienced COVID-19 symptoms and the pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) was measured. PCR for COVID-19, chest computed tomography, routine investigations, and electrocardiography were performed for the admitted patients. The mean PDAI of the patients during relapse was 23.6  14.8 (range 5-60). Seven patients received azathioprine; one patient received mycophenolate mofetil; and six patients received 1000 mg of rituximab (RTX) twice at an interval of 14 days. None of the 12 patients had COVID-19-suggestive symptoms. Only 1 patient relapsed after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The six admitted patients who received RTX were negative for COVID-19 based on the PCR testing results. Out of the 12 patients, eight achieved complete remission, while four achieved partial remission. No major adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, the treatments with systemic steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and rituximab were well tolerated by the patients with relapsing PV, provided that there was no contact with individuals with COVID-19.

Analysis of Google Trend information may give providers and healthcare systems useful information regarding Internet users' interest in bariatric procedures. The objective of this study was to gather Google Trend information on worldwide Internet searches for \\"bariatric surgery\\", \\"gastric bypass\\", \\"gastric sleeve\\", \\"gastric plication\\", and \\"lap band\\" from 2004-2012 and to explore temporal relationships with relevant media events, economic variations, and policy modifications. METHODS Data were collected using Google Trends. Trend analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel Version 14.3.5 and Minitab V.16.0. RESULTS Trend analyses showed that total search volume for the term \\"bariatric surgery\\" has declined roughly 25% since January 2004, although interest increased approximately 5% from 2011 to 2012. Interest in lap band procedures declined 30% over the past 5 years, while \\"gastric sleeve\\" has increased 15%. Spikes in search numbers show an association with events such as changing policy and insurance guidelines and media coverage for bariatric procedures. CONCLUSION This report illustrates that variations in Internet search volume for terms related to bariatric surgery are multifactorial in origin. Although it is impossible to ascertain if reported Internet search volume is based on interest in potentially undergoing bariatric surgery or simply general interest, this analysis reveals that search volume appears to mirror real world events.

Methods We queried the COVID-19 Research Network; a multinational database utilizing the TriNetX Network to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The main endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality. Results 14,712 patients were included, of whom, 6,387 (43.4%) were males. Males were older (55.017.7 vs. 51.117.9 years, P<.001), and had higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, nicotine dependence and heart failure, but a lower prevalence of obesity. Before propensity score matching (PSM), all-cause mortality was 8.8% in males and 4.3% in females (OR 2.15; 95% CI, 1.87-2.46; P<.001), at median follow-up of 34, and 32 days, respectively. In the Kaplan Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival was significantly lower in males than in females (73% vs. 86%, P-log rank <.001). After PSM, all-cause mortality remained significantly higher in males than in females (8.13% vs. 4.60%, OR 1.81; 95% CI, 1.55-2.11; P<.001).

In order to solve these inference problems, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) employ different inference algorithms, such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), or variational methods. Existing research on such algorithms mainly concerns their implementation and efficiency, rather than the correctness of the algorithms themselves when applied in the context of expressive PPLs. To remedy this, we give a correctness proof for SMC methods in the context of an expressive PPL calculus, representative of popular PPLs such as WebPPL, Anglican, and Birch. Previous work have studied correctness of MCMC using an operational semantics, and correctness of SMC and MCMC in a denotational setting without term recursion. However, for SMC inferenceone of the most commonly used algorithms in PPLs as of todayno formal correctness proof exists in an operational setting. In particular, an open question is if the resample locations in a probabilistic program affects the correctness of SMC. We solve this fundamental problem, and make four novel contributions: (i) we extend an untyped PPL lambda calculus and operational semantics to include explicit resample terms, expressing synchronization points in SMC inference; (ii) we prove, for the first time, that subject to mild restrictions, any placement of the explicit resample terms is valid for a generic form of SMC inference; (iii) as a result of (ii), our calculus benefits from classic results from the SMC literature: a law of large numbers and an unbiased estimate of the model evidence; and (iv) we formalize the bootstrap particle filter for the calculus and discuss how our results can be further extended to other SMC algorithms.","output":"Correctness of Sequential Monte Carlo Inference for Probabilistic Programming Languages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sustainable development imaginary was built on a belief in co-operation, collaboration and consensus building and requires governance approaches that rely upon the values of a liberal, pluralistic, tolerant, and democratic society.

METHODS This multicenter, retrospective cohort study collected data from lung transplant recipients within 3 years of transplant at 4 centers between March 24, 2020 and September 1, 2020. During this period, as part of routine care during the COVID-19 pandemic, these centers implemented a home-based surveillance program using plasma -cfDNA in preference to surveillance bronchoscopy. -cfDNA was used to detect acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD) - a composite endpoint of acute rejection and infection. -cfDNA levels in patients with ALAD were compared to stable patients. The performance characteristics of -cfDNA  1.0% to detect ALAD were estimated. RESULTS A total of 175 patients underwent 380 -cfDNA measurements, of which 290 were for routine surveillance purposes. -cfDNA was higher in patients with ALAD than stable patients (Median (IQR) 1.7% (0.63, 3.1) vs 0.35% (0.22, 0.79), p < 0.001).

METHODS: Sixty-one neonates (35 weeks gestation) with CGISC were randomised to receive daily supplementation with a triple-strain bifidobacterial probiotic (n = 30) or placebo (n = 31) until discharge. Stool microbiota was analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing on samples collected before (T1), 1 week (T2), and 2 weeks (T3) after supplementation and before discharge (T4). The primary outcome was the sum of the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic families of Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Pseudomonaceae, Staphylococcaeae, Streptococcaceae, and Yersiniaceae at T3. RESULTS: The median gestational age [38 weeks (IQR: 37.1C38.9)] was similar in both groups. The probiotic group had lower rates of caesarean deliveries (40% versus 70%, p = 0.02). The relative abundance of potentially pathogenic families was lower in the probiotic group compared to placebo at T3 [(median: 50.4 (IQR: 26.6C67.6) versus 67.1 (IQR: 50.9C96.2); p = 0.04).

METHODS: We have retrospectively searched our electronic database and identified 33 pwMS who had a delay in treatment due to COVID-19 pandemics. The following data were extracted: age, sex, multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotype: relapsing-remitting (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status scale (EDSS), previous disease modifying therapy (DMT), number of ocrelizumab cycles prior to the lockdown, dates of first ocrelizumab infusion, last ocrelizumab infusion prior to the lockdown and delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown. Flow cytometry results, relapses and EDSS progression prior to the delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown were extracted. RESULTS: The mean time between two ocrelizumab infusion during the lockdown was 7.720.64 (range 6.07 to 8.92) months. The mean time between last ocrelizumab infusion and the lymphocyte sampling prior to post COVID infusion was 6.590.95 (range 5.18 to 8.49) months. In this period, none of the studied patients had a relapse. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, time from last ocrelizumab infusion to lymphocyte sampling prior to the next infusion was the only significant predictor for CD19+ B cells count, when corrected for the number of previous ocrelizumab cycles and MS phenotype (RRMS or PPMS) (B=7.981, 95% C.I. 3.277-12.686, p=0.002).

But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications. Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity. Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy. Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed; (2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age; (3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging; and (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate agig.

The identification of four such PAR-binding modules and the characterization of a number of proteins utilising these elements during the last decade has provided important insights into how PAR regulates different cellular activities.

This study aimed to describe the expression of miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-25, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 in a sample of type 1 diabetic children and adolescents to explore their association with DN and some indices of kidney injury. Patients and Methods: Seventy type 1 diabetic patients, with 5 years' duration of diabetes or more, were recruited from Children's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of the above mentioned miRNAs in serum and to assess its association with DN, and the studied risk factors. Results: There was a significantly higher percentage of up-regulation of miRNA-377 and miRNA-93 (P=0.03, 0.02, respectively) in addition to significant down-regulation of miRNA-25 (P=0.01) in patients with DN than in patients without DN. In patients with DN, expression of miR-216a was significantly negatively correlated with creatinine (r=-0.4, P=0.04) and positively correlated with eGFR using creatinine (r=0.5, P=0.03). In the same group, expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with urinary cystatin C (r=0.6, P=0.01) and was negatively correlated with e-GFR using cystatin c (r=-0.6, P=0.01). miRNA-93 was associated with increased risk (odds ratio=15, 95% CI=12.03-24.63, P=0.01), while miRNA-25 was associated with decreased risk for albuminuria (odds ratio=0.15, 95% CI=0.08-0.55, P=0.03). Conclusion: miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DN, while miRNA-25 may have a reno-protective role.

We encountered a patient with thoracic pneumatosis after frequent displacement of the tracheal tube with an overinflated cuff. CASE PRESENTATION We admitted a 62-year-old man to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. We secured his airway using a cuffed 8.5-mm tracheal tube. However, air leakage did not stop with the regular intracuff pressure (25 cm H2O) because the diameter of his trachea was too large for the tracheal tube inserted. In addition, a chest X-ray examination revealed rostral tube displacement. Therefore, we applied a higher intracuff pressure (35 cm H2O) to prevent air leakage and tracheal tube movement. However, severe coughing episodes developed, and 3 days after ICU admission, a chest X-ray and CT scan revealed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. We did not have larger tracheal tubes in stock. We decided to use a tracheostomy tube instead, which we expected to be placed securely and to prevent tube displacement. After tracheostomy, the severe coughing episodes became infrequent. Finally, we weaned the patient from mechanical ventilation 12 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS The clinical signs and symptoms in our patient point to tracheal tube size mismatch as the cause of pneumothorax.","output":"A case of thoracic pneumatosis due to severe coughs and tracheal tube displacement induced by tracheal tube size mismatch."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain neglected in the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) (i.e. plasma collected from individuals after their recovery from COVID-19) has emerged as a leading medical treatment for COVID-19. Studies to date support the safety-and increasingly the efficacy-of CCP to treat COVID-19. This has motivated large-scale procurement and transfusion of CCP, notably in the United States (US), where inventories of CCP have been attained, and government-supported stockpiling of CCP is underway. CCP is a therapy that could be implemented in LMICs. However, systemic and transfusion-specific challenges (e.g. capacity for donor mobilization and collections) impede local procurement of this resource in sufficient volumes to meet clinical demand. This raises the question as to whether there are strategies to facilitate sharing of CCP with LMICs and/or bolstering local capacity for collection to contend with the health crisis. While compelling, there are cost-related, logistical and regulatory barriers to both approaches. For one, there is complexity in diverting national interest (e.g. in the US) away from an epidemic that displays few signs of abating. There are also concerns regarding equitable distribution of CCP in LMICs and how that might be overcome. Further, the barriers to blood donation in general apply to collection of CCP; these obstacles are longstanding, accounting for the inability of many LMICs to meet their blood transfusion needs. Nonetheless, CCP affords dual opportunity for humanitarian outreach while tackling a broader challenge of blood transfusion safety and availability.","output":"Promoting access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma in low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contributed to increasing prevalence of depressive symptoms and other psychological repercussions, particularly in the disease population in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, the caregiver burden of caregivers of persons with dementia (CGPWD), has been under-investigated. Aims: This study examined the psychological impact and its correlates on the CGPWD in Hong Kong amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: CGPWD referred from rehabilitation clinics and online seminar were used to recruit participants to complete an online questionnaire by the end of the second-wave of the COVID-19 outbreak (June 2021). To be eligible, either full-time or part-time CGPWD, aged 18 or above, can understand Cantonese, currently reside in Hong Kong and offering care to PWD for at least one year, were recruited. Those CGPWD diagnosed with any type of psychiatric disorder were excluded from this study. The Chinese Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-22), and Nonattachment Scale (NAS-7) were used to measure participants depression, perceived stress, anxiety symptoms, caregiver burden and wisdom in subjective feelings of internal stress. The modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (mMOS-SS) and the SARS Appraisal Inventory (SAI) were also administered to measure participants perceived support and coping efficacy. Follow-up responses were gathered by the end of third-wave outbreak (October 2021). Results: A total of 51 CGPWD participated, of which, 33 (64.7%) suffered from probable depression (CES-D score  16). Participants also showed a significant increase in depression symptom scores at the three-month follow-up period (t = 2.25, p = 0.03). CGPWD with probable depression had less non-attachment awareness and higher scores in anxiety, stress, caregiving burden, and coronavirus impact (all p < 0.05) than those without. Conclusions: High prevalence of depressive symptoms was noted among our CGPWD sample and these symptoms seemed to worsen substantially.

A1pp inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation in the host and promotes viral infection and pathogenesis. We performed in silico screening of FDA approved drugs and nucleoside analogue library against the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 A1pp domain. Docking scores and interaction profile analyses exhibited strong binding affinity of eleven FDA approved drugs and five nucleoside analogues NA1 (-13.84), nadide (-13.65), citicholine (-13.54), NA2 (-12.42), and NA3 (-12.27). The lead compound NA1 exhibited significant hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction at the natural substrate binding site. The root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface (SASA), hydrogen bond formation, principle component analysis, and free energy landscape calculations for NA1 bound protein displayed stable complex formation in 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation, compared to unbound macro domain and natural substrate adenosine-5-diphosphoribose bound macro domain that served as a positive control.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 infections affect nasal mucociliary activity using the saccharin test to measure nasal MCC time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective comparative investigation included 25 patients with COVID-19 infection and 25 healthy controls. The nasal MCC time was assessed using the saccharin test. Saccharin test was applied to COVID-19 patients between the 10th and 20th days of COVID-19 test positivity. Patients admitted to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic with non-nasal symptoms and no history of COVID-19 infection served as the control subjects. RESULTS: Age, gender distribution, smoking, and alcohol usage, and the existence of other systemic disorders had no statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0.25, p = 0.77, p = 1.00, p = 0.28, p = 0.54, respectively). The COVID-19 group had a mean nasal MCC time of 12.00  2.51 min, compared to 9.77  2.51 min in the control group. The nasal MCC time in the COVID-19 group was statistically significantly longer (p = 0.043).

Delays in diagnosis are common [1], awareness is low, and paediatric rheumatological conditions have a considerable impact on young people and their families [2]. A lack of understanding amongst families of newly-diagnosed children leads to uncertainty and anxiety. Objectives: This patient and parent-led project developed a resource pack for parents of CYP newly-diagnosed with JIA, to provide information and support. Following a pilot, feedback from recipients was collated and analysed to help improve future provision. Methods: A young person with JIA identified the need for direct family support. Juvenile Arthritis Research (a UK charity) developed a unique pack of support information, containing resources for both children and their families -called A Little Box Of Hope. This included information about JIA and support services available for families, as well as Kipo (a children's book about JIA) and accompanying finger puppet. Clinicians at one paediatric rheumatology centre provided information about the packs to newly diagnosed families, who then requested a free box to be posted to them. Following an initial pilot study, recipients were invited to complete a short online questionnaire and provide feedback to allow refinement of the provision. Results: Respondents were asked a series of questions, each on a scale of 1-5. Every respondent gave a score of 5 in response to What do you think of the idea of A Little Box Of Hope Every parent of children under ten years old gave a score of 5 for every item when asked How useful is each item in your Little Box Of Hope Respondents also gave free-text comments: ?

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to April 05, 2021. We included studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection versus noninfected patients. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge or at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation, cardiac arrest witnessed and occurring at home, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, proportion of nonshockable rhythm and resuscitation attempted, and ambulance arrival time. RESULTS: In the ten included studies, 18% (1341/7545) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurred in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and SARS-CoV-2 infection had reduced rates of survival (16/856 [1.9%] vs. 153/2344 [6.5%]; odds ratio (OR) = 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17C0.65; P = 0.001; I(2) = 28%) and return of spontaneous circulation (188/861 [22%] vs. 640/2403 [27%]; OR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65C0.86; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%) when compared to noninfected patients.

PURPOSE The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has been a long-standing supporter of advancing pharmacy practice, specifically in the area of pharmacy practice models. In 2019, ASHP began the planning to launch PAI (Practice Advancement Initiative) 2030. PAI 2030 describes and details a bold vision for patient care, medication use, and pharmacy practice over the next decade. This work represents an ambitious goal to continue to advance the profession of pharmacy for the betterment of our patients. While much has been accomplished with the PAI, there is little literature on PAI 2030 (the authors are unaware of any published examples). SUMMARY The purpose of the article is to explain a novel state affiliate's prioritization of ASHP's PAI 2030 recommendations. In the spring of 2020, the North Carolina Association of Pharmacists (NCAP), the North Carolina state affiliate of ASHP, began discussions around PAI 2030. In the fall of 2020, prior to the NCAP Annual Convention, health-system pharmacy leaders within NCAP developed a questionnaire to serve as a PAI 2030 self-assessment. This approach allowed a state affiliate to implement an innovative program to act on the recommendations from PAI 2030. After the prioritization, health-system pharmacy leaders engaged in discussion to comment on what recommendations have been identified. The goal of this discussion was to provide NCAP a direction to pursue focused efforts to support recommendations of PAI 2030. Ultimately, NCAP seeks that this statewide approach would help advance pharmacy practice, and improve pharmacy practice across the state of North Carolina in collaboration with NCAP. CONCLUSION This discussion illustrates how a state affiliate has pursued implementing PAI 2030. This approach provides a strategy for state affiliates in addressing the recommendations within PAI 2030. A novel statewide approach can help marshal resources to advance practice when health systems partner with a state affiliate.","output":"A state affiliate's utilization of ASHP's Practice Advancement Initiative 2030 to identify current state of practice and a process to prioritize goal achievement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of global monitoring of influenza is to help decision making in regular seasonal influenza and in the case of a new pandemic. FluNet is the main tool for information sharing among the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network, as well as the public.

Weekly information on recent isolates and epidemiological situations are available to the public through many functionalities, for example, maps (animated or static), charts and raw data are embedded in the system for data display. Thus far, FluNet has collected weekly influenza surveillance data from up to 1997. A major outcome of this global network is the influenza vaccine composition, which is proposed twice a year (i.e., for both hemispheres) on the basis of the collected data. However, FluNet is far from performing comprehensive monitoring of influenza at a global level; 109 WHO member states still do not participate in the network and participating national influenza centers have only limited resources, which do not allow them to implement a reliable, accurate and real-time epidemiology of influenza in the areas they deserve.

Utilizing a narrative synthesis approach, data were mapped onto the categories, themes, and subthemes that were identified in the original review. Newly identified categories were discussed among the team until consensus was achieved. RESULTS Of the 14,166 number of records identified, 5263 remained after removal of duplicates, and 50 articles were included in the final review. Studies were predominantly conducted in the UK and were qualitative in design. In contrast to the original review, a larger number of studies sampled solely patients (n = 12), and the remainder focused on clinicians (n = 27) or a mix of clinicians and other (e.g. patients and/or family members) (n = 11). Forty-six studies explored perspectives on the nature of compassion or compassionate behaviours, traversing six themes: nature of compassion, development of compassion, interpersonal factors related to compassion, action and practical compassion, barriers and enablers of compassion, and outcomes of compassion. Four studies reported on the category of educational or clinical interventions, a notable decrease compared to the 10 studies identified in the original review. CONCLUSIONS Since the original scoping review on compassion in healthcare, while a greater number of studies incorporated patient perspectives, clinical or educational interventions appeared to be limited. More efficacious and evidence-based interventions or training programs tailored towards improving compassion for patients in healthcare is required.","output":"Compassion in healthcare: an updated scoping review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a global health pandemic and caused profound morbidity and mortality worldwide.

This research intended to delve into miR-183-5p changes in mepivacaine-mediated SH-SY5Y cell injury, as well as its modulatory mechanism on cell apoptosis. RT-qPCR was adopted for assaying miR-183-5p and PDCD4 mRNA expression. Our team respectively transfected miR-183-5p mimic and inhibitor to enhance or inhibit miR-183-5p function. We employed Western blot for detecting PDCD4 protein levels, as well as flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342/PI double staining for determining cell apoptosis rate. Additionally, our crew applied an ELISA kit for measuring TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 contents. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was examined by the Image-iT LIVE Green ROS detection Kit. As well as dual-luciferase reporter experiment for verifying the targeting link of miR-183-5p with PDCD4. In mepivacaine-induced cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, miR-183-5p expression was down-regulated. TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 contents were elevated. The rate of apoptosis increased visibly, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax levels waxed, whereas Bcl-2 level waned. MiR-183-5p could alleviate the damaging impact of mepivacaine. Dual-luciferase reporter experiments demonstrated that miR-183-5p directly targeted PDCD4. Collectively, we concluded that a high concentration of mepivacaine can cause SH-SY5Y cell damage, miR-183-5p functions crucially in mepivacaine-mediated cell damage.

We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required the rapid adaptation of work practices to accommodate social distancing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) policy changes. Many departments have recognized the wellbeing implications to staff and made changes to try and mitigate this risk. Objectives In this study, we aim to begin to understand how COVID-19 and its associated workplace practice changes have impacted the existing situation. Methods An online survey was distributed to tertiary NICU physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists and allied health professionals in British Columbia and Alberta (table 1). We employed a combination of closed- and openended questions to understand the participants' views on work in the NICU during the pandemic and how this has impacted their wellbeing. Results 142 replies of which 121 were complete. 93 were from Alberta, 45 from British Columbia, and 4 did not provide their province. Of the respondents, 33 (22.7%) had cared for a patient with COVID-19. 98.3% reported a major change as a result of COVID-19. These included homeschooling children (40, 33.3%), caring for vulnerable relatives (19, 15.8%), shielding vulnerable relatives (107, 89.2%), changes to a family member's employment (36, 30%) and being unable to connect with friends and family outside their city/province (101, 84.2%) Respondents also cited themes of personal isolation, delayed care for their or their family's non-COVID-19 physical and mental health conditions, anxiety at working on multiple sites and a lack of access to their usual daily coping strategies such as sports. There were a series of Likert-scale question, with 0 = 'Completely disagree' and 100 = 'Completely agree'. Conclusions All NICUs have made significant adaptions to their operating procedures and sought to support their staff through the pandemic, and these data suggest that this is recognised by the majority of participants. This is necessary but not sufficient. The successes we can demonstrate in the logistical response must be taken in context of a global change affecting staff 's physical, psychological and social circumstances which changes their relationship with the NICU. In future work, we aim to use quantitative and qualitative analysis from this survey in order to better understand the current state of staff wellbeing, the nature of the difficulties experienced by staff and their perception of the interventions used to support them.","output":"The effects of SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) on nicu health care providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new approach was developed to achieve the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-PD-116740, an angucyclinone from the actinomycete isolate (WP 4669).

While real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains the gold standard, commercial assays for antibodies against (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. We sought to examine five widely used commercial methods. METHODS: We measured antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with assays, Abbott-IgG, Roche-IgT (total antibodies, isotype-unspecific), EUROIMMUN-IgG, EUROIMMUN-IgA, DiaSorin-IgG, in 191 serum samples from patients with rRT-PCR proven COVID-19 between days 0 and 47 after the onset of clinical symptoms and in biobank samples collected in 2018. The assays were calibrated using the manufacturers instructions; results are in multiples of the assay specific cut-offs (Abbott, Roche, EUROIMMUN) or in arbitrary units (AU/mL, DiaSorin). RESULTS: The assays for IgG and IgT have approximately the same sensitivity and specificity for detecting seroconversion which starts at approximately day 3 after symptom onset, sensitivity reached 93 percent on day 16 and was 100 percent for each assay on day 20. The assay for IgA antibodies was superior in sensitivity and had a lower specificity than the others. Bivariate non-parametric correlation coefficients ranged between 0.738 and 0.991. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial assays for IgG or total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are largely equivalent for establishing seroconversion but differ at high antibody titres. Increased sensitivity to detect seroconversion is afforded by including IgA antibodies.

Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we compared quantitative, phenotypic and functional characteristics of circulating bulk immune cells, and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein reactive T cell between the two groups. ARDS patients demonstrated significantly higher S-protein reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to non-ARDS patients. Of interest, comparison of circulating bulk T cells in ARDS patients to non-ARDS patients demonstrated decreased frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets with activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++. Importantly, survival from ARDS (4/10) was accompanied by a recovery of the CD11a++ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Conclusively, data on S-protein reactive polyfunctional T cells indicate the ability of ARDS patients to generate antiviral protection. Furthermore, decreased frequencies of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migratory molecule CD11a++ observed in circulation of ARDS patients might suggest their involvement in ARDS development and propose CD11a-based immune signature as a possible prognostic marker.","output":"COVID-19-induced ARDS is associated with decreased frequency of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colchicine, the toxin of the autumn crocus, has various anti-inflammatory effects.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the radiographer is able to calculate CTVs of TARE simulation with the same precision as the interventional radiologist. METHODS This study retrospectively considers 17 consecutive patients (8 males, 9 females; mean age 66.3  13.2 years) who underwent pre-treatment work-up for TARE, between May 2019 and February 2020 (trial ID:2234 - protocol). For each patient, four specific parameters are evaluated from MDCT achieved during treatment simulation: healthy liver volume (HLV), the whole hepatic parenchyma (THV = healthy liver and TTV = tumour) involved by TARE, and whole liver volume (WLV). Four independent observers-R1 (expert interventional radiologist), T1, T2, and T3 (radiographers, with different experiences in the field of interventional radiology)-are involved in the imaging analysed. RESULTS All the 4 observers detected the same number of hepatic lesion(s) per patient. Regarding the three radiographers, the intra-observer reliability for CTVs is very high 0.997 to 1.000 (95%CI).

This study aimed to explore how participatory health researchers engaged in co-production research perceive and experience power, and how it is discussed and addressed within the context of research partnerships. METHODS: Five online workshops were carried out with participatory health researchers working in different global contexts. Transcripts of the workshops were analysed thematically against the Social Ecology of Power framework and mapped at the micro (individual), meso (interpersonal) or macro (structural) level. RESULTS: A total of 59 participants, with participatory experience in 24 different countries, attended the workshops. At the micro level, key findings included the rarity of explicit discussions on the meaning and impact of power, the use of reflexivity for examining assumptions and power differentials, and the perceived importance of strengthening co-researcher capacity to shift power. At the meso level, participants emphasised the need to manage co-researcher expectations, create spaces for trusted dialogue, and consider the potential risks faced by empowered community partners. Participants were divided over whether gatekeeper engagement aided the research process or acted to exclude marginalised groups from participating. At the macro level, colonial and traditional research legacies were acknowledged to have generated and maintained power inequities within research partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: The Social Ecology of Power framework is a useful tool for engaging with power inequities that cut across the social ecology, highlighting how they can operate at the micro, meso and macro level. This study reiterates that power is pervasive, and that while many researchers are intentional about engaging with power, actions and available tools must be used more systematically to identify and address power imbalances in participatory research partnerships, in order to contribute to improved equity and social justice outcomes.","output":"You want to deal with power while riding on power: global perspectives on power in participatory health research and co-production approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Potassium is the most important intracellular cation and the kidneys play a pivotal role in potassium homeostasis.

Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing.

Long-standing inequities have placed Black individuals at disproportionate risk for negative postpartum mental health outcomes. Studies are urgently needed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has added to this risk (eg, syndemic associations). Objective: To examine the association between the syndemic and the postpartum mental health of Black birthing individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal cohort of Black birthing individuals were followed up from pregnancy (April 17 to July 8, 2020) through the early postpartum period (August 11, 2020, to March 2, 2021) from urban university medical center prenatal clinics. Pregnant Black participants were recruited via email and completed 2 online surveys. Main Outcomes and Measures: Composite variables capturing negative experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and racism (structural racism [general], structural racism [neighborhood], and interpersonal racism) were created. Logistic regressions examined main and interactive associations between these variables and postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale). Results: The mean (SD) age of 151 Black participants was 30.18 (5.65) years. The association between higher negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences and postpartum depression may be influenced by experiences of interpersonal racism and general systemic racism. Negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences were associated with greater likelihood of screening positive for depression only at higher levels of systemic racism (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.38-4.60) and interpersonal racism (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.04-3.48) but not at lower levels of systemic or interpersonal racism. Similarly, negative COVID-19 experiences were associated with anxiety only at higher levels of interpersonal racism (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.86-4.01) but not at lower levels of interpersonal racism. Overall, 44 (29%) met screening criteria for postpartum depression and 20 (13%) for postpartum anxiety. Conclusions and Relevance: In this longitudinal cohort study of Black birthing individuals, the experience of the syndemic was associated with negative postpartum mental health. Associations between interpersonal racism, structural racism, and negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences were associated with greater risk for postpartum depression and anxiety. Research is needed to address how systemic racism perturbs biobehavioral pathways to magnify associations between acute stressors and mental health. Such research can inform the creation of effective, culturally informed preventive interventions to improve the postpartum mental health of Black individuals.","output":"Association of COVID-19 and Endemic Systemic Racism With Postpartum Anxiety and Depression Among Black Birthing Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human social behavior plays a crucial role in how pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 or fake news spread in a population. Social interactions determine the contact network among individuals, while spreading, requiring individual-to-individual transmission, takes place on top of the network. Studying the topological aspects of a contact network, therefore, not only has the potential of leading to valuable insights into how the behavior of individuals impacts spreading phenomena, but it may also open up possibilities for devising effective behavioral interventions. Because of the temporal nature of interactionssince the topology of the network, containing who is in contact with whom, when, for how long, and in which precise sequence, varies (rapidly) in timeanalyzing them requires developing network methods and metrics that respect temporal variability, in contrast to those developed for static (i.e., time-invariant) networks. Here, by means of event mapping, we propose a method to quantify how quickly agents mingle by transforming temporal network data of agent contacts. We define a novel measure called contact sequence centrality, which quantifies the impact of an individual on the contact sequences, reflecting the individuals behavioral potential for spreading. Comparing contact sequence centrality across agents allows for ranking the impact of agents and identifying potential behavioral super-spreaders. The method is applied to social interaction data collected at an art fair in Amsterdam. We relate the measure to the existing network metrics, both temporal and static, and find that (mostly at longer time scales) traditional metrics lose their resemblance to contact sequence centrality.

METHODS: Literature was searched up to 31 May 2021, including (randomised) controlled trials and observational studies with patients with RMD. Pending quality assessment, data extraction was performed and risk of bias (RoB) was assessed. Quality assessment required provision of (1) an appropriate COVID-19 case definition, and (2a) a base incidence (for incidence data) or (2b) a comparator, >10 cases with the outcome and risk estimates minimally adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities (for risk factor data). RESULTS: Of 5165 records, 208 were included, of which 90 passed quality assessment and data were extracted for incidence (n=42), risk factor (n=42) or vaccination (n=14). Most studies had unclear/high RoB. Generally, patients with RMDs do not face more risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (n=26 studies) or worse prognosis of COVID-19 (n=14) than individuals without RMDs. No consistent differences in risk of developing (severe) COVID-19 were found between different RMDs (n=19). Disease activity is associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis (n=2), possibly explaining the increased risk seen for glucocorticoid use (n=13). Rituximab is associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis (n=7) and possibly Janus kinase inhibitors (n=3). Vaccination is generally immunogenic, though antibody responses are lower than in controls. Vaccine immunogenicity is negatively associated with older age, rituximab and mycophenolate.

METHODS: This multi-center cross-sectional descriptive study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh among the HCPs - doctors, nurses, and other subordinates (MLSS) engaged at COVID-dedicated hospitals. The study was conducted from February 5, 2021, to March 7, 2021, using a convenience sampling method among 550 HCPs using structured questionnaire with twenty-five questions on a three-point scale of responses. RESULTS: The age range of the respondents were 18 to 64 years with the mean 36.17 10.94 years of 524 HCPs, of which the majority of the respondents were female 323 (61.6%) and 201 (38.4%) were male with the 95.27% response rate. Almost all participants had high or more than sufficient perception (94.34%) about the symptoms of COVID-19. But all categories of HCPs expressed their poor or fair practice about restraining from shaking hands, and only 6.84% of nurses, 8.33% doctors, and 11.59% of MLSS avoided crowded public gatherings as a practice of prevention. A majority (95.99%) of the HCPs showed positive attitudes about the availability of vaccines free of cost, and 87.40% showed trust in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of the HCPs from the COVID-dedicated hospitals have a good perception and positive attitude towards vaccination; nevertheless, have a poor practice of prevention toward COVID-19. This may play a vital role in motivation and wide acceptance of vaccine among the general population and contribute in comprehensive strategic planning to fight back against the pandemic in the country with the restricted resource.","output":"Perception, Preventive Practice, and Attitude Towards Vaccine Against COVID-19 Among Health Care Professionals in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The potential impact of coronavirus in Antarctica through tourism and scientific research as well as the Antarctic Treaty System is reviewed over three time periods. In the short term, to April 2021, Antarctic tourism and field-based research will be severely reduced. The impact on Antarctic governance means that few, if any, international meetings will take place thereby leaving discussions on issues, such as fishing quotas, uncertain. Looking to the medium term, to April 2024, polar tourism is unlikely to have recovered and may face collapse unless alternatives are developed. Scientific research, organised through National Antarctic Programs could be reduced due to the economics of a global recession. Moving to a long-term view of six years or so, in terms of scientific activity, this will be highly dependent on the role and status of science in society following the pandemic and the extent to which science funding gets drawn into the economics of the recession. It is unlikely that cruise tourism will have regained its previous volumes though fishing, especially if food security becomes a major issue, is likely to increase pressure on environmental management mechanisms. Both these aspects will continue to put demands on the Antarctic Treaty System and its ability to respond to a fast changing global situation.

Most patients with COVID-19 have a fever accompanied by respiratory signs and symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea. We present 36 cases with a chief complaint of Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms along with respiratory symptoms. In this study, we aimed at investigating the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. Methods: A variety of observed GI symptoms included nausea and vomiting (72.2%), diarrhea (25%), abdominal pain (19.4%), loss of appetite (14%), and anosmia (14%). The most non-GI symptoms were dyspnea (66.7%), fever (66.7%), dry cough (58.3%), myalgia (52.4%), and others. Six patients (16.6%) were critically ill, 7 (19.4%) were in stable condition, and 23 patients (64%) showed moderate symptoms. Among the patients, 7 (19.5%) needed critical care and were admitted to ICU. Leucopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated acute-phase proteins were other features observed in these patients. The most common antiviral regimen was hydroxychloroquine and oseltamivir. Finally, 32 patients (89%) were discharged, and 4 (11%) died.

The cellular pathophysiology of the motor dysfunction is beginning to be better understood, thereby providing a stronger scientific rationale for surgical interventions. Yet, to date, there are no treatments that prevent, halt, or cure PD. Surgical strategies, offer symptomatic relief or control of motor complications associated with drug treatment. Both pallidotomy and thalamotomy were extensively used in the treatment of PD in the1950s and 1960s. With the introduction of levodopa (L-dopa) in the1960s and the realization of its striking benefits, surgery was almost abandoned and used only for patients with severe tremor. Surgical therapy is now being used earlier and more often. There are currently three brain regions being considered as targets for functional neurosurgery for PD (other than transplantation) either central nervous system lesions (thalamotomy, pallidotomy, or subthalamic nucleus [STN] lesions) or deep brain stimulation. These targets are: The ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus, the internal segment of the Globus Pallidus, and the STN. AIM: The objective of the study was to assess the outcome (3 months and 6 months) of lesioning procedures in PD patients meeting the inclusion criteria. METHODS: A prospective clinical study conducted on ten idiopathic PD (IPD) patients during the period from October 2018 to March 2021 at Cairo University Hospitals. This study was concerned to improve the motor symptoms of IPD patients by stereotactic radiofrequency ablative procedures. Cases were restricted to ten patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restriction of elective cases for chronic patients at Cairo University hospitals. RESULTS: In our study, we operated on ten IPD patients who were meeting our selection criteria by ablative procedures contralateral to Parkinsonian symptoms. Age of the patients ranged 17C70 years with mean of 50.5  16.35 y with predominance in males representing six patients. Mean duration of PD according to history ranged from 2 to 12 year with mean of 8  3.1 years. Patients were divided into three groups according to their presentation and the operation done for them. Thalamotomy group: Preoperatively, the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III off and on, respectively, was 24.4/15.2 and postoperatively was 13/7.4 with improvement 47%/51%. The tremor subscore was 5.4/2.8 preoperatively and 1.4/0.8 postoperatively with average of 72% improvement. The UPDRS II pre was 17.2/11.6 and post it became 10.6/7 with 39% improvement modified H & Y 2.4/1.7 pre and postoperatively (29% improvement). Pallidotomy group: Preoperatively, the UPDRS III off and on, respectively, was 38.5/23.5 and postoperatively was 28/16 with improvement 27%/32%. The rigidity subscore was 5/2.5 preoperatively and 2/1 postoperatively with average of 60% improvement. The bradykinesia subscore was 9/5.5 preoperatively and 5.5/2.5 postoperatively with average of 47% improvement. The dyskinesia subscore was 4.5 preoperatively and 1.2 postoperatively with average of 71% improvement. The UPDRS II pre was 22/12.5 and post it became 16/10 with 25% improvement modified H & Y 2.75/2.25 pre & postoperatively (18% improvement). Combined group: Preoperatively, the UPDRS III off & on respectively was 41.33/28.67 and postoperatively was 15.67/11.33 with improvement 62%/60%. The rigidity subscore was 5/3.33 preoperatively and 1.67/1 postoperatively with average of 68% improvement. The bradykinesia subscore was 10/6 preoperatively and 4/1.33 postoperatively with average of 72% improvement. The UPDRS II pre was 28.33/19.33 and post it became 16.33/10.67 with 43% improvement modified H and Y 2.83/2 pre and post-operatively (29% improvement). Postoperatively, there was a high significant statistical finding in all clinical score and subscore of Parkinsonian symptoms. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that lesioning procedure should be revisited globally using the modern tech iques of targeting and controlled thermal lesion protocols guided by capsular somatotopy and intraoperative macroelectrode stimulation, that will improve the outcome dramatically.

Initially, in the process of risk assessment, the DEA cross-efficiency method is used to evaluate a set of risk factors obtained from the FMEA. This FMEA-DEA cross-efficiency method not only overcomes some drawbacks of FMEA, but also eliminates several limitations of DEA to offer a high discrimination capability of decision units. For risk treatment and monitoring processes, an ML mechanism is utilized to predict the degree of remaining risk depending on simulated data corresponding to the risk treatment scenario. Prediction using ML is more accurate since the predictive power of this model is better than that of DEA which potentially contains errors. The motivation for this study is that the combination of the DEA and ML approaches gives a flexible and realistic choice in risk management. Based on a case study of logistics business, the results ascertain that the short-term and urgent solutions in service cost and performance are necessary to sustainable logistics operations under the COVID-19 pandemic. The prediction findings show that the risk of skilled personnel is the next concern once the service cost and performance strategies have been prioritised.

This study would be a first step to develop vaccination services by investigating community pharmacists' intention to be involved in PDV services not just during COVID-19 pandemic but also during standard service provision in Turkey which can be taken as an example across LMICs. OBJECTIVE: Considering the efforts to empower community pharmacists in service provision, the goal of the present study was to develop a structural equation model to explain the \\"Pharmacist-Driven Vaccination Service Intention Model (PDV-SIM)\\" by using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). METHODS: Based on the constructs of TPB, a measurement tool was developed. Sub-factors of PDV service intention was determined by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In the second step, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to prove the theoretical structure of the tool. Finally, a model explaining the relationship between observed variables, latent constructs from TPB was developed by SEM analysis. RESULTS: In the proposed PDV-SIM, patient related attitude toward PDV services, attitude toward negative consequences of PDV services, and subjective norm about PDV services had an impact on the behavioral intention of community pharmacists. Nevertheless, professional development attitude toward PDV services and perceived behavioral control were not evaluated as determinants of the behavioral intention. CONCLUSION: Results of this study revealed that TPB is appropriate for modelling PDV service intention of community pharmacists. This model can be utilized as a guide to potential pharmacy regulatory bodies and policy makers in their efforts to enable community pharmacists as vaccinators across LMICs.","output":"Examining community pharmacists' intention to provide pharmacist-driven vaccination services: A structural equation modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several clinical trials have been approved for the investigation of the possible use of mAbs, supporting the potential of this technology as a therapeutic approach for infectious diseases. The first monoclonal antibody (mAb), Muromonab CD3, was introduced for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection more than 30 years ago; since then more than 100 mAbs have been approved for therapeutic purposes. Nonetheless, only four mAbs are currently employed for infectious diseases: Palivizumab, for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, Raxibacumab and Obiltoxaximab, for the prophylaxis and treatment against anthrax toxin and Bezlotoxumab, for the prevention of Clostridium difficile recurrence. Protozoan infections are often neglected diseases for which effective and safe chemotherapies are generally missing. In this context, drug resistance and drug toxicity are two crucial problems. The recent advances in bioinformatics, parasite genomics, and biochemistry methodologies are contributing to better understand parasite biology, which is essential to guide the development of new therapies. In this review, we present the efforts that are being made in the evaluation of mAbs for the prevention or treatment of leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, malaria, and toxoplasmosis. Particular emphasis will be placed on the potential strengths and weaknesses of biological treatments in the control of these protozoan diseases that are still affecting hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.","output":"Monoclonal Antibodies for Protozoan Infections: A Future Reality or a Utopic Idea?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children < 5 years globally and the parasite genus Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of that diarrhea. The global disease burden attributable to cryptosporidiosis is substantial and the only approved chemotherapeutic, nitazoxanide, has poor efficacy in HIV positive children. Chemotherapeutic development is dependent on the calf model of cryptosporidiosis, which is the best approximation of human disease. However, the model is not consistently applied across research studies. Data collection commonly occurs using two different methods: Complete Fecal Collection (CFC), which requires use of confinement housing, and Interval Collection (IC), which permits use of box stalls. CFC mimics human challenge model methodology but it is unknown if confinement housing impacts study end-points and if data gathered via this method is suitable for generalization to human populations. METHODS: Using a modified crossover study design we compared CFC and IC and evaluated the impact of housing on study end-points. At birth, calves were randomly assigned to confinement (n = 14) or box stall housing (n = 9), or were challenged with 5 x 10(7) C. parvum oocysts, and followed for 10 days. Study end-points included fecal oocyst shedding, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and plasma cortisol. FINDINGS: Calves in confinement had no significant differences in mean log oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter between CFC and IC samples (P = 0.6), nor were there diurnal variations in oocyst shedding (P = 0.1). Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001), and required more supportive care (P = 0.0009) than calves in box stalls. CONCLUSION: Housing method confounds study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis. Due to increased stress data collected from calves in confinement housing may not accurately estimate the efficacy of chemotherapeutics targeting C. parvum.","output":"Impact of confinement housing on study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant global crisis since World War II that affected almost all the countries of our planet. To control the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, it is necessary to understand how the virus is transmitted to a susceptible individual and eventually spread in the community. The primary transmission pathway of COVID-19 is human-to-human transmission through infectious droplets. However, a recent study by Greenhalgh et al. (Lancet: 397:1603-1605, 2021) demonstrates 10 scientific reasons behind the airborne transmission of SARS-COV-2. In the present study, we introduce a novel mathematical model of COVID-19 that considers the transmission of free viruses in the air besides the transmission of direct contact with an infected person. The basic reproduction number of the epidemic model is calculated using the next-generation operator method and observed that it depends on both the transmission rate of direct contact and free virus contact. The local and global stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is well established. Analytically it is found that there is a forward bifurcation between the DFE and an endemic equilibrium using central manifold theory. Next, we used the nonlinear least-squares technique to identify the best-fitted parameter values in the model from the observed COVID-19 mortality data of two major districts of India. Using estimated parameters for Bangalore urban and Chennai, different control scenarios for mitigation of the disease are investigated. Results indicate that when a vaccine crisis is there, the public health authorities should prefer to vaccinate the susceptible people compared to the recovered persons who are now healthy. Along with face mask use, treatment of hospitalized patients and vaccination of susceptibles, immigration should be allowed in a supervised manner so that economy of the overall society remains healthy.","output":"A mechanistic model for airborne and direct human-to-human transmission of COVID-19: Effect of mitigation strategies and immigration of infectious persons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS COV2 outbreak in December 2019 has resulted in a number of unprecedented changes to work, school and social care, which have the potential to impact on the psychological well-being of all age groups Research into the effects of SARS COV2, both directly and indirectly on mental health and psychological well-being is ongoing, the results and data from which are evolving","output":"Relapsing remitting linear ecchymosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most frequent viral pathogens which are the cause of nosocomial infections were presented.

Intranasal delivery of VSV-hDCT activated both CD4(+) and CD8(+) DCT-specific T-cell responses. The magnitude of these responses could be significantly increased by booster immunization with recombinant adenovirus (Ad)-hDCT, which led to enhanced efficacy against B16-F10 melanoma in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings.

Using data from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network, we measure change in monthly incidents of opioid-related overdose pre- versus post-April 1, and the significance of change by gender, age, race, drug class, and naloxone doses administered. Findings demonstrate statistically significant increases in overdose incidents among both men and women, White and Black groups, and several age groups, most notably the 30C39 and 40C49 ranges, following April 1. Significant increases were observed for overdoses involving heroin, fentanyl, fentanyl analogs or other synthetic opioids, pharmaceutical opioids, and carfentanil.

OBJECTIVES: Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study follows a qualitative research design. Between May and June 2020 N = 11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully transcribed. A qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting points for older people.

Unadjusted and multivariable negative binomial regression with robust standard errors to account for clustering of counties within each state were used to evaluate the association of COVID-19 case fatality rate and Medicaid expansion status. Adjusted models included the addition of four sets of county-level covariates thought to influence the association of Medicaid status and COVID-19 fatality rate: demographics, comorbidities, economic indicators, and physician density.

METHODS: We carried out a multisite retrospective longitudinal study of all paediatric ED attendances from 2018 including 13 March to 7 June 2020. This aligned with the initial government-enforced public health phases: delay phase, mitigation phase and reopening phase 1. RESULTS: There were 7975 total regional attendances during government-enforced restrictions. This represents 17.5% and 15.6% reductions in site attendances when compared with the two previous years. Regional attendances reduced by 52.5% in 2020 compared with 2018 and 50.9% compared with 2019. Following an initial reduction in injury attendances at the beginning of the 'lockdown' (p = 0.076), the number of injuries consistently grew as weeks progressed (p < 0.05), reaching a peak of 44.6% of all attendances. As restrictions eased, the most common location where injuries occurred moved to areas outside the home (p < 0.000). There was a significant change in injury type, final disposition and device-associated injury (p < 0.05). Wheeled recreational devices were associated with over 20% of all injuries by reopening phase 1. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that total attendances and total injuries reduced during initial phases of the lockdown.

However, little is understood about how population adaptation changes across time, how sexual vs. asexual reproduction contribute to the spread of pathogens in wild populations and how diversity measured with neutral and selectively important markers correlates across years. Here, we report results from a long-term study of epidemiological and genetic dynamics within several natural populations of the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen interaction. Using pathogen isolates collected from three populations of wild flax (L. marginale) spanning 16 annual epidemics, we probe links between pathogen population dynamics, phenotypic variation for infectivity and genomic polymorphism. Pathogen genotyping was performed using 1567 genome-wide SNP loci and sequence data from two infectivity loci (AvrP123, AvrP4). Pathogen isolates were phenotyped for infectivity using a differential set. Patterns of epidemic development were assessed by conducting surveys of infection prevalence in one population (Kiandra) annually. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed host population and ecotype as key predictors of pathogen genetic structure. Despite strong fluctuations in pathogen population size and severe annual bottlenecks, analysis of molecular variance revealed that pathogen population differentiation was relatively stable over time. Annually, varying levels of clonal spread (0-44.8%) contributed to epidemics. However, within populations, temporal genetic composition was dynamic with rapid turnover of pathogen genotypes, despite the dominance of only four infectivity phenotypes across the entire study period. Furthermore, in the presence of strong fluctuations in population size and migration, spatial selection may maintain pathogen populations that, despite being phenotypically stable, are genetically highly dynamic.","output":"Genetic analysis reveals long-standing population differentiation and high diversity in the rust pathogen Melampsora lini"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 282 million cases and almost 5.5 million deaths (WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard, 2022).

Social Democratic countries, in turn, did not fare any better than their Conservative/Corporatist counterparts once potential confounding economic and political variables were accounted for: countries economic status, healthcare spending, availability of medical personnel, hospital beds, pandemic-related income support and debt relief, electoral events, and left-power mobilization. The pandemic-related welfare responses after the first wave were similar across all three types of western democracies, but the differences in pandemic outcomes remained. The somewhat better outlook of the Liberal states could be attributed to the so-called social democratization of the Anglo-American democracies, but also to the fact that neoliberalism could have flattened the previous differences between the welfare states typologies and could have brought states closer to each other, ideologically speaking, in terms of welfare provision.","output":"COVID-19 amongst western democracies: A welfare state analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report a transnasal snare technique for retrograde primary jejunostomy placement after surgical gastrojejunostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two patients underwent the transnasal snare technique for retrograde primary jejunostomy placement. Patients included two females, age 58 and 62. In both patients, a gooseneck snare was inserted in a transnasal fashion. After insertion of the snare into the jejunum, the location was confirmed with ultrasound. The snare was then targeted using a Chiba needle through which a 0.018-inch wire was advanced and snared through the nose. The wire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch Amplatz wire over which the tract was serially dilated followed by insertion of the jejunostomy catheter through a peel-away sheath. Technical success, complications, and follow-up were recorded. RESULTS Primary jejunostomy placement was technically successful in both patients. No minor or major complications occurred. Both patients received enteral nutrition the day following placement. Follow-up was at 54 and 38 days for patients 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSION The transnasal snare technique provides a novel alternative for primary jejunostomy insertion allowing for targeting of the jejunum with improved procedural success and no complications.","output":"Transnasal Snare Technique for Retrograde Primary Jejunostomy Placement After Surgical Gastrojejunostomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a global threat to human health. In order to prevent the spread of this virus, many countries have imposed travel restrictions. This difficult situation has dramatically affected the airline industry by reducing the passenger volume, number of flights, airline flow patterns, and even has changed the entire airport network, especially in Northeast Asia (because it includes the original disease seed). However, although most scholars have used conventional statistical analysis to describe the changes in passenger volume before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, very few of them have applied statistical assessment or time series analysis, and have not even examined how the impact may be different from place to place. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry and affected areas (including the origin-destination flow and the airport network). First, a Clustering Large Applications (CLARA) algorithm was used to group numerous origin-destination (O-D) flow patterns based on their characteristics and to determine if these characteristics have changed the severity of the impact of each cluster during the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, two statistical tests (the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were utilized to determine if the entire airport network and the top 30 hub airports changed during COVID-19. Four centrality measurement indices (degree, closeness, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality) of the airports were used to assess the entire network and ranking of individual hub airports. The study data, provided by The Official Aviation Guide (OAG) from December 2019 to April 2020, indicated that during the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a decrease in passenger volume (60%C98.4%) as well as the number of flights (1.5%C82.6%). However, there were no such significant changes regarding the popularity ranking of most airports during the outbreak. Before this occurred (December 2019), most hub airports were in China (April 2020), and this trend remain similar during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the values of the centrality measurement decreased significantly for most hub airports due to travel restrictions issued by the government.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on O-D flow and airport networks in the origin country and in Northeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the early results of endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy (E-NSM) and to investigate the safety of this procedure. METHODS Between January 2002 and December 2005, a total of 87 patients with breast cancer but without skin and nipple involvement, including two cases of bilateral breast cancer, underwent E-NSM. In case of bloody nipple discharge and suspicious extension near the nipple as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, the major ducts within the nipple were cored (nipple coring). In other cases, nipple coring was not performed. RESULTS Of the 89 breasts in 87 patients, 42 had tumors of >2 cm and 80 were diagnosed as having invasive carcinoma. Lymph node involvement was observed in 36 procedures. The overall rate of nipple necrosis was 18% (16 of 89). The rate of nipple necrosis among the procedures with nipple coring was statistically higher than that among those without nipple coring (7 of 17, 41%, vs. 9 of 72, 13%) (P = .01). Nipple involvement was observed in 2.2% (2 of 89). After a median follow-up period of 52 months, distant metastasis was observed in nine cases; no local recurrences occurred in this series. CONCLUSIONS E-NSM is an oncologically safe procedure and an acceptable method in selected patients requiring a mastectomy.

The aim of this study is to investigate the help-seeking motives among users of an internet-based service for problematic alcohol use, as well as the users' experiences of the support available through the service. METHOD The study consists of a thematic analysis of interviews with 38 former users of the internet-based intervention Alkoholhj?lpen. RESULTS The analysis shows that health and relationship factors, as well as feelings of shame, were important motives for the users' decisions to reduce their drinking. Availability and anonymity seem to have been important reasons for choosing internet-based support. The different treatment components, i.e. ICBT program, therapist support and discussion forum, were each perceived as helpful by some users but not by others. Treatment components were described as more useful when users were able to personally identify with the content, and when it helped them reflect on their own alcohol consumption.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from stabilizing. Of particular concern is the sharp increase in the number of diseases in June-July 2020. The causes and consequences of this sharp increase in the number of cases are still waiting for their researchers, but there is already an urgent need to assess the possible duration of the pandemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. The resumption of international passenger traffic needs the information for deciding which countries' citizens are welcome guests. Correct simulation of the infectious disease dynamics needs complicated mathematical models and many efforts for unknown parameters identification. Constant changes in the pandemic conditions (in particular, the peculiarities of quarantine and its violation, situations with testing and isolation of patients) cause various epidemic waves, lead to changes in the parameter values of the mathematical models. Objective. In this article, pandemic waves in Ukraine and in the world will be detected, calculated and discussed. The estimations for hidden periods, epidemic durations and final numbers of cases will be presented. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers will be calculated for different countries and regions. Methods. We propose a simple method for the epidemic waves detection based on the differentiation of the smoothed number of cases. We use the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for the dynamics of the epidemic waves. The known exact solution of the SIR differential equations and statistical approach were modified and used. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified for four waves of pandemic dynamics in Ukraine and five waves in the world. The number of cases and the number of patients spreading the infection versus time were calculated. In particular, the pandemic probably began in August 2019. If current trends continue, the end of the pandemic should be expected no earlier than in March 2021 both in Ukraine and in the world, the global number of cases will exceed 20 million. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers were calculated for different countries and regions. Conclusions. The SIR model and statistical approach to the parameter identification are helpful to make some reliable estimations of the epidemic waves. The number of persons spreading the infection versus time was calculated during all the epidemic waves. The obtained information will be useful to regulate the quarantine activities, to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic and to decide which countries' citizens are welcome guests.","output":"Waves of COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey was conducted during the national lockdown in April 2020 when the Italian government extended the quarantine measures to the whole country. Results: Results showed that women reported higher scores on perceived severity, worry, precautionary behaviors, and attitudes toward quarantine restrictions. Gender differences in the perceived likelihood of infection with SARS-CoV-2 were not significant. Using mediation analysis, we found that the relationship between gender and precautionary behaviors was explained by attitudes toward quarantine restrictions, perceived severity, and worry. Limitations: The use of a cross-sectional design precludes causal inference.

The virus, SARS-CoV-2 can cause a range of symptoms ranging from mild through fulminant respiratory failure. Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients require admission to the intensive care unit, with the majority of those requiring mechanical ventilation. High density consolidations in the bronchial tree and in the pulmonary parenchyma have been described in the advanced phase of the disease. We noted a subset of patients who had a sudden, significant increase in peak airway, plateau and peak inspiratory pressures. Partial or complete ETT occlusion was noted to be the culprit in the majority of these patients. METHODS With institutional IRB approval, we examined a subset of our mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. All of the patients were admitted to one of our COVID-19 ICUs. Each was staffed by a board certified intensivist. During multidisciplinary rounds, all arterial blood gas (ABG) results, ventilator settings and ventilator measurements are discussed and addressed. ARDSNet Protocols are employed. In patients with confirmed acute occlusion of the endotracheal tube (ETT), acute elevation in peak airway and peak inspiratory pressures are noted in conjunction with desaturation. Data was collected retrospectively and demographics, ventilatory settings and ABG results were recorded. RESULTS Our team has observed impeded ventilation in intubated patients who are several days into the critical course.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the timing for safe tracheal intubation in elderly patients can be determined by acceleromyographically monitoring paralysis of the adductor pollicis muscle when high-dose rocuronium, given to block the respiratory muscles, is administered. METHODS: Forty elderly (65-92 years) patients were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to two groups, to receive rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg. After induction of anesthesia and observing acceleromyographic train-of-four (TOF) responses of the adductor pollicis muscle to ulnar nerve stimulation, the patients randomly received either dose of rocuronium. The onset times from rocuronium administration to TOF counts of 0 were measured. Soon thereafter, a single anesthesiologist who was blinded to the allocated dose of rocuronium performed laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, and assessed intubating conditions. Data were analyzed by the unpaired t-test and Chi-squared test. RESULTS: The averaged [SD] onset time of neuromuscular blockade was significantly shorter with 1 mg/kg than 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium (104.3 [30.1] s vs. 186.8 [37.5] s, p < 0.001).

The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing ORF3 and envelope gene deletions, as well as mutated transcriptional regulator sequences, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. Thus, the trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development.","output":"A trans-complementation system for SARS-CoV-2 recapitulates authentic viral replication without virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Homeopathic Pathogenetic Trials (Proving) are human studies to examine the pathogenetic effects of investigational drugs in high dilution on healthy volunteers. As a part of the new coronavirus nosode development process for prophylactic use, the phase 1 study was conducted. The documentation of proving symptoms for a fast-track nosode development for a pandemic condition was the objective of this study. Materials and methods: An open-label trial to evaluate the safety and proving symptoms of Coronavirus nosode given orally to 10 volunteers (18-65 years age and of both genders). Volunteers were administered 6 doses of nosode as 6 pills twice daily in 30c dilution (size 30 globules) for 3 consecutive days. Pre and post-examination (physical), vital signs, and laboratory investigations were done on days 0, 17, 34. Symptoms experienced by the volunteers were recorded. Results: Symptoms reported by volunteers were analyzed. The symptoms reported were mild to severe but reversible and matching with the symptoms produced by the viral infection. There were no serious/fatal adverse events during the study. The basic biochemistry and Liver Function tests were not affected by the Nosode. Conclusion: New nosode developed during a pandemic condition produced specific symptoms in the homeopathic pathogenetic trial as a part of the Phase 1 study. ?

The PPP program, created by the U.S. government as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, provides loans to small businesses so they can keep employees on their payroll. We argue that the historical record and PPP program design choices made it likely that many Black-owned businesses received smaller PPP loans than White-owned businesses. Using newly released data on the PPP program, we find that Black-owned businesses received loans that were approximately 50% lower than observationally similar White-owned businesses. The effect is marginally smaller in areas with more bank competition and disappeared over time as changes to the PPP program were implemented allowing for entry by fintechs and other non-traditional lenders. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: We find that Black-owned businesses received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program that were approximately 50 percent lower than White-owned businesses with similar characteristics. However, this difference in loan size shrank over time as more non-bank lenders such as fintechs were allowed to participate in the program and began approving PPP loans. Loan size differences were also slightly smaller in zip codes containing a larger number of bank branches. These results are consistent with prior research which shows lending discrimination by commercial banks against Black borrowers. It is also consistent with studies showing that greater access to and competition among banks and other lenders can reduce discrimination. In light of these results we recommend that policy makers account for existing racial inequalities within banking or other systems in their program design to produce more equitable outcomes.","output":"Discrimination in lending?

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of M(pro), a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. M(pro) plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41CCys145, M(pro) contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nucleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV M(pro), but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of M(pro) are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N() (HD) and N(?) (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","output":"Inhibitor binding influences the protonation states of histidines in SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the global shutdown of tourism at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, small island developing states such as The Bahamas had their economies immobilized due to their heavy dependence on the industry.

This paper suggests conduits for economic development using a traditional strength, coastal and marine tourism, in conjunction with the emerging fields of ocean renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, marine biotechnology, and bioprospecting. The interlinkages between each activity are discussed. Knowledge gaps in offshore aquaculture, ocean renewable energy, marine biotechnology, and marine environment monitoring are identified. In each sector case, strategic and tactical decision-making can be achieved through the exploitation of ocean numerical modeling and observations, and consequently should be invested in and developed alongside the requisite computational resources.

The first hypothesis suggests a greater involvement of the right hemisphere in emotion perception whereas the second hypothesis suggests different involvements of each hemisphere as a function of the valence of the emotion. These hypotheses are based on findings for facial and prosodic emotion perception. Investigating emotion perception for other stimuli, such as music, should provide further insight and potentially help to disentangle between these two hypotheses. The present study investigated musical emotion perception in patients with unilateral right brain damage (RBD, n = 16) or left brain damage (LBD, n = 16), as well as in matched healthy comparison participants (n = 28). The experimental task required explicit recognition of musical emotions as well as ratings on the perceived intensity of the emotion. Compared to matched comparison participants, musical emotion recognition was impaired only in LBD participants, suggesting a potential specificity of the left hemisphere for explicit emotion recognition in musical material. In contrast, intensity ratings of musical emotions revealed that RBD patients underestimated the intensity of negative emotions compared to positive emotions, while LBD patients and comparisons did not show this pattern. To control for a potential generalized emotion deficit for other types of stimuli, we also tested facial emotion recognition in the same patients and their matched healthy comparisons. This revealed that emotion recognition after brain damage might depend on the stimulus category or modality used. These results are in line with the hypothesis of a deficit of emotion perception depending on lesion laterality and valence in brain-damaged participants. The present findings provide critical information to disentangle the currently debated competing hypotheses and thus allow for a better characterization of the involvement of each hemisphere for explicit emotion recognition and their perceived intensity.","output":"Recognition of musical emotions and their perceived intensity after unilateral brain damage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Although studies shows that symptom clusters and illness perceptions are negatively associated with quality of life (QoL), it is unclear how these variables of cervical cancer patients who receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) relate to each other.

Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test showed that the probabilities of survival for patients with extrapulmonary organ injury were significantly lower than those without extrapulmonary organ injury. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that only myocardial injury (P=0.000, HR: 5.068, 95% CI: 2.728-9.417) and circulatory system injury (P=0.000, HR: 4.076, 95% CI: 2.216-7.498) were the independent factors associated with COVID-19 patients' poor prognosis. Conclusions: Older age, lymphocytopenia, high level of D-Dimer and IL-6, and the severity of lung injury were the high-risk factors of extrapulmonary organ injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocardial and circulatory system injury were the most important risk factors related to poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Early risk factors for extrapulmonary organ injury in adult COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rates of physician burnout, depression, and suicide have been on the rise over the past 50 years.

Currently, the management of COVID-19 infection is mainly supportive. Several clinical trials worldwide are evaluating several drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we give a brief overview of pharmacological agents and other therapies which are under investigation as treatment options or adjunctive agents for patients infected with COVID-19 and for chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. At the time of writing this commentary, there is no peer-reviewed published evidence from randomized clinical trials of any pharmacological agents improving outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, it was reported that remdesivir an investigational antiviral agent hastens clinical recovery, but a study is yet to be published in peer-reviewed medical journal.","output":"Potential pharmacological agents for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use state-of-the-art computer-aided drug design (CADD) techniques to identify prospective inhibitors of the main protease enzyme, 3CL(pro) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19. From our screening of over one million compounds including approved drugs, investigational drugs, natural products, and organic compounds, and a rescreening protocol incorporating enzyme dynamics via ensemble docking, we have been able to identify a range of prospective 3CL(pro) inhibitors. Importantly, some of the identified compounds had previously been reported to exhibit inhibitory activities against the 3CL(pro) enzyme of the closely related SARS-CoV virus. The top-ranking compounds are characterized by the presence of multiple bi- and monocyclic rings, many of them being heterocycles and aromatic, which are flexibly linked allowing the ligands to adapt to the geometry of the 3CL(pro) substrate site and involve a high amount of functional groups enabling hydrogen bond formation with surrounding amino acid residues, including the catalytic dyad residues H41 and C145. Among the top binding compounds we identified several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which include a bioflavonoid, the group of natural products that binds best to 3CL(pro). Another class of compounds that decently binds to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease are steroid hormones, which thus may be endogenous inhibitors and might provide an explanation for the age-dependent severity of COVID-19. Many of the compounds identified by our work show a considerably stronger binding than found for reference compounds with in vitro demonstrated 3CL(pro) inhibition and anticoronavirus activity. The compounds determined in this work thus represent a good starting point for the design of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.","output":"High Throughput Virtual Screening to Discover Inhibitors of the Main Protease of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying the targets of an antimicrobial peptide is a fundamental step in studying the innate immune response and combating antibiotic resistance, and more broadly, precision medicine and public health. There have been extensive studies on the statistical and computational approaches to identify (i) whether a peptide is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) or a non-AMP and (ii) which targets are these sequences effective to (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, etc.). Despite the existing deep learning methods on this problem, most of them are unable to handle the small AMP classes (anti-insect, anti-parasite, etc.). And more importantly, some AMPs can have multiple targets, which the previous methods fail to consider. In this study, we build a diverse and comprehensive multi-label protein sequence database by collecting and cleaning amino acids from various AMP databases. To generate efficient representations and features for the small classes dataset, we take advantage of a protein language model trained on 250 million protein sequences. Based on that, we develop an end-to-end hierarchical multi-label deep forest framework, HMD-AMP, to annotate AMP comprehensively. After identifying an AMP, it will further predict what targets the AMP can effectively kill from eleven available classes. Extensive experiments suggest that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in both the binary classification task and the multi-label classification task, especially on the minor classes. Compared with the previous deep learning methods, our method improves the performance on macro-AUROC by 11%. The model is robust against reduced features and small perturbations and produces promising results. We believe HMD-AMP will both contribute to the future wet-lab investigations of the innate structural properties of different antimicrobial peptides and build promising empirical underpinnings for precise medicine with antibiotics.","output":"HMD-AMP: Protein Language-Powered Hierarchical Multi-label Deep Forest for Annotating Antimicrobial Peptides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 started to spread throughout the world causing the COVID-19 that has taken a considerable number of lives.

This caused an unprecedented emergency situation with significant negative effects on health and well-being both on an individual and societal level. Apart from health, economic and social consequences, the impact of this pandemic on mental health is increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. The present review aimed to provide a comprehensive discussion of the possible neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, together with the related underlying molecular pathways. In addition, the present review focused on populations which are at a higher risk of developing psychiatric disturbances due to the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed possible routes of clinical management and therapeutics to minimize the burden associated with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, research findings exploring the prevalence of COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms across vulnerable groups, including children, adolescents and COVID-19 survivors are presented, with particular emphasis on those with severe disease who required hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admission. Based on the available literature, the identification of potential determinants associated with PTSD across the different populations is underlined.
