Drawing on interviews with NGO representatives involved in three Northern California wildfires in 2017 and 2018, this study identifies challenges and opportunities for NGOs supporting wildfire relief and recovery. Across fires and NGOs, NGO management and wellbeing, coordination and disaster experiences emerge as common barriers and enablers of relief and recovery. In many cases, local NGOs' participation in wildfire relief and recovery included simultaneous expansion of an organisation's mission and activities and negative impacts on staff mental health. Under the rapidly evolving circumstances of relief and the prolonged burdens of recovery, personal relationships across NGOs and government agencies significantly improved coordination of assistance to communities. Finally, interviewees expressed greater confidence when responding to wildfires if they had previous experience with a disaster, although the COVID-19 pandemic presented distinct challenges on top of pre-existing long-term recovery work. Despite repeated assertions that interviewees' experiences reflected only their individual community or wildfire, key challenges and opportunities were consistent across disasters. These results may aid other NGOs in preparing to provide immediate disaster relief and long-term recovery in California and other wildfire-prone areas.","output":"Roles and experiences of non-governmental organisations in wildfire response and recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) epidemics represent the biggest global health threats in the last two decades. These infections manifest as bronchitis, pneumonia or severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness. The novel coronavirus seems to be associated with milder infections but it has spread globally more rapidly becoming a pandemic. This review summarises the state of the art of nanotechnology-based affinity biosensors for SARS, MERS and COVID-19 detection. The nanobiosensors are antibody- or DNA-based biosensors with electrochemical, optical or FET-based transduction. Various kinds of nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles, nanowires and graphene, have been merged to the affinity biosensors to enhance their analytical performances. The advantages of the use of the nanomaterials are highlighted, and the results compared with those obtained using non-nanostructured biosensors. A critical comparison with conventional methods, such as RT-PCR and ELISA, is also reported. It is hoped that this review will provide interesting information for the future development of new reliable nano-based platforms for point-of-care diagnostic devices for COVID-19 prevention and control.

Until recently, the normative approach underlying this advice was described in a 2008 document entitled Social value judgements: Principles for the development of NICE guidance (SVJ). In January 2020, however, NICE replaced SVJ with a new articulation of its guiding principles. Given the significant evolution of NICEs methods between 2008 and 2020, this study examines whether this new document (Principles) offers a transparent account of NICEs current normative approach. It finds that it does not, deriving much of its content directly from SVJ and failing to fully acknowledge or explain how and why NICEs approach has since changed. In particular, Principles is found to offer a largely procedural account of NICE decision-making, despite evidence of the increasing reliance of NICEs methods on substantive decision-rules and modifiers that cannot be justified in purely procedural terms. Thus, while Principles tells NICEs stakeholders much about how the organisation goes about the process of decision-making, it tells them little about the substantive grounds on which its decisions are now based. It is therefore argued that Principles does not offer a transparent account of NICEs normative approach (either alone, or alongside other documents) and that, given NICEs reliance on transparency as a requirement of procedural justice, NICE does not in this respect satisfy its own specification of a just decision-maker.","output":"Justice, Transparency and the Guiding Principles of the UKs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 52 papers The topics discussed include: the effect of urban infrastructure development on female labor force participation among the poor and middle class in India;understanding the sensibility of social media use and privacy with Bangladeshi facebook group users;persuasive information campaign to save water in universities: an option for water-stressed areas?;digital interventions to improve health and nutrition outcomes for children from low-income communities;an alternative to India's reservation policy: a unified framework for rigorous and adaptive measurement of socio-economic status;COVID-19 on facebook ads: competing agendas around a public health crisis;gaze-based screening of autistic traits for adolescents and young adults using prosaic videos;and information technology (IT) and welfare in India: does IT work?","output":"COMPASS 2020 - Proceedings of the 2020 3rd ACM SIGCAS Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The homotypic and heterotypic antibody response to rotavirus was determined in three pony mares and their foals.

The aim of this article is, therefore, to understand the public perception of socioeconomic crisis and human stress in resource-limited settings of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 outbreak. The sample comprised of 1066 Bangladeshi participants. Principal component analysis (PCA) was considered to design a standardized scale to measure the mental stress and socioeconomic crisis, one-way ANOVA and t-test were conducted to perceive different demographic risk groups; multiple linear regression was applied to estimate the statistically significant association between each component, and classical test theory (CTT) analysis was applied to examine the reliability of each item according to the components to develop a composite score. Without safeguarding the fundamental needs for the vulnerable ultra-poor group can undeniably cause the socioeconomic crisis and mental stress due to the COVID-19 lockdown. It has further created unemployment, deprivation, hunger, and social conflicts. The weak governance in the fragile healthcare system exacerbates the general public's anxiety as the COVID-19 testing facilities are centered around in the urban areas, a long serial to be tested, minimum or no treatment facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients are the chief observations hampered along with the disruption of other critical healthcare services. One-way ANOVA and t-test confirmed food and nutritional deficiency among the vulnerable poorest section due to loss of livelihood. Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed. Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak.

DESIGN: A hospital-based observational follow-up study. SETTING: Internal Medicine Service of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan, from 26 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, aged &#8805;18 years. METHODS: ALC was categorised into low, intermediate and high level and patients were triaged using the standard emergency severity illness score. All patients were followed until the end of hospital admission for the outcome of case fatality and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 822 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period and 699 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.5 years and 67% were males; 50.4% were triaged to low, 42.5% to intermediate and 7.2% to high acuity care. The overall case-fatality rate was 11.6%, with the highest (52%) in high acuity level followed by 16.2% in intermediate and 2% in low acuity care. Acuity level was associated with case fatality, with an HR (95% CI) of 5.0 (2.0 to 12.1) for high versus low acuity care and an HR of 2.7 (1.2, 6.4) for intermediate versus low acuity care, after adjusting for age, sex and common comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic lung disease. Similarly, acuity level was also associated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: High and intermediate acuity level is associated with higher case fatality rate and prolonged length of hospital stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. In resource-limited settings where the provision of high acuity care is limited, the intermediate care acuity could serve as a useful strategy to treat relatively less critical patients with COVID-19.","output":"Acuity level of care as a predictor of case fatality and prolonged hospital stay in patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based observational follow-up study from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune/antigen-mediated esophageal disease characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation.

We aimed to assess mental health status in children in the context of COVID-19, with a focus on discharged children. Methods: We recruited discharged children who recovered from COVID-19 and healthy controls between July and September 2020 in Wuhan Children's Hospital. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were assessed in these children using questionnaires. Univariable and multivariable logistic and linear regressions were conducted to identify risk factors. Results: Totally, there were 152 children (61 discharged children and 91 healthy controls) aged 7C18 years old in our study. An increasing trend in the prevalence of PTSD, anxiety, and depression was observed in the discharged children compared with healthy controls (PTSD: 8.20 vs. 2.20%, anxiety: 22.95 vs. 13.19%; depression: 47.54 vs. 32.97%).

We argue that there are at least two reasons making inspectability challenging: (i) representations are distributed across hundreds of channels and (ii) a unifying metric quantifying inspectability is lacking. In this paper, we address both issues by proposing Semantic Bottlenecks (SB), integrated into pretrained networks, to align channel outputs with individual visual concepts and introduce the model agnostic AUiC metric to measure the alignment. We present a case study on semantic segmentation to demonstrate that SBs improve the AUiC up to four-fold over regular network outputs. We explore two types of SB-layers in this work: while concept-supervised SB-layers (SSB) offer the greatest inspectability, we show that the second type, unsupervised SBs (USB), can match the SSBs by producing one-hot encodings. Importantly, for both SB types, we can recover state of the art segmentation performance despite a drastic dimensionality reduction from 1000s of non aligned channels to 10s of semantics-aligned channels that all downstream results are based on.

Design: Two cohort studies, on behalf of NHS England. Setting: Primary care data and pseudonymously-linked SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing data, hospital admissions, and death records from England. Participants: Study 1: 70,464 people with atrial fibrillation (AF) and CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2. Study 2: 372,746 people with non-valvular AF. Main outcome measures: Time to test for SARS-CoV-2, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 related hospital admission, COVID-19 deaths or non-COVID-19 deaths in Cox regression. Results: In Study 1, we included 52,416 current OAC users and 18,048 non-users. We observed no difference in risk of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 associated with current use (adjusted HR, 1.01, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.05) versus non-use. We observed a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR, 0.73, 95%CI, 0.60 to 0.90), and COVID-19 deaths (adjusted HR, 0.69, 95%CI, 0.49 to 0.97) associated with current use versus non-use.

RESULTS Results suggested that the two white rot fungi responded differently when exposed to the different concentrations of TCS. In general, P. ostreatus exhibited more potential and ligninolytic enzymatic activity compared to T. versicolor. LC-MS/MS analyses also showed that P. ostreatus degraded TCS with higher efficiency compared to T. versicolor. In addition, almost all P. ostreatus biodegradation activity was completed within the first day of sampling. Contrasting, less efficient degradation was observed by T. versicolor, reaching around 88% of TCS biodegradation at concentration of 20 g mL-1after 10 days. At higher TCS concentrations (30 g mL-1), the growth of T. versicolor severely inhibited and led to a drop in enzymatic activity and biodegradation. Furthermore, laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were determined as more involved enzymes which significantly correlated to TCS biodegradation by T. versicolor and P. ostreatus, respectively. CONCLUSION P. ostreatus might be considered as efficient fungus in biodegradation of high amount of TCS in environmental matrices. The results of the present study might provide insights for future investigations on potential of fungi for applications in bioaugmentation-based strategies to remove TCS from wastewater and activated sludge.","output":"Effect of Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor on triclosan biodegradation and activity of laccase and manganese peroxidase enzymes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucosal surfaces are the interface between the hosts internal milieu and the external environment, and they have dual functions, serving as physical barriers to foreign antigens and as accepting sites for vital materials. Mucosal vaccines are more favored to prevent mucosal infections from the portal of entry. Although mucosal vaccination has many advantages, licensed mucosal vaccines are scarce. The most widely studied mucosal routes are oral and intranasal. Licensed oral and intranasal vaccines are composed mostly of whole cell killed or live attenuated microorganisms serving as both delivery systems and built-in adjuvants. Future mucosal vaccines should be made with more purified antigen components, which will be relatively less immunogenic. To induce robust protective immune responses against well-purified vaccine antigens, an effective mucosal delivery system is an essential requisite. Recent developments in biomaterials and nanotechnology have enabled many innovative mucosal vaccine trials. For oral vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should be able to stably carry antigens and adjuvants and resist harsh physicochemical conditions in the stomach and intestinal tract. Besides many nano/microcarrier tools generated by using natural and chemical materials, the development of oral vaccine delivery systems using food materials should be more robustly researched to expand vaccine coverage of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. For intranasal vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should survive the very active mucociliary clearance mechanisms and prove safety because of the anatomical location of nasal cavity separated by a thin barrier. Future mucosal vaccine carriers, regardless of administration routes, should have certain common characteristics. They should maintain stability in given environments, be mucoadhesive, and have the ability to target specific tissues and cells.","output":"Current and New Approaches for Mucosal Vaccine Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To evaluate attitudes and perceptions toward virtual health (VH) and its usage among eye care providers before, during, and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: In April and May 2020, an online survey comprised of questions regarding past and current VH practices, as well as plans for future use was distributed among eye care providers nationwide. Results: Of the 117 eye care providers who completed the survey, 96.6% were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, 77.4% reported using VH during the pandemic. The majority of visits were for red eye (64.4%, n = 56) and ocular surface complaints (58.6%, n = 51). Examination components tested virtually varied, but most respondents felt these were at least \\"somewhat reliable.\\" Almost half of respondents (45%) felt it was \\"very easy\\" or \\"somewhat easy\\" to implement VH and the majority (53.8%, n = 43) were able to get it up and running in under a week. The majority felt the transition to VH was positive (57.5%), however, only 50.4% (n = 53) of those providers planned to use VH regularly once able to see patients safely in clinic again. Conclusions: While the majority of U.S. eye care providers who responded were not using VH before the COVID-19 pandemic, just months into the U.S. outbreak, 77.4% were using VH in their daily practice. In general, providers used these platforms for urgent examinations, adnexal disease, and postoperative care most often.

Bibenzyls are steroidal ethane derivatives, resembling the structural moiety of bioactive dihydro-stilbenoids or iso-quinoline alkaloids. These stress triggered secondary metabolites are the by-products of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Different classes of bryophytes (Bryophyta, Marchantiophyta and Anthocerotophyta) possess different subtypes of bibenzyls and dimeric bisbibenzyls. Among the liverwort, hornwort and mosses, former one is mostly enriched with bibenzyl type constituents as per the extensive study conducted for phytochemical deposit. Considering macrocyclic and acyclic group of bibenzyls and bisbybenzyls, generally marchantin type compounds are reported vividly for significant biological activity that includes neuro-nephro-cardio-protection besides anti-allergic, anti-microbial, anti-apoptotic and cytotoxic activities studied on in-vitro and in-vivo models or on cell lines. RESULT: The critical analysis of reported chemical and pharmaceutical attributions of bibenzyls and bis-bibenzyls yielded detailed report on this compound class along with their application, mode of action, natural source, techniques of synthesis, extraction procedure, isolation and characterization. Further, the structure activity relationship studies and bioactivity of bibenzyls derived from non-bryophytic origin were also summarized. CONCLUSION: This review encompasses prospective biological application of botanical reservoir of this primarily ignored, primeval land plant group where recent technical advances has paved the way for qualitative and quantitative isolation and estimation of novel compounds as well as marker components to study their impact on environment, as bio-control agents and as key leads in future drug designing.

IRAK-M, a member of IRAK family, is a negative regulator in TLR signaling and specifically expresses in monocytes and macrophages. The role of IRAK-M in intracellular growth of M. tb and macrophage polarization was explored, for deeply understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb, the significance of IRAK-M to innate immunity and pathogen-host interaction. METHODS: IRAK-M expression was detected in M. tb infected macrophages and in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis with immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. IRAK-M knock-down and over-expressing cell strains were constructed and intracellular survival of M. tb was investigated by acid-fast staining and colony forming units. Molecular markers of M1-type (pSTAT1 and iNOS) and M2-type (pSTAT6 and Arg-1) macrophages were detected using Western blot in IRAK-M knockdown U937 cells infected with M. tb H37Rv. U937 cells were stimulated with immunostimulant CpG7909 into M1 status and then infected with M. tb H37Rv. Expression of IRAK-M, IRAK-4 and iNOS was detected with immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, to evaluate the effect of IRAK-M to CpG directed M1-type polarization of macrophages during M. tb infection. Molecules related with macrophages bactericidal ability such as Hif-1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: IRAK-M increased in M. tb infected macrophage cells and also in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis. IRAK-M over-expression resulted in higher bacterial load, while IRAK-M interference resulted in lower bacterial load in M. tb infected cells. During M. tb infection, IRAK-M knockdown induced M1-type, while inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage. M1-type polarization of U937 cells induced by CpG7909 was inhibited by M. tb infection, which was reversed by IRAK-M knockdown in U937 cells. IRAK-M affected Hif-1 and MAPK signaling cascade during M. tb infection. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, IRAK-M might alter the polarity of macrophages, to facilitate intracellular survival of M. tb and affect Th1-type immunity of the host, which is helpful to understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb.","output":"IRAK-M alters the polarity of macrophages to facilitate the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Survivors of COVID-19 can present with varied and persisting symptoms, regardless of hospitalisation.

Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has had a critical role in tracking the emergence, introduction, and spread of new variants, which may affect transmissibility, pathogenicity, and escape from infection or vaccine-induced immunity. As anticipated, the rapid increase in COVID-19 infections in Iraq in February 2021 is due to the introduction of variants of concern during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave in Iraq (2021), we sequenced 76 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes using NGS technology and identified genomic mutations and proportions of circulating variants among these. Also, we performed an in silico study to predict the effect of the truncation of NS7a protein (ORF7a) on its function. We detected nine different lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 lineage was predominant (80.20%) from February to May 2021, while only one B.1.351 strain was detected. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis showed that multiple strains of the B.1.1.7 lineage clustered closely with those from European countries. A notable frequency (43.33%) of stop codon mutation (NS7a Q62stop) was detected among the B.1.1.7 lineage sequences. In silico analysis of NS7a with Q62stop found that this stop codon had no considerable effect on the function of NS7a.

Method: The databases of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from the establishment to June 2021. All randomized controlled trials about rTMS treatment for PSD were enrolled. Dysphagia Grade (DG) and Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) were applied as the major dysphagia severity rating scales to evaluate the outcomes. Results: A total of 12 clinical randomized controlled studies were included in our study. The summary effect size indicated that rTMS had a positive effect on PSD (SMD = -0.67, p < 0.001). The subgroup analysis for treatment duration and different stroke stages showed significant differences (treatment duration >5 days: SMD = -0.80, p < 0.001; subacute phase after stroke: SMD = -0.60, p < 0.001). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed among the other stimulation parameter subgroups (including stimulation frequency, location, and a single stimulation time) (p > 0.05). Conclusion: rTMS is beneficial to the recovery of PSD patients, while an intervention of more than 5 days and in the subacute phase after stroke might bring new strategies and rational therapeutics to the treatment of PSD.

Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. METHODS: Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (n = 855, 82%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (n = 829, 78%) and work-flow optimization (n = 802, 77%). Ethical and legal issues (n = 630, 62%) and lack of knowledge (n = 584, 57%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (n = 819, 79%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (n = 241, 23%).

This study examined core emergency response competencies of Chinese nursing personnel related to the outbreak of major infectious diseases. METHODS: A survey was conducted among 960 nurses working in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Data were collected on core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel caring for patients with major infectious diseases, measuring overall competency as well as by dimensions of prevention ability, rescue ability, and preparation ability. A t-test and one-way analysis of variance were first analyzed for differences between groups, followed by multiple linear regression to analyze main influencing factors for core emergency response competencies. RESULTS: The average score for core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel delivering care to patients with major infectious diseases was 128.05 (SD 22.23) (range 36-180 points); or 71%, which is equivalent to moderate performance. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main influencing factors for these nursing personnel were before participation in emergency drills for infectious diseases, current educational background, and working experience in the realm of infectious disease nursing.

RESULTS: In the Finnish environment, the results, based on our study sample, show that with electronic prescriptions and the direct dispensing model, the delivery time for a single medication over the counter was reduced by 13%. The results also indicate that the process has become more predictable, as the variation in terms of the workflow lead time has decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the dispensing process has become more efficient in terms of time and throughput as well as more technically oriented and predictable. From a sociotechnical perspective, the results indicate that the technical subsystem has strengthened, and pharmacies have adapted to the new technology in the dispensing process.","output":"Electronic prescription as a driver for digitalization in Finnish pharmacies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a critical review of recent therapeutic advances in long-acting (LA) modalities for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: LA injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been approved in the United States, Canada and Europe; the United States also has approved LA injectable preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the World Health Organization has recommended the vaginal PrEP ring. Current LA PrEP modalities in clinical trials include injections, films, rings, and implants; LA ART modalities in trials include subcutaneous injections and long-term oral pills. Although LA modalities hold incredible promise, global availability is inhibited by long-standing multilevel perils including declining multilateral funding, patent protections and lack of political will. Once available, access and uptake are limited by factors such as insurance coverage, clinic access, labor markets, stigma, and structural racism and sexism. These must be addressed to facilitate equitable access for all. SUMMARY: There have been tremendous recent advances in the efficacy of LA ART and PrEP modalities, providing renewed hope that ending the HIV epidemic is within reach. However, pervasive socio-structural inequities limit the promise of LA modalities, highlighting the need for cautious optimism in light of the embedded inequities in the trajectory of research, development, and population-level implementation.","output":"Promise, perils and cautious optimism: the next frontier in long-acting modalities for the treatment and prevention of HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alexander Georgievich Petrenko, a talented, creative biochemist, well known for his key contributions to the wider field of receptor biology, passed away on 2 May 2021, shortly after contracting COVID\\\\19.

Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV care delivery has been restructured and the impact on HIV outcomes is unknown. The objectives of this study were first, to examine the risk of severe COVID-19 among PWH, using a definition incorporating clinical risk factors, and second, to examine the pandemics impact on HIV care. We used data from the DC Cohort, a large cohort of people receiving HIV care in Washington, DC. We found that a high proportion of participants across all age groups qualified as increased (58%) or high risk (34%) for severe COVID-19. Between 2019 and 2020, encounters increased (17.7%, increasing to 23.5% of active DC Cohort participants had an encounter) while laboratory utilization decreased (14.4%, decreasing to 11.4% of active DC Cohort participants had an HIV RNA test performed). Implications of our work include the importance of protecting vulnerable people with HIV from acquiring COVID-19 and potentially manifesting severe complications through strategies including vaccination. Additionally, acknowledging that HIV service delivery will likely be changed long-term by the pandemic, adaptation is required to ensure continued progress towards 90-90-90 goals.

Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to the containment, vaccine exploration and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, when unusual temperature dependence was discovered from the 1550cm-1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27C and 31C, with the relative absorbance matches at 37C the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs 12). Meanwhile the ratio of bonds at 27C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials rather than by the laymans guess, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. As a result, the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody will be more conclusive beyond 31C, instead of at the usual room temperature of 20C - 25C, when the vaccine research and antibody diagnosis would likely be undermined. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, are not only of clinical significance in particular, but also of a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of the vaccine-antibody interactions in general.","output":"Binding strength and hydrogen bond numbers between Covid-19 RBD and HVR of antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the wellbeing of people worldwide, potentially increasing maladaptive psychological responses of vulnerable populations.

A significant predictor of vaccine attitudes in the United States is religiosity, with more-religious individuals expressing more distrust in science and being less likely to get vaccinated. Here, we test whether explicit cues of common religious identity can help medical experts build trust and increase vaccination intentions. In a preregistered survey experiment conducted with a sample of unvaccinated American Christians (n = 1,765), we presented participants with a vaccine endorsement from a prominent medical expert (NIH Director Francis Collins) and a short essay about doctors and scientists endorsement of the vaccines. In the common religious identity condition, these materials also highlighted the religious identity of Collins and many medical experts. Unvaccinated Christians in the common identity condition expressed higher trust in medical experts, greater intentions to vaccinate, and greater intentions to promote vaccination to friends and family than those who did not see the common identity cue. These effects were moderated by religiosity, with the strongest effects observed among the most religious participants, and statistically mediated by heightened perceptions of shared values with the medical expert endorsing the vaccine. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of common identity cues for promoting vaccination in a vaccine-hesitant subpopulation. More generally, the results illustrate how trust in science can be built through the invocation of common group identities, even identities often assumed to be in tension with science.","output":"Religious identity cues increase vaccination intentions and trust in medical experts among American Christians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The study assesses the perspective of doctors working in government hospitals of Nepal regarding hospital preparedness for infection prevention measures, isolation services provisions, critical care service readiness, and training of staff for COVID-19 pandemic management METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done in central, provincial, and local level health centers of the Government of Nepal to assess the perspective of medical doctors regarding COVID-19 pandemic readiness in their facility Nonprobability sampling was used to collect 56 responses from doctors working in different hospitals of Nepal An online survey was performed using a questionnaire tool, which was adapted from the guidelines of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RESULTS: Most of the participants were medical officers with an MBBS degree (32) followed by anesthesiologists (10) Thirteen participants worked in central hospitals (23 2%), 24 in provincial hospitals (42 8%) and 19 in local health centers (33 92%) The availability of adequate facemask was 84% in central hospitals, which was higher than provincial hospitals (66 7%), and local level health centers (77 8%) There were only 53 8% trained critical care providers in central hospitals and 29 2% in provincial hospitals Nearly 38 5% (5) of central hospitals had measures for airborne isolation in place, whereas this was only found in 8 3% (2) of provincial hospitals surveyed for critical care facilities Overall, only 2 hospitals had the provision of a negative pressure room with air exchanges Only 8 participants working in central hospitals (61 5%) and 14 working in provincial hospitals (58 3%) had performed hands-on training for donning and doffing personal protective equipment CONCLUSIONS: The majority of medical doctors working in government hospitals of Nepal perceive that provision of facemask distribution, airborne isolation rooms, critical care preparedness, and hands-on training to staff were not adequate","output":"Perspective of Doctors for COVID-19 Pandemic Readiness in Government Hospitals of Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To understand how researchers experience working in academia and the effects these experiences have on their mental health and well-being, through synthesizing published qualitative data. METHOD: A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted to gain a comprehensive overview of what is currently known about academic researchers mental health and well-being. Relevant papers were identified through searching electronic databases, Google Scholar, and citation tracking. The quality of the included studies was assessed and the data was synthesised using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: 26 papers were identified and included in this review. Academic researchers experiences were captured under seven key themes. Job insecurity coupled with the high expectations set by the academic system left researchers at risk of poor mental health and well-being. Access to peer support networks, opportunities for career progression, and mentorship can help mitigate the stress associated with the academic job role, however, under-represented groups in academia are at risk of unequal access to resources, support, and opportunities. CONCLUSION: To improve researchers well-being at work, scientific/academic practice and the systems concept of what a successful researcher should look like, needs to change. Further high-quality qualitative research is needed to better understand how systemic change, including tackling inequality and introducing better support systems, can be brought about more immediately and effectively.

Nanomedicine approaches have a high potential to enhance conventional diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. In fact, lipid nanoparticle/mRNA vaccines are already widely used to protect from COVID-19. In this review, we present an overview of the taxonomy, structure, variants of concern, epidemiology, pathophysiology and detection methods of SARS-CoV-2. The efforts of repurposing, tailoring, and adapting pre-existing medications to battle COVID-19 and the state of vaccine developments are presented. Next, we discuss the broad concepts and limitations of how nanomedicine could address the COVID-19 threat. Nanomaterials are particles in the nanometer scale (10C100 nm) which possess unique properties related to their size, polarity, structural and chemical composition. Nanoparticles can be composed of precious metals (copper, silver, gold), inorganic materials (graphene, silicon), proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, RNA/DNA, or conjugates, combinations and polymers of all of the aforementioned. The advanced biochemical features of these nanoscale particles allow them to directly interact with virions and irreversibly disrupt their structure, which can render a virus incapable of replicating within the host. Virus-neutralizing coats and surfaces impregnated with nanomaterials can enhance personal protective equipment, hand sanitizers and air filter systems. Nanoparticles can enhance drug-based therapies by optimizing uptake, stability, target cell-specific delivery, and magnetic properties. In fact, recent studies have highlighted the potential of nanoparticles in different aspects of the fight against SARS-CoV-2, such as enhancing biosensors and diagnostic tests, drug therapies, designing new delivery mechanisms, and optimizing vaccines.

Many studies endeavored to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV, in order to find solutions to suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the binding affinities of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. Our results show that the protein surface of the ACE2 at the receptor binding domain (RBD) exhibits negative electrostatic potential, while a positive potential is observed for the S proteins of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the binding energies at the interface are slightly higher for SARS-CoV-2 because of enhanced electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies result from the salt bridges forming between R426 and ACE-2-E329 in the case of SARS-CoV and K417 and ACE2-D30 in the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our results indicate that the enhancement in the binding energy is not due to a single mutant but rather because of the sophisticated structural changes induced by all these mutations together.

The primary outcome was to compare OPD visits and pediatric urology workload in the first third of 2020 versus 2019, where there was no curfew. The secondary outcome was to compare the same variables during the full curfew time, i.e., April 2020 versus April 2019. RESULTS: The number of OPD visits was lower in the first third of 2020 (7390 vs. 10,379 in 2019 P < 0.001). OPD visits in April 2020 were 78.6% lower than in April 2019, and teleclinics represented 850 (94.3%). Elective procedures in the first third of 2020 were 688, with a reduction rate of 34.3% compared to the same period of 2019 (P < 0.001). In April 2020, there were 18 elective surgeries, with a 91.4% decrease than in April 2019. Ureteric reimplantation, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and circumcision stopped, while pyeloplasty (n = 14) and urolithiasis (n = 4) procedures had declined by 50% and 76.5%, respectively. Most of the procedures (71.8%) were day surgery. Emergency procedures were similar in the first third of 2020 (65 vs. 64 in 2019, P = 0.994) and declined in April 2020 by 6.7% versus April 2019.

This hesitancy was also observed with COVID-19 vaccination rollout in many countries including Bangladesh, where it began on Feb 7, 2021. Reasons for this include lack of knowledge, misinformation, low trust in health systems, and so on. Vaccine hesitancy is context specific and varies across time, place, and socioeconomic groups. People living in urban slums should be prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination because they are more prone to COVID-19 infection due to their poor living conditions and inability to practice preventive measures. Therefore, we aimed to understand the perceptions and attitudes of urban slum dwellers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, towards COVID-19 vaccination through time. Methods This qualitative study was done in three urban slums of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. In-depth telephone interviews were done with 36 adults (25 women and 11 men) from Oct 21, 2020 to Jan 12, 2021, using a semi-structured guideline. Participants were selected by use of snowballing and opportunistic sampling techniques. Follow-up interviews were done in April and August, 2021. We did thematic analysis on the collected data. Informed verbal consent was obtained from the participants, and ethical clearance was obtained from BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health (Dhaka, Bangladesh; 2019C034-IR). Findings Before COVID-19 vaccine rollout, doubts, fears, and rumours about safety and effectiveness of the vaccine lead to hesitancy among many participants. With time, more people were willing to get COVID-19 vaccines when they found that many in their communities were getting vaccinated and that it was free of cost. Women knew more about the vaccine compared with men, due to the awareness sessions in courtyard meetings of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) attended by women. Trusted information sources were television news, community health workers, and government loudspeaker announcements. Youths (aged 18C24 years) in the slums were more interested in getting vaccinated as they had exposure to technology and social media where they learned about the benefits of vaccination, compared with people from older age groups. Besides structural inequities in the vaccination drive, such as the complicated online registration system, long queues at vaccination centres also meant many urban poor couldn't access COVID-19 vaccination as they worried about missing a day's work. Interpretation This study highlighted the importance of using sources such as NGO workers and television news to debunk myths and disseminate COVID-19 vaccine information to ensure compliance with vaccination among urban slum dwellers. Community perceptions shape individual practices, which can help policy makers design effective communication and strategies aimed at people who are poor to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

OBJECTIVE To improve recognition and management of SAM in a tertiary hospital in Malawi. METHODS The impact of multifaceted quality improvement interventions in process measures pertaining to the identification and management of SAM was assessed. Interventions included focused training for clinical staff, reporting process measures to staff, and mobile phone-based group messaging for enhanced communication. This initiative focused on children aged 6-36 months admitted to Kamuzu Central Hospital in Malawi from September 2019 to March 2020. Before-after comparisons were made with baseline data from the year before, and process measures within this intervention period which included three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles were compared. RESULTS During the intervention period, 418 children had SAM and in-hospital mortality was 10.8%, which was not significantly different from the baseline period. Compared with the baseline period, there was significant improvement in the documentation of full anthropometrics on admission, blood glucose test within 24 hours of admission and HIV testing results by discharge. During the intervention period, amidst increasing patient census with each PDSA cycle, three process measures were maintained (documentation of full anthropometrics, determination of nutritional status and HIV testing results), and there was significant improvement in blood glucose documentation.

The paper version was tested in a pilot phase, and subsequently, we conducted ten semi-structured interviews with the users of the new tool to test its feasibility and usability. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, leading to improvement and development of the digital version of the new tool. RESULTS After completing the pilot phase of the research, we identified the following four categories: a systematic tool for more consistent treatment and better communication during the patient's visit; training and empowerment; quality, safety and digitalization; these categories were later included in the final version of the digital communication tool. CONCLUSION Effective palliative care requires a good exchange of information and communication between all care professionals who work with the patient. Effective communication contributes to making patients and their relatives feel safe in their home environment and allows patients to stay in their homes even as their disease progresses.

METHODS: Non-redundant clinical samples obtained from hospitalized patients throughout Serbia were included in the prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted from January to June 2018. Samples were initially screened for the presence of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus (Acb) complex using conventional bacteriological techniques. Acb complexes recovered from clinical samples obtained from inpatients with confirmed bacterial infections were further evaluated for the presence of A. baumannii. Identification to the species level was done by the detection of the bla(OXA-51) gene and rpoB gene sequence analysis. Susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion and broth microdilution method. CRAB isolates were tested for the presence of acquired carbapenemases (bla(OXA-24-like), bla(OXA-23-like,)bla(OXA-58-like), bla(OXA-143-like), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(GIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM), bla(NDM)) by PCR. Clonal relatedness was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: Acb complex was isolated in 280 out of 2401 clinical samples (11.6%). Overall, A. baumannii was identified in 237 out of 280 Acb complex (84.6%). CRAB prevalence was found to be 93.7% (237/222).

The following carbapenemases-encoding genes were found: 98 (44.2%) bla(OXA-24-like), 76 (34.5%) bla(OXA-23-like), and 7 (3.2%) bla(NDM-1). PFGE analysis revealed six different clusters. MLST analysis identified three STs: ST2 (n = 13), ST492 (n = 14), and ST636 (n = 10). Obtained results evaluated that circulating CRAB clones in Serbia were as follows: bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA23)/ST2 (32.4%), bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA23)/bla(OXA72)/ST2 (2.7%), bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA72)/ST492 (37.8%), and bla(OXA66)/bla(OXA72)/ST636 (27.1%). CONCLUSION: This study revealed extremely high proportions of carbapenem resistance among A. baumannii clinical isolates due to the emergence of bla(OXA-72), bla(OXA-23), and bla(NDM-1) genes among CRAB isolates in Serbia and their clonal propagation.","output":"The first nationwide multicenter study of Acinetobacter baumannii recovered in Serbia: emergence of OXA-72, OXA-23 and NDM-1-producing isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.","output":"Insights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Defining Immune Determinants for Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused a significant health and economic crisis, a condition identified as conducive to stigmatization and hateful behavior against minority groups. It is however unclear whether the threat of infection triggers violence in addition to stigmatization, and whether a violent reaction can happen at the onset of an unexpected economic shock before social hierarchies can be disrupted. Using a novel database of hate crimes across Italy, we show that (i) hate crimes against Asians increased substantially at the pandemic onset, and that (ii) the increase was concentrated in cities with higher expected unemployment, but not higher mortality. We then examine individual, local and national mobilization as mechanisms. We find that (iii) local far-right institutions motivate hate crimes, while we find no support for the role of individual prejudice and national discourse.

OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review of the use of telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing speech pathology interventions for Spanish-speaking children with cleft palate. METHODS: In July and August 2020, the authors searched the electronic databases Medline, LILACS, SciELO, and the Cochrane Library using the following keywords in English (MeSH): Cleft palate combined with Early intervention, Speech therapy, Rehabilitation of speech and language disorders, Speech production measurement, Speech articulation tests and Telemedicine. Original articles were selected and analyzed, complemented by an analysis of flowcharts and recommendations by the GES Clinical Guide of Cleft Lip and Palate of Chile's Government and the authors' expert opinions. RESULTS: A total of 2680 articles were retrieved, of which 23 were critically analyzed and used to adapt the early stimulation, evaluation, and treatment of children with CP to speech therapy telepractice at the Gantz Foundation, a Hospital in Santiago de Chile. LIMITATIONS: Only three researchers carried out a quick review, which limited the depth of individual analysis of the studies included. Also, the suggestions and material presented should be evaluated in future investigations. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides useful guidelines for providing speech pathology interventions through telepractice for children with cleft palate.

METHODS: We did a prospective population-based study in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-naive UK adults recruited between May 1 and November 2, 2020, without a positive swab test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to enrolment. Information on 88 potential sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical and pharmacological risk factors was obtained through online questionnaires, and combined IgG/IgA/IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were determined in dried blood spots obtained between November 6, 2020, and April 18, 2021. We used logistic and linear regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and adjusted geometric mean ratios (aGMRs) for potential determinants of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (all participants) and antibody titres (seropositive participants only), respectively. RESULTS: Of 11,130 participants, 1696 (15.2%) were seropositive. Factors independently associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included frontline health/care occupation (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48C2.33), international travel (1.20, 1.07C1.35), number of visits to shops and other indoor public places ( 5 vs. 0/week: 1.29, 1.06C1.57, P-trend = 0.01), body mass index (BMI)  25 vs. < 25 kg/m(2) (1.24, 1.11C1.39), South Asian vs. White ethnicity (1.65, 1.10C2.49) and alcohol consumption 15 vs. 0 units/week (1.23, 1.04C1.46). Light physical exercise associated with lower risk (0.80, 0.70C0.93, for  10 vs. 0C4 h/week). Among seropositive participants, higher titres of anti-Spike antibodies associated with factors including BMI  30 vs. < 25 kg/m(2) (aGMR 1.10, 1.02C1.19), South Asian vs. White ethnicity (1.22, 1.04C1.44), frontline health/care occupation (1.24, 95% CI 1.11C1.39), international travel (1.11, 1.05C1.16) and number of visits to shops and other indoor public places ( 5 vs. 0/week: 1.12, 1.02C1.23, P-trend = 0.01); these associations were not substantially attenuated by adjustment for COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher alcohol consumption and lower light physical exercise represent new modifiable risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recognised associations between South Asian ethnic origin and obesity and higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were independent of other sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical, and pharmacological factors investigated. Among seropositive participants, higher titres of anti-Spike antibodies in people of South Asian ancestry and in obese people were not explained by greater COVID-19 disease severity in these groups.

The primary outcome was incidence of cerebrovascular disease as a comorbidity. Forty-seven studies involving 16,143 COVID-19 patients were included in this analysis. The incidences of a history of cerebrovascular disease and hypertension in COVID-19 patients were estimated to be 3.0% (95% CI, 2.0%-4.0%; P<0.00001) and 23.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-29.0%; P<0.00001), respectively.

The effects of parity and body condition of the dam, the duration of parturition, the time spent licking the calf, the sex and birth weight of the calf were also analyzed. Neonatal salivary cortisol concentrations were influenced neither by factors related to the dam (parity, body condition) nor the calf (sex, birth weight). The duration of parturition and the time spent licking the calf also had no effect on salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol concentrations increased rapidly after delivery in both groups to reach their peak levels at 45 and 60 min after delivery in EUT and DYS calves, respectively supporting that the birth process means considerable stress for calves and the immediate postnatal period also appears to be stressful for newborn calves. DYS calves exhibited higher salivary cortisol concentrations compared to EUT ones for 0 (P = 0.022), 15 (P = 0.016), 30 (P = 0.007), 45 (P = 0.003), 60 (P = 0.001) and 120 min (P = 0.001), and for 24 h (P = 0.040), respectively. Peak levels of salivary cortisol and the cortisol release into saliva calculated as AUC were higher in DYS than in EUT calves for the 48-h of the sampling period (P = 0.009 and P = 0.003, respectively). The greater magnitude of saliva cortisol levels in DYS calves compared to EUT ones suggest that difficult parturition means severe stress for bovine neonates and salivary cortisol could be an opportunity for non-invasive assessment of stress during the early neonatal period in cattle.","output":"Salivary cortisol as a non-invasive approach to assess stress in dystocic dairy calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Micro-electrolysis is a cost-effective method widely applied in wastewater treatment. In this paper, a high-efficiency micro-electrolysis filler was prepared by a facile calcination method for the degradation of isobutyl xanthate (IBX). The optimization of filler fabrication process was investigated from aspects of compressive strength, abrasion loss and degradation rate. Combined with multi-characterization techniques, it can be found that the zero-valent iron (ZVI) was partially changed to Fe(2+) in the phase of fayalite (Fe2SiO4) during the treatment. The influence of operation parameters of filler dosage, initial pH and initial concentration were thoroughly studied. The result shows that the IBX degradation rate by optimized filler can reach 93.30%, superior to that of Fe/C filler (the element Fe kept at ZVI during heat treatment) with 61.8% removal. The degradation pathway of IBX was studied by GC-MS in details and the bis(2-methylpropyl)carbonate was postulated as the main by-product. The stability of filler was evaluated by batch cycle tests and column tests. This work provides a novel perspective about micro-electrolysis filler preparation.

PURPOSE The aim of this study was to identify clinicians' viewpoints of foundational resources necessary to support good team functioning in the context of low staffing ratios. METHODOLOGY We used administrative data, validated with local mental health chiefs, to identify mental health teams that had achieved high team functioning despite low staffing ratios in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Guided by a recently developed model of team effectiveness, the Team Effectiveness Pyramid, we conducted qualitative interviews with 21 team members across three teams within two medical centers. Interview questions focused on the resources needed to support good team functioning despite low staffing ratios. We used directed content analysis to analyze results. RESULTS We found there were several domains of relevant resources: material, staffing, temporal, organizational, and psychological. These represent an expansion of the domains originally included in the Team Effectiveness Pyramid. CONCLUSIONS Within the five domains, we identified key tensions to be addressed when forming teams, including the balances between providing care for new versus established patients, emphasizing shared caseloads within the team versus matching patients to clinicians based on individual expertise, and establishing reporting structures by clinical discipline versus team membership.

We studied 23 SARS-CoV-2-infected survivors over a one year post symptom onset (PSO) interval by ex vivo cytokine ELISpot assay. All subjects demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-, IL-2, and Granzyme B (GzmB) T cell responses at presentation, with greater frequencies in severe disease. Cytokines, mainly produced by CD4+ T cells, targeted all structural proteins (Nucleocapsid, Membrane, Spike) except Envelope, with GzmB > IL-2 > IFN-. Mathematical modeling predicted that: 1) cytokine responses peaked at 6 days for IFN-, 36 days for IL-2, and 7 days for GzmB, 2) severe illness was associated with reduced IFN- and GzmB, but increased IL-2 production rates, 3) males displayed greater production of IFN-, whereas females produced more GzmB. Ex vivo responses declined over time with persistence of IL-2 in 86% and of IFN- and GzmB in 70% of subjects at a median of 336 days PSO. The average half-life of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytokine-producing cells was modelled to be 139 days (4.6 months). Potent T cell proliferative responses persisted throughout observation, were CD4 dominant, and were capable of producing all 3 cytokines. Several immunodominant CD4 and CD8 epitopes identified in this study were shared by seasonal coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-1 in the Nucleocapsid and Membrane regions. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones were able to kill target cells, though CD8 tended to be more potent. Importance Our findings highlight the relative importance of SARS-CoV-2-specific GzmB-producing T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 control, shared CD4 and CD8 immunodominant epitopes in seasonal coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-1, and indicate robust persistence of T cell memory at least one year after infection. Our findings should inform future strategies to induce T cell vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","output":"Longitudinal Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Specific T Cell Cytokine-Producing Responses for 1 Year Reveals Persistence of Multi-Cytokine Proliferative Responses, with Greater Immunity Associated with Disease Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to identify changes in the hazardous consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis, due to the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 in a cohort of schooled adolescents from Central Catalonia.

As a secondary objective, we aim to assess the rate of contagion in the first and the second Covid-19 wave in Spain among Otorhinolaryngologists and the regional distribution by ENT-Departments. METHODS: Study design and population: This is a prospective observational study in a cohort of 975 Otolaryngologists from 87 ENT Departments conducted from March 25 to November 17 in our collaborative group, COVID ORL ESP. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the diagnostic standard. Hospitalization and/or intensive care admission and mortality was recorded as non-identified data. RESULTS: Data collected from 975 otolaryngologist from 87 Departments resulted in 157 (16.5%) otolaryngologists testing positive for SARS-CoV-19 by RT-PCR. Important geographic differences in contagion are reported. A total of 136 (86.6%) otolaryngologists were tested positive during the first wave and 21 (13.3%) during the second wave. At the last cut-off point of the study only 30/87 ENT Departments (34.5%) remained COVID19-free and 5 Departments reported more than 50% staff members testing positive.

Sound is of major importance to peoples perception of the environment, and some remarked that the soundscape was changing for the better. But are these anecdotal reports based in truth? Has traffic noise from cars and airplanes really gone down, so that more birdsong can be heard? Have socially distanced people quietened down? This article presents a case study of the human perception of environmental sounds in an urban neighborhood in the Basque Country between 15 March and 25 May 2020. The social restrictions imposed through national legislation divided the 69-day period into three phases. We collected observations, field audio recordings, photography, and diary notes on 50 days. Experts in soundscape and architecture were presented with the recordings, in randomized order, and made two separate perceptual analyses. One group (N = 11) rated the recordings for pleasantness and eventfulness using an adapted version of the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol, and a partly overlapping group (N = 12) annotated perceived sound events with free-form semantic labels. The labels were systematically classified into a four-level Taxonomy of Sound Sources, allowing an estimation of the relative amounts of Natural, Human, and Technological sounds. Loudness and three descriptors developed for bioacoustics were extracted computationally. Analysis showed that Eventfulness, Acoustic Complexity, and Acoustic Richness increased significantly over the time period, while the amount of Technological sounds decreased. These observations were interpreted as reflecting changes in peoples outdoor activities and behavior over the whole 69-day period, evidenced in an increased presence of Human sounds of voices and walking, and a significant shift from motorized vehicles toward personal mobility devices, again evidenced by perceived sounds. Quantitative results provided a backdrop against which qualitative analyses of diary notes and observations were interpreted in relation to the restrictions and the architectural specifics of the site. An integrated analysis of all sources pointed at the temporary suspension of human outdoor activity as the main reason for such a change. In the third phase, the progressive return of street life and the usage of personal mobility vehicles seemed to be responsible for a clear increase in Eventfulness and Loudness even in the context of an overall decrease of Technological sounds. Indoor human activity shared through open windows and an increased presence of birdsong emerge as a novel characteristic element of the local urban soundscape. We discuss how such changes in the acoustic environment of the site, in acoustic measurements and as perceived by humans, point toward the soundscape being a crucial component of a comprehensive urban design strategy that aims to improve health and quality of life for increasingly large and dense populations in the future.","output":"Soundscape in Times of Change: Case Study of a City Neighbourhood During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is an extension of \\"The Future Orientation of Constructive Memory\\" published in 2008 (Rossi, Erickson-Klein & Rossi).

METHODS: We studied 367 120 men aged 35C75 years from 31 provinces in the China Patient-Centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events (PEACE) Million Persons Project. At baseline, AUD was assessed by alcohol use disorders identification test score, and EQ-5D-3L questionnaire was used to measure the quality of life. Mortality data was collected via National Mortality Surveillance System and Vital Registration. Mixed models were fitted to assess the associations of AUD with quality of life, and Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for the associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: We identified 39 163 men with AUD, which accounted for 10.7% of male participants and 25.8% of male drinkers. In the multivariable analysis, male drinkers who were aged 45C54 years, with higher education level, currently smoking, obese, with diagnosed hypertension, and without diagnosed cardiovascular diseases had higher rates of AUD. Male drinkers with AUD were less likely to have optimal QOL compared with those without AUD (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.61C0.65, P < 0.001). Moreover, among male drinkers, AUD was prospectively associated with a 20% higher risk for all-cause mortality and a 30% higher risk for mortality from cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In China one fourth of men who drank alcohol had AUD, which was associated with lower QOL and higher risk of all-cause mortality.

Surgical repair of this problem is challenged by a paucity of soft tissue, poor functional outcome, and a high rate of recurrence. Acellular dermal matrix has become increasingly popular in reconstructive surgery--at times--as an alternative to local and free tissue transfer in different parts of the body. However, its applicability in contracture release, particularly in hand surgery, has not been widely explored. METHODS Nine patients with burn contracture scars involving different locations in the hand and the wrist underwent two-stage reconstruction consisting of contracture release and use of acellular dermal matrix followed by definitive coverage with skin graft at the second stage. Patients were followed up for a period of at least 10 months (range, 10 to 25 months), during which time the passive range of motion of the hand was used as a quantitative measure of surgical outcome. RESULTS All nine patients retained at least 83 percent of the corrected range of motion involving the affected joints by 1 year and at least 89 percent of correction at each webspace. No patient required a revision procedure.

DATA SOURCES: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. RESULTS: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60 % more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. LIMITATIONS: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities.

Bovine have been proposed to be the primary host and three main viral lineages (D/OK-like, D/660-like and D/Japan-like) have been described. Experimental infections were so far performed in swine, ferret, calf and guinea pig, in order to study IDV pathogenesis.We developed a murine experimental model to ease the study of IDV pathogenesis and immune response. DBA/2 mice were inoculated with 105 TCID50 of D/bovine/France/5920/2014 (D/OK-like). No clinical signs and weight loss were observed. Viral replication was observed mainly in the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates) but also in lower respiratory tract of infected mice, with a peak at 4 days post-infection. Moreover, the virus was also detected in the intestines. All infected mice seroconverted by 14 days post infection. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that IDV induced an activation of pro-inflammatory genes such as IFN- and CCL2. Inoculation of NFB-luciferase and Ifnar1-/- mice demonstrated that IDV induced mild inflammation and that type I interferons response was not necessary in IDV clearance. Adaptation of IDV by serial passages in mice was not sufficient to induce disease or increased pathogenesis.Taken together, present data and comparisons with the calf model show that our mouse model allows for the study of IDV replication and fitness (before selected viruses may be inoculated on calves) and also of the immune response.ImportanceInfluenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of Orthomyxoviridae family, presents a large host range and a worldwide circulation.

However, whether limited exposure of the heart and ascending aorta resulting from an incision in the second intercostal space may lead to increased intraoperative cerebral embolization and more prominent postoperative neurologic decline, remains inconclusive. The aim of our study was to assess potential neurological complications after two different minimal invasive surgical techniques for aortic valve replacement by measuring cerebral microembolic signal during surgery and by follow-up cognitive evaluation. METHODS: Trans-cranial Doppler was used for microembolic signal detection during aortic valve replacement performed via mini-sternotomy and mini-thoracotomy. Patients were evaluated using Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination Revised Test before and 30 days after surgical procedure. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were recruited in the study. In 52 patients, transcranial Doppler was feasible. Of those, 25 underwent mini-sternotomy and 27 had mini-thoracotomy. There were no differences between groups with respect to sex, NYHA class distribution, Euroscore II or aortic valve area. Patients in mini-sternotomy group were younger (60.8  14.4 vs.72  5.84, p = 0.003), heavier (85.2  12.4 vs.72.5  12.9, p = 0.002) and had higher body surface area (1.98  0.167 vs. 1.83  0.178, p = 0.006). Surgery duration was longer in mini-sternotomy group compared to mini-thoracotomy (158  24 vs. 134  30 min, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no differences between groups in microembolic load, length of ICU or total hospital stay. Total microembolic signals count was correlated with cardiopulmonary bypass duration (5.64, 95%CI 0.677C10.60, p = 0.027). Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination Revised Test score decreased equivalently in both groups (p = 0.630) (MS: 85.2  9.6 vs. 82.9  11.4, p = 0.012; MT: 85.2  9.6 vs. 81.3  8.8, p = 0.001).

In particular, current guidelines and policies have highlighted the need to use high level Personal Protective Equipment to reduce the risk of viral infection during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. In particular, it was felt that the laparoscopic approach was at higher risk of viral transmission due to the chimney effect of the smoke escape from the trocars during and after the procedure. However, with this being a new and largely unknown viral agent, guidelines have been based on speculation and extrapolation from previous studies conducted in completely different situations, and led to anxiety amongst surgeons and theatre staff. We decided to conduct a systematic review of the Literature to try to clarify whether inhalation of surgical smoke can increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods A thorough search of the relevant Literature was performed following the PRISMA guidelines and the most relevant papers on this topic were selected for qualitative analysis. Duplicates, review, personal opinions and guidelines have been excluded. Quantitative analysis has not been performed due to the lack of homogeneous high-quality studies. Results Literature search identified 740 papers but only 34 of them were suitable for qualitative analysis. The quality of those studies is generally quite low. We were not able to find any evidence directly linking surgical smoke with viral transmission, other than in patients with active HPV infection. Discussion Inhalation of surgical smoke can be generally hazardous, and therefore the use of PPE during surgical operations must be recommended in any case. However, the present systematic review of the existent Literature did not identify any significant evidence of the risk of viral transmission with the surgical smoke, therefore the current guidelines restricting the use of laparoscopy and/or diathermy during the current Covid-19 pandemic may be considered excessive and non-evidence based.","output":"COVID-19 Infection risk by open and laparoscopic surgical smoke: a systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Antibody (Ab) Test is a point-of-care (POC) test that can use fingerstick samples in a rapid, high-sensitivity microfluidic immunofl-uorescence assay to qualitatively detect total antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The test was evaluated for clinical agreement using samples with lab-based antibody detection systems and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection status across POC settings. Methods: : Plasma samples from participants (18 years) were collected from clinical studies and commercial suppliers for positive and negative agreement analysis using the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG and RT-PCR as reference tests. Fingerstick application with capillary blood (applied directly or using transfer tube) from participants (18 years) was analysed following RT-PCR testing and evaluated against Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR test results. Cross-reactivity was analysed using samples with known related and high-prevalence pathogens. Application was performed by untrained users and ease of use of the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ab Test was investigated. Results: : A positive agreement of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.9, 100%;n=50) was determined in comparison with the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results and 97.2% (95% CI: 90.4, 99.2%;n=72) with RT-PCR, in samples obtained 118 days following RT-PCR testing. In participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 100% (95% CI: 94.5, 100%;n=66) negative agreement was established when evaluated against the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG test and 100% (95% CI: 98.7, 100%;n=290) against RT-PCR testing. There was 100% agreement observed between capillary fingerstick application and Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 or RT-PCR results, as well as between sample application methods.

However, only a few works focus on AI-based lung ultrasound (LUS) analysis in spite of its significant role in COVID-19. In this work, we aim to propose a novel method for severity assessment of COVID-19 patients from LUS and clinical information. Great challenges exist regarding the heterogeneous data, multi-modality information, and highly nonlinear mapping. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a dual-level supervised multiple instance learning module (DSA-MIL) to effectively combine the zone-level representations into patient-level representations. Then a novel modality alignment contrastive learning module (MA-CLR) is presented to combine representations of the two modalities, LUS and clinical information, by matching the two spaces while keeping the discriminative features. To train the nonlinear mapping, a staged representation transfer (SRT) strategy is introduced to maximumly leverage the semantic and discriminative information from the training data. We trained the model with LUS data of 233 patients, and validated it with 80 patients. Our method can effectively combine the two modalities and achieve accuracy of 75.0% for 4-level patient severity assessment, and 87.5% for the binary severe/non-severe identification. Besides, our method also provides interpretation of the severity assessment by grading each of the lung zone (with accuracy of 85.28%) and identifying the pathological patterns of each lung zone.

Methods A total of 134 patients (62 recovered and 72 deceased patients) with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT (316 scans) data were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and temporal changes of laboratory results, CT features, and severity scores were compared between recovered and deceased groups using the Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression to identify the risk factors for poor prognosis. Results Median age was 48 and 58 years for recovered and deceased patients, respectively. More patients had at least one comorbidity in the deceased group than the recovered group (60% vs. 29%). Leukocytes, neutrophil, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), prothrombin, D-dimer, serum ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the deceased group than the recovered group at different stages. The total CT score at the peak stage was significantly greater in the deceased group than the recovered group (20 vs. 11 points). The optimal cutoff value of the total CT scores was 16.5 points, achieving 69.4% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity for the prognostic prediction. The crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were more common in the deceased patients than those in the recovered patients.

Using the center-manifold theorem, we showed that both models exhibit forward bifurcation. The infection parameters were obtained by fitting the model to COVID-19 incidence data from three provinces in Indonesia, namely, Jakarta, West Java, and East Java. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential parameters on the number of new infections and the basic reproduction number. We found that the use of medical masks has the greatest effect in determining the number of new infections. The optimal control problem from the second model was characterized using the well-known Pontryagin's maximum principle and solved numerically. The results of a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that community awareness plays a crucial role in determining the success of COVID-19 eradication programs.","output":"Optimal control on COVID-19 eradication program in Indonesia under the effect of community awareness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global threat to human health.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can be used to explore experiences in real-time in the subjects daily life. The aim of this study was to assess frequency and stability of (perceptive and non-perceptive) CHR symptoms and to explore potential age effects. EMA was used in a sample of an early detection for psychosis service in Bern, Switzerland (N = 66; 11C36 years). CHR symptoms were recorded in random time intervals for seven days: eight assessments per day per subject, minimum time between prompts set at 25 min. CHR symptoms were additionally assessed with semi-structured interviews including the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes and the Schizophrenia Proneness Instruments. Mixed-effects linear regression analysis on the frequency of CHR symptoms revealed a significant effect of age group, and the interaction CHR symptoms x age group for both perceptive and non-perceptive symptoms. Further, regarding stability of CHR symptoms, there was a significant effect of the interaction CHR symptoms x age group for perceptive symptoms only. Based on EMA, perceptive CHR symptoms were more frequently reported but less stable in children/adolescents compared with adults. Together with previous findings, our finding of higher instability/variability of perceptive symptoms in younger persons might suggest that with advancing age and more stability of CHR symptoms, clinical relevance (reduced psychosocial functioning) may increase.

Currently, strategies to deal with COVID-19 are purely supportive and preventative, aimed at reducing transmission. An effective and simple method for reducing transmission of infections in the public or healthcare settings is hand hygiene. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the efficacy of hand sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this review, an extensive literature search was performed to succinctly summarize the primary active ingredients and mechanisms of action of hand sanitizers, compare the effectiveness and compliance of gel and foam sanitizers, and predict whether alcohol and non-alcohol hand sanitizers would be effective against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Most alcohol based hand sanitizers are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses. With what is currently known in the literature, one may not confidently suggest one mode of hand sanitizing delivery over the other. When hand washing with soap and water is unavailable, a sufficient volume of sanitizer is necessary to ensure complete hand coverage, and compliance is critical for appropriate hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: By extrapolating effectiveness of hand sanitizers on viruses of similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, this virus should be effectively inactivated with current hand hygiene products, though future research should attempt to determine this directly.","output":"Hand Sanitizers: A Review of Ingredients, Mechanisms of Action, Modes of Delivery, and Efficacy Against Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits by some African countries for screening has raised serious concerns over their role in malaria areas.

This mixed methods study explores changes in older adults social support satisfaction and interpersonal connections across the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A Midwestern sample of 70 older adults aged 70-97 completed two phone interviews (April and June 2020) about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. At both timepoints participants rated their satisfaction with social support and responded to open-ended questions about their interpersonal interactions, communication, and support in current daily life. Mean social support satisfaction significantly increased between the two interviews. Ensuing analysis of qualitative responses suggested this shift could reflect psychological adjustment to the circumstances or adaptation in methods of interpersonal connection over time. Emergent themes included: 1) increased family support and strain, 2) adaptable and flexible friendships, 3) isolation fatigue, and 4) communication through technology. Evaluation of change over time indicated divergent and shifting perceptions of social support as the pandemic endures. Findings suggest nuanced and diverse social support experiences amongst older adults, yet general patterns of initial shock to social support systems that subsided or adapted over time. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand older adults social support needs and seek to explore ways to best foster social connections during instances of forced social isolation or societal crises such as the current and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Shifts in Older Adults Social Support during Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In the midst of a pandemic, residency interviews transitioned to a virtual format for the first time.

A better understanding of the viral shedding into the air has been developed, but its temporal pattern is largely unknown. Sampling tools, as one of the critical elements for studying SARS-CoV-2 aerosol, are not readily available around the world. Many of them are less capable of preserving the viability of SARS-CoV-2, thus offering no clues about viral infectivity.

We hypothesised patients with new cerebral lesions would have impaired tissue oxygenation reflected in their rScO2 values. METHODS NIRS and DWI data were collected in 152 elective cardiac surgery patients. Absolute rScO2 values, duration of desaturation below thresholds (baseline, 10%, and 20%), and accumulated cerebral desaturation load were compared between patients with or without new cerebral lesions on DWI. Primary outcome was time below 10% from rScO2 baseline. RESULTS The time below 10% from rScO2 baseline was significantly longer for patients with new cerebral lesions than for patients without [median (inter-quartile range): 11.0 (0.4; 37.5) min vs 1.8 inter-quartile range: (0.05; 20.9) min, P=0.02]. Furthermore, they had a higher accumulated desaturation load below baseline (P=0.02) and 10% below baseline (P=0.02). Finally, their absolute minimum rScO2 value was significantly lower (P=0.01). However, the frequency of patients with desaturation below 10% and 20% was comparable between patients with and without new cerebral lesions. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis did not identify a clear-cut critical threshold among the investigated rScO2 variables. CONCLUSIONS Use of NIRS identified significant group differences in rScO2 values between patients with or without new ischaemic lesions.

Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality. Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes. This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes. Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality. Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population. Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes. Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis. Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome. A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic and its Impact on the Cardio-Oncology Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NK cells are innate lymphocytes capable of killing malignant or infected cells and to produce a wide array of cytokines and chemokines following activation.

However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients has not yet been extensively examined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients and to identify factors independently associated with malnutrition risk. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 760 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 29 January 2020 and 15 March 2020. Based on the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 score, we divided patients into the normal nutrition group (NRS score <3) and the malnutrition risk group (NRS score &#8805;3). The associations of age, gender, symptoms, comorbidities, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, disease severity, activities of daily living (ADL) score, and clinical outcomes with malnutrition risk were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with malnutrition risk. RESULTS: Of patients with COVID-19, 82.6% were at risk of malnutrition. There were statistical differences in the age, incidence of fever, BMI, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations, ADL score, and disease severity between the 2 groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age &#8805;65 y (vs. <65 y; OR: 5.40; P < 0.001), serum albumin <35 g/L (vs. &#8805;35 g/L; OR: 3.61; P < 0.001), serum prealbumin <150 mg/L (vs. &#8805;150 mg/L; OR: 2.88; P = 0.042), critical cases (vs. moderate cases; OR: 4.46; P < 0.001), ADL score 41-60 (vs. ADL score 100; OR: 4.50; P = 0.012), and ADL score &#8804;40 (vs. ADL score 100; OR: 9.49; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the risk of malnutrition in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that prevalence of malnutrition risk was high in COVID-19 patients.

Intraabdominal pathologies are usually identified through presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and laboratory and radiological results; however, these could also delay diagnosis because of inconclusive laboratory tests or imaging results, or the inability to safely transfer a patient to the radiology room. In the current study we evaluated the safety and accuracy of bedside diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the presence of intraabdominal pathology in an ICU setting. METHODS This retrospective study, carried out between January 2006 and June 2008, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of bedside diagnostic laparoscopy performed on patients with a suspicion of ongoing intraabdominal pathology. Clinical indications for bedside diagnostic laparoscopy were: ultrasonography (US) images of gallbladder distension or wall thickening of more than 3 to 4 mm, with or without pericholecystic fluid; elevation of laboratory tests (bilirubin, transaminases, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, gamma-glutamyltransferase); high level of lactate/metabolic acidosis; CT images inconclusive for intraabdominal pathology; or inability to perform a CT scan. Patients did not undergo bedside diagnostic laparoscopy if they presented clear indications for open surgery, coagulopathy, abdominal wall infection or high intraabdominal pressure. RESULTS Thirty-two patients underwent bedside diagnostic laparoscopy (Visiport Plus, Autosuture, US), 14 of whom had been admitted to the ICU for major trauma, 12 for sepsis of unknown origin and 6 for complications after cardiac surgery. The procedure was performed on an average of eight days after ICU admission (95% confidence interval = 5 to 15 days) and mean procedure duration was 40 minutes. None of the procedures resulted in complications. Bedside diagnostic laparoscopy was diagnostic for intraabdominal pathology in 15 patients, who subsequently underwent surgery, except in two cases of diffuse gut hypoperfusion. Diagnosis of cholecystitis was obtained in seven cases: two were treated with laparotomic cholecystectomy and five with percutaneous gallbladder drainage positioning. CONCLUSIONS Bedside diagnostic laparoscopy represents a safe and accurate technique for diagnosing intraabdominal pathology in an ICU setting and should be taken into consideration when patient transfer to radiology or the operating room is considered unsafe, or when routine radiological examinations are not conclusive enough to reach a definite diagnosis.","output":"Bedside diagnostic laparoscopy to diagnose intraabdominal pathology in the intensive care unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic. Only a few laboratories routinely isolate the virus, which is because the current co-culture strategy is highly time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. This work aimed to develop a new high-throughput isolation strategy using novel technologies for rapid and automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We used an automated microscope based on high-content screening (HCS), and we applied specific image analysis algorithms targeting cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 that tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 that tested negative, were processed with our HCS strategy and were compared with the classical isolation procedure. RESULTS: The isolation rate was 43% (31/72) with both strategies on RT-PCR-positive samples and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, in which we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with the HCS strategy, where 80% (25/31) of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, compared with only 26% (8/30) with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive samples (31 with HCS versus 27 with classic strategy) after 1 week of co-culture. CONCLUSIONS: This system allows the rapid and automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator workload, which reduces the risk of contamination and paves the way for future applications in clinical microbiology, such as large-scale drug susceptibility testing.","output":"High-speed large-scale automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using miniaturized co-culture coupled to high-content screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard precautions to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission implies that infected cell cultures and clinical specimens may undergo some sort of inactivation to reduce or abolish infectivity.

Herein, a novel adaptive level-set evolution protocol based on the internal and external functions is designed to eliminate the initialization sensitivity, thereby making the proposed SRIS model robust to contour initialization. In the level-set energy function, an adaptive weight function is formulated to adaptively alter the intensities of the internal and external energy functions based on image information. In addition, the sign of energy function is modulated depending on the internal and external regions to eliminate the effects of noise in an image. Finally, the performance of the proposed SRIS model is illustrated on complex real and synthetic images and compared with that of the previously reported state-of-the-art models. Moreover, statistical analysis has been performed on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) computed tomography images and THUS10000 real image datasets to confirm the superior performance of the SRIS model from the viewpoint of both segmentation accuracy and time efficiency.

Methods This study was adopted with a retrospective research design to study probable SARS cases from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou and Kaoshiung from August 2003 to February 2004, with a total of 78 cases (average age, 44 years; standard deviation, 18 years; age range, 13C84 years) including 24 males (30.8%) and 54 females (69.2%). Results Most of the 78 cases involved nosocomial infection (56.4%). A total of 24 patients died, and the mortality rate was as high as 30.8%. Logistic regression analysis found that intubation (odds ratio, 115; p < 0.001) was the mortality forecast factor. Conclusion The mortality rate of intubation patients was 115 times higher than that of those who did not require intubation. Therefore, special care must be taken with SARS disease with severe infiltration chest X-ray images and respiratory distress.

The economic, psychological, and social disarray generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is devastating. Public health experts and epidemiologists worldwide are struggling to formulate policies on how to control this pandemic as there is no effective vaccine or treatment available which provide long-term immunity against different variants of COVID-19 and to eradicate this virus completely. As the new cases and fatalities are recorded daily or weekly, the responses are likely to be repeated or longitudinally correlated. Thus, studying the impact of available covariates and new cases on deaths from COVID-19 repeatedly would provide significant insights into this pandemics dynamics. For a better understanding of the dynamics of spread, in this paper, we study the impact of various risk factors on the new cases and deaths over time. To do that, we propose a marginal-conditional based joint modelling approach to predict trajectories, which is crucial to the health policy planners for taking necessary measures. The conditional model is a natural choice to study the underlying property of dependence in consecutive new cases and deaths. Using this model, one can examine the relationship between outcomes and predictors, and it is possible to calculate risks of the sequence of events repeatedly. The advantage of repeated measures is that one can see how individual responses change over time. The predictive accuracy of the proposed model is also compared with various machine learning techniques. The machine learning algorithms used in this paper are extended to accommodate repeated responses. The performance of the proposed model is illustrated using COVID-19 data collected from the Texas Health and Human Services.","output":"Regressive Class Modelling for Predicting Trajectories of COVID-19 Fatalities Using Statistical and Machine Learning Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinations are without doubt one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine, and there is hope that they can constitute a solution to halt the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the anti-vaccination movement is currently on the rise, spreading online misinformation about vaccine safety and causing a worrying reduction in vaccination rates worldwide. In this historical time, it is imperative to understand the reasons of vaccine hesitancy, and to find effective strategies to dismantle the rhetoric of anti-vaccination supporters. For this reason, we analyzed the behavior of anti-vaccination supporters on the platform Twitter. Here we identify that anti-vaccination supporters, in comparison with pro-vaccination supporters, share conspiracy theories and make use of emotional language. We demonstrate that anti-vaccination supporters are more engaged in discussions on Twitter and share their contents from a pull of strong influencers. We show that the movement's success relies on a strong sense of community, based on the contents produced by a small fraction of profiles, with the community at large serving as a sounding board for anti-vaccination discourse to circulate online. Our data demonstrate that Donald Trump, before his profile was suspended, was the main driver of vaccine misinformation on Twitter. Based on these results, we welcome policies that aim at halting the circulation of false information about vaccines by targeting the anti-vaccination community on Twitter. Based on our data, we also propose solutions to improve the communication strategy of health organizations and build a community of engaged influencers that support the dissemination of scientific insights, including issues related to vaccines and their safety.","output":"The anti-vaccination infodemic on social media: A behavioral analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our society, geospatial data are used for multiple purposes, and their use has grown exponentially in recent decades, especially with the emergence of COVID-19. In this sense, universities play a key role in the geospatial domain from two points of view: the formation of students in this field in society, and the transfer and communication of knowledge. Considering the university-age population in Spain, a study was carried out in autonomous communities on the training provided by degrees that educate future spatial data managers (i.e., Bachelor Degree in Engineering in Geomatics and Surveying and Bachelor Degree of Geography) and the disciplines in which geospatial data are treated indirectly. The results show that universities offer two degrees providing direct training and seven degrees providing indirect training in geospatial data management per 100,000 inhabitants of university age. A high correlation of R-2 = 0.84 has been found between the number of degrees that provide direct training and the number of geospatial services offered by Spanish universities, and most of these degrees and resources are offered by public universities. Although there are good prospects for the future of the geospatial industry, the number of students pursuing these degrees is decreasing by 5% while the number of students enrolled in all degrees in the country has increased by 4.3%.

Initially, recommendations to treat severe cases of pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with ECMO have been restrained. In the meantime, ECMO has been shown to produce similar outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to existing data on ARDS mortality.Objective: We performed an international email survey to assess how ECMO providers worldwide have previously used ECMO during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19.MethodsA questionnaire with 45 questions (covering e.g. indication, technical aspects, benefit and reasons for treatment discontinuation), mostly multiple-choice, was distributed by email to ECMO centers. The survey was approved by the European branch of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO).Results: 276 centers worldwide responded that they employed ECMO for very severe COVID-19 cases, mostly in veno-venous configuration (87%). The most common reason to establish ECMO was isolated hypoxemic respiratory failure (50%), followed by a combination of hypoxemia and hypercapnia (39%). Only a small fraction of patients required veno-arterial cannulation due to heart failure (3%). Time on ECMO varied between less than two and more than four weeks. The main reason to discontinue ECMO treatment prior to patients recovery was lack of clinical improvement (53%), followed by major bleeding, mostly intracranially (13%). Only 4% of respondents reported that triage situations, lack of staff or lack of oxygenators were responsible for discontinuation of ECMO support. Most ECMO physicians (66%  26%) agreed that patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS (CARDS) benefitted from ECMO. Overall mortality of COVID-19 patients on ECMO was estimated to be about 55%, scoring higher than what has previously been reported for Influenza patients on ECMO (29 C 36%).Conclusion: ECMO has been utilized successfully during the COVID-19 pandemic to stabilize CARDS patients in hypoxemic or hypercapnic lung failure. Age and multimorbidity limited the use of ECMO. Triage situations were rarely a concern. ECMO providers stated that patients with severe COVID-19 benefitted from ECMO.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. METHODS: Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe, and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. RESULTS: Levels of 14 cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IFN-?3-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, hepatocyte growth factor, monokine-induced gamma IFN, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the 5 cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome.

OBJECTIVE: To report a novel case of fungal NOE centred on the left TMJ in an immunocompromised adult male with a focus on investigations and optimal management. Case Report. A 67-year-old male with comorbid chronic renal impairment presented to our otolaryngology department with prolonged left otalgia and otorrhoea. Subsequent cross-sectional imaging demonstrated left NOE centred on the TMJ. Poor resolution with prolonged courses of systemic and topical anti-pseudomonal antibiotics prompted maxillofacial surgical input for left TMJ exploration, washout, and biopsy from the joint capsule. The causative organism was identified as Aspergillus flavus on PCR analysis. The patient was successfully treated with oral posaconazole and repeated topical insertions of amphotericin B-soaked ribbon gauze to the left ear. Discussion. A combination of various imaging modalities including CT, MRI, Tc-99, and gallium-67 are utilised in clinical practice both to diagnose NOE and subsequently monitor disease progression or resolution. Immunocompromised patients with confirmed fungal NOE may require a combination of treatments including surgical debridement and prolonged antifungal therapy for a number of months, if not lifelong, treatment. Initiating empirical antifungal therapy may be justified in some patients. However, this should be judged on a case-by-case basis and guided by discussion with the local microbiology and infectious diseases departments.

In this context, protein subunit vaccines formulated with appropriate adjuvants represent a promising approach to address this urgent need. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) but is poorly immunogenic. We therefore compared pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, including those activating STING, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9, alone or formulated with aluminum hydroxide (AH), and benchmarked them to AS01B and AS03-like emulsion-based adjuvants for their potential to enhance RBD immunogenicity in young and aged mice. We found that the AH and CpG adjuvant formulation (AH:CpG) demonstrated the highest enhancement of anti-RBD neutralizing Ab titers in both age groups (80-fold over AH), and protected aged mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Notably, AH:CpG-adjuvanted RBD vaccine elicited neutralizing Abs against both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 variant at serum concentrations comparable to those induced by the authorized mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine.

We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programmes for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention.

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with an enormous capacity for rapid replication and high rates of mutation, leading to a tremendous amount of genetic diversity. Viral evolution occurs when selection working on genetic diversity leads to new mutations being fixed in the population over time. For IBV, the emergence of variant viruses is likely due to a combination of selection acting on existing genetic diversity, as well as on newly created mutations as the virus replicates, or genetic drift. Immunity against IBV creates a strong selection pressure; however, immunity can also reduce the viral load, decreasing replication and the development of new mutations. Examining the balance between immunity reducing infection, replication, and genetic diversity, and immune pressure selecting for new variants, is extremely difficult at best. Nonetheless, vaccination and immunity do play a role in the emergence of new antigenic variants of IBV. To complicate the situation even more, coronaviruses can undergo recombination, and several studies in the literature report recombination between IBV vaccines and field viruses. However, to our knowledge, unlike genetic drift, recombination alone has not been shown to result in a new antigenic and pathogenic IBV type emerging to cause widespread disease in poultry. Vaccines against IBV that result in an immune population can reduce transmission (basic reproductive number R0 less than 1), making vaccines for IBV the best control strategy available. However, IBV control remains extremely challenging because of the high number of antigenic variants causing disease in poultry and a limited number of vaccines that mostly provide only partial protection against infection and replication of those variants. Currently, there is one major variant IBV circulating in all sectors of US commercial poultry production: DMV/1639/11. This virus was initially detected in 2011, but only began causing significant disease in 2014/2015. Since then, it has affected all three sectors of poultry production (layers, breeders, broilers) and continues to predominate in certain regions of the United States. Additionally, a previously classified variant IBV, which is no longer considered a variant virus, GA08, is highly prevalent. This is attributed to heavy GA08-type IBV vaccine usage because disease caused by the GA08-type virus is rare. Interestingly, the major IBV detected in poultry for several decades, ArkDPI, is no longer among the most detected viruses in the United States. This change corresponds to the shift away from ArkDPI vaccine usage in the broiler sector as GA08 vaccine usage has increased and highlights the role IBV vaccines play in influencing viral populations in commercial chickens.","output":"Molecular Evolution of Infectious Bronchitis Virus and the Emergence of Variant Viruses Circulating in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to adaptations being made to all aspects of the NHS, including general practice, acute medical specialties and oncology.

The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Togo on March 5. Two months later, few data were available to describe the circulation of the new coronavirus in the country. OBJECTIVE: This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lom. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 23, 2020, to May 8, 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: health care, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swabs for direct detection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and blood for antibody detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. RESULTS: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included, and 71.6% (n = 684) were men. Approximately 22.1% (n = 212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n = 196) were from the police sector, and 38.7% (n = 370) were from the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR test result at the time of recruitment, and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n = 15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%.

Early prediction of severe disease enables clinicians to avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development and improve management of critically ill patients. The soluble receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (sRAGE) is a biomarker shown to predict ARDS. Although sRAGE level varies depending on the type of disease, there is limited information available on changes in sRAGE levels in COVID-19. Therefore, sRAGE was measured in COVID-19 patients to determine sRAGE level variation in COVID-19 severity and to examine its ability to predict the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: In this single-centre observational cohort study in Germany, serum sRAGE during acute COVID-19, 20 weeks after the start of COVID-19 symptoms, as well as in control groups of non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and healthy controls were measured using ELISA. The primary endpoint was severe disease (high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO)/MV and need of organ support). The secondary endpoints were respiratory failure with need of MV and 30-day mortality. The area under the curve (AUC), cut-off based on Youdens index and odds ratio with 95% CI for sRAGE were calculated with regard to prediction of MV need and mortality. RESULTS: Serum sRAGE in 164 COVID-19 patients, 101 matched COVID-19 convalescent patients, 23 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 15 healthy volunteers were measured. sRAGE level increased with COVID-19 severity, need for oxygen therapy, HFNO/MV, ARDS severity, need of dialysis and catecholamine support, 30-day mortality, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA) score. sRAGE was found to be a good predictor of MV need in COVID-19 inpatients and mortality with an AUC of 0.871 (0.770C0.973) and 0.903 (0.817C0.990), respectively. When adjusted for male gender, age, comorbidity and SOFA score  3, sRAGE was independently associated with risk of need for HFNO/MV. When adjusted for SOFA score  3, sRAGE was independently associated with risk of need for MV. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sRAGE concentrations are elevated in COVID-19 patients as disease severity increases. sRAGE should be considered as a biomarker for predicting the need for MV and mortality in COVID-19.

AAI network analysis is particularly well suited for interrogating the impact of constellations of mutations as occur on Omicron that may function in an epistatic manner. Our analyses suggest that as compared to previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has increased antibody escape breadth due to mutations in class 3 and 4 antibody epitopes as well as increased escape depth due to accumulated mutations in class 1 antibody epitopes. We note certain RBD mutations that might further enhance Omicrons escape, and in particular advise careful surveillance of two subclades bearing R346S/K mutations. Further, AAI network analysis suggests that the function of certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may be disrupted by Omicron mutations as a result of the cumulative indirect perturbations to the epitope surface properties, despite point-mutation analyses suggesting these antibodies are tolerant of the set of Omicron mutations in isolation. Finally, for several Omicron mutations that do not appear to contribute meaningfully to antibody escape, we find evidence for a plausible role in enhanced transmissibility via disruption of RBD-down conformational stability at the RBD-RBD interface.","output":"Insights on the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been identified in Wuhan, China, in the last week of December, the virus has spread across nations and continents affecting over 3 million people and putting the whole world to a halt.

Mobile technologies have rapidly developed; communication apps such as WeChat (one of the largest social networking platforms in China) are widely used and have the potential to conveniently improve health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of using WeChat to improve breastfeeding practices. METHODS: This 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted among pregnant women from May 2019 to April 2020 in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, China. Pregnant women were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 years or older, were 11 to 37 weeks pregnant with a singleton fetus, had no known illness that could limit breastfeeding after childbirth, used WeChat through their smartphone, and had access to the internet. A total of 344 pregnant women were recruited at baseline, with 170 in the intervention group and 174 in the control group. Women in the intervention group received breastfeeding knowledge and promotion information weekly through a WeChat official account from their third month of pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The primary outcome of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding rate was measured 0-1 month, 2-3 months, and 4-5 months postpartum. RESULTS: At 0-1 month postpartum, the exclusive breastfeeding rate was significantly higher in the intervention group than that in the control group (81.1% vs 63.3%; odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.58-4.78; P<.001). Similarly, mothers in the intervention group were more likely to provide predominantly breast milk (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.55-4.96; P<.001) and less likely to give dairy products to their children (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.75; P=.005). There was no statistically significant difference for exclusive breastfeeding rate 2-3 months (P=.09) and 4-5 months postpartum (P=.27), though more children in the intervention group were exclusively breastfed than those in the control group 2-3 months postpartum (intervention: 111/152, 73.0%; control: 96/152, 63.2%) and 4-5 months postpartum(intervention: 50/108, 46.3%; control: 46/109, 42.2%).

SUMMARY: This case report describes a 42-year-old male with COVID-19 who developed a massive pulmonary embolism resulting in cardiac arrest after suspected failure of low-molecular-weight heparin therapy for a deep venous thrombosis. Administration of two 50-mg doses of intravenous alteplase resulted in return of spontaneous circulation, and low-dose argatroban was used as follow-up anticoagulation therapy without complications. This is the first case report of use of argatroban in a patient with COVID-19 with cardiac arrestCassociated massive pulmonary embolism after failure of previous anticoagulation efforts. CONCLUSION: Argatroban may be used as an alternate anticoagulation strategy in COVID-19 patients who fail low-molecular weight therapy. A risk versus benefit discussion should be had regarding appropriateness of therapy as well as dosing.

Detection and isolation of people infected with the virus is crucial to public health measures. Hitherto, the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) test is the most useful method for viral detection, although high cost of performance and low supplies have limited testing. New ways to optimize RT-PCR testing performance must be achieved since many million tests have been performed almost exclusively on individual basis. We present the results of a pooling method for testing to optimize resources.Methods: Groups of two to 27 people with no COVID-19 symptoms were tested by RT-PCR. Positive groups were re-analyzed individually, and positive groups were compared to obtain the maximum number of persons per group to achieve optimal resource utilization.Results: Groups of four to six people were found optimal for resources optimization, up to 67%. Groups with higher or lower number of people had results from 37% and 47% that implied higher economic expenses.Conclusion: Group testing of 4 to 6 persons for COVID-19 by RT-PCR are practical and optimize time and economical resources for detection of asymptomatic people infected by the virus.Funding: None to declare.

Annually about 44.6 million calves are bred, which makes the optimal management of these animals extremely important. Several diseases can affect the initial stages of the bovine production chain, being the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) one of the most relevant pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology of BRSV infection in dairy cattle herds of S?o Paulo State, Brazil, using serological and risk factors analyses. For that, 1243 blood samples were collected of animals from 26 farms and a questionnaire about possible risk factors for BRSV prevalence was performed. The obtained blood sera were analyzed using virus neutralization test (VNT). RESULTS: VNT results showed high BRSV prevalence in dairy cattle herds, reaching 79.5% of seropositivity. The BRSV seroprevalence among studied farms ranged from 40 to 100%. The analysis of risk factors indicated that the age group and the occurrence of coinfection with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) should be associated with a higher prevalence of BRSV, while natural suckling was considered a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that adult animals over 1 year old are an important risk factor for the high seroprevalence of BRSV in herds. The high BRSV prevalence associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 suggests that biosecurity measures should be applied in order to reduce viral dissemination. Additionally, the natural suckling may be an important management to protect calves from high BRSV seroprevalence.","output":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus seroprevalence and risk factors in non-vaccinated dairy cattle herds in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare workers have frequently become infected with SARS-CoV-2 whilst treating patients with COVID-19. A variety of novel devices have been proposed to reduce COVID-19 cross contamination. Objective: To test whether a novel patient isolation hood was safe and comfortable, and could potentially reduce HCW COVID-19 infections. Methods: Prospective cohort study of 20 patients, entailing staff/patient questionnaires, and safety aspects of prototype isolation hoods. Prospective collection of HCW COVID-19 data. Assessment of isolation hood safety and practicality, and adverse event reporting. Outcome Measures: Questionnaires responses, adverse events reporting, rates of HCW infections during study period (20/6/2020 - 21/7/2020). HCW COVID-19 infections reported until last recorded HCW COVID-19 diagnosis (20/6/2020 - 27/9/2020). Results: Of the 60 (of 64) eligible individual staff surveys, 60 favoured isolation hood use. Staff were unanimous in: perceiving the hood as safe (60/60), preferring its use (56/56), and understanding its potential COVID-19 cross-contamination minimisation (60/60). All eight patients who completed the questionnaire thought the isolation hood helped prevent COVID-19 cross-infection, was safe, and comfortable. There were no reported patient safety adverse events. The overall attack COVID-19 attack rate from 20/6/2020-27/9/2020 among registered nurses was 3.4% (102/2994): ICUs 2.2% (3/138), Geriatric wards 13.2% (26/197), and COVID-19 Wards 18.3% (32/175).

The ability to preferentially protect high-groups in COVID-19 is hotly debated. Here, the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high-risk of death after infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave. Methods. The shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people at a high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here are according to age (>=70 versus <70 years), and institutionalized (nursing home) setting. For age-related precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people >=70 years old. For setting-related precision shielding, data were analyzed from 10 countries where information was available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among COVID-19 deaths, and overall population infection fatality rate. Findings. Across 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, i.e. low-risk people being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in USA all yielded S=0.4-0.8, consistent with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5-1.6, consistent with inverse protection. Assuming 25% infection fatality rate among nursing home residents, S values for nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea (S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany, and Denmark. No shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1), nursing home residents were far more frequently infected that the rest of the population. Interpretation. The experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID-19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.","output":"Precision shielding for COVID-19: metrics of assessment and feasibility of deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The philosophical discipline of ethics examines good, bad, right, wrong and how people live as individuals within a community. Bioethics investigates research in healthcare and medicine, examining public policy as it relates to healthcare and how resources are allocated. This includes: difficult, private, individual decisions, which occur in clinical settings; dilemmas during clinical trials; and controversies surrounding novel research. It is important to understand that ethical considerations related to health care ethics and those that pertain to public health are often seen from different perspectives. In public health, decisions are made within a context and a framework through principles which guide action that affect communities and populations. These decisions and actions are made with and involve, stakeholders to include: traditional, community and religious leaders; government officials; and private and commercial stake holders. The underlying principles of both public health ethics and bioethics are the same, namely equality, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, veracity and fidelity. Health care ethics supports the rights of individuals. Under the same umbrella of health care ethics are medical ethics, clinical ethics and research ethics. These disciplines offer views that support the rights of individuals. Ethics in public health is very complex with a myriad of issues to include diverse groups of people in different situations, which have to be taken into account from the view of what is best for the population. Evaluating the components of a public health system, how resources are developed and the economic support available to communities is crucial.

Unfortunately, this element is mostly lacking within the context of Ugandas post war recovery and transition. This article attempts to strike a balance between retributive justice and reconciliation. Considering the challenges of achieving justice through the courts, including the COVID-19 disruptions, the article argues that by directly engaging survivors in alternative dispute resolution as a process embedded in plea-bargaining, the Courts can make accountability for atrocity crimes more victim-centred. This recommendation is radical, from an International Criminal Justice(ICJ) perspective, because redress through the courts is primarily about retribution or punishment of guilty parties, which a survivor-centred approach to plea bargaining might not always produce. The argument, however, is not to turn away from retributive justice. Rather, the claim is that it is ineffective for mass atrocities within specific contexts, on its own. Ultimately, a more radical approach is for criminal accountability mechanisms to preserve spaces that allow for reconciliation, through Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and Plea Bargaining.

However, these sands harbour diverse microbial assemblages that play a critical role in the balance between public health and ecology. In this study, targeted high-throughput sequencing analysis was used to identify sand-borne bacterial populations at four public beaches in Durban. The effect of heavy metal in shaping the distribution of bacterial metacommunities was determined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), while the functional gene profiles were predicted using PICRUSt2 analysis. Sequences matching those of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria were the most abundant in all samples, followed by those of the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes. Genus-level taxonomic analysis showed the presence of 1163 bacterial genera in all samples combined. The distribution of bacterial communities was shaped by heavy metal concentrations, with the distribution of Flavobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Deltaproteobacteria influenced by Pb and Zn, while B and Cr influenced the distribution of Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria, respectively. Identified antibiotic resistance genes included the peptidoglycan biosynthesis gene II, III, IV, and V, as well as the polymyxin resistance gene, while the virulence genes included the sitA, fimB, aerobactin synthase, and pilL gene. Our findings demonstrate that beach sand-borne bacteria are reservoirs of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Contamination of beach sands with heavy metals selects for both heavy metal resistance and antibiotic resistance in beach sand bacterial communities.

Evidence Review: An international panel of experts was selected based on their clinical and scientific expertise in laparoscopic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Statements were produced upon reviewing the literature and assessed by the members of the expert panel. The literature search and its critical appraisal were limited to articles published in English during the period from 1994 to 2019. The Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials databases were searched, The search strategy included, but was not limited to, the terms 'laparoscopic', 'pancreaticoduodenectomy, 'pancreatoduodenectomy', 'Whipple's operation', and 'minimally invasive surgery'. Reference lists from the included articles were manually checked for any additional studies, which were included when appropriate. Delphi method was used to establish expert consensus and the AGREE II-GRS Instrument was applied to assess the methodological quality and externally validate the final statements. The statements were further discussed during a one-day face-to-face meeting at the 1st Summit on Minimally Invasive Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery in Wuhan, China.

Objectives To describe the epidemiology of the observed asthma spike and explore available meteorological and environmental data to understand potential causes of this episode. Design A retrospective observational study was conducted of patient visits to health care services in England as monitored through surveillance systems routinely operated by PHE. The number of presentations during the asthma event was compared to expected levels for the overall population and across specific regions. Setting Healthcare services in England. Main outcome measures Number of patients presenting to healthcare services for asthma- and difficulty breathing-type symptoms. Results Spikes in asthma and difficulty breathing were detected across several PHE syndromic surveillance systems. Across affected areas ED attendances for asthma increased by 560% on 17 June compared to the average number of weekday daily attendances during the previous 4 weeks. GP out of hours contacts increased by 422%, NHS 111 calls 193%, NHS 111 online assessments 581% and ambulance call outs 54%.

Currently, management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 infection with invasive mechanical ventilation results in poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Interventions to reduce ventilatory requirements or preclude their needs should be evaluated in order to improve survival rates in critically ill patients. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during the innate immune response could be a contributing factor to the pulmonary pathology. This study suggests the use of dornase alfa, a recombinant DNAse I that lyses NETs, to reduce ventilatory requirements and improve oxygenation status, as well as outcomes in critically ill patients with ARDS subsequent to confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection. Design. A single-institution cohort study. Setting. Intensive care unit in a tertiary medical center. Patients. Adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Intervention. Treatment with aerosolized dornase alfa. Measurements and Main Results. Of 39 patients evaluated, most patients had improvement in oxygenation measured by increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, reduction in ventilatory support or other supportive oxygen requirements, and partial resolution of bilateral opacities visible on CXR, as well as improved outcome. Conclusions. Administration of inhalational dornase alfa via a filtered nebulizer medication system or through an adapter in a ventilator circuit should be considered in all COVID-19-positive patients with ARDS as early in the disease course as possible.

All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured. RESULTS: Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%). Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. CONCLUSION: The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases. Positive psychological intervention is necessary.","output":"Perceived infection transmission routes, infection control practices, psychosocial changes, and management of COVID-19 infected healthcare workers in a tertiary acute care hospital in Wuhan: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans has a wide range of presentations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness. Suitable animal models mimicking varying degrees of clinical disease manifestations could expedite development of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulted in subclinical disease in rhesus macaques with mild pneumonia and clinical disease in Syrian hamsters with severe pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, or in situ hybridization. Replicating virus in the lungs was identified using in situ hybridization or virus plaque forming assays. Viral encephalitis, reported in some COVID-19 patients, was identified in one macaque and was confirmed with immunohistochemistry. There was no evidence of encephalitis in hamsters. Severity and distribution of lung inflammation were substantially more in hamsters compared with macaques and exhibited vascular changes and virus-induced cytopathic changes as seen in COVID-19 patients. Neither the hamster nor macaque models demonstrated evidence for multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS). Data presented here demonstrate that macaques may be appropriate for mechanistic studies of mild asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19-associated encephalitis, whereas Syrian hamsters may be more suited to study severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Modeling SARS-CoV-2: Comparative Pathology in Rhesus Macaque and Golden Syrian Hamster Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events among patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2) is high. This may be due to a hypercoagulable state induced by the severe inflammation that results from the SAR-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to determine hypercoagulable states' incidence based on thromboelastography study and its association with thrombotic events in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fifty-two COVID-19 patients who had thromboelastography study were retrospectively included. All patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The hypercoagulable state was observed in 16 patients (30.8%). Among them, maximum amplitude and a-angle were elevated in 75% and 25%, respectively. Reaction time and K were low in only 12.5% for both of them. Inflammatory and coagulation markers, as well as thromboprophylaxis regimens, were not associated with a hypercoagulable state. Fourteen patients (27%) experienced a total of 16 thrombotic events, including 8 (57%) deep venous thrombosis, 6 (43%) pulmonary embolism, and 2 (14.3%) arterial thrombosis. The hypercoagulable state was not significantly associated with thrombotic events. In summary, we observed a lower rate of hypercoagulable state on thromboelastography study in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether native Sharp's angle is associated with an increased abduction angle of the acetabular component. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent primary total hip replacement between February 2012 and August 2015 were included. Vertical positioning of acetabular implant in the antero-posterior post-operative radiographs were measured. The proportion of implants positioned outside the safe zone (40  10) was calculated and through a multivariate analysis, Sharp's angle and other factors possibly associated with cup malpositioning were evaluated. RESULTS Five hundred twenty-eight hip arthroplasties were analyzed. Prevalence of cup malpositioning was 7.6% and 25 patients had an altered native acetabular angle. An altered pre-operative Sharp's angle was associated with a higher risk of vertical malpositioning of the acetabular component (OR 2.51 IC 95%: 1.17-5.39) (p = 0.02). Body mass index, surgeon's volume, size of the implant, gender, pre-operative diagnose and age, were not associated with the position of the cup. CONCLUSIONS The alteration of the Sharp's angle as an indicator of hip dysplasia in native hips increases the odds of acetabular cup malpositioning. Other factors explored did not correlate with the position of the acetabular prosthesis. Systematic assessment of Sharp's angle should be included in the pre-operative planning of primary hip arthroplasty.","output":"A retrospective study on the relationship between altered native acetabular angle and vertical implant malpositioning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led teachers to an unpredictable scenario where the lockdown situation has accelerated the shift from traditional to online educational methods, and relationships have been altered by the avoidance of direct contact with the others, with implications for their mental health. Physical activity seemed to be a factor that could prevent mental disorders such as anxiety or depression in this peculiar situation. Therefore, the aims of this study were to explore how teachers have been affected by the lockdown with respect to their mental health and their relationships in three main fields: work, family, and social relationships, and to know which is the role of physical activity in the mentioned variables. For that purpose, an online survey was designed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Results showed that indoor physical activity acts as preventive in lockdown situations, whereas the level of activity does not affect mental health. Also, teachers have experienced higher levels of distress due to the workload generated during the lockdown. In conclusion, to prevent health problems among teachers in future similar situations, it would be important to facilitate the practice of physical activity at home.

We aimed to estimate the effects of graduated compression stockings on venous thromboembolism events, survival, and functional status at 6 months after stroke. METHODS The CLOTS Trials adopted an international multicentre, parallel group design, with central randomization and a 1:1 treatment allocation. In CLOTS Trial 1, 2518 immobile stroke patients were allocated thigh-length graduated compression stockings or not, and in CLOTS trial 2, 3014 to thigh-length or below-knee graduated compression stockings. We measured vital status, Oxford Handicap Scale, and quality of life (EQ5D-3 L) at 6 months. RESULTS We compared survival in patients enrolled in Trials 1 and 2 with a Cox proportional hazards model, including variables included in our minimization algorithm. In both trials, allocation to thigh-length graduated compression stockings was associated with a very slight, but nonsignificant, increased hazard of death in the first 6 months (Trial 1: hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% confidence interval, 0.913-1.295; and Trial 2: hazard ratio, 1.037; 95% confidence interval, 0.892-1.205). There were no statistically significant differences in venous thromboembolism events, Oxford Handicap Scale, or EQ5D-3 L between the treatment groups in CLOTS Trials 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS Although underpowered to detect clinically important effects on long-term outcomes, our results effectively exclude a >10% relative reduction in the hazard of death within 6 months associated with the use of thigh-length stockings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.","output":"Microwave ablation of liver metastases guided by contrast-enhanced ultrasound: experience with 125 metastases in 39 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health indeed is Wealth The Corona Virus Pandemic has impacted the best health-care systems world-wide;even as the world grapples with the massive loss of human life causing pain to millions The Pandemic is no more just a medical health challenge;it has thrown up spiritual and emotional challenges as it is affecting our belief system Prevention is Better than Cure is the mantra Since there is no allopathic medicine solution available;people are adopting various measures like social distancing and personal sanitization There is an urgent need to assist the individuals to take all the preventive measures possible to boost their immunity, improve the respiratory system, and lessen the anxiety, stress, and depression It can be difficult to not feel anxiety and sometimes panic over the coronavirus outbreak, with the onslaught of updates on news and social media Yoga has emerged as the perfect tool that an individual can follow to establish physical, mental, and spiritual balance to develop robust health and combat physical and emotional challenges Yoga offers another path, a fresh perspective with which to deal with events that are beyond our control The different asanas of yoga can help us to prevent COVID-19 by boosting our immune system and managing the stress that one is going through in this time of uncertainty This study tries to specifically evaluate the impact of the preventive measures undertaken through Yoga practice 126 respondents from different states of India were requested to perform yoga daily for 30 days Significant changes were observed and are mentioned in detail ? 2020 Australasian College of Health Service Management All rights reserved","output":"YOGIC INTERVENTIONS for PSYCHO-PHYSICAL WELL-BEING under COVID-19 TIMES & after"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Internet age, emotions exist in cyberspace and geospatial space, and social media is the mapping from geospatial space to cyberspace.

OBJECTIVE: We describe a methodology to estimate HIV prevalence among Venezuelan migrants in Colombia. METHODS: Respondent-driven sampling, a nonprobability sampling method, was selected for attributes of reaching highly networked populations without sampling frames and analytic methods that permit estimation of population parameters. Respondent-driven sampling was modified to permit electronic referral of peers via SMS text messaging and WhatsApp. Participants complete sociobehavioral surveys and rapid HIV and syphilis screening tests with confirmatory testing. HIV treatment is not available for migrants who have entered Colombia through irregular pathways; thus, medicolegal services integrated into posttest counseling provide staff lawyers and legal assistance to participants diagnosed with HIV or syphilis for sustained access to treatment through the national health system. Case finding is integrated into respondent-driven sampling to allow partner referral. This study is implemented by a local community-based organization providing HIV support services and related legal services for Venezuelans in Colombia. RESULTS: Data collection was launched in 4 cities in July and August 2021. As of November 2021, 3105 of the target 6100 participants were enrolled, with enrollment expected to end by February/March 2022.

However, other maternal-effect genes are not accessible due to their essential zygotic functions during embryonic development. Identifying these regulators is essential to fill the large gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms and molecular pathways contributing to fertility and to maternally regulated developmental processes.

Such attacks will have far-reaching consequences, including decreased accessibility, possible casualties, and fear among people. The extent, incidence, and characteristics of terrorist attacks against hospitals are unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and to characterize terrorist attacks against hospitals reported to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) over a 50-year period. METHODS The GTD was used to search for all terrorist attacks against hospitals from 1970-2019. Analyses were performed on temporal factors, location, attack and weapon type, and number of casualties or hostages. Chi-square tests were performed to evaluate trends over time and differences in attack types per world region. RESULTS In total, 454 terrorist attacks against hospitals were identified in 61 different countries. Of these, 78 attacks targeted a specific person within the hospital, about one-half (52.6%) involved medical personnel. There was an increasing trend in yearly number of attacks from 2008 onwards, with a peak in 2014 (n = 41) and 2015 (n = 41). With 179 incidents, the \\"Middle East & North Africa\\" was the most heavily hit region of the world, followed by \\"South Asia\\" with 125 attacks. Bombings and explosions were the most common attack type (n = 270), followed by 77 armed assaults. Overall, there were 2,746 people injured and 1,631 fatalities. In three incidents, hospitals were identified as secondary targets (deliberate follow-up attack on a hospital after a primary incident elsewhere). CONCLUSION This analysis of the GTD identified 454 terrorist attacks against hospitals over a 50-year period. It demonstrates that the threat is real, especially in recent years and in world regions where terrorism is prevalent.

SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent of COVID-19, uses its surface glycoprotein Spike (S) for host cell attachment and entry. The emerging picture of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that S protein, in addition, to ACE2, interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of C-type lectin receptors, CD209L and CD209. Recognition of CD209L and CD209 which are widely expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target organs can facilitate entry and transmission leading to dysregulation of the host immune response and other major organs including, cardiovascular system. Establishing a comprehensive map of the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with CD209 family proteins, and their roles in transmission and pathogenesis can provide new insights into host-pathogen interaction with implications in therapies and vaccine development. ABSTRACT: C-type lectin CD209/DC-SIGN and CD209L/L-SIGN proteins are distinct cell adhesion and pathogen recognition receptors that mediate cellular interactions and recognize a wide range of pathogens, including viruses such as SARS, SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, fungi and parasites. Pathogens exploit CD209 family proteins to promote infection and evade the immune recognition system. CD209L and CD209 are widely expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target organs and can contribute to infection and pathogenesis. CD209 family receptors are highly susceptible to alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism, which may influence virus tropism and transmission in vivo. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and the neck/repeat region represent the key features of CD209 family proteins that are also central to facilitating cellular ligand interactions and pathogen recognition. While the neck/repeat region is involved in oligomeric dimerization, the CRD recognizes the mannose-containing structures present on specific glycoproteins such as those found on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Considering the role of CD209L and related proteins in diverse pathogen recognition, this review article discusses the recent advances in the cellular and biochemical characterization of CD209 and CD209L and their roles in viral uptake, which has important implications in understanding the hostCpathogen interaction, the viral pathobiology and driving vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"C-type Lectin CD209L/L-SIGN and CD209/DC-SIGN: Cell Adhesion Molecules Turned to Pathogen Recognition Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Simulation training is an effective tool for improving confidence in healthcare workers.

We present a set of medical student-led clinical simulation sessions and evaluate their effects on (i) confidence among redeployed healthcare workers managing COVID-19 patients and (ii) medical students' confidence as educators. METHODS: Half-day simulation training sessions consisting of three COVID-related clinical scenarios were devised by senior medical students and delivered to a group of approximately 150 healthcare workers over six repeated sessions prior to redeployment to COVID-19 wards. We distributed an anonymous pre- and post-simulation questionnaire to 36 participants in the final group exploring their experiences. The confidence scores were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Following the delivery of teaching, medical students completed a questionnaire assessing their personal experiences of designing and delivering the exercises. RESULTS: Data are available for 35/36 participants approached. Respondents reported being significantly more confident after the training in all aspects of managing COVID-19 patients, including triage, complex discharge, recognising deterioration, initiating basic life support, managing symptoms and advising on visiting policies (p < 0.001); 97% of respondents rated the training as useful.

Factors associated with hesitancy included younger age, female gender, black-Pacific-Island-Native American heritage, less formal education, conservative political tendencies, resistance to masks or routine influenza vaccinations, and distrust of media coverage. 5501 (25%) had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine injection, including 29% of US participants. Following the first injection, 69% self-reported local and 40% systemic reactions, which increased following the second injection to 76% and 67%, respectively, with patterns mimicking clinical trials. Limitations: Study was performed early during vaccine availability. Attitudes may change. Conclusion: Nearly one in five individuals with serious comorbid conditions harbor COVID-19 hesitancy. Early safety experiences among those who have been vaccinated should be reassuring.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among individuals with cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other serious comorbid conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a new dataset on the dynamics of non-performing loans (NPLs) during 92 banking crises since 1990 The data show similarities across crises during NPL build-ups but much heterogeneity in the pace of NPL resolution We document how high and unresolved NPLs deepen post-crisis recessions and use a machine learning approach to establish pre-crisis predictors of NPL problems These predictorsa set of weak macroeconomic, institutional, corporate, and banking sector conditionshelp shed light on post-COVID-19 NPL vulnerabilities","output":"The Dynamics of Non-Performing Loans during Banking Crises: A New Database with Post-COVID-19 Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: The coronavirus pandemic's public health and economic impacts have led to much hope in the US regarding the prospect of a safe, effective vaccine to either prevent infection or minimize symptoms and reduce mortality risk. However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults' intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it. Methods and findings: Multivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n=1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.","output":"Demographic Differences in US Adult Intentions to Receive a Potential Coronavirus Vaccine and Implications for Ongoing Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We studied several acute inflammatory materials (AIM) such as various inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and heat shock proteins in ARDS patients by simultaneously measuring from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma.

RESULTS: In the BALF, only HSP 47 was significantly increased in ARDS group than non-ARDS group. In plasma, GRP 94, HSP 90, HSP 60, HSP 47, GPx-3, and IL-8 were increased significantly in ARDS group. In short, most of the AIM in BALF or plasma were not significantly different in ARDS group as compared with non-ARDS group. Ninety-day mortality was significantly related to HSP90, HSP 60 and GPx-3 in plasma but not in BALF.

RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to determine if tocilizumab benefits patients hospitalized with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and followed up through April 21, 2020, was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14 days and stratified according to disease severity designated at admission (severe, &#8805; 3 L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, pre/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers, and safety outcomes were assessed. Post hoc survival analyses were conducted for race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among the 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36% and 19% were black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78% vs 93%; P < .001), greater proportion requiring MV (44% vs 5%; P < .001), and longer median MV days (5.5 vs 1.0; P = .003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 153 [64%]) comprised 90% of those with severe disease; 44% of patients with nonsevere disease received tocilizumab for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (120 vs 71 mg/L; P < .001) and received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs 3 days; P < .001), but their survival was similar to that of patients with nonsevere disease (83% vs 91%; P = .11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75% (95% CI, 64-89). Following tocilizumab treatment, few adverse events occurred, and oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and soluble IL-2 receptor (also termed CD25) levels increased significantly. Survival in black and Hispanic patients, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in white patients (log-rank test, P = .002). INTERPRETATION: A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence MV and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improved, with higher than expected survival. Randomized trials must confirm these findings.","output":"Tocilizumab Treatment for Cytokine Release Syndrome in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: Survival and Clinical Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessment of the economy-wide impacts of tourism has increased importance due to the unprecedented impacts of COVID-19 Computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is a versatile tool for estimating the economy-wide impacts of tourism, as opposed to alternative general equilibrium approaches and partial equilibrium approaches However, there has not been any systematic review done on CGE applications in tourism literature The article reviews CGE applications in tourism over the past 25 years using a systematic quantitative literature review approach This review presents potentially important applications of CGE models in guiding post-COVID tourism Further, the article highlights the new developments in CGE modelling, which are yet to be adopted in tourism economics Existing studies show a strong geographical bias Notable research gaps exist in the areas of poverty, inequality, gender, environmental and the climate change impacts of tourism Future research in these areas will be vital to effectively guide post-COVID tourism recovery","output":"Systematic literature review on computable general equilibrium applications in tourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The primary focus of the study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of common gastrointestinal cancer patients and develop baseline data to form cancer care policy.

Here, we report, using a range of molecular techniques including PCR, western blot, recombinant DNA technology, ELISA, high performance thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry that the 28 KDa cysteine-rich protein (Ov28CRP) is a reliable component of the O. volvulus ESPs to address the biology of this parasite. We showed that (1) Ov28CRP is a putative ganglioside GM2 Activator Protein (GM2AP) conserved in nematode; (2) OvGM2AP gene is transcriptionally activated in all investigated stages of the parasitic life cycle, including larval and adult stages; (3) The full-length OvGM2AP was detected in in-vitro O. volvulus ESPs of adult and larval stages; (4) the mass expressed and purified recombinant OvGM2AP purified from insect cell culture medium was found to be glycosylated at asparagine 173 and lacked N-terminal signal peptide sequence; (5) the recombinant OvGM2AP discriminated serum samples of infected and uninfected individuals; (6) OvGM2AP competitively inhibits MUG degradation by recombinant -hexosaminidase A but not MUGS, and could not hydrolyze the GM2 to GM3; (7) humoral immune responses to the recombinant OvGM2AP revealed a negative correlation with ivermectin treatment.

Previously, we generated a TK&gE-deleted PRV (PRV()(TK&gE?AH02)) based on a virulent PRV AH02LA strain. It was shown to be safe for 1-day-old piglets with maternal PRV antibodies and 4 ~ 5 week-old PRV antibody negative piglets and provide rapid and 100 % protection in weaned pigs against lethal challenge with the PRV variant strain. It suggests that PRV(TK&gE?AH02) may be a promising live vaccine vector for construction of recombinant vaccine in pigs. However, insertion site, as a main factor, may affect foreign gene expression. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed four recombinant PRV-S bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) carrying the same spike (S) expression cassette of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain in different noncoding regions (UL11-10, UL35-36, UL46-27 or US2-1) from AH02LA BAC with TK, gE and gI deletion. The successful expression of S gene (UL11-10, UL35-36 and UL46-27) in recombinant viruses was confirmed by virus rescue, PCR, real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. We observed higher S gene mRNA expression level in swine testicular cells infected with PRV-S(UL11-10)TK/gE and PRV-S(UL35-36)TK/gE compared to that of PRV-S(UL46-27)TK/gE at 6 h post infection (P < 0.05). Moreover, at 12 h post infection, cells infected with PRV-S(UL11-10)TK/gE exhibited higher S gene mRNA expression than those infected with PRV-S(UL35-36)TK/gE (P = 0.097) and PRV-S(UL46-27)TK/gE (P < 0.05). Recovered vectored mutant PRV-S (UL11-10, UL35-36 and UL46-27) exhibited similar growth kinetics to the parental virus (PRV()(TK&gE?AH02)).

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and preprint repository databases (up to February 28, 2021). Random-effects and inverse variance heterogeneity meta-analysis were used to pool the odds ratio of individual trials. The risk of bias was appraised using Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials were included in this analysis with a total of 658 patients who were randomized to receive ivermectin and 597 patients randomized in the control group who did not receive ivermectin. Of six trials, four had an overall high risk of bias. The estimated effect of ivermectin indicated mortality benefits (pooled odds ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.42, n = 1255), with some evidence against the hypothesis of 'no significant difference' at the current sample size.

Here, we examined longitudinal antibody responses and viral neutralizing capacity to the B.1 lineage virus (Wuhan related), to variants of concern (VOC;Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta), and to a local variant of interest (VOI;Lambda) in volunteers receiving the Sputnik V vaccine in Argentina. Longitudinal serum samples (N = 536) collected from 118 volunteers obtained between January and October 2021 were used. The analysis indicates that while anti-spike IgG levels significantly wane over time, the neutralizing capacity for the Wuhan-related lineages of SARS-CoV-2 and VOC is maintained within 6 months of vaccination. In addition, an improved antibody cross-neutralizing ability for circulating variants of concern (Beta and Gamma) was observed over time postvaccination. The viral variants that displayed higher escape to neutralizing antibodies with respect to the original virus (Beta and Gamma variants) were the ones showing the largest increase in susceptibility to neutralization over time after vaccination. Our observations indicate that serum neutralizing antibodies are maintained for at least 6 months and show a reduction of VOC escape to neutralizing antibodies over time after vaccination. IMPORTANCE Vaccines have been produced in record time for SARS-CoV-2, offering the possibility of halting the global pandemic However, inequalities in vaccine accessibility in different regions of the world create a need to increase international cooperation. Sputnik V is a recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine that has been widely used in Argentina and other developing countries, but limited information is available about its elicited immune responses. Here, we examined longitudinal antibody levels and viral neutralizing capacity elicited by Sputnik V vaccination. Using a cohort of 118 volunteers, we found that while anti-spike antibodies wane over time, the neutralizing capacity to viral variants of concern and local variants of interest is maintained within 4 months of vaccination. In addition, we observed an increased cross-neutralization activity over time for the Beta and Gamma variants.

In order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts, approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid, sensitive, and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters. In this study, we present an ultracentrifugation-based method for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA and use crAssphage, a bacteriophage specific to the human gut, to help account for RNA loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing. With these methods, we were able to detect, and sometimes quantify, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 mL wastewater samples within as little as 4.5 hours. Using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus RNA and deactivated SARS-CoV-2, we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7-12% of viral RNA using our method. Results from 24 sewersheds across Upstate New York during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater may be indicative of greater COVID-19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10,000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1.7%. crAssphage DNA concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied. After accounting for flow rate and population served, crAssphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1.35  10(11) and 2.42  10(8) genome copies per day for DNA and RNA, respectively. A negative relationship between per capita crAssphage RNA and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of RNA over long transit times. Our results reinforce the potential for wastewater surveillance to be used as a tool to supplement understanding of infectious disease transmission obtained by traditional testing and highlight the potential for crAssphage co-detection to improve interpretations of wastewater surveillance data.","output":"Co-quantification of crAssphage increases confidence in wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2 in low prevalence areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This year, World Diabetes Day on 14 November coincides with the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife, and therefore focuses on highlighting the role of nurses in the prevention and management of diabetes.Diabetes is recognized as an important cause of premature death and disability globally and in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, where its prevalence has been steadily increasing since 1990.

The most relevant anomaly was the marked spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 diffusion. Lombardia region accounted for around 60% of fatal cases (while hosting 15% of Italian population). Moreover, 86% of fatalities concentrated in four Northern Italy regions. The explosive outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardia at the very beginning of pandemic fatally biased the R-like statistics routinely used to control the disease dynamics. To (at least partially) overcome this bias, we propose a new index RI = dH/dI (daily derivative ratio of H and I, given H = Healed and I = Infected), corresponding to the ratio between healed and infected patients relative daily changes. The proposed index is less flawed than R by the uncertainty related to the estimated number of infected persons and allows to follow (and possibly forecast) epidemic dynamics in a largely model-independent way. To analyze the dynamics of the epidemic, starting from the beginning of the virus spreadingwhen data are insufficient to make an estimate by adopting SIR modela \\"sigmoidal family with delay\\" logistic model was introduced. That approach allowed in estimating the epidemic peak using the few data gathered even before mid-March. Based on this analysis, the peak was correctly predicted to occur by end of April. Analytical methodology of the dynamics of the epidemic we are proposing herein aims to forecast the time and intensity of the epidemic peak (forward prediction), while allowing identifying the (more likely) beginning of the epidemic (backward prediction). In addition, we established a relationship between hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU) versus deaths daily rates by avoiding the necessity to rely on precise estimates of the infected fraction of the population The joint evolution of the above parameters over time allows for a trustworthy and unbiased estimation of the dynamics of the epidemic, allowing us to clearly detect the qualitatively different character of the so-called second wave with respect to the previous epidemic peak.","output":"New statistical RI index allow to better track the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan in China has placed immense burden on national economies and global health.

METHOD: An exhaustive literature search using 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Cancer', 'Malignancy', 'Relationships', Interlinks', 'Genetic', 'Epigenetic', 'Epidemiological studies', 'Clinical Studies', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine scenario' were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE till 2nd June 2021. RESULT: In this narrative review, 17 epidemiological studies were listed which focused on clinical parameters of several malignancy patient cohorts who contracted COVID-19. Besides, genetic and epigenetic alterations seen among cancer patients are also discussed which may plausibly increase the vulnerability of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, global vaccination scenario among malignant patients along with the necessity to prioritize them in the vaccination campaigns are also elaborated. CONCLUSION: Genetic and epigenetic modifications present in ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-6 and several cytokines require more in-depth research to elucidate the shared mechanisms of malignancy and SARS-CoV-2.","output":"COVID-19 and Malignancy: Exploration of the possible genetic and epigenetic interlinks and overview of the vaccination scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus pandemics are associated with a number of well-documented threats, stressors and traumas that vary by impacted population and contribute to mental disorders. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b) varied by disorder (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined). From 60 publications (N=66,190 participants), 725 individual estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. Across disorder and population, the median summary point prevalence was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates were generally substantially higher than reported by prior research for unselected samples. Psychiatric morbidity and PTSD were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults. Notably high prevalence was found for (a) psychiatric morbidity, PTSD and depression in infected/recovered adults (25-56%), (b) psychiatric morbidity and PTSD in healthcare providers (21-29%), (c) depression and PTSD in the adults in the community (15-19%), and (d) psychiatric morbidity in quarantined adults (28%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates were higher for studies/estimates: (1) focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19, (2) conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus other locations, obtained (3) via questionnaire versus clinician assessment and (4) with standard versus non-standard scoring, and (5) of moderate or very low versus low quality. The number of mental disorders attributable to COVID-19 will be substantial and magnitudes higher than attributable to MERS and SARS due to the vast scope and ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mental Disorder Prevalence Among Populations Impacted by Coronavirus Pandemics: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Study of COVID-19, MERS & SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No disponible COVID-19 confinement situation imposed to the population by the public health reasons causes a considerable reordering of daily habits in families with children Parent-child interactions might crease and, accordingly, the opportunities to strengthen adaptive behavioral dynamics between the child and their parents and other family members If this is not the case, problematic behavior increases and, in the context of confinement conditions, the probability of COVID-19 might also infection Functional Analysis of Behavior is a key reference to shape child&#039;behavior and in the same functional root, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is proving to be useful to build psychological flexibility in many arenas beyond the clinical one where it accumulates remarkable evidence One of this arenas points to building flexible behavioral patterns in children both in educational and family contexts The present work aims to apply the ACT model for managing the child&#039;s behavior and for improving psychological flexibility during family interactions in the context of following the instructions to reduce virus infection","output":"Consideraciones sobre conducta infantil y confinamiento en la crisis por COVID-19 desde la perspectiva funcional del anlisis de la conducta y ACT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased the risk of mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and healthcare workers (HCWs) are at greater risk than other occupational groups.

The survey was carried out among 128 dental HCWs from three dental clinics of Ekaterinburg, Russia. The mean age of the sample was 38.6 years. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21); PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale-Self-Report (PSS-SR); subjective distress was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The results indicated that 20.3-24.2% HCWs had mild to extremely severe symptoms of psychological distress, and 7.1-29.7% had clinical symptoms of PTSD. No differences between females and males were revealed. HCWs working directly with patients had significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and the risk of PTSD development compared to those working indirectly, whereas older HCWs had significantly higher levels of both psychological distress and PTSD symptoms compared to younger HCWs.

We investigated vaccine-induced antibody responses in patients with NHL/CLL against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants of concern including B.1.167.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood from 121 patients with NHL/CLL receiving two doses of vaccine were collected longitudinally. Antibody binding against the full-length spike protein, the receptor-binding, and N-terminal domains of the original strain and of variants was measured using a multiplex assay. Live-virus neutralization against Delta, Omicron, and the early WA1/2020 strains was measured using a focus reduction neutralization test. B cells were measured by flow cytometry. Correlation between vaccine response and clinical factors was determined. RESULTS Mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin G-binding titers were 85-fold lower in patients with NHL/CLL compared with healthy controls, with seroconversion occurring in only 67% of patients. Neutralization titers were also lower and correlated with binding titers (P < .0001). Treatment with anti-CD20-directed therapies within 1 year resulted in 136-fold lower binding titers. Peripheral blood B-cell count also correlated with vaccine response. At 3 months from last anti-CD20-directed therapy, B-cell count  4.31/L blood around the time of vaccination predicted response (OR 7.46, P = .04). Antibody responses also correlated with age. Importantly, neutralization titers against Delta and Omicron were reduced six- and 42-fold, respectively, with 67% of patients seropositive for WA1/2020 exhibiting seronegativity for Omicron. CONCLUSION Antibody binding and live-virus neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern including Delta and Omicron were substantially lower in patients with NHL/CLL compared with healthy vaccinees.

This chapter examines the two impossibilities of implementing regulatory frameworks capable of containing the tendency toward collapse within the realm of globalized capitalism: (1) the self-regulation of economic agents induced by the presence of mechanisms emanating from the market itself and (2) regulation induced not only by market mechanisms but also by agreements negotiated between businesses, the state, and civil society. The idea of self-regulation does not apply to capitalism because markets are not ruled by the principle of homeostasis. Moreover, capitalism cannot price its action on ecosystems because ecosystems are broader in space and time than the investment/profit cycle. No matter how corporate leaders want to improve their corporations ethical conduct, they cannot afford to subordinate their corporate goals to the environmental imperative. Analysis of the second impossibility mentioned above (regulation induced by agreements negotiated between businesses, the state, and civil society) touches on the punctus dolens of all the problems discussed in this chapter and even in this book: the impossibility of this second route stems from the lack of parity between the parties, a necessary condition for an effective negotiation.","output":"The Illusion of a Sustainable Capitalism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic in the USA has been accompanied by high rates of mortality and an unprecedented need for palliative care delivery. Little is known about the use of palliative care services in intensive care unit (ICU) settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission, between 7 March and 14 April 2020 to two academic teaching hospitals in New York City. Palliative care consultation included a one-time telemedicine consultation or continued telemedicine consultation and follow-up with multidisciplinary team involvement. Patient information was collected from the electronic health record and analyses were conducted with Stata V.15.1 (StataCorp) statistical software. RESULTS A total of 151 critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission were identified, of whom 59 (39.07%) received an inpatient palliative care consultation. More than half of patients died (n=85/151, 56.29%), with 57.65% (n=49/85) of these patients receiving palliative care services during their hospitalisation. Patients who received palliative care consultation were more likely to be older, sicker and receive mechanical ventilation than their counterparts. Patients who died and did not receive palliative care were younger and required non-invasive ventilation support. CONCLUSION There is a lack of utilisation of palliative care in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Further research into predictors of poor outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients may help identify patients that would benefit from early palliative care involvement going forward.","output":"Palliative care in critically ill COVID-19 patients: the early New York City experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present results of an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves which can be produced by spinning neutron stars with an asymmetry around their rotation axis, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors.

The pandemic has exposed the need for effective public health surveillance in the interest of global health security. However, current indicators are limited in doing a comparative intercountry assessment and comparison because of variation in testing rates and reporting standards. Hence, this study attempts at addressing this gap. Methods The study proposes incremental change in cases per testing rate (ICTR) as an indicator for doing cross country comparison of the pandemic progress. The equation for calculating this indicator is explained in this study. This is followed by measuring its strength of association and predictive power for determining change in SARS-CoV-2 cases in five countries (USA, UK, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh). Results and discussion ICTR was found to have a significantly higher strength of association and predictive power (than the existing indicator- test positivity rate) for determining change in cases over different time periods. Using ICTR, cross country comparison was done for the five countries for15 months to draw deeper insights into the progress of the pandemic. Conclusions The study finds ICTR to be a suitable indicator for inter country comparison and intra country monitoring of the pandemic, which would be useful for global COVID-19 surveillance.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the landscape of response to OHCAs, particularly with regard to providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We aimed to describe, characterize, and address the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers towards CPR of OHCA patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of healthcare workers and trainees in the United States and Saudi Arabia via an online survey available between October 2020, and May 2021. The primary outcome of interest was willingness to perform CPR for OHCA, with confidence to handle CPR for OHCA as our secondary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 501 healthcare professionals, including 436 (87%) with background in emergency medicine, participated in our survey. 331 (66%) reported being willing to perform CPR for OHCA, while 170 (34%) were not willing. 311 (94%) willing participants stated that their medical oath and moral responsibility were the main motivators for willingness, while a fear of contracting COVID-19 was the primary demotivating factor for 126 (74%) unwilling participants. Time series analysis with simple exponential smoothing showed an increase in willingness to perform CPR from 30% to 50%, as well as an increase in mean confidence level to perform CPR from 60% to 70%, between October 2020 and May 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected healthcare workers' attitudes towards performing CPR for OHCA.

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, new systems were developed quickly. The chest radiography is one of the least expensive among the imaging exams that assist in the detection of COVID-19. Despite not having high sensitivity for pattern detection compared to other tests - such as ground-glass opacities in computed tomography - this test helps screen infected patients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a methodology for detecting COVID-19 in chest radiography considering three possible scenarios: the healthy, presence of COVID-19, and presence of other pathologies. We developed the methodology by evaluating transfer learning techniques in five well know pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures. For training CNNs, we used 1,932 healthy images, 3,651 of other pathologies, and 1,436 images related to the presence of COVID-19. We obtained an accuracy of 94.36% in the scenario COVID-19 vs. healthy, 99.80% for COVID-19 vs. others pathologies, and 95.01% differentiating in three classes.

It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. Peoples day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vectorChost ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vectorChost ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vectorChost ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vectorChost ratio and peoples day-to-day movement patterns.

The Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) performed a survey to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical treatment of gynecological cancer, with a focus on chemotherapy and oral treatment with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARP-i). METHODS: The survey consisted of a self-administered online questionnaire, sent via email between November 2020 and January 2021 to all members of MITO group. RESULTS: Forty-nine centers completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (83%) use screening tests to determine COVID-19 status in patients who were to undergo chemotherapy or oral medications. All respondents to our survey continued cancer therapy in patients who tested negative for COVID-19 during the pandemic. Seventy-three percent of respondents declared they stopped treatment with chemotherapy or PARP-i only after a positive swab and resumed therapy when negative tests were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 positivity impacted patterns of treatment in patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer within the MITO group. Further investigations are needed to evaluate whether these modifications influence oncological clinical outcomes.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on medical treatment patterns in gynecologic oncology: a MITO group survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2) was published and the number of infected people began to increase rapidly, many global companies began to develop a vaccine. Almost all known approaches to vaccine design were applied for this purpose, including inactivated viruses, mRNA and DNA-vaccines, vaccines based on various viral vectors, synthetically generated peptides and recombinant proteins produced in cells of insects and mammals. This review considers one of the promising vaccine platforms based on messenger RNA. Until recent years, mRNA-vaccination was out of practical implementation due to high sensitivity to nuclease degradation and consequent instability of drugs based on mRNA. Latest technological advances significantly mitigated the problems of low immunogenicity, instability, and difficulties in RNA-vaccine delivery. It is worth noting that mRNA-vaccines can efficiently activate both components of the immune system, i. e. T-cell and humoral responses. The essential advantage of mRNAvaccines includes fast, inexpensive, scalable and uniform production providing a large output of desirable products in vitro. Synthesis and purification processes significantly simplify the process technology of mRNA drugs with injectable purity. Thus, mRNA production via in vitro transcription is more advantageous as compared with DNA-vaccines since it is a chemical process without the use of cells. mRNA techniques make it possible to pass all the phases of vaccine development much faster in comparison with the production of vaccines based on inactivated viruses or recombinant proteins. This property is critically important when designing vaccines against viral pathogens as the main problem of disease control includes a time gap between an epidemic and vaccine development. This paper discusses studies on the development of vaccines against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 with special attention to the mRNA technique.","output":"mRNA technology as one of the promising platforms for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In March and April 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic, site clinical practice guidelines were implemented for prone positioning of awake, alert, spontaneously breathing suspected COVID-19 patients in hypoxic respiratory distress. The purpose of this pandemic disaster practice improvement project was to measure changes in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning on awake, alert, spontaneously breathing non-intubated adult acute respiratory distress, or ARDS, patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of ED COVID-19 positive patients from 3/30/2020 to 4/30/2020 was conducted for patients with a room air pulse oximetry < 90% and a pre-prone position pulse oximetry  94% who tolerated prone positioning for at least 30 minutes. The primary outcome was change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30 minutes after initiating prone positioning. Median differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Of the 440 COVID-19 patients, 31 met inclusion criteria. Median pulse oximetry increased as 83% (IQR= 75%-86%) on room air, 90% (IQR=89%-93%) with supplemental oxygen, and 96% (IQR=94%-98%) with prone positioning (x.xx, p<.001). 45% (N=14) were intubated during their hospital stay and 26% (N=8) of the included patients died. CONCLUSION: In awake, alert, and spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19, an initially low pulse oximetry reading improved with prone positioning.

Methods: The performance of a whole blood interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) release assay (IGRA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was evaluated in COVID-19 convalescents tested serially up to 10 months post-infection and in healthy blood donors. SARS-CoV-2 IGRA was applied in contacts of households with index cases. Freshly collected blood in the lithium heparin tube was left unstimulated, stimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool, and stimulated with mitogen. Results: The overall sensitivity and specificity of IGRA were 84.5% (153/181; 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.0-89.0) and 86.6% (123/142; 95% CI;80.0-91.2), respectively.

Coronavirus caused a severe effect on the human immune system where some of the non-structural proteins (nsp) are involved in virus-mediated immune response and pathogenesis. To suppress the viral RNA replication mechanism and immune-mediated responses, we aimed to identify limonoids and triterpenoids as antagonists by targeting helicases (nsp13), exonuclease (nsp14), and endoribonuclease (nsp15) of SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutic proteins. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: In silico molecular docking and drug-likeness of a library of 369 phytochemicals from limonoids and triterpenoids were performed to screen the potential hits that binds effectively at the active site of the proteins target. In addition, the molecular dynamics simulations of the proteins and their complexes with the potential hits were performed for 100 ns by using GROMACS.

The model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter.

DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative design, using in-depth individual telephone interviews, and analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ten family members of adult COVID-19 patients in the ICU. RESULT: Seven key themes represented family members' experiences: (a) reactions to the COVID-19 diagnosis, (b) COVID-19 as a destabilizing force on the family unit, (c) COVID-19's effects on bereavement outcomes, (d) desperately seeking information, (e) family member needs, (f) conflicting feelings about video calls, and (g) appreciation of care. Family members' feelings about the patient's diagnosis and how the virus was contracted exacerbated their stress and anxiety. They struggled to feel informed about care that they could not witness and had difficulty understanding information. Family members reported that video calls were unhelpful. While these experiences made them question the quality of care, they expressed their appreciation of the frontline healthcare providers taking care of their loved ones.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the risk of psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and suppression measures during the early days of the lockdown. We compared the level of psychological distress at the beginning of that period with a pre-pandemic health survey and assessed the psychological effects of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in social activity and support. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to the general population in Belgium 3 days after the beginning of the lockdown. 20,792 respondents participated. The psychological distress of the population was measured using the GHQ-12 scale. Social activities and support were assessed using the Social Participation Measure, the Short Loneliness Scale, and the Oslo Social Support Scale. An index of subjective exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic was constructed, as well as a measure of change in occupational status. Measurements were compared to a representative sample of individuals extracted from the Belgian Health Interview Survey of 2018. Bootstrapping was performed and analyses were reweighted to match the Belgian population in order to control for survey selection bias. RESULTS: Half of the respondents reported psychological distress in the early days of the lockdown. A longer period of confinement was associated with higher risk of distress. Women and younger age groups were more at risk than men and older age groups, as were respondents who had been exposed to COVID-19. Changes in occupational status and a decrease in social activity and support also increased the risk of psychological distress. Comparing the results with those of the 2018 Belgian Health Interview shows that the early period of the lockdown corresponded to a 2.3-fold increase in psychological distress (95% CI: 2.16C2.45). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress is associated with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and suppression measures.

Identified in China in December 2019, the virus has spread more than 200 countries in the world. Scientists have named the virus as Novel Corona Virus (belongs to SARS group virus). The virus has caused severe disruption to our world. Educational institutions, financial Services, government services and many other sectors are badly affected by this virus. More importantly, the virus has caused a massive amount of human deaths around the world and still its infecting people every day. Scientist around the world are trying to find a solution to stop the COVID-19. Their solutions include identifying possible effective vaccine, computer-aided modelling to see the pattern of spread etc. Using Machine Learning techniques, it is possible to forecast the spread, death, and recovery due to COVID-19. In this article, we have shown a machine learning model named as Prophet Time Series Analysis to forecast the spread, death, and recovery in different countries. We train the model using the available historical data on COVID-19 from John Hopkins University's COVID-19 site. Then we forecast spread, death, and recovery for seven days using a well known forecasting model called Prophet. This interval can be increased to see the effect of COVID-19. We chose 145 days of historical data to train the model then we predict effect for seven days (15 June 2020 to 22 June 2020). To verify out result, we compare the predicted value with actual value of spread, death and recovery. The model provides accuracy over 92% in all the cases. Our model can be used to identify the effect of COVID-19 in any countries in the world. The system is developed using Python language and visualization is also possible interactively. By using our system, it will be possible to observe the effect of spread, death and recovery for any countries for any period of time. ? 2021 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

We were familiarizing ourselves with digital pathology solutions at the time when the COVID-19 outbreak forced us to embark on an abrupt transition to digital pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe how the abrupt transition to digital pathology might affect the quality of diagnoses, model possible causes by probabilistic modeling, and qualitatively gauge the perception of this abrupt transition. METHODS: A total of 17 pathologists and residents participated in this study; these participants reviewed 25 additional test cases from the archives and completed a final psychologic survey. For each case, participants performed several different diagnostic tasks, and their results were recorded and compared with the original diagnoses performed using the gold standard method (ie, conventional microscopy). We performed Bayesian data analysis with probabilistic modeling. RESULTS: The overall analysis, comprising 1345 different items, resulted in a 9% (117/1345) error rate in using digital slides. The task of differentiating a neoplastic process from a nonneoplastic one accounted for an error rate of 10.7% (42/392), whereas the distinction of a malignant process from a benign one accounted for an error rate of 4.2% (11/258). Apart from residents, senior pathologists generated most discrepancies (7.9%, 13/164). Our model showed that these differences among career levels persisted even after adjusting for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in line with previous findings, emphasizing that the duration of transition (ie, lengthy or abrupt) might not influence the diagnostic performance. Moreover, our findings highlight that senior pathologists may be limited by a digital gap, which may negatively affect their performance with digital pathology. These results can guide the process of digital transition in the field of pathology.","output":"Digital Pathology During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Working in the ICU during the first COVID-19 wave was associated with high levels of mental health disorders. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the mental health symptoms in health-care providers (HCPs) facing the second wave? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study (October 30-December 1, 2020) was conducted in 16 ICUs during the second wave in France. HCPs completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (for post-traumatic stress disorder), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: Of 1,203 HCPs, 845 responded (70%) (66% nursing staff, 32% medical staff, 2% other professionals); 487 (57.6%) had treated more than 10 new patients with COVID-19 in the previous week. Insomnia affected 320 (37.9%), and 7.7% were taking a psychotropic drug daily. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout were reported in 60.0% (95% CI, 56.6%-63.3%), 36.1% (95% CI, 32.9%-39.5%), 28.4% (95% CI, 25.4%-31.6%), and 45.1% (95% CI, 41.7%-48.5%) of respondents, respectively. Independent predictors of such symptoms included respondent characteristics (sex, profession, experience, personality traits), work organization (ability to rest and to care for family), and self-perceptions (fear of becoming infected or of infecting family and friends, feeling pressure related to the surge, intention to leave the ICU, lassitude, working conditions, feeling they had a high-risk profession, and \\"missing the clapping\\"). The number of patients with COVID-19 treated in the first wave or over the last week was not associated with symptoms of mental health disorders.

More than 20 published studies have used RT-PCR methods to determine viral SARS-CoV-2 genomic presence in postmortem brain tissue and the overall impression is that viral brain invasion is relatively uncommon and occurs in low copy numbers, supporting indirect mechanisms as the cause of most neurological phenomena. Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and stroke are one such possible indirect mechanism, as acute ischemia or stroke concurrence with COVID-19 has been reported as being 0.5% to 20%. Immunohistochemical stains for beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been suggested to be a signature change of hypoxic leukoencephalopathy or COVID-19 brain disease, although prior reports have not had a non-COVID-19 control group. We therefore compared the prevalence and intensity of white matter APP staining in the brains of subjects dying with and without COVID-19. Clinical and neuropathological results, including semi-quantitative assessment of the density of white matter APP staining, were compared between 20 COVID-19 cases and 20 pre-COVID-19 autopsy cases, including 10 cases with autopsy-proven non-COVID-19 pneumonia and 10 cases without pneumonia. Positive APP white matter staining in at least one of the two brain regions (precentral gyrus and cingulate gyrus) studied was not significantly more common in COVID-19 vs controls (14/20 vs 12/20). Comparing density scores from both brain regions combined, the mean scores for COVID-19 cases were higher than those for controls of both types together but not significantly different when restricting to controls with pneumonia. Among control cases, cases with pneumonia had significantly higher scores. The presence or absence of a major neuropathologically-defined neurodegenerative disorder did not significantly affect the APP scores. The major finding is that while APP white matter staining cannot be regarded as a specific marker of COVID-19, as it does not occur with significantly greater probability in in COVID-19 brains as compared to non-COVID-19 brains, it is possible that white matter APP staining, representing acute or subacute axonal damage, may be a common occurrence in the perimortem period, and that it may be more intense in subjects dying with pneumonia, regardless of cause.","output":"White Matter Beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein Immunoreactivity in Autopsied Subjects With and Without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The incorporation of effective treatments is critical to improving patient care for COVID-19.

Methods 10 online, CME-certified activities were delivered in multiple formats. For individual activities, educational effect was assessed with a repeated pairs pre-/post-assessment study including a 1 to 7-item, multiple choice, knowledge/competence questionnaire and one confidence assessment question. To assess changes in knowledge, competence, and confidence, data were aggregated across activities and stratified by learning theme.

However, it is unclear how zeolite amendment alters soil K fixation, K utilization, and K balance in the paddy rice systems under AWD compared with continuous flooding irrigation (CF). A two-year lysimeter experiment with a split-plot design was used to evaluate the effect of irrigation regime and fertilization management in paddy fields in Donggang, northern coastal China in 2018 and 2019. The field experiment included two irrigation regimes (CF and AWD) as the main plots, and three zeolite/K managements (Z 0 K 0 , no added zeolite or K;Z 5 K 30 , 5 t haC1 zeolite and 30 kg haC1 K;Z 0 K 60 , no added zeolite and 60 kg haC1 K) as the subplots. The results showed that zeolite mitigated the reductions in grain yield and aboveground biomass caused by water stress in AWD. Zeolite addition also caused soil K fixation under AWD, which reduced K leaching losses and avoided excessive K absorption by rice plants, thus contributing to sustainable rice production by preventing soil K depletion. The Z 5 K 30 treatment had lower total K leaching losses and higher K partial factor productivity (the ability of rice to use K to produce yield) than the commonly used practice (Z 0 K 60). Compared with Z 0 K 60 under CF, the Z 5 K 30 treatment under AWD produced higher grain yield, economic benefit, water use efficiency, and total K balance.

Electrocardiography was measured during the task and during four baseline periods in order to calculate vmHRV. RTs on the flanker task were fit to an ex-Gaussian distribution, which estimated three RT parameters: mu (Gaussian mean), sigma (Gaussian SD), and tau (combination of exponential mean and SD). First, findings indicate that threat of noise was associated with reductions in mu and tau, suggesting that SA might improve attention and motor responding. Second, higher resting vmHRV was associated with relatively lower tau (averaged across conditions), as well as to relatively stronger threat-related decreases in tau. Third, intra-individual decreases in vmHRV were accompanied by concomitant decreases in tau. These findings support roles for trait and state vagal control in guiding adaptive anxiety-related (and anxiety-unrelated) attentional responses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients consecutively admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively collected, and retrospective statistical analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess potential factors for poor outcomes defined as ARDS or death. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were analysed, and 34 of them developed respiratory failure (70% as ARDS).

Distant metastases are seen in 50% of cases regardless of treatment, which contributes to high mortality rates. Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a protein regulator of mitotic entry and cytokinesis. Increased PLK-1 expression has been shown in different tumours, which makes its inhibition a potential treatment target. To date, no study has been published to discuss the prognostic role of PLK-1 expression in patients with uveal melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS . We assessed by immunohistochemistry PLK-1 expression in uveal melanoma cells collected in 158 patients treated by primary enucleation. We determined the correlation between PLK-1 levels evaluated by the immunoreactivity scale (IRS) method and detailed clinical as well as histological parameters. Additionally, we determined the association between PLK-1 expression levels and long-term prognosis. RESULTS Elevated PLK-1 expression in tumour cells, defined as IRS >2, was observed in 70% (111/158) of cases, whereas low expression or no expression was seen in the remaining 30% (47/158) of patients. There was a significant correlation between low PLK-1 expression and a higher clinical tumour stage (pT, p = 0.04) as well as a higher AJCC prognostic stage group (p = 0.037). We observed an inverse correlation between PLK-1 expression and tumour cell pigment content (p = 0.0019). There was no correlation between PLK-1 expression and other histological parameters such as mitotic rate or histological subtype. The Kaplan-Meier's analysis demonstrated that low PLK-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0058).

However, might there be some individuals for whom job loss may be so detrimental that they experience high levels of worry even if they view job loss as less likely? To answer this question, the present study leveraged research on future-oriented cognition to investigate profiles of cognitive and affective job insecurity (JI). We examined how economic job dependency relates to different profiles of JI experiences as well as the implications of these profiles for understanding heterogeneity in work strain. Latent profile analysis using the U.S. International Social Survey Program data set, and replicated in the U.K. data set, revealed three profiles: Employees who are secure in their role and do not worry about potential job loss (secure alignment profile), those who worry significantly about job loss despite perceiving minimal job threats (affective JI misalignment profile), and employees who worry to some extent and perceive minimal job threats (ambivalent JI alignment profile). As anticipated, several economic job dependence factors (perceived employability and education) were predictors of profile membership. Further, those in the affective JI misalignment profile reported the greatest amount of strain. We discuss our results in terms of implications for JI theory and organizational practice.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence about the optimal management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and even less is available in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy than in the general population. In this retrospective, observational, single-center study, we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of all maintenance hemodialysis patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 12th to April 10th, 2020 as confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Baseline features, clinical course, laboratory data, and different therapies were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Among the 36 patients, 11 (30.5%) died, and 7 were able to be discharged within the observation period. Clinical and radiological evolution during the first week of admission were predictive of mortality. Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as defined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 L/min and radiological worsening. Significantly, 11 of those 18 patients (61.1%) died. None of the classical cardiovascular risk factors in the general population were associated with higher mortality. Compared to survivors, nonsurvivors had significantly longer dialysis vintage, increased lactate dehydrogenase (490 U/l  120 U/l vs. 281 U/l  151 U/l, P = 0.008) and C-reactive protein levels (18.3 mg/dl  13.7 mg/dl vs. 8.1 mg/dl  8.1 mg/dl, P = 0.021), and a lower lymphocyte count (0.38 103/l  0.14 103/l vs. 0.76 103/l  0.48 103/l, P = 0.04) 1 week after clinical onset.

METHODS: We analyzed the antiviral activity of 41 drugs against the SFTSV to explore potential therapeutic candidates using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and plaque assay in vitro. RESULTS: Peramivir, nitazoxanide, and favipiravir were found to have inhibitory effects on the SFTSV at concentrations below the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax).

Methods Observational study in a 185-bed nursing home with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, and weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2 was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (CT) value below 32 were selected for sequencing. Results 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). Conclusions The frequency of a/presymptomatic residents compared to staff suggests that a/presymptomatic residents could be unrecognized symptomatic cases. However, symptomatic and presymptomatic/unrecognized symptomatic residents both have the same potential for viral shedding. The high prevalence symptomatic staff found in facility-wide testing suggests that staff has difficulty attributing their symptoms to possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast isolation and mitigation of this outbreak.","output":"A COVID-19 Nursing Home Transmission Study: sequence and metadata from weekly testing in an extensive nursing home outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stem cell therapies offer a great promise for regenerative and reconstructive medicine, due to their self-renewal and differentiation capacity.

This paper presents the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will test the effectiveness of link workers based in general practices in deprived areas in improving health outcomes for people with multimorbidity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The protocol presents the proposed pragmatic RCT, involving 10 general practitioner (GP) practices and 600 patients. Eligible participants will be community dwelling adults with multimorbidity (two chronic conditions) identified as being suitable for referral to a practice-based link worker. Following baseline data collection, the patients will be randomised into intervention group that will meet the link worker over a1-month period, or a wait list control that will receive usual GP care. Primary outcomes are health-related quality of life as assessed by EQ-5D-5L and mental health assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes are based on the core outcome set for multimorbidity. Data will be collected at baseline and on intervention completion at 1 month using questionnaires self-completed by participants and GP records. Parallel process and economic analyses will be conducted to explore participants experiences and examine cost-effectiveness of the link worker intervention.

EOS notably affect asthmatic response by generating several lipid mediators. Mice have been utilized in hopes of defining new pharmacological targets to treat asthma. However, many pinpointed targets in mice did not translate into clinics, underscoring that key differences exist between the two species. In this study, we compared the ability of human (h) and mouse (m) EOS to biosynthesize key bioactive lipids derived from arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). hEOS were isolated from the blood of healthy subjects and mild asthmatics, while mEOSs were differentiated from the bone marrow. EOSs were treated with fatty acids and lipid mediator biosynthesis assessed by LC-MS/MS. We found that hEOS biosynthesized leukotriene (LT) C(4) and LTB(4) in a 5:1 ratio while mEOS almost exclusively biosynthesized LTB(4). The biosynthesis of the 15-lipoxygenase (LO) metabolites 15-HETE and 12-HETE also differed, with a 15-HETE:12-HETE ratio of 6.3 for hEOS and 0.727 for mEOS. EOS biosynthesized some specialized pro-resolving mediators, and the levels from mEOS were 9-times higher than those of hEOS. In contrast, hEOS produced important amounts of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) and its congeners from EPA and DHA, a biosynthetic pathway that was up to ~100-fold less prominent in mEOS. Our data show that hEOS and mEOS biosynthesize the same lipid mediators but in different amounts. Compared to asthmatics, mouse models likely have an amplified involvement of LTB(4) and specialized pro-resolving mediators and a diminished impact of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol and its congeners.","output":"Human and Mouse Eosinophils Differ in Their Ability to Biosynthesize Eicosanoids, Docosanoids, the Endocannabinoid 2-Arachidonoyl-glycerol and Its Congeners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-organ fibrosis among end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients cannot be explained by uremia alone.

Basal plasma levels of proteolytic regulators and fibrotic factors were elevated in ESRD patients compared to healthy controls, with isoform-specific changes during HD. Platelet lysate (PL) RNA transcripts for growth and coagulative factors were elevated post-HD, with upregulation correlated to HD vintage. Platelet secretome correlations to plasma factors reveal acutely induced pro-fibrotic platelet phenotypes in ESRD patients during HD characterized by preferentially enhanced proteolytic enzyme translation and secretion, platelet contribution to inflammatory response, and increasing platelet dysfunction with blood flow rate (BFR) and Vintage. Compensatory mechanisms of increased platelet growth factor synthesis with acute plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP) increases show short-term mode-switching between dialysis sessions leading to long-term pro-fibrotic bias.

To address needs such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, unique user access, the ability to send automated reminders, and a limited development budget, we used the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data management platform to deliver a patient-facing psychological intervention designed for patients with voice disorders. This was a novel use of REDCap. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usability of the intervention, with this intervention serving as a use case for REDCap-based patient-facing interventions. METHODS: We used REDCap survey instruments to develop the web-based voice intervention modules, then conducted usability evaluations using (1) heuristic evaluations by 2 evaluators, and (2) formal usability testing with 7 participants, consisting of predetermined tasks, a think-aloud protocol, ease-of-use measurements, a product reaction card, and a debriefing interview. RESULTS: Heuristic evaluations found strengths in visibility of system status and real-world match, and weaknesses in user control and help documentation. Based on this feedback, changes to the intervention were made before usability testing. Overall, usability testing participants found the intervention useful and easy to use, although testing revealed some concerns with design, content, and terminology. Some concerns were readily addressed, and others required adaptations within REDCap.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study, including all residents aged 50-69 years, who were offered the public screening programme with biannual faecal immunochemical tests. Demographic (of all GPs) and screening data (of all eligible residents) for years 2018-2019 were collected from the official electronic datasets of the Ancona Local Health Unit. The potential predictors of acceptable screening uptake, including GP's gender, age, and number of registered subjects, were evaluated using random-effect logistic regression, with geographical area as the cluster unit. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 332 GP clusters, including 120,178 eligible subjects. The overall province uptake was 38.0%  10.7%. The uptake was lower than 30% in one-fifth of the GP clusters, and higher than 45% in another fifth.

The groups were compared with regard of patient's characteristics, perioperative findings/complications, operative time, pain severity, analgesic requirement, time to oral tolerance and flatus, length of hospital stay, and cosmetic results. RESULTS A total of 75 consecutive patients enrolled in the study. Each group included 25 patients. The groups showed no significant differences in patient's characteristics. The mean operative time was significantly longer in SILA than OA with a mean difference of 7 minutes (P < 0.05). Postoperative pain after OA were significantly higher than SLA and SILA (P < 0.05). The average time to oral tolerance and flatus was significantly higher in OA than the laparoscopic groups with a mean difference of 1 and 2.5 hours (P = 0.04 and 0.023, respectively).

Of note, TB-IRIS is characterized by exacerbated inflammation and tissue damage that occurs in response to the elevated production of CD4(+) T cell-derived IFN-. Nevertheless, the possible participation of CD8(+) T cells in TB-IRIS development remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive assessment of the composition of CD8(+) T cell memory subsets and their association with circulating inflammation-related molecules in TB-HIV coinfected patients initiating ART. RESULTS: We found that TB-IRIS individuals display higher frequencies of Antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells during the onset of IRIS and that the levels of these cells positively correlate with baseline mycobacterial smear grade. TB-IRIS individuals exhibited higher frequencies of effector memory and lower percentages of na?ve CD8(+) T cells than their Non-IRIS counterparts. In both TB-IRIS and Non-IRIS patients, ART commencement was associated with fewer significant correlations among memory CD8(+) T cells and cells from other immune compartments. Networks analysis revealed distinct patterns of correlation between each memory subset with inflammatory cytokines suggesting different dynamics of CD8(+) T cell memory subsets reconstitution. TB-IRIS patients displayed lower levels of memory cells positive for CXCR3 (a chemokine receptor that plays a role in trafficking activated CD8(+) T cells to the tissues) than Non-IRIS individuals before and after ART. Furthermore, we found that CXCR3(+) na?ve CD8(+) T cells were inversely associated with the risk of TB-IRIS development. On the other hand, we noticed that the frequencies of CXCR3(+) effector CD8(+) T cells were positively associated with the probability of TB-IRIS development. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that TB-IRIS individuals display a distinct profile of memory CD8(+) T cell subsets reconstitution after ART initiation. Moreover, our data point to a differential association between the frequencies of CXCR3(+) CD8(+) T cells and the risk of TB-IRIS development.

Furthermore, we depicted the cumulative cases curves of COVID-19, reproducing the spreading of the pandemic between the cities of S?o Paulo and S?o Jos dos Campos, Brazil. The scenarios also unveil how the lockdown measures can flatten the contamination curves.

The incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients is not exactly known and its detection in these patients is challenging. Thus, the healthcare staff managing these patients at the CCFs and general wards at the PHIs should be vigilant and monitor these patients for development of signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, as well as trend D-dimer level.

Methods Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, we conducted a case-control study using ICD-10-CM codes to identify PWSUD aged 12 years and older with hospital visits for any reason during AprilCDecember 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to identify factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among PWSUD (age, sex, race/ethnicity, U.S. Census Region, urban/rural classification, insurance payor type, comorbidities, and substance use disorder [SUD] type), and then stratified by SUD type. Results From April-December 2020, 18,298 (1.3%) of 1,429,154 persons with SUD in the database had a COVID-19 diagnosis. Among PWSUD, opioid use disorder (OUD;aOR=1.24, 95% CI=1.18-1.32), alcohol use disorder (AUD;aOR=1.16, 95%CI=1.11-1.22), cocaine or other stimulant use disorder (COUD;aOR=1.28, 95% CI=1.22-1.34), and multiple SUDs (aOR=1.20, 95%CI=1.15-1.26) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19, as were comorbidities such as chronic lower respiratory disease (aOR=1.32, 95% CI=1.26-1.37), chronic hepatitis (aOR=1.45, 95% CI=1.34-1.57), and diabetes (aOR=1.78, 95% CI=1.71-1.86).

A severe risk of infection has been observed in elderly populations. In addition, individuals with obesity and obesity-related comorbidities have also been identified to be at a higher risk of infection for COVID-19. We have attempted here to provide evidence in support of exercise management as a prevention strategy for improving health and minimizing the effects of COVID-19. Therefore, exercise duration, frequency, and intensity benefits are summarized in an attempt to provide guidelines for the general population. In terms of exercise effects, there are multiple benefits of exercise related to human health. These include, decreases in adipose tissue, improvements in cardio-respiratory fitness, enhanced metabolic homeostasis, and suppress inflammation active. With respect to the amount of exercise performed individuals should exercise at a moderate intensity for at least 150 min/wk as an initial target. Increases in intensity and duration of exercise training are necessary for significant fitness benefits, weight loss, and prevention of weight regain. In relation to walking, 10,000 steps/day at a rate of 64C170 steps/minute for at least 10 min duration is reasonable for healthy adults. For exercise intensity, a combination of resistance training (RT), aerobic training (AT) as well as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) incorporated with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) can be recognized as an optimal exercise mode for health benefits. Aerobic training and MICT should be viewed as a basis for exercise in combination with appropriate volumes and types of RT and HIIT.

E-questionnaire dissemination occurred through e-mails, QR-codes or live/phone interviews ~7 days after the first and second vaccine dose. A descriptive analysis was conducted to quantify AEFI incidence on both occasions, stratifying results by type and severity of symptoms. FINDINGS: Mean age of the 2558 vaccine recipients was 6614 years. First-dose AEFI incidence was 53.3% (systemic reactions at 42.2%), while second-dose AEFI incidence was 66.8% (systemic reactions at 50.4%) (n = 1288). In general, 76.0% of two-dose recipients reported some AEFIs after either vaccine dose, and 2.1% suffered severe reactions; in 60- to 89-year-olds (n = 1021), AEFI incidence was 70.0%, with 53.0% of subjects describing systemic reactions and 0.8% reporting severe symptoms.

The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate.

Participants were classified as having chronic pain if they endorsed significant pain for >3 months that did not remit on subsequent surveys. An additional survey, the Coronavirus Impact Questionnaire (CIQ), was created and administered in March 2021 to OK-SNAP enrollees to assess self-reported effects of the pandemic.

It is one of the most common symptoms of upper respiratory diseases including COVID-19 and is a leading cause of physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions. Despite being on the market for decades, few over the counter sore throat medications are proven to heal sore throat. In studying pharyngitis using organotypic human respiratory tissue stimulated with bradykinin, we saw an increase in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in response to bradykinin. Bradykinin is one of the first inflammatory signals for pharyngitis and it increases PGE2 in human subjects. If left unregulated, PGE2 may further increase inflammation via the COX pathway and via IL-8, a proinflammatory chemokine responsible for neutrophil infiltration and possibly thus, a cytokine storm. Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), a non-specific COX inhibitor, was able to mitigate a bradykinin-induced increase in PGE2 in our studies. However, ASA was inflammatory above its small therapeutic window, greatly increasing levels of PGE2 and IL-8 above those seen with bradykinin stimulation alone. Similar to other systems, the respiratory epithelia maintains a delicate balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals in order to keep the respiratory barrier intact. To our knowledge, this is the first study to try and elucidate the complex mechanisms involved in healing pharyngitis, an inflammatory condition of the respiratory epithelia. Biovanta?, a formula containing ASA mitigated bradykinin-induced inflammation more strongly than ASA alone in organotypic human respiratory tissues.

However, IV iron administration did consistently cause a significant increase in hemoglobin levels relative to oral iron therapy or no iron. CONCLUSION Overall, these findings are consistent in that IV iron administration is highly effective at rapidly increasing hemoglobin levels in patients with iron deficiency anemia undergoing major abdominal surgery. Unfortunately, there is currently no evidence of reduced incidence of allogeneic blood transfusions or other enhanced outcomes.","output":"Preoperative Anemia Treatment with Intravenous Iron Therapy in Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stimulated by the analysis of a dataset from China about Covid-19, we propose a class of semiparametric models for panel data analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the reaction of global Internet users to the outbreak of COVID-19 by evaluating the possibility of using Internet monitoring as an instrument in handling communicable diseases and responding to public health emergencies. METHODS: The disease-related data were retrieved from Chinas National Health Commission (CNHC) and World Health Organization (WHO) from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Daily Google Trends (GT) and daily Baidu Attention Index (BAI) for the keyword Coronavirus were collected from their official websites. Rumors which occurred in the course of this outbreak were mined from Chinese National Platform to Refute Rumors (CNPRR) and Tencent Platform to Refute Rumors (TPRR). Kendalls Tau-B rank test was applied to check the bivariate correlation among the two indexes mentioned above, epidemic trends, and rumors. RESULTS: After the outbreak of COVID-19, both daily BAI and daily GT increased rapidly and remained at a high level, this process lasted about 10 days. When major events occurred, daily BAI, daily GT, and the number of rumors simultaneously reached new peaks. Our study indicates that these indexes and rumors are statistically related to disease-related indicators. Information symmetry was also found to help significantly eliminate the false news and to prevent rumors from spreading across social media through the epidemic outbreak. CONCLUSION: Compared to traditional methods, Internet monitoring could be particularly efficient and economical in the prevention and control of epidemic and rumors by reflecting public attention and attitude, especially in the early period of an outbreak.","output":"An Extensive Search Trends-Based Analysis of Public Attention on Social Media in the Early Outbreak of COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we provide details regarding the steps of technology transfer in the context of working with a MEMS wafer foundry.

Patients with thoracic malignancies are thought to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 given their older age, smoking habits, and pre-existing cardiopulmonary comorbidities, in addition to cancer treatments. We aimed to study the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with thoracic malignancies. METHODS: The Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration (TERAVOLT) registry is a multicentre observational study composed of a cross-sectional component and a longitudinal cohort component. Eligibility criteria were the presence of any thoracic cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], small-cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumours, and other pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms) and a COVID-19 diagnosis, either laboratory confirmed with RT-PCR, suspected with symptoms and contacts, or radiologically suspected cases with lung imaging features consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and symptoms. Patients of any age, sex, histology, or stage were considered eligible, including those in active treatment and clinical follow-up. Clinical data were extracted from medical records of consecutive patients from Jan 1, 2020, and will be collected until the end of pandemic declared by WHO. Data on demographics, oncological history and comorbidities, COVID-19 diagnosis, and course of illness and clinical outcomes were collected. Associations between demographic or clinical characteristics and outcomes were measured with odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, with sex, age, smoking status, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease included in multivariable analysis. This is a preliminary analysis of the first 200 patients. The registry continues to accept new sites and patient data. FINDINGS: Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients with COVID-19 and thoracic cancers from eight countries were identified and included in the TERAVOLT registry; median age was 680 years (618C750) and the majority had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0C1 (142 [72%] of 196 patients), were current or former smokers (159 [81%] of 196), had non-small-cell lung cancer (151 [76%] of 200), and were on therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (147 [74%] of 199), with 112 (57%) of 197 on first-line treatment. 152 (76%) patients were hospitalised and 66 (33%) died. 13 (10%) of 134 patients who met criteria for ICU admission were admitted to ICU; the remaining 121 were hospitalised, but were not admitted to ICU. Univariable analyses revealed that being older than 65 years (OR 188, 95% 100C362), being a current or former smoker (424, 170C1295), receiving treatment with chemotherapy alone (254, 109C611), and the presence of any comorbidities (265, 109C746) were associated with increased risk of death. However, in multivariable analysis, only smoking history (OR 318, 95% CI 111C906) was associated with increased risk of death. INTERPRETATION: With an ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, our data suggest high mortality and low admission to intensive care in patients with thoracic cancer. Whether mortality could be reduced with treatment in intensive care remains to be determined. With improved cancer therapeutic options, access to intensive care should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting based on cancer specific mortality and patients' preference.

Therefore, we aimed to understand health and lifestyle conditions associated with frailty transition over 6 months and devise a method for identifying frailty among community-dwelling older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This community-based prospective cohort study was conducted from May to July 2020 (baseline) and November 2020 to January 2021 (follow-up) in Japan, with 1,953 community-dwelling older people (65 years) at baseline. To identify transition from non-frailty at baseline to frailty at follow-up, the Frailty Screening Index was used. For predicting frailty transition, two self-reported questionnaires assessing health and lifestyle conditions were employed. RESULTS: Overall, 706 individuals returned the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Among the 492 non-frail older people at baseline, there was a 9.8% increase in frailty transition. The adjusted model for frailty transition by age, sex, multimorbidity, and living arrangements indicated that forgetfulness (odds ratio [OR] 2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 7.51), falls in the past year (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.74), and subjective leg muscle weakness (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.21) were predictors of frailty transition. The combination of age 75 years and subjective leg muscle weakness showed moderate sensitivity, specificity, and % accuracy (0.688, 0.696, and 69.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of older people showed new transitions to frailty over 6 months during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.","output":"Modified SEIR and AI prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China under public health interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report clinical profile of hundred and nine patients with SARS CoV-2 infection, and whole genome sequences (WGS) of seven virus isolates from the first reported cases in India, with various international travel histories.

WBC and neutrophil counts showed an increase, while lymphocyte counts decreased in patients with severe infection suggesting a possible neutrophil mediated organ damage, while immune activity may be diminished with decrease in lymphocytes leading to disease severity. Increase in SGOT, SGPT and blood urea suggests the functional deficiencies of liver, heart, and kidney in patients who succumbed to the disease when compared to the group of recovered patients. The WGS analysis showed that these isolates were classified into two clades: I/A3i, and A2a (four according to GISAID: O, L, GR, and GH).

Especially for health professionals, flu vaccination is the best method to protect them, and the same applies for the patients and the general population from being infected. One of the most important preventive measure is vaccination and the main types of vaccines available, the limitations and side effects are briefly presented. AIM: The aim of this paper is to present the necessity of the healthcare professionals to conceptualize the importance of flu vaccination ifor themselves and the general population. Healthcare professionals are influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Epidemiological surveys on this issue are presented for Greece, European Union, and the USA. METHODS: A broad scope literature review was conducted based on a strict selection process of articles referring to the general population and the healthcare professionals with emphasis on the time period from the fall of 2018 until the spring of 2020 across Greece. The method used in this research obtained information through bibliographical references throughout Europe, USA, and relevant studies in Greece. RESULTS: The results of this research indicated that influenza vaccination among healthcare professionals in Greece in the time period 2018-2019 was higher in primary health centers (PHCs) with a percentage of 43.8% than in Hospitals which was 30.6%. In addition, in the time period 2019-2020 flu vaccination among health professionals was higher in PHCs with a percentage of 57.9% rather than in Hospitals with a percentage of 38.8%. Specifically, flu vaccination rate which took place in hospitals was higher among physicians than in other healthcare personnel. Furthermore, the fundamental reasons for recommending flu vaccination in healthcare professionals are presented, and issues related to denial or acceptance of it are highlighted. Measures and strategies are proposed in order to increase flu vaccination coverage in healthcare facilities in Greece. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this research review healthcare professionals (HCPs) especially the ones working in ICUs, in ICUs for newborn children, in Departments for acute care infections, in Departments caring of persons with immunodeficiency or Units for transplantation, Oncology and Haematology Departments, and finally, in Emergency Care Units need directly to be vaccinated for the flu virus.

Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5X greater than that observed in influenza hemagglutinin HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These findings uncover a high degree of adaptation in S1 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may undergo antigenic drift.","output":"Rapid and parallel adaptive mutations in spike S1 drive clade success in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background As the Municipality Council area in Colombo (CMC) experienced the highest number of cases until end of January 2021, in Sri Lanka, we carried out a serosurvey prior to initiation of the vaccination program to understand the extent of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Methods SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was determined in 2547 individuals between the ages of 10 to 86 years, by the Wantai total antibody ELISA. We also compared to seroprevalence using the haemagglutination test (HAT) to evaluate its usefulness in carrying out serosurveys. Results The overall seropositivity rate was 24.46%, while seropositivity by HAT was 18.9%. Although the SARS-CoV-2 infection detection rates by PCR were highest in the population between the ages of 20 to 60 years of age, the seropositivity rates were equal among all age groups. The seropositivity rate was highest in the 10 to 20 age group (34.03%), whereas the PCR positivity rates was 9.8%. Differences in the PCR positivity rates and seropositivity rates were also seen in 60- to 70-year-olds (8.9% vs 30.4%) and in individuals >70 year (4.1% vs 1.2%). The seropositivity rates of the females was 29.7% (290/976), which was significantly higher (p<0.002) than in males 21.2% (333/1571). Conclusions A high seroprevalence rate (24.5%) was seen in all age groups in the CMC suggesting that a high level of transmission was seen during this area.

DESIGN observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS accesses to the emergency departments (EDs) of Lazio Region hospitals in the first three months of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES total number of accesses to the emergency room and number of specific accesses for cardio and cerebrovascular diseases, for severe trauma, for symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, and for symptoms related to pneumonia. RESULTS in the first 3 months of 2019, there were 429,972 accesses to the EDs of Lazio Region; in the same period of 2020, accesses arise to 353,806, (reduction of 21.5%), with a 73% reduction in the last three weeks of march 2020 as compared with the corresponding period of 2019. Comparing the first 3 months of the 2017-2019 with 2020, the accesses for acute coronary syndrome and acute cerebrovascular disease decreased since the 10th week up to more than 57% and 50%, respectively. The accesses due to symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions, proxy of potentially inappropriate conditions, decreased since the 8th week, with a maximum reduction of 70%. Access to severe trauma decreased by up to 70% in the 11th week. The accesses for pneumonia increased up to a 70% increment in the 12th week.

Hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses demonstrate that students COVID-19 mitigating actions after stay-at-home orders were significantly and positively associated with, in order of importance: (1) higher levels of COVID-19 spread prevention knowledge; (2) espousing more liberal, as opposed to conservative, political orientations; (3) being female; and (4) increased disbelief of COVID-19 misinformation/disinformation claims. Furthermore, the students political orientation moderated the relationship between their trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decisions and their personal COVID-19 actions, with trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decision-making being a significant positive predictor of moderate, conservative, and very conservative student groups COVID-19 mitigating actions. Conversely, there was no association between trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decision-making and very liberal and liberal students conducting COVID-19 actions.

The spread of fake news, misinformation, digital kidnapping, and ransomware-related crimes are amongst the most recurrent crimes in which manipulated digital photos and videos are the perpetrating and disseminating medium. Criminal investigation has been challenged in applying machine learning techniques to automatically distinguish between fake and genuine seized photos and videos. Despite the pertinent need for manual validation, easy-to-use platforms for digital forensics are essential to automate and facilitate the detection of tampered content and to help criminal investigators with their work. This paper presents a machine learning Support Vector Machines (SVM) based method to distinguish between genuine and fake multimedia files, namely digital photos and videos, which may indicate the presence of deepfake content. The method was implemented in Python and integrated as new modules in the widely used digital forensics application Autopsy. The implemented approach extracts a set of simple features resulting from the application of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to digital photos and video frames. The model was evaluated with a large dataset of classified multimedia files containing both legitimate and fake photos and frames extracted from videos. Regarding deepfake detection in videos, the Celeb-DFv1 dataset was used, featuring 590 original videos collected from YouTube, and covering different subjects. The results obtained with the 5-fold cross-validation outperformed those SVM-based methods documented in the literature, by achieving an average F1-score of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] , respectively for photos, videos, and a mixture of both types of content. A benchmark with state-of-the-art methods was also done, by comparing the proposed SVM method with deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Despite CNN having outperformed the proposed DFT-SVM compound method, the competitiveness of the results attained by DFT-SVM and the substantially reduced processing time make it appropriate to be implemented and embedded into Autopsy modules, by predicting the level of fakeness calculated for each analyzed multimedia file.","output":"Exposing Manipulated Photos and Videos in Digital Forensics Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms of the increased vascular tone associated with vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease have not been clearly defined. The goal of the present study was to examine the role of vascular smooth muscle membrane Na+-K+-ATPase enzyme activity as well as nitric oxide synthase inhibition on the contractile responses induced by sickle erythrocyte constituents. 2 mm ring segments of rabbit carotid arterial ring preparations were placed in 20 ml organ baths containing physiological salt solution (PSS) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, at 37oC and pH 7.4 and isometric contractions recorded, under an initial load of 2g. Arterial rings were exposed to 50 l of each erythrocyte constituent at an adjusted haematocrit of 0.6. The magnitude of K+-induced relaxation of 10-7 M phenylephrine (PE)-precontracted rings exposed for 30 minutes to K+-free PSS (which inhibits Na+-K+ pump) was estimated in the absence (control) or presence of RBC constituents (ghosts, erythrocytes or haemoglobin solution) from Hb SS subjects. Secondly, the influence of 20-minute exposure of the rings to SS GHOSTS on acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation of 10-7 M PE phenylephrine-precontraction (in the absence or presence of L-NAME) was evaluated. Our results show that K+-induced relaxation was significantly and differentially attenuated by erythrocyte constituents (p<0.05) in the order: SS GHOST > SS HBS > SS RBC. NO synthase inhibition with L-NAME further potentiated the enhanced PE contractions induced by SS GHOSTS and caused a greater attenuation of Ach-induced relaxation (compared with SS GHOSTS alone). The results suggest that SS erythrocyte GHOSTS induce enhancement of vascular smooth muscle tone via impairment of vascular Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme activity as well as attenuate endothelium-dependent relaxation.

In addition, we evaluated the effect of ATA in vivo using a mouse model of infection. ATA did not protect mice against a lethal challenge with BTV or AHSV, most probably due to the in vivo effect of ATA on immune system regulation.

The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHODS: We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%.

The virus circulates as many different types (168), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. The influence of these features on transmission patterns of HRV in the community is understudied. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at nine out-patient facilities across a Health and Demographic Surveillance System between December 2015 and November 2016. HRV was diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR, and the VP4/VP2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the HRV types. Classification models and G-test statistic were used to investigate HRV type spatial distribution. Demographic characteristics and clinical features of ARI were also compared. Results: Of 5,744 NPS samples collected, HRV was detected in 1057 (18.4%), of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. HRV species A, B and C were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively. In total, 87 types were determined: 39, 10 and 38 occurred within species A, B and C, respectively. HRV types presented heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence. Spatially, identical types occurred over a wide distance at similar times, but there was statistically significant evidence for clustering of types between health facilities in close proximity or linked by major road networks. Conclusion: This study records a high prevalence of HRV in out-patient presentations exhibiting high type diversity. Patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. Temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. Spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.","output":"Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, 2015-2016, observed through outpatient surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Adequate immunity to COVID-19 apparently cannot be attained in Germany by voluntary vaccination alone, and therefore the introduction of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination is still under consideration. We present findings on the potential acceptance of such a requirement by the German population, and we report on the reasons given for accepting or rejecting it and how these reasons vary according to population subgroup. METHODS We used representative data from the Socio-Economic Panel for the period January to December 2021. We linked the respondents' answers concerning mandatory COVID-19 vaccination to information about their sociodemographic characteristics, state of health, political attitudes, and degree of confidence in the judicial and political systems. We analyzed these data using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical methods. RESULTS Just over half of the respondents (50.44% [49.08%; 51.79%]) favored mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. Among the supporters, the reason most frequently given (95%) was that, without such a requirement, not enough people would be vaccinated. Among the opponents of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination (49.56% [48.21%; 50.92%]), by far the most common reason given for opposing it was a desire to uphold individual freedom (91.36% [90.31%; 92.40%]). Persons supporting mandatory COVID-19 vaccination, on average, older than those who opposed it; they less commonly had an education beyond secondary school, were less healthy, tended to have no children, had centrist political views, and expressed more confidence in the political system. The largest difference between the two groups was that more than 90% of supporters of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination were themselves vaccinated, compared to only approximately 60% of opponents. CONCLUSION The lack of consensus on this issue among politicians and physicians in Germany is reflected in a similar lack of consensus in the German population as a whole. A discussion of the appropriate understanding of individual freedom would be the most promising way to widen the acceptance of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. A commonly expressed conception of freedom that permits the deliberate endangerment of other people's health seems morally questionable.","output":"Attitudes Toward Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination in Germany-a Representative Analysis of Data From the Socio-Economic Panel for the Year 2021."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its first detection in 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) has been the cause of millions of deaths worldwide.

A bioinformatic scan of the viral genome identified several hundreds of fragments potentially activating TLR7/8, suggesting that products of virus endosomal processing potently activate the IFN and inflammatory responses downstream of these receptors. In vivo, SAMPs induced MyD88-dependent lung inflammation characterized by accumulation of proinflammatory and cytotoxic mediators and immune cell infiltration, as well as splenic DC phenotypical maturation. These results identified TLR7/8 as a crucial cellular sensor of ssRNAs encoded by SARS-CoV-2 involved in host resistance and the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2Cassociated ssRNAs activate inflammation and immunity via TLR7/8"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Mental health is an important component of the protection strategy for healthcare workers (HCWs). However, it has not been well described in Vietnam during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to measure the psychological distress and health-related quality-of-life among frontline healthcare workers during the peak of the outbreak in Vietnam. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 173 health workers at two national tertiary hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam from March to April 2020. The psychological distress was measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale C 21 Items (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale C Revised (IES-R), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). EQ-5D-5L was used to determine the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes. RESULTS: Among 173 HCWs, the proportion of reported depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress was 20.2%, 33.5%, and 12.7%, respectively. The median EQ-5D-5L index score was 0.93 (IQR=0.85C0.94), and the anxiety/depression aspect had the highest reported problems. The most COVID-19-specific concerns among frontline HCWs were the reduction of income (59%) and the increase of living costs (54.3%). HCWs working in the COVID-19-designated hospital had a significantly higher rate of mental health problems and had a lower HRQoL outcome than those working in non-COVID-19-designated hospitals. Other factors associated with psychological distress and sleep problems include age, job title, income, chronic diseases status, and years of working in healthcare settings. HCWs who were 30 years old, had higher working years, had higher incomes, and had mental health and sleep problems were more likely to have lower HRQoL scores. CONCLUSION: We reported a moderate rate of psychological distress and lower HRQoL outcomes among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam. Various factors were found to be associated with mental health and HRQoL that might be useful for implementing appropriate interventions for HCWs in low-resource settings.","output":"Mental Health and Health-Related Quality-of-Life Outcomes Among Frontline Health Workers During the Peak of COVID-19 Outbreak in Vietnam: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesalazine is the most widely used aminosalicylate for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC).

It has rarely been mentioned in the literature as a cause of human disease. Various types of infections have been reported, primarily bloodstream infections. Whether Saccharomyces is a cause of true infection in other sites as compared to a culture contaminant is controversial, as it is considered a normal part of the gastrointestinal (GI), vaginal, and respiratory mucosal flora. The main risk factors for infection with Saccharomyces are immunodeficiency including chemotherapy, history of a central venous catheter, gastroenterological surgery, and use of antibiotics or probiotics. We present the case of an 80-year-old woman who, after five days of dexamethasone treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia, presented with worsening abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with perforated diverticulitis, complicated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia. We will discuss the management of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia and other infections to highlight the difficulty in management and high mortality risk associated with similar infections. Case Presentation An 80-year-old woman with no known medical history was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia and hypoxia, for which she required four liters of oxygen. She was initially treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, cefepime, and azithromycin. On the fifth day of hospitalization, she developed acute generalized abdominal pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis (figure 2) showed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid versus terminal ileum perforation, and two abscesses (measuring 5.5 cm and 8 cm in the largest diameters) in the pelvis. Surgical team recommended non-operative management. On days eight and ten of illness, blood cultures were obtained and grew Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Piperacillin-tazobactam was started for empiric GI coverage. Micafungin was started when yeast was identified in blood cultures and was subsequently switched to oral voriconazole once the yeast was identified as Saccharomyces. Blood cultures cleared four days after first positive. Due to persistently worsening leukocytosis, an exploratory laparotomy with sigmoidectomy and end colostomy was performed on day twelve of hospitalization. Intraoperative diagnosis of Hinchey stage IV diverticulitis (diverticulitis with generalized fecal peritonitis) was made. A drain was placed, and cultures from the abscess fluid grew Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to the Saccharomyces isolate, a Mucor species grew in the abscess culture after four days, and the patient was transitioned to liposomal amphotericin B. Two days after amphotericin was started, the patient developed acute encephalopathy to the point where she was non-responsive to pain, believed to be secondary to amphotericin B neurotoxicity. She required transfer to a surgical intensive care unit. Liposomal amphotericin B was changed to intravenous posaconazole. Within 48 hours of stopping amphotericin, the patient's mental status showed moderate improvement and she was disoriented but conversive. She then developed refractory hypoxia and progressive kidney dysfunction, and ultimately required intubation and continuous renal replacement therapy. Surgical team questioned posaconazole as a cause for her worsening renal function, and she was subsequently switched to intravenous Isavuconazole. The patient continued to decline, requiring vasopressor support. She developed refractory metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis, and hypoxia uncorrected with maximum ventilatory support. The patient's family requested to transition to comfort measures, and the patient expired on day 21 after initial COVID-19 admission. Discussion In one study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was considered one of the nosocomially acquired infections. It has been reported to cause an average of 1.7% of all fungal cases. Our patient developed Saccharomyces cerevisiae after evidence of diverticulitis complicated by bowel perforation in the setting of being treated with broad-spectr m antibiotics and while not being known to use probiotics. Various types of GI infections have been reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including esophagitis, peritonitis, liver abscess and a link to Crohn's disease, where antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae are a sensitive and specific test. A key element in the management of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the removal of the infected foreign bodies and the purification of the source. There are no guidelines for dealing with Saccharomyces cerevisiae infections, it is well known that it is susceptible to amphotericin B. Several different types of azole drugs have been investigated, resistance to itraconazole and fluconazole have been reported. Better susceptibility Results were observed with voriconazole and posaconazole. The mortality rate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia remains high and was reported in one study as 29.5%. Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia is a rare, lifethreatening disease with no clearly defined treatment guidelines. Further studies are needed to better understand the therapeutic antifungals options.

The full restoration of the electric infrastructure is not always simultaneously performed with the full restoration of electric production. Here, we describe the electric production curves for the islands of Saint-Martin, Saint-Barthelemy, and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, where two major hurricanes occurred in 2017. After the major hurricanes, the electric energy production was characterised by a slow recovery followed by a stable phase during several months, corresponding to approximately $75\\\\%$ of the initial electric production. A resilience time of several months (1 month $<t_s<$ 5 months) is necessary to attain the new electric energy production equilibrium $E_{is}$, which is lower than the initial electric energy production $E_i$. The reduction in electric energy consumption per capita is of $20-25\\\\%$. In Saint-Martin, during the post-hurricane stable phase, the electric production was only approximately $60\\\\%$ of the initial electric energy production instead of $75\\\\%$. The reduction of 15 percent in the electric production of Saint-Martin after Hurricane Irma could be attributed to the migration of approximately 8 000 inhabitants (approximately $23\\\\%$) outside the island.

Measles infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed children. A suboptimal seroprotection against measles has been shown in immunocompromised children. There is limited published literature on measles immunity in children with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome (DTNS). We compared the proportions of children with DTNS and healthy controls who were seroprotected against measles. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study. Measles-specific IgG antibodies of 108 children with DTNS (3 to 10 years of age) and an equal number of age-matched healthy controls were measured. All children had received two doses of measles-containing vaccine at 9-12 and 16-24 months of age under routine immunisation programme. Serum measles IgG antibody titres were measured by indirect ELISA. The assay results were interpreted as (1) > 11 NTU (NovaTec Units), positive/seroprotective titres; (2) 9-11, equivocal; and (3) < 9 NTU, negative. Inter- and intra-group comparisons were made to identify the disease characteristics related to seroprotection status. RESULTS The proportion of children with protective anti-measles antibodies (n = 70, 65%) was significantly lower in DTNS as compared to controls (n = 88, 81.48%) (p = 0.005). Their median [IQR] antibody titres were also significantly lower than those in controls (14.1 [14] NTU vs. 18.3 [15.2] NTU (p = 0.001). The age, gender, clinical subtype, duration of disease, and type of immunosuppressive therapy were not significantly different between seroprotected and non-seroprotected children with DTNS. CONCLUSION A significantly lower percentage of fully vaccinated children with DTNS were seroprotected against measles compared to healthy controls.","output":"Seroprotection against measles in previously vaccinated children with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resolving conformational heterogeneity of multiple protein states that coexist in solution remains one of the main obstacles in the characterization of protein therapeutics and the determination of the conformational transition pathways critical for biological functions, ranging from molecular recognition to enzymatic catalysis. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) reaction coupled with top-down mass spectrometric (MS) analysis provides a means to characterize protein higher-order structures and dynamics in a conformer-specific manner. The conformational resolving power of this technique is highly dependent on the efficiencies of separating protein states at the intact protein level and minimizing the residual non-deuterated protic content during the HDX reactions. Here we describe a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based variant of the HDX MS approach that aims to improve the conformational resolution. In this approach, proteins undergo HDX reactions while migrating through a deuterated background electrolyte solution (BGE) during the capillary electrophoretic separation. Different protein states or proteoforms that coexist in solution can be efficiently separated based on their differing charge-to-size ratios. The difference in electrophoretic mobility between proteins and protic solvent molecules minimizes the residual non-deuterated solvent, resulting in a nearly complete deuterating environment during the HDX process. The flow-through microvial CE-MS interface allows efficient electrospray ionization of the eluted protein species following a rapid mixing with the quenching and denaturing modifier solution at the outlet of the sprayer. The online top-down MS analysis measures the global deuteration level of the eluted intact protein species, and subsequently, the deuteration of their gas-phase fragments. This paper demonstrates this approach in differential HDX for systems, including the natural protein variants coexisting in milk.","output":"Capillary Electrophoresis-based Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange for Conformational Characterization of Proteins with Top-down Mass Spectrometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused by infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has led to more than 600,000 deaths worldwide.

The mutation R518W or R518Q on the NPC1 is one of type of disease-related mutation that causes cholesterol transports to be cut in half, which results in the accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of the cell. Even though there has been significant progress with understanding the cholesterol transport by NPC1 in combination with NPC2, especially after the structural determination of the full length NPC1 in 2016, many details such as the interaction of the full length NPC1 with the NPC2, the molecular motions responsible for the cholesterol transport during and after this interaction, and the structure and the function relations of many mutations are still not well understood. In this paper, we report the extensive molecular dynamics simulations in order to gain insight into the structure and the dynamics of NPC1 lumenal domain for the cholesterol transport and the disease behind the mutation (R518W). It was found that the mutation induces a structural shift of the NTD (N-terminal domain), toward the loop region in the MLD (middle lumenal domain), which is believed to play a central role in the interaction with NPC2 protein, so the interaction with the NPC2 protein might be less favorable compared to the wild NPC1. Also, the simulation indicates the possible re-orientation of the NTD with both the wild and the R518W mutated NPC1 after receiving the cholesterol from the NPC2, that align to form an internal tunnel, which is a possible pose for further action in cholesterol trafficking. We believe the current study can provide a better understanding of the cholesterol transport by NPC1 especially the role of NTD of NPC1 in combination with NPC2 interactions.","output":"Molecular dynamics study with mutation shows that N-terminal domain (NTD) structural re-orientation in NPC1 is required for proper alignment of cholesterol transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in China, the parents of hospitalized neonatal patients commonly endure more psychological stress compared to the general population, which probably originated from not staying with their children, inconvenience of daily life, and financial crisis.

Epitope mapping using a panel of 10 amino acid overlapped 15-mer peptides covering region 401-515 from RBD did not identify linear epitopes when tested with sera from infected individuals or from RBD-immunized mice. However, immunization of mice with these 15-mer peptides identified four peptides located at region 446-480 that induced antibodies recognizing the peptides and RBD/S1 proteins.

Patients admitted and requiring oxygen supplementation were treated with no steroids, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. SETTING This study takes place in the ICU's at a large, tertiary, public teaching hospital serving a primarily low-income community in urban Los Angeles. PATIENTS All eligible patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 respiratory failure from March 1 to July 31, 2020 were included in this study. INTERVENTIONS A total of 262 patients were grouped as receiving usual care (n = 75), methylprednisolone dosed at least at 1mg/kg/day for  3 days (n = 104), or dexamethasone dosed at least at 6 mg for 7 days (n = 83). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All-cause mortality within 50 days of initial corticosteroid treatment as compared to usual care was calculated. The mortality effect was then stratified based on levels of respiratory support received by the patient.

These experiences increase the risk for future violence and other health problems associated with the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents and adults. METHODS: Data from the 2019 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey were used to determine the prevalence of high school students self-reported experiences with physical fighting, being threatened with a weapon, physical dating violence, sexual violence, and bullying. Logistic regression models adjusting for sex, grade, and race/ethnicity were used to test the strength of associations between experiencing multiple forms of violence and 16 self-reported health risk behaviors and conditions. RESULTS: Approximately one half of students (44.3%) experienced at least one type of violence; more than one in seven (15.6%) experienced two or more types during the preceding 12 months. Experiencing multiple types of violence was significantly more prevalent among females than among males and among students identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual or not sure of their sexual identity than among heterosexual students. Experiencing violence was significantly associated with higher prevalence of all examined health risks and conditions. Relative to youths with no violence experiences, adjusted health risk and condition prevalence estimates were up to seven times higher among those experiencing two types of violence and up to 21 times higher among those experiencing three or more types of violence. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Many youths experience multiple types of violence, with potentially lifelong health impacts.

Here, we assess levels of anti-N binding antibodies and anti-S neutralizing antibodies in unvaccinated children compared with unvaccinated older adults following infection. Specifically, we examine neutralization and anti-N binding by sera collected up to 52 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and compare these to a cohort of adults, including older adults, most of whom had mild infections that did not require hospitalization. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in children than adults early after infection, but by 6 months titers were similar between age groups. The neutralizing activity of the childrens sera decreased modestly from one to six months; a pattern that was not significantly different from that observed in adults. However, infection of children induced much lower levels of anti-N antibodies than in adults, and levels of these anti-N antibodies decreased more rapidly in children than in adults, including older adults. These results highlight age-related differences in the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, as vaccines for children are introduced, may provide comparator data for the longevity of infection-elicited and vaccination-induced neutralizing antibody responses.","output":"Dynamics of infection-elicited SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children over time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 and several types of cancer, suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treat Covid-19. CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for cancer treatment. A recent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 found a significant CK2 kinase activity, and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses. CIGB-300, originally designed as an anticancer peptide, is an antagonist of CK2 kinase activity that binds to the CK2 phospho-acceptor sites. Recent preliminary results show the antiviral activity of CIGB-300 using a surrogate model of coronavirus. Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidence, at the molecular level, of how CIGB-300 may interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle within infected human cells. METHODS: Sequence analyses and data from phosphorylation studies were combined to predict infection-induced molecular mechanisms that can be interfered by CIGB-300. Next, we integrated data from multi-omics studies and data focusing on the antagonistic effect on the CK2 kinase activity of CIGB-300. A combination of network and functional enrichment analyses was used. RESULTS: Firstly, from the SARS-CoV studies, we inferred the potential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on the immune response. Afterwards, from the analysis of multiple omics data, we proposed the action of CIGB-300 from the early stages of viral infections perturbing the virus hijacking of RNA splicing machinery. We also predicted the interference of CIGB-300 in virus-host interactions that are responsible for the high infectivity and the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we provided evidence of how CIGB-300 may participate in the attenuation of phenotypes related to muscle, bleeding, coagulation and respiratory disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our computational analysis proposes putative molecular mechanisms that support the antiviral activity of CIGB-300.

Advances in electronic health record systems and Natural Language Processing (NLP) create a unique opportunity to systematically document patient SDoH from digitized free-text provider notes. METHODS Patient SDoH status [recorded by Your Current Life Situation (YCLS) Survey] and associated provider notes recorded between March 2017 and June 2020 were extracted (32,261 beneficiaries; 50,722 YCLS surveys; 485,425 provider notes).NLP patterns were generated using a machine learning test statistic (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). Patterns were developed and assessed in a training, training validation, and final validation dataset (64%, 16%, and 20% of total data, respectively).NLP models analyzed SDoH-specific categories (housing, medical care, and transportation needs) and a combined SDoH metric. Model performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen  statistic, assuming the YCLS Survey to be the gold standard. RESULTS Within the training validation dataset, NLP models showed strong sensitivity and specificity, with moderate agreement with the YCLS Survey (Housing: sensitivity=0.67, specificity=0.89, =0.51; Medical care: sensitivity=0.55, specificity=0.73, =0.20; Transportation: sensitivity=0.79, specificity=0.87, =0.58).

Despite increasing fraudulent activity involving cryptocurrencies, research on the potential of cryptocurrencies for fraud has not been examined in a systematic study. This review examines the current state of knowledge about what kinds of cryptocurrency fraud currently exist, or are expected to exist in the future, and provides comprehensive definitions of the frauds identified. METHODS: The study involved a scoping review of academic research and grey literature on cryptocurrency fraud and a 1.5-day expert consensus exercise. The review followed the PRISMA-ScR protocol, with eligibility criteria based on language, publication type, relevance to cryptocurrency fraud, and evidence provided. Researchers screened 391 academic records, 106 of which went on to the eligibility phase, and 63 of which were ultimately analysed. We screened 394 grey literature sources, 128 of which passed on to the eligibility phase, and 53 of which were included in our review. The expert consensus exercise was attended by high-profile participants from the private sector, government, and academia. It involved problem planning and analysis activities and discussion about the future of cryptocurrency crime. RESULTS: The academic literature identified 29 different types of cryptocurrency fraud; the grey literature discussed 32 types, 14 of which were not identified in the academic literature (i.e., 47 unique types in total). Ponzi schemes and (synonymous) high yield investment programmes were most discussed across all literature. Participants in the expert consensus exercise ranked pump-and-dump schemes and ransomware as the most profitable and feasible threats, though pump-and-dumps were, notably, perceived as the least harmful type of fraud. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this scoping review suggest cryptocurrency fraud research is rapidly developing in volume and breadth, though we remain at an early stage of thinking about future problems and scenarios involving cryptocurrencies. The findings of this work emphasise the need for better collaboration across sectors and consensus on definitions surrounding cryptocurrency fraud to address the problems identified.","output":"Cryptocurrencies and future financial crime"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered university lockdowns, forcing physiology educators to rapidly pivot laboratories into a remote delivery format. This study documents the experiences of an international group of 10 physiology educators surrounding this transition. They wrote reflective narratives, framed by guiding questions, to answer the research question: \\"What were the changes to physiology laboratories in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?\\" These narratives probed educators' attitudes toward virtual laboratories before, during, and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure. Most of the respondents reported planning on retaining some aspects of the remote laboratories postpandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and on-campus laboratories.

The present study aimed to investigate how financial difficulties during the pandemic correlate with mental health among residents of Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 4,020 residents from different parts of Bangladesh between July and September 2020, during a period of elevated risk of COVID-19 infection. A self-reported online questionnaire comprising socio-demographic, financial difficulties and psychometric measures (to assess depression, anxiety and stress) was used to gather information from participants. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with mental health consequences. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in the sample were 71.1%, 62.3%, and 56.7%, respectively. Levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly higher among participants who reported female sex, being unmarried, smaller families, higher monthly family income, poor self-perceived health status, living near people who had been infected by COVID-19, probability of decreased income, food scarcity (both during the pandemic and in the future) and the possibility of unemployment. However, due to the nature of the cross-sectional study performed with a convenience sampling method, the causal relationship between variables cannot be justified. Conclusions: After several months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh, more than half of the respondents rated their mental health concerns as moderate to severe.

METHODS: From February to March 2021, a mail survey was distributed to 1,400 older adults aged 70C89 years old. Responded participants were 1,003 (71.6% response rate). Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was the independent variable. ICT use was assessed based on ICT use history and current ICT use activities. Loneliness was based on the Japanese version of the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Social isolation was a total score of six items. Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were performed and stratified by age groups (70C79 and  80 years). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the proportion of people aged  80 years who reported cognitive decline was twice that of 70s. Non-ICT use was independently associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline in participants aged  80 years. Furthermore, the significant associations between cognitive decline and interaction items (non-ICT use by loneliness or social isolation) were observed in the  80 age group. No association was found in the 70C79 age group. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ICT users with high loneliness or social isolation scores were more likely to experience cognitive decline for adults age  80 years.

Changes in frequency and forms of social contact have reduced the spread of the COVID-19 virus and thus saved lives, yet there is increasing evidence for negative side effects such as mental health issues. In the present study, we investigate the development of loneliness and its predictors to examine the role of changes in social networks due to social distancing and other COVID-19-related life changes. A total of 737 participants (age range = 18C81 years) completed an online survey in three waves during the last quarter of 2020 at one-month intervals. Latent growth and multilevel modeling revealed that emotional loneliness increased over time, while social loneliness remained stable. Moreover, socially lonely individuals were likely to also develop emotional loneliness over time. Increased social distancing and sanitary measures were accompanied by decreased social interactions and loss of individuals considered SOS contacts and confidants. Changes in specific social network indicators were differentially associated with changes in emotional vs social loneliness: Loss of friends considered confidants was associated with increasing emotional loneliness, whereas loss of friends considered SOS contacts and reduced overall social interactions were related to increasing social loneliness. Lastly, individuals with more family-and-friend SOS contacts, more friends as confidants and an overall higher number of social interactions were more protected from feeling socially or emotionally lonely. Study findings enhance the understanding of underlying mechanisms differentially contributing to social and emotional loneliness and offer practical suggestions to reduce mental-health side effects of social distancing.","output":"Loneliness during COVID-19: Development and influencing factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation Integrating multimodal data represents an effective approach to predicting biomedical characteristics, such as protein functions and disease outcomes. However, existing data integration approaches do not sufficiently address the heterogeneous semantics of multimodal data. In particular, early and intermediate approaches that rely on a uniform integrated representation reinforce the consensus among the modalities, but may lose exclusive local information. The alternative late integration approach that can address this challenge has not been systematically studied for biomedical problems. Results We propose Ensemble Integration (EI) as a novel systematic realization of the late integration approach. EI infers local predictive models from the individual modalities using appropriate algorithms, and uses effective heterogeneous ensemble algorithms to integrate these local models into a global predictive model. We also propose a novel interpretation method for EI models. We tested EI on the problems of predicting protein function from multimodal STRING data, and mortality due to COVID-19 from multimodal data in electronic health records. We found that EI accomplished its goal of producing significantly more accurate predictions than each individual modality. It also performed better than several established early integration methods for each of these problems. The interpretation of representative EI predictive models for COVID-19 mortality identified several disease-relevant features, such as laboratory test (BUN and calcium) and vital sign (minimum oxygen saturation) measurements and demographics (age). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the EI framework for biomedical data integration and predictive modeling.

This study reports the process of establishing a smartphone palpitation and pre-syncope ambulatory care Clinic (SPACC) service. Materials and Methods: A clinical standard operating procedure (SOP) was devised, and funding was secured through a business case for the purchase of 40 AliveCor devices in the first instance. The clinic was launched on 22 July 2019. Results: Between 22 July 2019 and 31 October 2019, 68 patients seen in the emergency departments (EDs) with palpitations or pre-syncope were referred to SPACC. Of those, 30 were male and 38 were female, and the mean age was 45.8 years old (SD 15.1) with a range from 18 years old to 80 years old. A total of 50 (74%) patients underwent full investigation. On the first assessment, seven (10%) patients were deemed to have non-cardiac palpitations and were not fitted with the device. All patients who underwent full investigation achieved symptomatic rhythm correlation most with sinus rhythm, ventricular ectopics, or bigeminy. A symptomatic cardiac dysrhythmia was detected in six (8.8%) patients. Three patients had supraventricular tachycardia (4%), two had atrial fibrillation (3%), and one had atrial flutter (2%). Qualitative feedback from the SPACC team suggested several areas where improvement to the clinic could be made.

The lack of proper UAV detection studies employing thermal infrared cameras is also an issue, despite its success with other targets. Besides, we have not found any previous study that addresses the detection task as a function of distance to the target.

To allow studies as a function of the sensor-to-target distance, the dataset is divided into three categories (Close, Medium, Distant) according to the industry-standard Detect, Recognize and Identify (DRI) requirements, built on the Johnson criteria. Given that the drones must be flown within visual range due to regulations, the largest sensor-to-target distance for a drone is 200 m, and acquisitions are made in daylight.

This greatly facilitates the ready detection of signaling changes of cellCcell communication in response to any biological perturbations. We then investigated how intercellular communications affect intracellular signaling response by inferring a multiscale signaling network which bridges the intercellular communications at the population level and the cell stateCspecific intracellular signaling network at the molecular level. The latter is constructed by integrating receptor-TF interactions collected from public databases and TF-target gene regulations inferred from a network-regularized regression model. By applying our approaches to three scRNA-seq datasets from skin development, spinal cord injury, and COVID-19, we demonstrated the capability of our approaches in identifying the predominant signaling changes across conditions and the critical signaling mechanisms regulating target gene expression.

Differences in apoptosis efficiency displayed by reovirus strains are linked to the viral mu1-encoding M2 gene segment. Studies using pharmacologic inhibitors of reovirus replication demonstrate that apoptosis induction by reovirus requires viral disassembly in cellular endosomes but not RNA synthesis. Since the mu1 protein functions to pierce endosomal membranes during this temporal window, these findings point to an important role for mu1 in activating signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis. To understand mechanisms used by mu1 to induce apoptosis, a panel of mu1 mutant viruses generated by reverse genetics was analyzed for the capacities to penetrate host cell membranes, activate proapoptotic signaling pathways, evoke cell death, and produce encephalitis in newborn mice. We found that single amino acid changes within the delta region of mu1 reduce the efficiency of membrane penetration. These mutations also diminish the capacities of reovirus to activate proapoptotic transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3 and elicit apoptosis. Additionally, we observed that following intracranial inoculation, an apoptosis-deficient mu1 mutant is less virulent in newborn mice in comparison to the wild-type virus. These results indicate a critical function for the membrane penetration activity of mu1 in evoking prodeath signaling pathways that regulate reovirus pathogenesis.","output":"Reovirus apoptosis and virulence are regulated by host cell membrane penetration efficiency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Plain chest radiograph (CXR), although less sensitive than chest CT, is usually the first-line imaging modality used for patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relation between radiological changes in CXR and clinical severity of the disease in symptomatic patients with COVID 19 has not been fully studied and there is no scoring system for the severity of the lung involvement, using the plain CXR. AIM OF THE STUDY: Current COVID-19 radiological literature is dominated by CT and a detailed description CXR appearances in relation to the disease time course is lacking. We propose an easy scoring system (CO X-RADS) to describe the severity of chest involvement in symptomatic COVID 19 patients using CXR and to correlate the radiological changes with the clinical severity of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical manifestations and CXR findings were recorded in 500 symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) COVID-19 designated facility Center from January to June 2020. The severity and outcome of the disease included: intensive care unit admission, need for oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation. and mortality rate. RESULTS: Most of our symptomatic patients (86.8%) had mild and moderate clinical manifestations. The remaining 13.2% had severe manifestations, including: fever, persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, abdominal and generalized body pains. Based on our radiological scoring system (0 to 10) patients were distributed according to their CXR findings into different categories and according to our suggested (CO X-RADS) severity system into five categories (0 to IV). Patients with mild clinical manifestations showed low scoring in CXR (score 0 up to 4) and they represented 72% of our patients. Patients with moderately severe clinical manifestations showed mainly GGO (scoring 5 and 6) and represented about 14.8% of patients. Patients presented with severe clinical manifestations had obvious lung consolidations at the time of presentation with CXR scoring system &#8805; 7 and represented about 13.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: We proposed a simple CXR reporting scoring system (CO X-RADS) to categorize COVID-19 patients according to their radiological severity. This radiological score was correlated well with the clinical severity score of patients. We encourage other centers to test this scoring system in correlation with the clinical status of patients.","output":"Proposed Scoring System for Evaluating Clinico-radiological Severity of COVID- 19 using Plain Chest X- ray (CXR) changes (CO X-RADS): Preliminary results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most tobacco-focused clinical trials are based on locally conducted studies that face significant challenges to implementation and successful execution. These challenges include the need for large, diverse, yet still representative study samples. This often means a protracted, costly, and inefficient recruitment process. Multisite clinical trials can overcome some of these hurdles but incur their own unique challenges. With recent advances in mobile health and digital technologies, there is now a promising alternative: Remote Trials. These trials are led and coordinated by a local investigative team, but are based remotely, within a given community, state, or even nation. The remote approach affords many of the benefits of multisite trials (more efficient recruitment of larger study samples) without the same barriers (cost, multisite management, and regulatory hurdles). The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health pandemic has resulted in rapid requirements to shift ongoing clinical trials to remote delivery and assessment platforms, making methods for the conduct of remote trials even more timely. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of available methods for the conduct of remote tobacco-focused clinical trials as well as illustrative examples of how these methods have been implemented across recently completed and ongoing tobacco studies. We focus on key aspects of the clinical trial pipeline including remote: (1) study recruitment and screening, (2) informed consent, (3) assessment, (4) biomarker collection, and (5) medication adherence monitoring. Implications With recent advances in mobile health and digital technologies, remote trials now offer a promising alternative to traditional in-person clinical trials. Remote trials afford expedient recruitment of large, demographically representative study samples, without undo burden to a research team.

METHODS This was an analysis of nasal swab specimens obtained from 590 outpatients suffering from acute respiratory tract disease between September 2009 and February 2010. RESULTS The RVP Fast assay performed well in less than 4 h for detecting type A influenza H1 viruses, particularly (H1N1)pdm09, and human entero/rhinoviruses, with 95.2% and 90.05% agreement, respectively, when compared to monoplex real-time PCR assays. This multiplex assay also detected at least 1 virus in 69.3% of the specimens and detected multiple infections in 40 samples.

Fluvoxamine may prevent clinical deterioration by stimulating the -1 receptor, which regulates cytokine production. Objective To determine whether fluvoxamine, given during mild COVID-19 illness, prevents clinical deterioration and decreases the severity of disease. Design, Setting, and Participants Double-blind, randomized, fully remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine vs placebo. Participants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. One hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n = 80) or placebo (n = 72) 3 times daily for 15 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. Results Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72%] women), 115 (76%) completed the trial. Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 1.8%-16.4%] from survival analysis; log-rank P = .009). The fluvoxamine group had 1 serious adverse event and 11 other adverse events, whereas the placebo group had 6 serious adverse events and 12 other adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance In this preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, patients treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days.

Nine months later more than 1.4 million people have died from COVID 19. In this work, the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on five nursing homes in Austria, which cared for 889 residents in the first half of 2020, were examined. The research question was whether the measures taken were appropriate to prevent an outbreak within the individual facilities. To detect previously unrecognized infections, the present study evaluated the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in residents and employees of the nursing homes. Following the analysis of blood samples, the prospectively collected data was connected to data from screening examinations and data from contact tracing. The present study demonstrated an overall prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nursing homes of 3.7%. Whereas the prevalence in those facilities that have never been hit by an outbreak is 0%, the prevalence in those facilities with an outbreak is up to 4.9%. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 35 persons. A retrospective analysis of all 5 included nursing homes demonstrated that upon regular clinical screening in combination with PCRs an infection with SARS-COV-2 was detected in 66 residents and 24 employees from different professional groups. In only 25 of the 35 persons with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 an infection was proven in advance. This study suggests that specific measures can prevent transmission within a health care facility. Nevertheless, the results also show that a risk reduction to 0% cannot be achieved. In preparation for further pandemic waves there is still the need to reduce the probability of a transmission in nursing homes with specific test strategies.

Areas of novelty, in terms of new regimens, new types of cancer suitable for Metronomic chemotherapy (mCHT) and the overview of current ongoing trials, along with a critical review of them, are also provided. ABSTRACT: Metronomic chemotherapy treatment (mCHT) refers to the chronic administration of low doses chemotherapy that can sustain prolonged, and active plasma levels of drugs, producing favorable tolerability and it is a new promising therapeutic approach in solid and in hematologic tumors. mCHT has not only a direct effect on tumor cells, but also an action on cell microenvironment, by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, or promoting immune response and for these reasons can be considered a multi-target therapy itself. Here we review the state of the art of mCHT use in some classical tumour types, such as breast and no small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), see what is new regarding most recent data in different cancer types, such as glioblastoma (GBL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and new drugs with potential metronomic administration. Finally, a look at the strategic use of mCHT in the context of health emergencies, or in low Cand middle-income countries (LMICs), where access to adequate healthcare is often not easy, is mandatory, as we always need to bear in in mind that equity in care must be a compulsory part of our medical work and research.","output":"Metronomic Chemotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children have a low rate of COVID-19 and secondary severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) but present a high prevalence of symptomatic seasonal coronavirus infections. AIM: We tested if prior infections by seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, HKU1, 229E or OC43 as assessed by serology, provide cross-protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We set a cross-sectional observational multicentric study in pauci- or asymptomatic children hospitalised in Paris during the first wave for reasons other than COVID (hospitalised children (HOS), n = 739) plus children presenting with MIS (n = 36). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein (N) and S1 and S2 domains of the spike (S) proteins were monitored by an in-house luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay. We randomly selected 69 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients (including 15 with MIS) and 115 matched SARS-CoV-2-seronegative patients (controls (CTL)). We measured antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV as evidence for prior corresponding infections and assessed if SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of infection and levels of antibody responses were shaped by prior seasonal coronavirus infections. RESULTS: Prevalence of HCoV infections were similar in HOS, MIS and CTL groups. Antibody levels against HCoV were not significantly different in the three groups and were not related to the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the HOS and MIS groups.

The home, work, and school environments have collided and merged to form a new normal for many families. This merging extends into the family food environment, and little is known about how families are currently navigating this landscape. The objective of the present study was to describe families' adaptations in the family food environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Parents participated in one of 14 virtual focus groups (conducted in English and Spanish between December 2020 and February 2021). Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: Forty-eight parents (81% Hispanic and SES diverse) participated. Five themes and one subtheme were identified around changes in eating habits and mealtime frequency, increases in snacking, family connectedness at mealtimes, and use of screens at meals. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the family food environment. Families shared how their eating habits have changed and that device usage increased at mealtimes. Some changes (e.g., weight gain) may have lasting health implications for both children and parents. Public health officials, pediatricians, and schools should work with families to resume healthy habits post pandemic.","output":"Family Food Environment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious agents have been postulated as causes of multiple sclerosis for over a century. The possible role of a virus or viruses is supported by data that (1) a childhood exposure is involved and viral infections may precipitate exacerbations of disease, (2) experimental infections in animals and natural infections in humans can cause diseases with long incubation periods, remitting and relapsing courses, and demyelination, and (3) patients with multiple sclerosis have abnormal immune responses to viruses. The pathogenesis of three human demyelinating diseases of known viral etiology is discussed. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a papovavirus selectively infects oligodendrocytes and causes focal areas of demyelination. In postmeasles encephalomyelitis, the virus is lymphotrophic and disrupts immune regulation that can result in an autoimmune perivenular demyelinating illness without evidence of infection of the central nervous system. In human immunodeficiency virus\\\\encephalopathy and myelopathy virus is present in macrophages and microglia and the myelin abnormalities apparently are caused by soluble factors such as viral proteins, cytokines, or neurotoxins.

Oral examination showed widespread whitish reticular and papular lesions on the lips, the dorsum of the tongue, and bilateral buccal mucosa, with diffuse erosions covered with pseudomembrane on the buccal mucosa. The boy's parents were examined to exhibit white reticular and plaque-like lesions on their oral mucosa. The three patients were clinically diagnosed as affected by OLP and histopathologically confirmed. The boy underwent topical treatment with recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (rb-bFGF) gel, and oral lesions gradually resolved and healed. Neither of his parents received treatment. During the subsequent follow-ups, none of three patients underwent any medical treatment. Fortunately, their lesions had almost faded over 8 years. CONCLUSIONS Our case emphasizes that pediatric OLP should be recorded with family history. Besides, long-term periodic follow-up is recommended in pediatric patients with OLP for monitoring any changes in lesions.","output":"Familial oral lichen planus in a 3-year-old boy: a case report with eight years of follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the world.

Despite in vitro antiviral activity, clinical trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were disappointing, and they may even impair outcomes. Chloroquine causes zebroid deposits reminiscent of Fabry disease (&#945;-galactosidase A deficiency) and endothelial cells are key targets of COVID-19. We have explored the effect of chloroquine on cultured endothelial cells and its modulation by recombinant &#945;-galactosidase A (agalsidase). Following dose-response studies, 0.5 g/mL chloroquine was added to cultured human endothelial cells. Neutral red and Lysotracker were used to assess lysosomes. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) - MTT assay and cell stress by assessing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). In endothelial cells, chloroquine induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity at in vitro test concentrations for COVID-19 therapy. At a sublethal concentration, chloroquine significantly induced the accumulation of acid organelles (P < 0.05), increased ROS levels, and decreased NO production (P < 0.05). These adverse effects of chloroquine on endothelial cell biology were decreased by agalsidase-? (P < 0.05). Chloroquine-induced endothelial cell cytotoxicity and stress is attenuated by agalsidase-? treatment. This suggests that endothelial cell injury may contribute to the failure of chloroquine as therapy for COVID-19 and may be at least in part related to causing dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme &#945;-galactosidase A.","output":"Chloroquine may induce endothelial injury through lysosomal dysfunction and oxidative stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the identification of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the death toll from the direct infection by COVID-19 has exceeded 775,000, and more than 21 million cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) around the world. It is strongly believed that its impact might be worsened by poor outdoor and indoor air qualities, particularly on older adults. The nationwide lockdown measures were imposed between March 23 and June 20, 2020, to stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In this work, the possible effects of the lockdown on the air quality were investigated using meteorological and air quality datasets obtained from eight monitoring stations covering the Eastern Province of the KSA. The studied air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), and inhalable particulate matter (PM(10)). The NO(2) was found to be the marker pollutant responding best to the lockdown measures since its concentrations decreased at all sites during- and post-lockdown periods and ranged between 12C86% and 14C81%, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown period, the Eastern Province also experienced significant concentration reductions at varying rates for PM(10) (21C70%), CO (5.8C55%), and SO(2) (8.7C30%), while O(3) concentrations showed increasing rates ranging between 6.3 and 45%.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, known for its immunomodulatory properties. It has shown antiviral effect specifically against Sars-CoV-2 in vitro, and acts on cytokine signaling pathways that have been implicated in COVID-19. Methods: DAWn-Azithro is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 proof-of-concept, multicenter clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of azithromycin for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is part of a series of trials testing promising interventions for COVID-19, running in parallel and grouped under the name DAWn-studies. Patients hospitalized on dedicated COVID-wards are eligible for study-inclusion when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 72 hours through PCR (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage), or chest CT scan showing typical features of COVID-19 and without alternate diagnosis. Patients are block-randomized (9 patients) with a 2:1 allocation to receive azithromycin plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Standard of care is mostly supportive, but may comprise hydroxychloroquine, up to the treating physicians discretion and depending on local policy and national health regulations. The treatment group receives azithromycin qd 500 mg during the first 5 consecutive days after inclusion. The trial will include 284 patients and recruits from 15 centers across Belgium. Primary outcome is time from admission (day 0) to life discharge or to sustained clinical improvement, defined as an improvement of two points on the WHO 7-category ordinal scale sustained for at least 3 days. Discussion: The trial investigates the urgent and still unmet global need for drugs that may impact on the disease course of COVID-19. It will either provide support or else justify the discouragement of the current widespread, uncontrolled use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. The analogous design of other parallel trials of the DAWN-consortium, will amplify the chance of identifying successful treatment strategies and allow comparison of treatment effects within an identical clinical context.

Remarkably, GG reduced the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Plasminogen activator inhibito-1 (PAI-1). In-vitro, GG acted as potent immunomodulator by reducing Th2 and Th17 differentiation and IL-4 and IL-17A cytokine production. In addition, GG also showed robust potential to suppress ROS, mtROS and NETs generation in a concentration dependent manner in both human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and murine bone marrow derived neutrophils (BMDNs).

Frequent drug use during this time may interfere with neurophysiological and neuropsychological development pathways, potentially leading to ongoing unfavorable neuroadaptations. The dose-response relationship between illicit drug use, exposure, and individual neurodevelopmental variation is unknown but salient with global shifts in the legal landscape and increasingly liberal attitudes and perceptions of the harm caused by cannabis and illicit drugs. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to synthesize longitudinal studies that investigate the effects of illicit drug use on structural, functional, and cognitive brain domains in individuals under the neural age of adulthood (25 years). This protocol outlines prospective methods that will facilitate an exhaustive review of the literature exploring pre- and post-drug use brain abnormalities arising during neurodevelopment. METHODS Five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central, and Web of Science) will be systematically searched between 1990 and 2019. The search terms will be a combination of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), with keywords adapted to each database. Study reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and if relevant, study quality will be assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eligible studies are those that sampled youth exposed to cannabis or illicit drugs and employed neurophysiological or neuropsychological assessment techniques. Studies will be excluded if participants had been clinically diagnosed with any psychiatric, neurological, or pharmacological condition. RESULTS This is an ongoing review. As of February 2020, papers are in full-text screening, with results predicted to be complete by July 2020.

However, following COVID-19, some conditions may develop which may favor thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Such a condition is Kawasaki-like disease (K-lD). K-lD appears in children as a subgroup of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). In some cases, K-lD patients may develop giant coronary aneurysms. The evolution and characteristics of coronary aneurysms from K-lD appear to be different from classical Kawasaki disease (KD) aneurysms. Differences include a lower percentage of aneurysm formation than in non-COVID-19 KD, a smaller number of giant forms, a tendency towards aneurysm regression, and fewer thrombotic events associated with AMI. We present here a review of the literature on the thrombotic risks of post-COVID-19 coronary aneurysms, starting from a unique clinical case of a 2-year-old boy who developed multiple coronary aneurysms, followed by AMI. In dehydration conditions, 6 months after COVID-19, the boy developed anterior descending artery occlusion and a slow favorable outcome of the AMI after thrombolysis. This review establishes severity criteria and risk factors that predispose to thrombosis and AMI in post-COVID-19 patients. These may include dehydration, thrombophilia, congenital malformations, chronic inflammatory conditions, chronic kidney impairment, acute cardiac failure, and others. All these possible complications should be monitored during acute illness.

As an employee awareness measure to reduce the misinformation and panic, we developed a serious game to train various do's and don'ts of the pandemic. We chose an enterprise awareness game Phishy, having a 'survival' theme, and suitably repurposed it to create COVID-19 awareness game Govid. Appropriate modifications were made to the original game so that there is synergy between the new game story and the learning content. Repurposing greatly reduced the development time, which helped us to develop and deploy the game within just seven days. Govid was played by 2,372 employees of our organization. Using a pre-test and post-test method, we observed that Govid participants had a correctness percentage of 95.6% in answering COVID-19-related questions after playing the game. Our results show that a repurposed game with an engaging gameplay coupled with appropriate learning content shows positive results in the learning outcome.

This results from integrating the patient-centred focus of PC with the traditional tumour-directed focus in oncology. This integration represents a complex intervention affecting how people work. We have investigated clinicians adherence to requested documentation of four important patient-centred study indicators (EGOC; symptom assessment, weight and GP report) in our ongoing RCT on PC integration. Results from 435 consultations; first oncological (start last chemotherapy-line), palliative and oncological consultations during chemotherapy showed that registration percentage differed across consultations; 94.8% in the palliative (83.3C100%), 65.8% (62.5C75.0%) and 69.2% (57.0C84.3%) in the oncological consultations. Results were not satisfactory and call for strict pre-study optimization strategies to promote integration and handle organizational, professional and individual barriers towards a more patient-centred focus. ABSTRACT: Background. Despite robust evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating clinical and patient-reported benefits of integrated oncology and palliative care, the tumour-centred focus is predominant. This singleCcentre process evaluation monitors documentation of required patient-centred variables during an RCT. Methods. Performance status, patient self-reported symptoms, weight and summaries to general practitioners were assessed from June 2017 to July 2020 in three consultation types: first oncological after study inclusion and palliative and oncological consultations during chemotherapy. Descriptive statistics were used to monitor if the pre-defined program fulfilment of 85% documentation was reached. Results. 435 consultations were monitored in 76 patients; 60.5% males, 86.8% with GI cancers; 76 (17.5%) were from the first oncological consultations, 87 (20.0%) and 272 (62.5%) from palliative or subsequent oncological consultations. Program fulfilment differed across consultation types with 94.8% in the palliative consultations (83.3C100%), relative to 65.8% (62.5C75.0%) and 69.2% (57.0C84.3%) for first and subsequent oncological consultations over time, respectively. Use of self-reported symptoms was consistently lower in the oncological consultations. Conclusions. The documentation level of required core variables was not satisfactory, notwithstanding their high clinical relevance and continuous reminders during study. Pre-trial optimization strategies are paramount to promote integration and reduce professional and personal barriers towards a more patient-centred focus.","output":"Using Process Indicators to Monitor Documentation of Patient-Centred Variables in an Integrated Oncology and Palliative Care PathwayResults from a Cluster Randomized Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Skin is not the only casualty following a burn accident. Many children suffer long term, debilitating emotional effects from their burn injury (Abdullah et al. 1994; Kornhaber et al. 2018). Armstrong-James et al. (2018) and Maslow and Lobato (2010) found that summer camps explicitly designed for burn survivor children can positively impact childrens adaptability to stares and comments and improve their sense of self-esteem. Camp Susquehanna has been a summer camp for burn survivors for the past 25+ years. When the COVID19 pandemic closed many businesses, we decided to transition our in-person camp to 100% online. Researchers demonstrated the positive effects of summer camp for burn survivors (Maslow & Lobato, 2010; Bakker et al. 2011). However, the effects of a 100% online camp are not known. Our concern was, are we able to transition and be as impactful as it is face to face at camp? What will the schedule and activities look like in this new format? How will we ensure all children participating will have access to online and the supplies necessary? METHODS: We opted to select a three-week format with two sessions a day divided into two age groups. We ensured every child had internet access then mailed out a camp in the box. It contained all the things needed for each planned activity. The critical question remained, however, will we be as impactful? The current research looks at quantitative and qualitative measures of self-esteem, happiness, and satisfaction following participation in a three-week summer program held in July 2020. We make comparisons to previous years results. The authors expected that self-esteem, happiness, and satisfaction levels matched or exceeded last years levels. RESULTS: We collected data from 42 campers and 22 volunteer camp counselors. Results show that campers were able to receive the support they needed, not only from the staff but also from their peers. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery method was indeed different this year, but the positive effect on our campers remained the same.","output":"502 Adapting to COVID19: Can Virtual Burn Camp be as Impactful as Last Years In-person Camp?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, respiratory aerosols with diameters smaller than 100 m have been con- firmed as important vectors for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

These origami masks can be fabricated by non-experts at minimal cost and effort, provide adequate filtration efficiencies, and are easily scaled to different facial sizes. Using a mannequin fit test simulator, we demonstrate that these masks can provide optimal filtration efficiency and ease of breathing with minimal leak- age.

This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up.

Regular testing, producing rapid and reliable results is important in this population because infections spread quickly, and presentations are often atypical or asymptomatic. This study evaluated current testing pathways in care homes to explore the role of point-of-care tests (POCTs). METHODS: A total of 10 staff from eight care homes, purposively sampled to reflect care organisational attributes that influence outbreak severity, underwent a semi-structured remote videoconference interview. Transcripts were analysed using process mapping tools and framework analysis focussing on perceptions about, gaps within and needs arising from current pathways. RESULTS: Four main steps were identified in testing: infection prevention, preparatory steps, swabbing procedure and management of residents. Infection prevention was particularly challenging for mobile residents with cognitive impairment. Swabbing and preparatory steps were resource-intensive, requiring additional staff resource. Swabbing required flexibility and staff who were familiar to the resident. Frequent approaches to residents were needed to ensure they would participate at a suitable time. After-test management varied between sites. Several homes reported deviating from government guidance to take more cautious approaches, which they perceived to be more robust. CONCLUSION: Swab-based testing is organisationally complex and resource-intensive in care homes. It needs to be flexible to meet the needs of residents and provide care homes with rapid information to support care decisions. POCT could help address gaps but the complexity of the setting means that each technology must be evaluated in context before widespread adoption in care homes.","output":"COVID-19 testing in English care homes and implications for staff and residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s10044-020-00950-0.].","output":"Correction to a novel framework for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 on computed tomography scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous drugs are currently under accelerated clinical investigation for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19); however, well\\\\established safety and efficacy data for these drugs are limited.

Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on protein sequence and structural features to predict experimental RBD-hACE2 binding affinities of 8,440 variants upon single and multiple amino acid substitutions in the RBD or ACE2. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 83.28% and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities in five-fold cross-validation tests and predicts improved binding affinity for most circulating variants. We pro-actively used the CNN model to exhaustively screen for novel RBD variants with combinations of up to four single amino acid substitutions and suggested candidates with the highest improvements in RBD-ACE2 binding affinity for human and animal ACE2 receptors. We found that the binding affinity of RBD variants against animal ACE2s follows similar trends as those against human ACE2. White-tailed deer ACE2 binds to RBD almost as tightly as human ACE2 while cattle, pig, and chicken ACE2s bind weakly. The model allows testing whether adaptation of the virus for increased binding with other animals would cause concomitant increases in binding with hACE2 or decreased fitness due to adaptation to other hosts.","output":"A CNN model for predicting binding affinity changes between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD variants and ACE2 homologues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the confinement of approximately one third of the world population, causing a drastic change in the activities of daily life with many repercussions at the health, economic and social levels.

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.","output":"Interactions of coronaviruses with ACE2, angiotensin II, and RAS inhibitorslessons from available evidence and insights into COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In general, in mammalian cells, cytosolic DNA viruses are sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and RNA viruses are recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, triggering a series of downstream innate antiviral signaling steps in the host. We previously reported that measles virus (MeV), which possesses an RNA genome, induces rapid antiviral responses, followed by comprehensive downregulation of host gene expression in epithelial cells. Interestingly, gene ontology analysis indicated that genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are enriched among the list of downregulated genes. To evaluate mitochondrial stress after MeV infection, we first observed the mitochondrial morphology of infected cells and found that significantly elongated mitochondrial networks with a hyperfused phenotype were formed. In addition, an increased amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol was detected during progression of infection. Based on these results, we show that cytosolic mtDNA released from hyperfused mitochondria during MeV infection is captured by cGAS and causes consequent priming of the DNA sensing pathway in addition to canonical RNA sensing. We also ascertained the contribution of cGAS to the in vivo pathogenicity of MeV. In addition, we found that other viruses that induce downregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as seen for MeV cause similar mitochondrial hyperfusion and cytosolic mtDNA-priming antiviral responses. These findings indicate that the mtDNA-activated cGAS pathway is critical for full innate control of certain viruses, including RNA viruses that cause mitochondrial stress.","output":"Downregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by virus infection triggers antiviral responses by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research is to investigate the relationships between the counts of cases with Covid-19 and the deaths due to it in seven countries that are severely affected from this pandemic disease.

By this method 14 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the S protein of the c1-2 variant were revealed to react with the S1 subunit and one with the S2 subunit. These 14 MAbs were classified into the following three groups: (A) MAbs reactive to almost all MHV strains examined, (B) MAbs specific for the JHMV strain and (C) MAbs specific for a large S protein of the JHMV strain. All five MAbs classified in group B showed neutralization activity and four of them also showed fusion inhibition activity. Four of six MAbs in group C showed neutralizing activity to the c1-2 variant but not to the sp-4 variant, and most of them had no fusion inhibition activity.

India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases. Overall, we suggest that with the high level of immunity developed against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of the districts, it is less likely to have a second wave in India.","output":"Estimation of real-infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Indian populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 crisis hit the economy in 2020, the Federal Reserve responded with numerous programs designed to prevent a collapse in bank credit and firms available funds.

In the model, quantitative easing works through three channels: the expansion of bank reserves lowers a liquidity premium, the purchase of assets lowers a volatility risk premium, and the economic stimulus lowers a credit risk premium. Since bank reserves are currently larger than in the past, the liquidity premium channel is weaker, and quantitative easing is less effective. Direct lending to firms at a market rate is also less effective. Direct lending to firms at a subsidized rate can be more stimulative than quantitative easing, provided that it lowers firms marginal borrowing rate and user cost of capital.","output":"Quantitative Easing and Direct Lending in Response to the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aims to contribute to the existing literature by examining the role of institutional quality in the nexus of disaggregated energy sources and environmental degradation for belt and road initiative countries.

Further, a panel quantile regression and panel fixed effect model is used in the study to explore the nexus. The study found a long-run association between institutional quality (IQ), energy production from oil (EPOil), natural gas (EPGas), coal (EPCoal), renewables (EPRenew), and CO2 emission in BRI countries. According to panel unit-root tests, all variables are integrated of order I(1), and the panel co-integration test showed a log-run association among variables. The results of panel quantile regression and panel fixed effect model showed a positive association between IQ and CO2 emission. Similarly, an association of CO2 emission with EPGas, EPOil, and EPCoal is also significantly positive. The extraction and use of fossil fuels (natural gas, oil, and coal) pollute the air, while, on the other hand, there is a negative relationship found between CO2 emission and EPRenew.

With the number of cases increasing rapidly, the epidemiological data on the nutritional practice is scarce. In this study, we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and nutritional practice in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter, ambidirectional cohort study conducted at 11 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. All eligible critical COVID-19 patients in the study hospital intensive care units at 00:00, March 6th, 2020, were included. Data collection was performed via written case report forms. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were identified and enrolled, of whom eight died during the 28-day outcome follow- up period. The median interval between hospital admission and the study day was 24 (interquartile range, 13- 26) days and 52.2% (23 of 44) of patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation. The median nutrition risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score was 3 (interquartile range, 2-5) on the study day. During the enrolment day, 68.2% (30 of 44) of patients received enteral nutrition (EN), while 6.8% (3 of 44) received parenteral nutrition (PN) alone. Nausea and aspiration were uncommon, with a prevalence of 11.4% (5 of 44) and 6.8% (3 of 44), respectively. As for energy delivery, 69.7% (23 of 33) of patients receiving EN and/or PN were achieving their prescribed targets.

A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that low AT (levels below 80%) was a predictor of mortality (HR:3.97; 95%CI:1.38 to 11.43; p=0.0103).

The literature on online learning has traditionally focused on students who choose online learning. In light of recent shifts in education, online learning continues to increase its prevalence in the education of all students, including those who would not have traditionally chosen this medium. In this research, we explore students' experiences in emergency online learning in two undergraduate business classes. Through the use of the learning platform metadata and student survey responses, this research examines the impact of various pedagogical techniques used in the online classroom and their ability to maintain high student motivation to engage with the learning content.

We determined their willingness to provide cell phone data and personal information to public health staff investigating COVID-19 cases, as well as their concerns about sharing this information. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We used the electronic medical records of an academic healthcare institution in central Pennsylvania to obtain names and addresses of patients who had visited an outpatient clinic or been an inpatient within the prior three years, were 18 years or older, and who resided in a community defined as rural by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The survey included four statements about contact tracing, three statements about intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and validated scales for general trust and for distrust in healthcare organizations. All study variables were summarized to determine their distributions, and bivariate binomial logistic regression was conducted. A multivariable model including all of the independent variables was then fit for each outcome variable. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The response rate was 19.5%. 95 % of respondents were white, 56% were female, and nearly two-thirds were older than 60 years. Binomial logistic regression showed that both distrust in healthcare organizations and political values influenced respondents willingness to share information with contact tracers as well as their concerns about sharing. In multivariate analysis, political values were a consistent predicator of willingness to share and concerns about sharing. Respondents who indicated that they wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible were significantly more likely than those who did not want to be vaccinated to be willing to share their cell phone location data and personal data. Conversely, they were less likely to be concerned with these data being shared without their permission. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding rural residents concerns about sharing personal information is critical if we are to develop successful strategies for lessening the impact of COVID-19 and managing future pandemics.

OBJECTIVES The study attempted to evaluate the potential role of EPSTI1 against pneumonia and reveal its underlying mechanism. METHODS Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5, 10, and 20 g/mL) was applied in WI-38 cells to establish the in vitro pneumonia model. Knockdown of epithelial-stromal interaction 1 (EPSTI1) was performed by transfection with EPSTI1 siRNA (siEPSTI1) into LPS-treated cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were implemented to measure cell viability, and apoptotic cells were detected using flow cytometry. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunoblotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were conducted to quantify EPSTI1 expression, and proteins related to nuclear factor -light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-B) signaling, including p-p65, p65, p-IB, and IB. RESULTS EPSTI1 was highly expressed in LPS-treated WI-38 cells. Cell apoptosis was promoted, and cell viability was inhibited after being exposed to LPS. Besides, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- were dramatically upregulated. Knockdown of EPSTI1 restored cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis, and attenuated expressions of proinflammatory factors. Additionally, knockdown of EPSTI1 visibly decreased the increased ratios of p-p65/p65 and p-IB/IB induced by LPS. Knockdown of EPSTI1 alleviated inflammatory injury through the inactivation of the NF-B pathway.

By analysing structural characteristics of the Official Aviation Guide flight data, we show that this resulted in an increased average distance between airports, and in an increased number of long-range routes. Based on our study of network robustness, we uncover that this disruption is consistent with the impact of a mixture of targeted and random global attack on the worldwide air transportation network. By considering the individual functional evolution of airports, we identify anomalous airports with high centrality but low degree, which further enables us to reveal the underlying transitions among airport-specific representations in terms of both geographical and geopolitical factors. During the evolution of the air transportation network, we also observe how the network attempted to cope by shifting centralities between different airports around the world. Since these shifts are not aligned with optimal strategies for minimizing delays and disconnects, we conclude that they are consistent with politics trumping science from the viewpoint of epidemic containment and transport.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the worldwide air transportation network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia often also have physical health illnesses and interventions are needed to address the resultant multimorbidity and reduced life expectancy.

This multi-biomarker test (MBT) demonstrated feasibility of quantitative detection of six host serum proteins simultaneously, jointly allowing discrimination of patients with multibacillary and paucibacillary leprosy from control individuals in high and low leprosy endemic areas. Pilot testing of fingerstick blood showed similar MBT performance in point-of-care (POC) settings as observed for plasma and serum. Thus, this newly developed prototype MBT measures six biomarkers covering immunity against M. leprae across the leprosy spectrum.

METHODS: This is a retrospective, two-center case series of 198 consecutive COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension. RESULTS: Among 198 patients, 58 (29.3%) and 16 (8.1%) were on ARB and ACEI, respectively. Patients who were on ARB or ACEI/ARB had a significantly lower rate of severe illness and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when compared with patients treated with ACEI alone or not receiving RAAS blocker (P < 0.05). The KaplanCMeier survival curve showed that patients with ARB in their antihypertensive regimen had a trend toward a higher survival rate when compared with individuals without ARB (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07C1.02; P = 0.054).

This unprecedented pandemic outbreak pressingly necessitated the trans-disciplinary approach in developing novel/new anti-COVID-19 drugs especially, small molecule inhibitors targeting the seminal proteins of viral etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the traditional medicinal knowledge, we made an attempt through molecular docking analysis to explore the phytochemical constituents of three most commonly used Indian herbs in 'steam inhalation therapy' against well recognized viral receptor proteins. RESULTS: A total of 57 phytochemicals were scrutinized virtually against four structural protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 viz. 3CLpro, ACE-2, spike glycoprotein and RdRp. Providentially, two bioactives from each of the three plants i.e. apigenin-o-7-glucuronide and ellagic acid from Eucalyptus globulus; eudesmol and viridiflorene from Vitex negundo and; vasicolinone and anisotine from Justicia adhatoda were identified to be the best hit lead molecules based on interaction energies, conventional hydrogen bonding numbers and other non-covalent interactions. On comparison with the known SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor -lopinavir and RdRp inhibitor -remdesivir, apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was found to be a phenomenal inhibitor of both protease and polymerase, as it strongly interacts with their active sites and exhibited remarkably high binding affinity. Furthermore, in silico drug-likeness and ADMET prediction analyses clearly evidenced the usability of the identified bioactives to develop as drug against COVID-19.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of the syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (19-S), as well as human ACE2 expression vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cellCcell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the 19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via 19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. CONCLUSIONS: This distinction between the 19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully. 19-S mRNA may represent a safer mRNA vaccine design in the future.

DESIGN: Descriptive survey. SETTING: All non-specialist secondary care providers in England from 27 March27to 5 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Acute (non-specialist) trusts with a type 1 (ie, 24 hours/day, consultant-led) accident and emergency department (n=125), Nightingale (field) hospitals (n=7) and independent sector secondary care providers (n=195). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two thresholds for safe occupancy were used: 85% as per the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement. RESULTS: At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough there were 8.7% (8508) fewer general and acute beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to full occupancy of general and acute bed (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8%. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity and 154 trust-days (1.8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust=1, range: 1C17). However, only three sustainability and transformation partnerships (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed types existed at a national level. However, due to an unequal distribution of bed utilisation, many trusts spent a significant period operating above safe-occupancy thresholds despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts, a key operational issue to address in preparing for future waves.","output":"Hospital bed capacity and usage across secondary healthcare providers in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: a descriptive analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the start of the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many countries have replaced traditional class education with distance education (DE) as a preventive measure.

Method: In this study, the medical sciences students whom had been taught through distant education during COVID-19 pandemic, were questioned about their academic views, attitudes, and practices towards distant teaching due to COVID-19 and how such a teaching has influenced their study performance. The informed consent was taken from each participant student before going through the questionnaire form questions. The questionnaire form was sent through the Internet to all students in the targeted colleges, to give the same chance to all to be part of the study.

The aim of this study was to systematically review main clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric age. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed database. Papers published between 1 January and 1 May 2020 including children aged 0C18 years were selected. Sixty-two studies and three reviews were included, with a total sample size of 7480 children (2428/4660 males, 52.1%; weighted mean age 7.6 years). Patients showed mainly mild (608/1432, 42.5%) and moderate (567/1432, 39.6%) signs of the infection. About 2% of children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The most commonly described symptoms were fever (51.6%) and cough (47.3%). Laboratory findings were often unremarkable. Children underwent a chest CT scan in 73.9% of all cases, and 32.7% resulted normal. Overall, the estimated mortality was 0.08%. A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults.

As a result, sequence similarity of paralogous genes is significantly higher than expected from their evolutionary distance. Gene conversion, a copy paste DNA repair mechanism that transfers sequences from one gene to another and homologous recombination are drivers of concerted evolution. Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire CEA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.","output":"Natural selection supports escape from concerted evolution of a recently duplicated CEACAM1 paralog in the ruminant CEA gene family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to present the host experience of student hosts in Hong Kong, a popular educational destination for international students from mainland China and other countries. This study examines the interconnection between the experience-based and sociocultural dimensions of visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travel, considering the overall host experience, the hostCguest relationship and post-hosting changes in perception of both the VFR experience and destination. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a qualitative approach to compare the experience-based and sociocultural dimensions of VFR travel considering international university students as VFR hosts in Hong Kong, taking a student sample from both mainland Chinese and overseas students. Based on a voluntary sampling approach, the research team had face-to-face interviews with the students that agreed to participate. The interviews were conducted voluntarily and anonymously and included those students who had hosted any friends or relatives in the past 12 months. A total of 26 interviews were successfully completed, including 10 mainland Chinese and 16 non-mainland Chinese students. Findings: The results confirm that the VFR host experience is generally shaped by an integration of internal characteristics (sociocultural characteristics of both hosts and visitors) and external environment (urban infrastructure and tourism resources). The two groups distinctively express their host experience that shows some areas of cultural barriers and geographical proximity. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research mainly lie on its relatively small sample size because of constraints in accessing the contact information of international students across universities. These shortcomings should be improved by adopting a research design that uses other sampling approaches, such as snowball sampling, to include a wider scope of students from different local universities, or convenience sampling, to interview and compare responses of international students from various educational destinations. Alternative data sources may be considered, for example, through user-generated contents from online and social media platforms that contain sharing of students as hosts. Practical implications: The geographical and cultural proximities influence VFR tourism development and social construction of values and the consequent hosting behaviour. The unique role of international students should be further explored, especially in the Asian context. The outcome of VFR travel must be evaluated and studied more from cultural and personal dimensions than economic gain, which should be relevant to host perspective such as improved quality of life, social ties and place attachment and psychological benefits. The changing risk perception caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may be examined through some forms of travel intention. Social implications: Firstly, the destination marketing organisations of the educational destination should address the difficulty faced by student hosts in terms of external attributes such as local culture, urban infrastructure, tourism resources and information accessibility. Secondly, to target the hosts, some specific VFR-related products and services may be developed for international students through local tertiary institutions such that the role of hosts as ambassadors can be facilitated and enhanced. Thirdly, the functional role of international students can be distinctive based on their unique network, activities and knowledge constructed upon learning during the period of education. Originality/value: The studentification of many educational destination cities, the dynamism of the role of international students as VFR hosts and their cultural differences between places of origin have provided an opportunity for deepening the understanding of VFR tourism. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The connection between VFR experience based and sociocultural dimensions of international students and mainland Chinese students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycyrrhizin has a role in immune regulation in the central nervous system, but its impact on sciatic nerve injury had not previously been reported. In this study, a BALB/c mouse model of sciatic nerve injury was used to explore the role of glycyrrhizin in sciatic nerve repair and its underlying mechanism. Glycyrrhizin with intragastric gavage of 10 and 20 mg/kg weight per day (mid- and high-dose, respectively) inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) expression at the protein and mRNA levels versus the 5 mg/kg (low-dose) group and control (0.9% NaCl solution) at one, two, four and eight weeks following sciatic nerve injury, and simultaneously improved the action potential amplitude and motor nerve conductive velocity. Combined Marsland, Glees and Eriksons silver stain and Luxol fast blue staining results indicated that high- and mid-dose glycyrrhizin promoted improved sciatic nerve myelination compared with the low-dose or control groups eight weeks after injury. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that glycyrrhizin had an inhibitory effect to a certain degree on local hypertrophic scar and inflammatory responses in the mouse model. In conclusion, glycyrrhizin can promote sciatic nerve regeneration and functional repair, in which doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg per day are more effective than lower doses, and such regeneration is associated with the downregulation of p75NTR.","output":"Glycyrrhizin improves p75NTR-associated sciatic nerve regeneration in a BALB/c mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious diseases.

We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T  37.5 C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1CJune 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7C8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. CONCLUSIONS: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization.

Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7  19.4 vs. 63.3  18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) observed in the 30-39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35-2.11).

Centromere localization was abolished if as few as 28 amino acids were removed from the amino terminus of CENP-B. The centromere localization signal of CENP-B can function in an autonomous fashion, relocating a fused bacterial enzyme to centromeres. The centromere localization domain of CENP-B specifically binds in vitro to a subset of alpha-satellite DNA monomers. These results suggest that the primary mechanism for localization of CENP-B to centromeres involves the recognition of a DNA sequence found at centromeres.

Evaluation includes determining an underlying etiology. Isolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis (IPIPC) without clinical, serological, or histological evidence of an underlying systemic process is an extremely rare cause of DAH. In limited case series, treatment is similar to treatment of DAH secondary to vasculitis or autoimmune disease and consists of immunosuppression. Prognosis is generally favorable. We present a case of a healthy male with IPIPC who, despite treatment, had persistent and ultimately fatal DAH. A 64-year-old male presented with mild dyspnea and scant hemoptysis.

This study aims to compare the level of burnout syndrome in medical residents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential risk factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on medical residents from three different university hospitals in Turkey in March 2021, one year after the pandemic hit Turkey. Burnout is measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory which assesses three dimensions of it: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Collected data were combined and compared with the data of a previous study which was held in the same hospitals in December 2019, three months before the pandemic. Results: A total of 412 medical residents from three universities participated in this study. The mean age was 27.8{+/-}2.4 and half of them were female. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, residents have a significantly decreased feeling of personal accomplishment one year after (from 20.8{+/-}5.1 to 10.9{+/-}5, p<0.001). No significant differences in emotional exhaustion (pre: 19.0{+/-}7.6 post: 18.8{+/-}7.8) and depersonalization (pre: 7.3{+/-}4.3 post: 7.2{+/-}4.4) scores were observed. Emotional exhaustion is higher in residents who are female, have more night shifts, live with someone at the risk of severe COVID-19 and experience personal problems during COVID-19. Depersonalization increases as the age, residency year, and the number of night shifts increases and it is higher in married residents. Residents of the state university hospital feel less personal accomplishment than those of foundational universities. Conclusion: Already high pre-pandemic levels of burnout and a relative decrease in demand due to social restrictions may explain not increasing emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. However, the substantial decrease in the feeling of personal accomplishment among residents is concerning. Without immediate action, it may lead to serious consequences on human resources and the quality of health care in the short to middle term.","output":"Comparison of the burnout among medical residents before and during the pandemic: not more exhausted but less accomplished"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid digital technology advancement has resulted in a tremendous increase in computing tasks imposing stringent energy efficiency and area efficiency requirements on next-generation computing.

The survey waves 12 (19th/20th May 2020) and 21 (15th/16th September 2020) were investigated as examples of two different pandemic phases. The psychosocial and emotional situation and well-being of children were measured with the emotional subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed by parents. Descriptive analyses and logistic regressions were calculated. In total, a third of the participating parents in wave 12 and in wave 21 reported having children and adolescents with emotional symptoms. Especially children with younger parents seemed to be more affected by emotional symptoms. Sociodemographic aspects, such as household language, showed a significant association with reported emotional symptoms in children (Wave 12: OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.20C4.09). Reported prevalences of emotional symptoms in children did not differ between the pandemic phases. In conclusion, the pandemic had negative influences on the emotional symptoms of children and adolescents in COVID-19 pandemic waves in 2020, indicating a forecasted reoccurrence and need for preventive measures for upcoming waves and other pandemics in the future.","output":"Emotional Situation of Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: Results from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring Study (COSMO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This MEDICC Review roundtable gathers some of Cuba's top researchers in the fi elds of vaccines and biotechnology, all of whom work in institutions belonging to BioCubaFarma, the umbrella company of Cuban biotech and pharmaceutical R&D, production, distribution and export.

We investigated if a pit crew model training improves performance assessment and ALS skills retention when compared to standard ALS education. METHODS: This was a prospective, blinded, randomized, and controlled, parallel\\\\group trial. We recruited students to 4\\\\person resuscitation teams. We video recorded simulated ALS\\\\situations after the ALS education and after 6\\\\month follow\\\\up. We analyzed technical skills (TS) and non\\\\technical skills (NTS) demonstrated in them with an instrument measuring TS and NTS, and used a linear mixed model to model the difference between the groups in the TS and NTS. Another linear model was used to explore the difference between the groups in hands\\\\on ratio and hands\\\\free time. The difference in the total assessment score was analyzed with the Mann\\\\Whitney U\\\\test. The primary outcome was the difference in the total assessment score between the groups at follow\\\\up.

Raised during the COVID-19 pandemic shock, this debate is the reaction of countries to the global diffusion of downfalls through transborder supplies. We analyze vulnerabilities of GVCs to sudden shocks, demonstrate the role of these risks in escalating the 2020 global recession and in shaping its unique features, as well as scrutinize the emerging post-pandemic strategies of leading MNEs for enhancing the GVC resilience. We argue that despite the collapse of the just-in-time supply system and the crucial dependency of many domestic industries on imports from China, the pandemic shock could neither undermine foundations of distributed production nor lead to mass reshoring. On the contrary, both analyzed practice and surveyed econometric literature confirm that benefits of countries' participation in GVCs outweigh risks of their falling under potential rippling disruptions. Moreover, MNEs' resilience strategies, which we classified into three interrelated lines of action (restructuring of GVCs' supplier networks, production optimization, and GVCs' digital transformation), give globalization a new impetus. We conclude with describing the changing features of distributed production under the ongoing GVCs' restructuring and outline a number of promising export opportunities that objectively open up in the 2020s for developing economies, including Russia.

However, the mechanisms governing the development of complications remain poorly studied. The present work reports the comparative assessment of the functional changes which take place in human ECV-304 endothelial cell sublines obtained previously by the long-term culturing of cells after exposure to varying infectious doses (IDs) of influenza A virus, and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has been demonstrated that, in the course of long-term culturing (six passages) after exposure to pathogenic agents (influenza virus and/or LPS), endothelial cells maintain changes in their migratory activity, permeability, and expression of mRNA for cytokines TNF and TGF (along with the changes in their proliferation activity, which has been demonstrated earlier). The pattern of changes depended on the type of the agent (agents) to which the cells were exposed. The differences in migratory activity (which was at its maximum 4 h after wounding) between the cell sublines at the sixth passage correlated with the differences in their proliferation activity at the first passage (proliferation data were obtained previously). In particular, an increase in migration and proliferation was observed in the sublines exposed to low virus doses (ECV-1ID), as well as exposed to LPS (ECV-LPS), while the suppression of migration and proliferation was observed in the subline exposed to high virus doses (ECV-1000ID). In the ECV-1ID, ECV-LPS, and most notably in ECV-1ID + LPS sublines, we detected an increase in the expression of mRNA for cytokines TNF and TGF, which, however, didnt lead to the induction of apoptosis. We have also demonstrated an increase in cell permeability in the analyzed sublines, which was indicated by a decrease in the expression of the mRNAs for the genes encoding occludin and ZO-1, the tight junctions proteins . This paper also reports an evaluation of the effects of the antiviral preparations rimantadine and alpisarin on the functional state of cell sublines. As a result, it has been demonstrated that these drugs may be able to prevent the development of the pathological changes caused by influenza A virus and/or LPS in endothelial cells.

The remodeling process of the ECM causes changes in the biomechanical properties of the ONH and the peripapillary sclera, which is accompanied by an increased reactivity of the resident astrocytes. The molecular factors involved in the remodeling process belong to the Transforming growth factor (TGF)-? superfamily, especially TGF-?2. In previous publications we showed that TGF-?2 induced ECM alterations are mediated by Cellular Communication Network Factor (CCN)2/Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) and recently we showed that CCN2/CTGF is expressed by astrocytes of the ON under normal conditions. In this study we wanted to get a better understanding of the function of CCN2/CTGF under normal and pathologic conditions. To this end, we analyzed the glial lamina and peripapillary sclera of CCN2/CTGF overexpressing mice and studied the effect of CCN2/CTGF and increasing substratum stiffness on murine ON astrocytes in vitro. We observed enhanced astrocyte reactivity in the ONH, increased ECM protein synthesis in the peripapillary sclera and increased Ccn2/Ctgf expression in the ONH during the pathologic development in situ. CCN2/CTGF treatment of primary murine ON astrocytes induced a higher migration rate, and increase of ECM proteins including fibronectin, elastin and collagen type III. Furthermore, the astrocytes responded to stiffer substratum with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, actin and CCN2/CTGF synthesis. Finally, we observed the reinforced appearance of CCN2/CTGF in the lamina cribrosa of glaucomatous patients. We conclude that reactive changes in ONH astrocytes, induced by the altered biomechanical characteristics of the region, give rise to a self-amplifying process that includes increased TGF-?2/CCN2/CTGF signaling and leads to the synthesis of ECM molecules and cytoskeleton proteins, a process that in turn augments the stiffness at the ONH. Such a scenario may finally result in a vicious circle in the pathogenesis of POAG. The transgenic CTGF-overexpressing mouse model might be an optimal model to study the chronic pathological POAG changes in the ONH.","output":"CCN2/CTGF-A Modulator of the Optic Nerve Head Astrocyte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nipah disease is listed as one of the WHO priority diseases that pose the greatest public health risk due to their epidemic potential.

METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search. RESULTS: A number of substances have been found to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes. High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections. Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well. The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials. At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020.

Cancer and its treatment affect many haematological and biochemical parameters, therefore we analysed these prior to and during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and correlated them with outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with cancer testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in centres throughout the United Kingdom were identified and entered into a database following local governance approval. Clinical and longitudinal laboratory data were extracted from patient records. Data were analysed using MannCWhitney U test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, logistic regression, or linear regression for outcomes. Hierarchical clustering of heatmaps was performed using Ward's method. RESULTS: In total, 302 patients were included in three cohorts: Manchester (n = 67), Liverpool (n = 62), and UK (n = 173). In the entire cohort (N = 302), median age was 69 (range 19-93 years), including 163 males and 139 females; of these, 216 were diagnosed with a solid tumour and 86 with a haematological cancer. Preinfection lymphopaenia, neutropaenia and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were not associated with oxygen requirement (O(2)) or death. Lymphocyte count (P < 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.03), LDH (P < 0.0001) and albumin (P < 0.0001) significantly changed from preinfection to during infection. High rather than low neutrophils at day 0 (P = 0.007), higher maximal neutrophils during COVID-19 (P = 0.026) and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; P = 0.01) were associated with death.

In the Manchester/Liverpool cohort 30 patients have restarted therapy following COVID-19, with no additional complications requiring readmission. CONCLUSION: Preinfection biochemical/haematological parameters were not associated with worse outcome in cancer patients. Restarting treatment following COVID-19 was not associated with additional complications. Neutropaenia due to cancer/treatment is not associated with COVID-19 mortality.

Here we study socioeconomic determinants of mobility disruption during both the lockdown and the recovery phases in Italy. For this purpose, we analyze a massive data set on Italian mobility from February to October 2020 and we combine it with detailed data on pre-existing local socioeconomic features of Italian administrative units. Using a set of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, we reliably show that the least and the most affected areas persistently belong to two different clusters. Notably, the former cluster features significantly higher income per capita and lower income inequality than the latter. This distinction persists once the lockdown is lifted.

RECENT FINDINGS New data strengthen the evidence against a causal link between MS and vaccination. Recent consensus statements agree on the need to start vaccination early. Timings for vaccine administration should be adjusted to ensure safety and optimize vaccine responses, given the potential interference of DMDs. Patients treated with Ocrelizumab (and potentially other B-cell depleting therapies) are at risk of diminished immunogenicity to vaccines. This has relevant implications for the upcoming vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY An early assessment and immunization of MS patients allows optimizing vaccine responses and avoiding potential interference with treatment plans. Vaccinations are safe and effective but some specific considerations should be followed when vaccinating before, during, and after receiving immunotherapy. A time-window for vaccination taking into account the kinetics of B cell repopulation could potentially improve vaccine responses. Further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response dynamics in MS patients under specific therapies will be key for defining the best vaccination strategy.","output":"Vaccinations in multiple sclerosis patients receiving disease-modifying drugs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reasons for performing study: Recognising the presence of a necrotising component of the gastrointestinal disease may be clinically useful in ill equine neonates. Objectives: To study the importance of abdominal sonograms in neonatal foals suffering from gastrointestinal conditions and to describe the clinical features of necrotising gastrointestinal disease. Hypothesis: There is a subgroup of neonates with sonographically detectable pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), reflecting a necrotising disease. Methods: Records of foals aged 7 days hospitalised from 2005 to 2009 with signs of gastrointestinal disease were evaluated (n = 89). The association of sonographic, clinical and clinicopathological signs with necrotising gastrointestinal disease and outcome was determined. Results: PI was imaged in 19 foals. Twenty\\\\seven foals were classified as having necrotising gastrointestinal disease based on the presence of gastrointestinal signs (colic, diarrhoea, gastric reflux or abdominal distension) and sonographic PI (n = 19), surgical (n = 2) or pathological (n = 6) evidence of gastrointestinal necrosis. There was a difference between survival rate in foals with and without necrotising disease (33.3 and 69.4%, respectively, P = 0.005) or foals with and without PI detected sonographically (36.8 and 72.1%, respectively, P = 0.023). PI was the only sonographic finding associated with outcome. Prematurity, the presence of blood in the faeces, gastric reflux, abdominal distension, abnormal echogenicity of the colon and the lowest white blood cell count during hospitalisation were associated with necrotising gastrointestinal disease (P<0.05). Conclusions and potential relevance: Abdominal sonograms have prognostic value in neonatal gastrointestinal disease. PI and the presence of necrotising gastrointestinal disease were common and associated with a poor prognosis.","output":"The importance of ultrasonographic pneumatosis intestinalis in equine neonatal gastrointestinal disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Involving patients and their carers in research has become more common, as funders demand evidence of involvement. The Patient Voice in Cancer Research (PVCR) is an initiative led by University College Dublin (UCD) in Ireland. It encourages and enables people affected by cancer, and their families to become involved in shaping and informing the future of cancer research across the island of Ireland. Its aim is to identify the questions and needs that matter most to (i) people living with a cancer diagnosis, and (ii) those most likely to improve the relevance of cancer research. The initiative commenced in April 2016. METHODS: This paper presents a reflective case study of our journey thus far. We outline three key stages of the initiative and share what we have learnt. At the core of PVCR, is a focus on building long-term relationships. RESULTS: We have developed over time an inclusive initiative that is built on trust and respect for everyones contributions. This work is grounded on collegiality, mixed with a good sense of humour and friendship. CONCLUSION: The development of PVCR has taken time and investment. The benefits and impact of undertaking this work have been immensely rewarding and now require significant focus as we enhance cancer research across the island of Ireland.","output":"Could you give us an idea on what we are all doing here? the Patient Voice in Cancer Research (PVCR) starting the journey of involvement in Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the spread of COVID-19 infections and deaths by county poverty level in the US. In the beginning of the pandemic, counties with either very low poverty levels or very high poverty levels reported the highest numbers of cases. A U-shaped relationship prevails for counties with high population density while among counties with low population density, only poorer counties report high incidence rates of COVID-19. Second, we discuss the pattern of infections spreading from higher to lower income counties. Third, we show that stay-at-home mandates caused significantly higher reductions in mobility in high income counties that experienced adverse weather shocks than counties that did not. These effects are not present in counties with high poverty rates. Using weather shocks in combination with stay-at-home mandates as an instrument for social distancing, we find that measures taken to promote social distancing helped curb infections in high income counties but not in low income counties.

A literature search up from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2021 was conducted in three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, in order to identify studies on periodontal disease alone or in conjunction with diabetes mellitus, reporting any relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection as a primary outcome. Only articles published in the English language were included. Due to the lack of studies, we decided to collect all the theoretical and clinical evidence suggesting a possible biological pathway evidencing the relationship among PD, DM, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. From a total of 29 articles, 12 were included for final review studies (five reviews, two hypotheses, one Special Issue, one perspective, one commentary, one caseCcontrol study, and one case report). In addition, this systematic review article hypothesizes the correlation between PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in periodontal tissue and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. T2DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from altered insulin secretion or action. Likewise, periodontitis and T2DM are inflammatory disorders with a bidirectional association, and both diseases have a similar immunomodulatory cascade and cytokine profile. ACE2 is a crucial component of the reninCangiotensin system (RAS) and the key factor of entry in the cells by the new SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is widely distributed in the lung and kidneys, and interestingly has a great distribution in the oral cavity, principally in the tongue and periodontal tissue. ACE2 in periodontal tissue plays a crucial role between health and disease. Moreover, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis is downregulated in the dysbiotic and inflammatory periodontal environment. Nevertheless, the balance of ACE2 activity is modified in the context of concurrent diabetes, increasing the expression of ACE2 by the uncontrolled glycemia chronic in T2DM. Therefore, the uncontrolled hyperglycemia possibly increases the risk of developing periodontitis and triggering overexpression of ACE2 in periodontal tissue of T2DM patients, with these events potentially being essential to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of mild-to-severe form of COVID-19. In this sense, we would like to point out that the need for randomized controlled trials is imperative to support this association.","output":"Should We Be Concerned about the Association of Diabetes Mellitus and Periodontal Disease in the Risk of Infection by SARS-CoV-2?

Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is a potential cure for technically operable disease. The epidemiology and long-term outcomes of CTEPH have not been previously described in Australia and New Zealand. METHODS Data were extracted from the Pulmonary Hypertension Society of Australia and New Zealand (PHSANZ) registry for patients diagnosed with CTEPH between January 2004 and March 2020. Baseline characteristics, treatment strategies, outcome data and long-term survival are reported. RESULTS A total of 386 patients were included with 146 (37.8%) undergoing PEA and 240 (62.2%) in the non-PEA group. PEA patients were younger (55  16 vs. 62  16 years, p < 0.001) with higher baseline 6-min walk distance (6MWD; 405  122 vs. 323  146 m, p = 0.021), whilst both groups had similar baseline pulmonary haemodynamics. Pulmonary hypertension-specific therapy was used in 54% of patients post-PEA and 88% in the non-PEA group. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 93%, 87% and 84% for the PEA group compared to 86%, 73% and 62%, respectively, for the non-PEA group (p < 0.001). Multivariate survival analysis showed baseline 6MWD was an independent predictor of survival in both operated and medically managed patients. CONCLUSION In this first multicentre report of CTEPH in Australia and New Zealand, long-term survival is comparable to that in other contemporary CTEPH registries. However, PEA was only performed in a minority of CTEPH patients (37.8%) and significantly less than overseas reports. Greater awareness of PEA and improved patient access to experienced CTEPH centres are important priorities.","output":"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in Australia and New Zealand: An analysis of the PHSANZ registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectieziekten zijn ziekten veroorzaakt door levende micro-organismen.

With the cooperation of those involved, the site, which was once in a crisis situation, has improved to the point where it is possible to look ahead and proceed with work on schedule. In the off-site area, conditions for returning home have been progressed, and evacuation orders for some areas have been lifted by the Japanese Government. This article describes, in respect of the various efforts being made on site at the moment, the current status of fuel removal from the spent fuel pools, preparations for fuel debris retrieval, improvement of the working environment, and future plans. Removal of fuel from the spent fuel pool for Unit 4 was completed in December 2014, and work is continuing with Unit 3 in order to complete by March 2021. The decision was made to install a large cover in advance for Unit 1 in consideration of the risk of dust scattering, and to conduct fuel removal for Unit 2 from the south side without dismantling the existing upper section of the building. The target is for fuel removal from the pools, including Units 5 and 6, to be complete by 2031. Regarding fuel debris retrieval, progress in various investigations has made it possible to grasp the distribution of debris in the reactor containment vessels of Units 1-3 to a certain extent, and it was decided that the first retrieval will start with the most-investigated unit (Unit 2). A robot arm will be used for retrieval; initially, a trial retrieval will be started, and once the retrieval method has been verified and confirmed, the scale of retrieval will be expanded in stages using a device with the same mechanism. The working environment of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has also improved. By reducing the stirring up of radioactive materials due to facing (paving), etc., it became possible to reduce the degree of protective clothing needed, and the area in which people can work with simple clothing such as general work clothes now represents 96% of the entire site. Due to various reduction measures, the effective dose of workers is currently approximately 0.2-0.4 mSv month-1 on average per person. The work environment will continue to be improved steadily in the future. Finally, I would like to briefly mention the direction of future decommissioning efforts. The decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and contaminated water management are being implemented based on the national Mid-and-Long-Term Roadmap. The latest edition (5th revision) sets out the milestones until 2031, and we are on target to achieve the goals set forth here and the goals set forth in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's risk map. To that end, the Mid-and-Long-Term Decommissioning Action Plan 2020, which shows the main work processes of the decommissioning, was announced. This will enable us to proceed with decommissioning work more systematically in the future while looking ahead. Local people who sometime are concerned about risk arising from Fukushima Daiichi may grasp the future work plan concretely in relief, and can consider taking part in the decommissioning work. The key lies in how we can contribute to the reconstruction of Fukushima through the decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and we will continue to take responsibility for decommissioning of the power plant and contaminated water management under the principle of 'striking a balance of reconstruction and decommissioning'.","output":"Fukushima Daiichi decontamination and decommissioning: current status and challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applications for new businesses from the U.S. Census Bureaus monthly and weekly Business Formation Statistics (BFS) fell substantially in the early stages of the pandemic but then surged in the second half of 2020.

The analysis included general vocabulary through network graphs and a comparison across gender, academic background, school type and knowledge area. The results made it possible to identify the latent mental lexicon of teachers, revealing significant differences in the perception of emotions, according to gender and ICTs use and according to gender and knowledge area. The study further projects the potential of lexical availability to determine the emotions required by Affective Informatics in the adaptability of educational systems and to make adjustments to the instructional design.","output":"Teachers Perceptions Analysis on Students Emotions in Virtual Classes during COVID19 Pandemic: A Lexical Availability Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral RNA replication by blocking RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. First developed and tested during the Ebola epidemic, repurposed, and gained prominence during the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on data from three major trials, remdesivir became the first and only medication to obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19 disease. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of the article is to review available preclinical, clinical, and post-marketing data to assess the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. We performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published on remdesivir until January 2021. EXPERT OPINION: The substantial evidence of its effectiveness in a few trials together with the favorable safety profile makes remdesivir a primary therapeutic candidate for treatment in adult and pediatric patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and requiring oxygen supplementation. While remdesivir does not improve mortality, it has been shown to reduce the recovery time and increase the odds for clinical improvement, specifically in patients with early presentation and moderate COVID-19 disease. Remdesivir is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile in the pediatric and adult populations.","output":"Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID 19: review of the pharmacological properties, safety and clinical effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text.","output":"2021 ACC/AHA Key Data Elements and Definitions for Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Data Standards (Writing Committee to Develop Clinical Data Standards for Heart Failure)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are older individuals Age and the comorbidities typically associated with it usually go hand in hand with a less favorable course of the disease We were interested in the antibody response in this particular patient group as well as in the results of rapid antigen testing","output":"Antibody titers and rapid antigen testing in elderly patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia vs. staff of ICU and \\"Covid-19\\" wards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiplication and division of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light are important functions in the exploitation of the OAM mode space for such purposes as high-dimensional quantum information encoding and mode division multiplexed optical communications.

For this purpose, we have developed an innovative enhanced fraud detection framework using actuarial and data science techniques. Triggers specific to COVID-19 are identified in addition to the existing triggers. We have also explored the relationship between insurance fraud and COVID-19. To determine this we calculated Pearson correlation coefficient and fitted logarithmic regression model between fraud in health insurance and COVID-19 cases. This work uses two datasets: health insurance dataset and Kaggle dataset on COVID-19 cases for the same select geographical location in India. Our experimental results shows Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86, which implies that the month on month rate of fraudulent cases is highly correlated with month on month rate of COVID-19 cases. The logarithmic regression performed on the data gave the r-squared value of 0.91 which indicates that the model is a good fit.

Whilst research has shown the overall benefits FWA can have, limited research has explored whether use and benefits of FWA are equal across differentiated organisational contexts and genders. We suggest that individuals working in their familys business face less organizational constraints that typically hinder employees from taking advantage of FWA. It could be suggested that these workers may make higher use of FWA than individuals in regular employment because of their entrepreneurial status and nepotistic privileges. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to explore if family members working in their familys business, work under favourable boundary conditions which enable them to more freely make use of and benefit from FWAs. Utilising representative data from the German Family Panel (pairfam), our comparative analysis based on propensity score matching, suggests that family members working in their familys business (N = 337) do make greater use of FWA than those in regular employment. Counter to common assumptions, the findings reveal that FWA leads to higher workloads for owner-managers but not for family employees. Furthermore, families working in their business show no differences in how they divide household tasks compared to regular employed familiesCyet they perceive that division to be fairer. This study extends knowledge by introducing family ownership and kinship ties as important boundary conditions to existing theories on FWA, such as life-course theory.

Neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized, including febrile seizures, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, as well as encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases. Cerebral vasculitis is rarely reported. We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia complicated by flaccid tetraplegia due to Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) associated with a cerebral vasculitis-like pattern. Case description: A 62-year-old man was hospitalized for cough, fever, and severe respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The chest Computerized Tomography (CT) showed images related to interstitial pneumonia and the subsequent nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive deterioration of the senses associated with areflexic flaccid tetraplegia. The treatment with high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) led to the immediate improvement of the general conditions and a partial response in terms of recovery of the upper limb and of the distal lower limb movements.

Although there are many deep learning methods used for detecting the face masks, there are few lightweight detectors having a good effect on small or medium-size face masks detection in the complicated environments. Methods: In this work we propose an efficient and lightweight detection method based on YOLOv4-tiny, and a face mask detection and monitoring system for mask wearing status. Two feasible improvement strategies, network structure optimization and K-means++ clustering algorithm, are utilized for improving the detection accuracy on the premise of ensuring the real-time face masks recognition. Particularly, the improved residual module and cross fusion module are designed to aim at extracting the features of small or medium-size targets effectively. Moreover, the enhanced dual attention mechanism and the improved spatial pyramid pooling module are employed for merging sufficiently the deep and shallow semantic information and expanding the receptive field. Afterwards, the detection accuracy is compensated through the combination of activation functions. Finally, the depthwise separable convolution module is used to reduce the quantity of parameters and improve the detection efficiency. Our proposed detector is evaluated on a public face mask dataset, and an ablation experiment is also provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, which is compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models as well. Results: Our proposed detector increases the AP (average precision) values in each category of the public face mask dataset compared with the original YOLOv4-tiny. The mAP (mean average precision) is improved by 4.56% and the speed reaches 92.81 FPS. Meanwhile, the quantity of parameters and the FLOPs (floating-point operations) are reduced by 1/3, 16.48%, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed detector achieves better overall detection performance compared with other SOTA detectors for real-time mask detection, demonstrated the superiority with both theoretical value and practical significance. The developed system also brings greater flexibility to the application of face mask detection in hospitals, campuses, communities, etc.","output":"SMD-YOLO: an efficient and lightweight detection method for mask wearing status during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On April 7th 2021 the UK regulator recommended against delivering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine (AZ vaccine) to those under-30 if an alternative vaccine could be offered instead.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus, has shown promise as a vaccine vector for mammals. Here, we generated a recombinant avirulent NDV La Sota strain expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) and evaluated its potential to serve as a vaccine against rabies. The recombinant virus, rL-RVG, retained its high-growth property in chicken eggs, with titers of up to 10?? 50% egg infective doses (EID??)/ml of allantoic fluid. RVG expression enabled rL-RVG to spread from cell to cell in a rabies virus-like manner, and RVG was incorporated on the surface of the rL-RVG viral particle. RVG incorporation did not alter the trypsin-dependent infectivity of the NDV vector in mammalian cells. rL-RVG and La Sota NDV showed similar levels of sensitivity to a neutralization antibody against NDV and similar levels of resistance to a neutralization antibody against rabies virus. Animal studies demonstrated that rL-RVG is safe in several species, including cats and dogs, when administered as multiple high doses of recombinant vaccine. Intramuscular vaccination with rL-RVG induced a substantial rabies virus neutralization antibody response and provided complete protection from challenge with circulating rabies virus strains. Most importantly, rL-RVG induced strong and long-lasting protective neutralization antibody responses to rabies virus in dogs and cats. A low vaccine dose of 10?3 EID?? completely protected dogs from challenge with a circulating strain of rabies virus for more than a year.

Aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood, but probably include dietary issues, perhaps relating to overfeeding, feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum, or conditions which effect decreased gut motility. Fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome. The calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea, and the abdomen became distended and painful. In spite of intensive therapy, the calf died 48 h after birth. At necropsy, the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid, and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic.

Patients with MIS-C have been reported to have cardiac involvement and clinical features overlapping with other acute inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki-Disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. MIS-C may follow Covid-19 infection, most of the time after its asymptomatic form, even though it can lead to serious and life-threatening illness. CASE SUMMARY: In this case series, we discuss two cases of young adults with no former medical history who fit with the criteria defined in MIS-C. They both developed a refractory cardiogenic shock and required intensive care treatment including mechanical circulatory support, specifically the use of venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). They were both treated early with intravenous immune globulin and adjunctive high-dose steroids. They recovered ad integrum in less than two weeks. DISCUSSION: MIS-C occurs 2 to 4 weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients with MIS-C should ideally be managed in an intensive care environment since rapid clinical deterioration may occur. It would be preferable to have a multi-disciplinary care to improve outcomes. Patients should be monitored for shock. Elucidating the mechanism of this new entity may have importance for understanding COVID-19 far beyond the patients who have had MIS-C to date. The pathogenesis seems to involve post-infectious immune dysregulation so early administration intravenous immune globulin associated to corticosteroids appears appropriate. It implies early recognition of the syndrome even in young adults.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome-related refractory cardiogenic shock in adults after COVID-19 infection: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral diseases account for an increasing proportion of deaths worldwide.

Mice lacking Pum2 or overexpressing human TDP-43 show apparent motorization of layers IV and V of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), characterized by dramatic expansion of cells co-expressing Sox5 and Bcl11b/Ctip2, a hallmark of subcerebral projection neurons, at the expense of cells expressing the layer IV neuronal marker Ror. Moreover, retrograde labeling experiments with cholera toxin B in Pum2; Emx1-Cre and TDP43(A315T) mice revealed a corresponding increase in subcerebral connectivity of these neurons in S1. Intriguingly, other key features of somatosensory area identity are largely preserved, suggesting that Pum2 and TDP-43 may function in a downstream program, rather than controlling area identity per se. Transfection of primary neurons and in utero electroporation (IUE) suggest cell-autonomous and post-mitotic modulation of Sox5, Bcl11b/Ctip2, and Ror levels. Mechanistically, we find that Pum2 and TDP-43 directly interact with and affect the translation of mRNAs encoding Sox5, Bcl11b/Ctip2, and Ror. In contrast, effects on the levels of these mRNAs were not detectable in qRT-PCR or single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization assays, and we also did not detect effects on their splicing or polyadenylation patterns. Our results support the notion that post-transcriptional regulatory programs involving translational regulation and mediated by Pum2 and TDP-43 contribute to elaboration of area-specific neuronal identity and connectivity in the neocortex.","output":"Pum2 and TDP-43 refine area-specific cytoarchitecture post-mitotically and modulate translation of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb mRNAs in developing mouse neocortex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for tissue oxygenation can improve the survival of patients with life-threatening respiratory distress syndrome or cardiac failure. Current Concepts: Recently, the use of ECMO in acute respiratory distress syndrome has first been reported by a multicenter randomized controlled trial, known as the conventional ventilation or ECMO for severe adult respiratory failure trial. The ECMO application is dramatically increasing with the increasing number of patients experiencing acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. In this review, we explain the indications of the ECMO application and ECMO-associated complications.

In the first scenario: no control measures are put into place, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Algeria is 2.1, the number of new cases in Algeria will peak from around late May to early June and up to 82% of the Algerian population will likely contract the coronavirus. In the second scenario, at a certain date T, drastic control measures are taken, people are being advised to self-isolate or to quarantine and will be able to leave their homes only if necessary. We use SEIR model with fast change between fully protected and risky states. We prove that the final size of the epidemic depends strongly on the cumulative number of cases at the date when we implement intervention and on the fraction of the population in confinement.

METHODS: Multistage cluster sampling was used in a cross-sectional study to recruit 1309 HCWs from two academic hospitals in the Eastern Cape, South Africa over 6 weeks in November and December 2020. Prior test results for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and participants characteristics were recorded while a blood sample was drawn for detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The primary outcome measure was the SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence rate, defined as the combined total of positive results for either PCR or IgG antibodies, divided by the total sample. The secondary outcome was significant risk factors associated with infection. RESULTS: Of the total participants included in the analysis (n=1295), the majority were women (81.5%), of black race (78.7%) and nurses (44.8%). A total of 390 (30.1%) HCWs had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 488 (37.7%), yielding a cumulative incidence of 47.2% (n=611). In the adjusted logistic regression model, being overweight (adjusted OR (aOR)=2.15, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.20), obese (aOR=1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.85) and living with HIV (aOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.08) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no significant difference in infection rates between high, medium and low COVID-19 exposure working environments. CONCLUSIONS: The high SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence in the cohort was surprising this early in the epidemic and probably related to exposure both in and outside the hospitals. To mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs, infection prevention and control strategies should target community transmission in addition to screening for HIV and metabolic conditions.","output":"Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and associated risk factors among healthcare workers: a cross-sectional study in the Eastern Cape, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seismic measuring stations do not only record seismic waves.

While coronaviruses have been known to infect animals for decades, the true intermediate host of the virus has not been identified, with no cases of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals. The screening of wild, farmed, and domesticated animals is necessary to help us understand the virus and its origins and prevent future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.

Converted surgeries and patients with appendiceal abscess or concomitant intestinal obstruction were excluded. A total of 259 children underwent appendectomy with either two (35 %) or three (65 %) laparoscopic trocars according to the surgeons' preference and intraoperative judgment. Patient demographics, clinical symptoms, surgery characteristics, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS The mean age of the children was 10.4 years (range, 1-14 years). The mean follow-up time was 41.2 months (SD  29.2). No significant differences in age, gender, weight, or signs and symptoms were found between the two- and three-trocar groups. The mean surgery time was significantly shorter in the two-trocar group (47 min) than in the three-trocar group (66 min; p < 0.001). The rates of surgical complications were 2 % vs. 4 %, (p = 0.501), and the rates of postoperative complications were 0 % vs. 5 % (p = 0.054), in the two- and three-trocar groups.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate seropositivity among HCWs and to compare available variables with seropositivity to understand the factors affecting seropositivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A serosurveillance among HCWs was carried out using population proportion sampling during the second half of October 2020 in the city of Ahmedabad using the Covid-Kavach (immunoglobulin G [IgG] ELISA Antibody testing kit). Simple proportions and appropriate statistical tests were used as needed. RESULTS: As on October' 2020, HCWs in Ahmedabad demonstrated a seropositivity of 20.84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.00C22.81%). Seropositivity among HCWs was lower than that of the general population (24.20%) which was estimated as part of the same study. Female HCWs had higher seropositivity 22.14% (95% CI 19.74C24.74%) as compared to 18.82% (95% CI 16.06C21.93%) among male HCWs and the difference was statistically not significant (Z = 1.66, P = 0.097).

The flipped classroom design organizes learning in such a way that the lower-order thinking such as memorization is expected at the individual student level in the form of homework and the higher-order thinking including application and analysis occurs in the classroom in the presence of the instructor. With the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, instructors and students were given no time to adjust to the remote educational set up. Flipped teaching, like most other instructional modalities, had to be transformed into an online platform. The present study assessed the effectiveness of FT in a remote setting in a graduate-level physiology course (n=33). The course content included lecture videos, slides, and reading assignments which were made available on BlackBoard, the Learning Management System. Students were expected to have reviewed the assigned content prior to the virtual synchronous sessions. During the synchronous meeting, a question-answer (Q&A) session allowed students to review the content yet again. Followed by the Q&A session, an individual quiz, containing lower-order questions, was given to assess student preparation. Soon after the review of the quiz, students in small groups (4-5 students per group) were allowed to use breakout rooms to complete a set of questions which were designed at the higher order of Bloom's taxonomy and expected students to apply knowledge, analyze or synthesize their collaborative responses. The answers to these questions were reviewed during the first part of the following synchronous session where students were selected randomly to answer these questions which prompted them to come prepared. Student surveys were administered at the beginning and the end of the course to assess their knowledge gain, perception of the remote FT format, and confidence in completing the course.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of measuring synovial fluid interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels for identifying PJI of the shoulder. METHODS Thirty-two consecutive patients evaluated for pain at the site of a shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively enrolled from November 2012 to September 2013 and underwent revision surgery (thirty-five procedures during which samples were obtained for synovial fluid IL-6 analysis). Cases were categorized into infection (n = 15) and no-infection (n = 20) groups on the basis of objective preoperative and intraoperative findings. Twenty patients treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were also enrolled to serve as a non-infected control group. Synovial fluid was obtained through aspiration intraoperatively for all patients, as well as preoperatively for some. Synovial fluid IL-6 levels were measured with use of a cytokine immunoassay that utilizes electrochemiluminescent detection. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the diagnostic utility of synovial fluid IL-6 analysis. RESULTS Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, synovial fluid IL-6 measurement had an area under the curve of 0.891 with an ideal cutoff value of 359.3 pg/mL. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 87%, 90%, 8.45, and 0.15, respectively. Seven patients who underwent a single-stage revision had negative results on standard perioperative testing, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, but multiple positive intraoperative tissue cultures. The level of synovial fluid IL-6 was elevated in five of these seven patients, with a median value of 1400 pg/mL. Intraoperative synovial fluid IL-6 values correlated well with preoperative IL-6 synovial fluid values (correlation = 0.61; p = 0.025) and frozen-section histologic findings (p < 0.001). Synovial fluid IL-6 levels were also significantly elevated in patients with Propionibacterium acnes infection (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Measurement of synovial fluid IL-6 levels is more sensitive and specific than current preoperative testing for predicting positive cultures for patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.

There are fewer articles addressing the validity of conducting virtual assessments, particularly standardized assessment of oral language and literacy abilities in children. In addition, there is a lack of practical, useful recommendations available to support clinicians and researchers on how to conduct these assessment measures virtually. Given the recent rapid rise in virtual care and research as a result of the Coronavirus-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers require guidance on best practices for virtual administration of these tools imminently. This article seeks to fill this gap in the literature by providing such recommendations. METHODS: We (a) completed a narrative review of the extant literature, and (b) conducted semi-structured interviews with a group of 12 clinicians, students and researchers who had administered standardized language and literacy assessments with a variety of monolingual and multilingual school-aged children, with and without speech and language difficulties, in clinical and research settings. Six themes: candidacy for virtual assessment, communication and collaboration with caregivers, technology and equipment, virtual administration, ethics, consent and confidentiality, and considerations for bilingual populations were identified as a result of these two processes and were used to develop a set of recommendations to guide the use of standardized assessments in a virtual setting. In line with the Guidelines International Network, these recommendations were rated by group members, and reviewed by external stakeholders. A quasi-Delphi consensus procedure was used to reach agreement on ratings for recommendations.

Furthermore, the nature of antibodies (Abs) directed against viral antigens beyond the spike protein or endemic coronavirus antigens and their associations with disease severity and outcomes remain poorly defined. We performed deep molecular profiling of Abs directed against a wide range of antigenic specificities in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. The profiles consisted of canonical (S, RBD, N) and non-canonical (orf3a, orf8, nsp3, nps13 and M) antigenic specificities. Notably, multivariate machine learning (ML) models, generated using profiles of Abs directed against canonical or non-canonical antigens, were equally discriminative of recovery and mortality COVID-19 outcomes. In both ML models, survivors were associated with increased virus-specific IgA and IgG3 antibodies and with higher antigen-specific antibody galactosylation. Intriguingly, pre-pandemic healthy controls had cross-reactive Abs directed against nsp13 which is a conserved protein in other alpha and beta coronaviruses. Notably, higher levels of nsp13-specific IgA antibodies were associated with recovery in severe COVID-19. In keeping with these findings, a model built on Ab profiles for endemic coronavirus antigens was also predictive of COVID-19 outcome bifurcation, with higher levels of IgA and IgG3 antibodies against OC43 S and NL63 S being associated with survival.

Our study focused on the potential therapeutic value of CD151 downregulation in improving current anti-adhesion molecule therapies. METHODS: Lentivirus intracerebroventricular administration was conducted to inhibit the CD151 expression and observe its functional influence on neurological injuries and outcomes. Then, immunohistochemistry and myeloperoxidase activity assessment were performed to explore the effects of CD151 expression on neutrophil and monocyte recruitment after rat cerebral ischemia. Primary rat brain microvascular endothelial cells were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation to elucidate the underlying working mechanisms between CD151 and VCAM-1. RESULTS: The CD151 downregulation remarkably reduced neurological injuries and improved neurological outcomes, which were accompanied with reduced neutrophil and monocyte infiltration after the CD151 downregulation. The VCAM-1 expression was remarkably decreased among the adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell responsible for neutrophil and monocyte infiltration. The activation of p38 MAPK and NF-B pathways was restricted after the CD151 downregulation. p38 MAPK and NF-B inhibitors decreased the VCAM-1 expression, and p38 acted as an upstream regulator of NF-B. However, CD151 downregulation did not directly influence the neutrophil and monocyte activation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, CD151 regulated the expression of adhesion molecules.

METHODS. We linked 4 national registries to retrospectively identify laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths within 28 d in England between September 1, 2020, and August 31, 2021, comparing unvaccinated adult SOT recipients and those who had received 2 doses of ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 vaccine. Infection incidence rate ratios were adjusted for recipient demographics and calendar month using a negative binomial regression model, with 95% confidence intervals. Case fatality rate ratios were adjusted using a Cox proportional hazards model to generate hazard ratio (95% confidence interval). RESULTS. On August 31, 2021, it was found that 3080 (7.1%) were unvaccinated, 1141 (2.6%) had 1 vaccine dose, and 39 260 (90.3%) had 2 vaccine doses. There were 4147 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 407 deaths (unadjusted case fatality rate 9.8%). The risk-adjusted infection incidence rate ratio was 1.29 (1.03-1.61), implying that vaccination was not associated with reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the hazard ratio for death within 28 d of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.80 (0.63-1.00), a 20% reduction in risk of death in vaccinated patients (P = 0.05). Two doses of ChAdOx1-S were associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.69; 0.52-0.92), whereas vaccination with BNT162b2 was not (0.97; 0.71-1.31). CONCLUSIONS. Vaccination of SOT recipients confers some protection against SARS-CoV-2Crelated mortality, but this protection is inferior to that achieved in the general population. SOT recipients require additional protective measures, including further vaccine doses, antiviral drugs, and nonpharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Real-world Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S Vaccines Against SARS-CoV-2 in Solid Organ and Islet Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to bridge the digital gender divide in information and communication technology (ICT) education and field by reflecting the alumni opinions on gender equality in the ICT context.

The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a number of challenges to effectively deliver practical content online and remotely, whilst still meeting intended learning outcomes, accreditation requirements, and attaining a high level of student engagement and experience. The MSc Forensic Science programme featured in this study is a one-year degree programme with a strong emphasis on the practical elements of forensic science, and a diverse international student cohort. Therefore, the restrictions associated with the pandemic made it very difficult not only to plan the delivery of material but also to adapt the content itself for effective online and remote learning. By focusing on the intended learning outcomes, a number of innovative teaching practices were developed to successfully transition from face-to-face teaching to online and remote delivery. A range of online and practical resources were developed, including a laboratory home kit, demonstration videos, online practical technique simulations (produced by Learning Science), data analysis tasks, and interactive workshops and activities, all designed to consolidate student learning and build confidence, in preparation for such a time that on campus practical teaching could resume. The initial feedback received from these activities from both staff and students was extremely positive and the transition from classroom to online teaching was a success, as reflected in student attainment and later student feedback. Students reported that they had a better understanding of what was expected of them, including knowledge of protocols and techniques, and felt much more confident moving into the next stage of their learning development. Even though the practical laboratory sessions were the most significantly affected by the restrictions associated with the pandemic, and resulted in reduced interaction for the students, this was counteracted by virtual sessions and workshops, which gave students the opportunity to engage with each other and communicate their thoughts and opinions, ultimately building key presentation and group working skills. This case study will detail the pivot to remote learning, as well as critically evaluating the feedback from students and discussing the changes that are likely to be retained as longer-term teaching practices, versus those that were a necessary temporary addition or adjustment in response to the pandemic.","output":"Lockdown labs: pivoting to remote learning in forensic science higher education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are high risks of infection for surgeons during the face-to-face COVID-19 swab sampling due to the novel coronavirus's infectivity. To address this issue, we propose a flexible transoral robot with a teleoperated configuration for swab sampling.

A 3-prismatic-universal (3-PU) flexible parallel mechanism with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) is used to realize the manipulator's movements. The flexibility of the manipulator improves the safety of testees. Besides, the master device is similar to the manipulator in structure. It is easy to use for operators. Under the guidance of the vision from the endoscope, the surgeon can operate the master device to control the swab's motion attached to the manipulator for sampling. In this paper, the robotic system, the workspace, and the operation procedure are described in detail. The tongue depressor, which is used to prevent the tongue's interference during the sampling, is also tested. The accuracy of the manipulator under visual guidance is validated intuitively.

ES cells' growth, viability, and differentiation in vitro were evaluated when they were enclosed in solid or liquefied core APA microcapsules. In comparison with those microcapsules with solid cores, the liquefied capsules provided a more suitable culture environment for the growth of ES cells.

In contrast to the prolonged lag phase in vitro, ES cells encapsulated grew much faster in vivo. Typical markers for the undifferentiated ES cells, such as AP, SSEA-1, and Oct-4 gene, were also tracked by immunochemistry and RT-PCR. Results showed that expression of markers remained high over 2 weeks of culture in vitro. However, decreased expression of markers was found in those samples in vivo with time passage.

The survey assessed COVID-19 prevention behaviors and health-related social needs. Responses to How often do you feel lonely or isolated from those around you? were used to create a dichotomous social isolation dependent variable. The main independent variable, family/community support, was based on responses to the validated question \\"If for any reason you need help with day-to-day activities such as bathing, preparing meals, shopping, managing finances, etc., do you get the help you need?\\" Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for socioeconomic status, medical conditions, positive COVID test (for self or family), COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and emergency preparedness levels was used. RESULTS: Limited family/community support was strongly associated with social isolation (OR=6.2; p<0.01), as was having any chronic condition (OR=2.9, p=0.02).

This need is due to difficulties in vaccine manufacturing and distribution, vaccine hesitancy, and, critically, the increased prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with greater contagiousness or reduced sensitivity to immunity. Antibodies from eggs of hens (immunoglobulin Y; IgY) that were administered receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were developed as nasal drops to capture the virus on the nasal mucosa. Although initially raised against the 2019 novel coronavirus index strain (2019-nCoV), these anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgY surprisingly had indistinguishable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding against variants of concern that have emerged, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529). This is distinct for sera from immunized or convalescent patients. Culture neutralization titers against available Alpha, Beta, and Delta were also indistinguishable from the index SARS-CoV-2 strain.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the hospital course for COVID-19 patients with dementia to an aging cohort without dementia in a large New York City academic medical center. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study describing all consecutive patients age 65 or older with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 6 and April 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were evaluated, including 116 (21.8%) with previously diagnosed dementia, and 415 without dementia. Patients with dementia had higher mortality (50.0%versus 35.4%, pa??=a??0.006); despite similar comorbidities and complications, multivariate analysis indicated the association was dependent on age, sex, comorbidities, and code status. Patients with dementia more often presented with delirium (36.2%versus 11.6%, pa??<a??0.001) but less often presented with multiple other COVID-19 symptoms, and these findings remained after adjusting for age and sex.

The study used group-based semi-structured interviews to collaborate with keystone elderly participants who had profound knowledge and lived experiences about observed changes in their local environment (n = 13). These participants were identified through theoretical sampling from four remote Indigenous villages of Mbire District in Zimbabwe. The purpose of the study was to identify indicators of climate change impacts from communities believed not to have been much influenced by the scientific construct of climate change. Results revealed that the locals have a keen interest to closely observe changes occurring in their environment, including finer accounts of experiences with climatic events, owing to their predominantly climate-sensitive livelihoods. These results corroborate existing evidence about a warmer and drier climate and the reported increase in the frequency and severity of drought as well as floods in the area, and add finer details to the changes in ecological, hydrological and human systems, which are not sufficiently reported in existing climate impact studies. We also flagged new observations in biological systems as pointers for further intensive investigation.

A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1C40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","output":"Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial involvement has been described during previous SARS and MERS outbreaks.

In settings of low disease prevalence, such as asymptomatic community testing, national guidelines recommend molecular confirmation of positive Ag-RDT results. This often requires patients to be recalled for repeat specimen recollection and subsequent testing in reference laboratories. This project assessed the use of a point-of-care molecular method for SARS-CoV-2 detection on-site at a volunteer-led asymptomatic community testing site, using the residual test buffer (RTB) from positive Ag-RDTs. MethodsThe Abbott COVID-19 ID NOW assay was performed on RTB from two Ag-RDTs: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device and the BTNX Rapid Response COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device. All RTBs were tested using real-time RT-PCR at a reference laboratory using the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit which was used to assign positive Ag-RDTs results as true or false positives. Analytical specificity of the ID NOW was assessed with a panel of various respiratory organisms. ResultsOf 419 positive Ag-RDTs from 5148 tests performed, ID NOW testing of the RTB was positive in 100% of the samples characterized as true positives by RT-PCR. No SARS-CoV-2 detections by ID NOW were observed from 10 specimens characterized as false positive Ag-RDTs, or from contrived specimens with various respiratory organisms. ConclusionsThe use of on-site molecular testing on RTB provides a suitable option for rapid confirmatory testing of positive Ag-RDTs, thereby obviating the need for specimen recollection for molecular testing at local reference laboratories.","output":"Avoiding false positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test results with point-of-care molecular testing on residual test buffer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To summarise the unfolding of the COVID-19 epidemic among slum dwellers and different social strata in the city of Buenos Aires during the first 20 weeks after the first reported case. DESIGN: Observational study using a time-series analysis. Natural experiment in a big city. SETTING: Population of the city of Buenos Aires and the integrated health reporting system records of positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 tests. PARTICIPANTS: Records from the Argentine Integrated Health Reporting System for all persons with suspected and RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between 31 January and 14 July 2020. OUTCOMES: To estimate the effects of living in a slum on the standardised incidence rate of COVID-19, corrected Poisson regression models were used. Additionally, the impact of socioeconomic status was performed using an ecological analysis at the community level. RESULTS: A total of 114 052 people were tested for symptoms related with COVID-19. Of these, 39 039 (34.2%) were RT-PCR positive. The incidence rates for COVID-19 towards the end of the 20th week were 160 (155 to 165) per 100 000 people among the inhabitants who did not reside in the slums (n=2 841 997) and 708 (674 to 642) among slums dwellers (n=233 749). Compared with the better-off socioeconomic quintile (1.00), there was a linear gradient on incidence rates: 1.36 (1.25 to 1.46), 1.61 (1.49 to 1.74), 1.86 (1.72 to 2.01), 2.94 (2.74 to 3.16) from Q2 to Q5, respectively. Slum dwellers were associated with an incidence rate of 14.3 (13.4 to 15.4). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of the epidemic is socially conditioned. Slum dwellers are at a much higher risk than the rest of the community.

Effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil using target-controlled infusion (TCI) has been evaluated in previous studies. Recent studies revealed the existence of sex-related differences in remifentanil Ce in young and elderly patients. Thus, there was the need to re-evaluate the effect of age in single sex. We investigated the remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough in young and elderly male patients and evaluated the age-related differences. Patients and methods In total, 25 young (ages between 20 and 50 years) and 24 elderly (ages between 65 and 75 years) male patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Anesthesia was implemented with remifentanil using TCI and sevoflurane. The remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough was estimated for each group using Dixon's up-and-down method and isotonic regression method with a bootstrapping approach. Results The remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough in 50% (EC50) and 95% (EC95) of the patients was comparable between the young and elderly patients. Isotonic regression demonstrated that the EC50 (83% confidence interval [CI]) of remifentanil was 2.56 (2.39-2.75) ng/mL in the young patients and 2.15 (1.92-2.5) ng/mL in the elderly patients. The EC95 (95% CI) of remifentanil was 3.33 (2.94-3.46) ng/mL in the young patients and 3.41 (3.18-3.48) ng/mL in the elderly patients. Dixon's up-and-down method also demonstrated that the EC50 was comparable between the two groups (2.690.32 ng/mL vs 2.390.38 ng/mL, P=0.132).

This work uses a Model-Based Meta-Analysis (MBMA) to relate, across species, immunogenicity to peak viral load (VL) after challenge and to clinical efficacy. Together with non-clinical and/or early clinical immunogenicity data (ECID), this enables prediction of a candidate vaccines clinical efficacy. The goal of this work was to enable the accelerated development of vaccine candidates by supporting Go/No-Go and study design decisions, and the resulting MBMA can be instrumental in decisions not to progress candidates to late stage development. METHODS: A literature review with pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria enabled creation of a database including nonclinical serum neutralizing titers (SN), peak VL after challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (VL), along with data from several clinical vaccine candidates. Rhesus Macaque (RM) and golden hamster (GH) were selected (due to availability and consistency of data) for MBMA modeling. For both RM and GH, peak post-challenge VL in lung and nasal tissues were used as surrogates for clinical disease and were related to pre-challenge SN via the MBMA. The VL predictions from the RM MBMA were scaled to incidence rates in humans, with a scaling factor between RM and human SN estimated using early Phase 3 efficacy data. This enabled clinical efficacy predictions based on ECID. To qualify the models predictive power, efficacies of COVID-19 vaccine candidates were compared to those predicted from the MBMA and their respective Ph1/2 SN data. More recently available clinical data enable building a clinical MBMA; comparing this to the RM MBMA further supports SN as predictive. RESULTS: The MBMA analyses identified a sigmoidal decrease in VL (increasing protection) with increase in SN in all three species, with more SN needed (in both RM and GH) for protection in nasal swabs than in BAL (see figure). The comparison between predicted and reported clinical efficacies demonstrated the models predictive power across vaccine platforms.

Model and data visualizations have been harmonized (across tissue-types) separately for each of RM and GH using VACHER (Lommerse, et al., CPT:PSP, in press). CONCLUSION: By quantifying adjustments needed between species and assays, translational MBMA can inform development decisions by using nonclinical SN and VL, and ECID to predict protection from COVID-19.

Crush syndrome-induced acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) is considered to be mainly due to myoglobin (Mb) circulation and deposition after skeletal muscle ruptures and releases. Macrophages are the primary immune cells that fight foreign substances and play critical roles in regulating the bodys natural immune response. However, what effect does myoglobin have on macrophages and the mechanisms involved in the CS-AKI remain unclear. This study aims to look into how myoglobin affects macrophages of the CS-AKI model. C57BL/6 mice were used to construct the CS-AKI model by digital crush platform. Biochemical analysis and renal histology confirmed the successful establishment of the CS-AKI mouse model. Ferrous myoglobin was used to treat Raw264.7 macrophages to mimic the CS-AKI cell model in vitro. The macrophage polarization toward M1 type and activation of RIG-I as myoglobin sensor were verified by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western blotting (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF). Macrophage pyroptosis was observed under light microscopy. The interaction between RIG-I and caspase1 was subsequently explored by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and IF. Small interfering RNA (siRIG-I) and pyroptosis inhibitor dimethyl fumarate (DMF) were used to verify the role of macrophage polarization and pyroptosis in CS-AKI. In the kidney tissue of CS-AKI mice, macrophage infiltration and M1 type were found. We also detected that in the cell model of CS-AKI in vitro, ferrous myoglobin treatment promoted macrophages polarization to M1. Meanwhile, we observed pyroptosis, and myoglobin activated the RIG-I/Caspase1/GSDMD signaling pathway. In addition, pyroptosis inhibitor DMF not only alleviated kidney injury of CS-AKI mice but also inhibited macrophage polarization to M1 phenotype and pyroptosis via the RIG-I/Caspase1/GSDMD signaling pathway.

Among the new promising biomarkers of aPE, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) showed correlations with aPE prognosis. The aim of this study was to conduct an exploratory analysis to check the possible role of cell blood count (CBC) parameters as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of aPE in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: A case control study was conducted. Two populations were compared: (i) patients hospitalised from 31 January 2020 to 30 June 2021 with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and aPE confirmed at angio computed tomography (aCT) or pulmonary scintigraphy (COVID-19 aPE group); (ii) patients hospitalised from 31 January 2017 to 30 June 2021 without SARS-CoV-2 infection whose suspicion of aPE was excluded by aCT or pulmonary scintigraphy (no-aPE group). Results: Overall, 184 patients were included in the study, 83 in COVID-19 aPE group and 101 in no-aPE group. At the univariate analysis, COVID-19 patients with aPE had higher NLR, PLR, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than patients without aPE (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in mean platelet volume and platelet counts. No difference in mortality rate was detected. At the multivariate analysis, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were both associated with diagnostic of aPE while no CBC parameters were associated with mortality at day#7. Conclusions: Neutrophiland lymphocyte counts could be predictors of the early detection of aPE in COVID-19 patients.

We draw data from a study of asthma management in St. Louis, Missouri, and Gainesville, Florida, which included 41 caregivers, 24 children, and 12 health-care providers.

Of these, 176,640 individuals were included in the study who were aged  15 years with confirmed COVID-19 positive status who had records linked to their vaccination status. Those with incomplete or missing records were excluded (n = 38,300). Study participants were divided into three groups depending upon their vaccination status: fully vaccinated (two doses), partially vaccinated (single dose), and non-vaccinated. Study outcomes included COVID-19-related admissions to hospital general and critical care wards and death. Vaccine effectiveness for each outcome was based on the incidence density per 1000 person-years. RESULTS: The fully-, partially- and non-vaccinated groups included 62,931, 21,768 and 91,941 individuals, respectively. Based on the incidence rate ratios, the vaccine effectiveness in fully vaccinated individuals was 80%, 92%, and 97% in preventing COVID-19-related hospital admissions, critical care admissions, and death, respectively, when compared to the non-vaccinated group. No protection was observed for critical and non-critical care hospital admissions for the partially vaccinated group, while some protection against death was apparent, although statistically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: In a COVID-19 pandemic, use of the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV inactivated vaccine is effective in preventing severe disease and death in a two-dose regimen.

Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for non-Markovian dynamics.

There is a growing collection of viral outbreak films that might serve as a source of information about epidemics for popular culture consumers that warrants critical examination. As such, this paper considers the motivating factors behind engaging preventive behaviours during a disease outbreak, and the role news and popular media may have in influencing these behaviours.","output":"Public health crises in popular media: how viral outbreak films affect the publics health literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause broke out, and currently more than 150 countries around the world have been affected. Globally, as of 5: 46 pm CET, 6 November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had reported 48 534 508 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1 231 017 deaths. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most important medical challenge in decades. Previous research mainly focused on the exploration of lung changes. However, with development of the disease and deepening research, more and more patients showed cardiovascular diseases, even in those without respiratory symptoms, and some researchers have found that underlying cardiovascular diseases increase the risk of infection. Although the related mechanism is not thoroughly studied, based on existing research, we speculate that the interaction between the virus and its receptor, inflammatory factors, various forms of the stress response, hypoxic environment, and drug administration could all induce the development of cardiac adverse events. Interventions to control these pathogenic factors may effectively reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular complications. This review summarizes the latest research on the relationship between COVID-19 and its associated cardiovascular complications, and we also explore possible mechanisms and treatments.","output":"Impact of Cardiovascular Diseases on COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we are interested to forecast and predict the time evolution of the Covid-19 in Morocco based on two different time series forecasting models.

Since the discovery of this disease in late 2019, COVID-19 has become a worldwide concern, mainly due to its high degree of contagion. As of April 2021, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health Organization has already exceeded 135 million worldwide, while the number of deaths exceeds 2.9 million. Due to the impacts of the disease, efforts in the literature have intensified in terms of studying approaches aiming to detect COVID-19, with a focus on supporting and facilitating the process of disease diagnosis. This work proposes the application of texture descriptors based on phylogenetic relationships between species to characterize segmented CT volumes, and the subsequent classification of regions into COVID-19, solid lesion or healthy tissue.

The objective of the study was to investigate if U-Earth AIRcel bioreactors were effective in monitoring and improving air quality via detection, capture, and destruction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reducing the risk of transmission among healthcare workers. U-Earth AIRcel bioreactors are a demonstrated effective biomonitoring system. We implemented a methodological approach wherein they were placed at various hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in Italy. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was achieved through rapid biomonitoring testing of the solutes from the AIRcel bioreactors via SARS-CoV-2 rapid test antigen and consecutive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with the multiplex platform (XABT) and the Real-Time PCR Rotor-Gene. The marked presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in multiple water samples via the detection of ORF1ab + N and/or E gene involved in gene expression and cellular signaling of the SARS-CoV virus. The AIRcel bioreactors were able to neutralize the virus effectively as traces of the viruses were no longer found in multiple solute samples after an overnight period. Transmission of COVID-19 via bio-aerosols, transmitted by infected patients, remains a viable threat for health workers. AIRcel bioreactors allow for rapid biomonitoring testing for early virus detection within the environment, reducing the risk of exponential contagion exposure and maintaining good air quality without endangering health workers.

Some studies have explored the impact of financial strain among pregnant women, in particular, during the pandemic. However, less is known about the factors associated with pregnant womens experiences of material hardship. Methods: : This study examined the factors associated with pregnant womens experiences of material hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic using data collected from 183 pregnant womxn who participated in an online Qualtrics panel survey during January 2021. In addition to socio-demographic characteristics, individuals were asked about their finances and predictors of financial well-being, mental health symptoms, and intimate partner violence experiences. Ordinary least squares regression was used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted estimates. Study findings showed that the majority of womxn in the sample experienced at least one form of material hardship in the past year. Results: : Economic self-sufficiency, financial strain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and economic abuse were all significantly associated with material hardship. Conclusions: : Overall , findings are consistent with other studies that have documented the association between financial hardship and mental health symptoms among pregnant womxn during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a unique contribution of this study is that it highlights the significant, positive association between economic abuse, a unique form of intimate partner violence, and material hardship among pregnant womxn during the pandemic.

Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family is proposed.

These data argue that alternative immune mechanisms, beyond neutralization, may continue to confer protection against severe disease.

Thus, here we probed the ability of vaccine induced antibodies, across three COVID-19 vaccines, to drive Fc-effector activity against Omicron. Despite the significant loss of IgM, IgA and IgG binding to the Omicron Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) across BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccines, stable isotype binding was observed across all of these vaccines to the Omicron Spike. Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a significant loss of cross RBD-specific antibody Fc{gamma}-receptor binding by the CoronaVac vaccine, but preservation of RBD-specific Fc{gamma}R2a and Fc{gamma}3a binding across the mRNA vaccines. Conversely, Spike-specific antibodies exhibited persistent binding to Fc{gamma}-receptors, across all three vaccines, albeit higher binding was observed with the mRNA vaccines, marked by a selective preservation of Fc{gamma}R2a and Fc{gamma}3a binding antibodies. Thus, despite the significant to near complete loss of Omicron neutralization across several vaccine platforms against Omicron, vaccine induced Spike-specific antibodies continue to recognize the virus and recruit Fc-receptors pointing to a persistent capacity for extra-neutralizing antibodies to contribute Omicron disease attenuation.","output":"Preserved Omicron Spike specific antibody binding and Fc-recognition across COVID-19 vaccine platforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: A vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently needed.

In the phase 2 trial, 224 adults were randomized to 5 g/dose in 2 schedule groups (injections on days 0 and 14 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28], and days 0 and 21 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28]). Design, Setting, and Participants: Interim analysis of ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The trials were conducted in Henan Province, China, among 96 (phase 1) and 224 (phase 2) healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years. Study enrollment began on April 12, 2020. The interim analysis was conducted on June 16, 2020, and updated on July 27, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary safety outcome was the combined adverse reactions 7 days after each injection, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response 14 days after the whole-course vaccination, which was measured by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: Among 320 patients who were randomized (mean age, 42.8 years; 200 women [62.5%]), all completed the trial up to 28 days after the whole-course vaccination. The 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 (16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 (14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, respectively, in the phase 2 trial.

Serological response was assessed by quantifying anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, while cell-mediated response was assessed by a whole-blood test quantifying the interferon (IFN)- response to spike peptides. B-cell phenotype and IFN--specific T-cell responses were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results After 6 months, anti-RBD antibodies were still detectable in 91.4% of RA patients, although we observed a significant reduction of the titer in patients under Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-Ig [median: 16.4 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml, interquartile range (IQR): 11.3C44.3, p < 0.0001] or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- inhibitors (median: 26.5 BAU/ml, IQR: 14.9C108.8, p = 0.0034) compared to controls (median: 152.7 BAU/ml, IQR: 89.3C260.3). All peripheral memory B-cell (MBC) subpopulations, in particular, the switched IgG+ MBCs (CD19+CD27+IgD-IgM-IgG+), were significantly reduced in RA subjects under CTLA-4-Ig compared to those in HCWs (p = 0.0012). In RA patients, a significantly reduced anti-RBD IgG titer was observed at T6 vs. T1, mainly in those treated with CTLA-4-Ig (p = 0.002), interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors (p = 0.015), and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  corticosteroids (CCSs) (p = 0.015). In contrast, a weak nonsignificant reduction of the T-cell response was reported at T6 vs. T1. T-cell response was found in 65.7% of the RA patients at T6, with lower significant magnitude in patients under CTLA-4-Ig compared to HCWs (p < 0.0001).

But, what if the LSAT is a faulty coupling that presents a major leak in the education pipeline? This standardize test has revealed years of racial bias from the disturbing score gaps between white and minority applicants. The LSAT has shown to have test biases within the questions that appear in the form of language interpretation, which contains culturally stereotypic language, situations, and structural components. As a result of these biases, there has been a disproportionate amount of lower scores by minorities, which hinders the chances of being accepted into law school. Thus, presenting a leak in the education pipeline that disconnects minorities from achieving their dreams of practicing law. Because of COVID-19, the Law School Admission Council is offering the LSAT online, remotely proctored in place of being in-person. This unexpected change should bring discussion in todays society about the overreliance on LSAT performance. Institutions should develop new and equitable means to evaluate an applicants ability to do well in law school, without disproportionately excluding minorities. Without admission modifications, minorities will continue to remain at a disadvantage when applying to law school.","output":"Recognizing Another Black Barrier: The LSAT Contributes to the Diversity Gap in the Legal Profession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of November 2020, the United States leads the world in confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths. Over the past 10 months, the United States has experienced three peaks in new cases, with the most recent spike in November setting new records. Inaction and the lack of a scientifically informed, unified response have contributed to the sustained spread of COVID-19 in the United States. This paper describes major events and findings from the domestic response to COVID-19 from January to November 2020, including on preventing transmission, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, ensuring sufficient physical infrastructure and healthcare workforce, paying for services, and governance. We further reflect on the public health response to-date and analyse the link between key policy decisions (e.g. closing, reopening) and COVID-19 cases in three states that are representative of the broader regions that have experienced spikes in cases. Finally, as we approach the winter months and undergo a change in national leadership, we highlight some considerations for the ongoing COVID-19 response and the broader United States healthcare system. These findings describe why the United States has failed to contain COVID-19 effectively to-date and can serve as a reference in the continued response to COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"United States response to the COVID-19 pandemic, JanuaryCNovember 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of COVID-19 patients is still growing exponentially worldwide due to the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therapeutic agents currently under investigation are antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other adjuvants that could relieve symptoms or improve the healing process. In this review, twelve therapeutic agents that could play a role in prophylaxis or improvement of the COVID-19-associated symptoms (as add-on substances) are discussed. Agents were identified based on their known pharmacologic mechanism of action in viral and/or nonviral fields and are postulated to interact with one or more of the seven known mechanisms associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus: (i) regulation of the immune system; (ii) virus entrance in the cell; (iii) virus replication; (iv) hyperinflammation; (v) oxidative stress; (vi) thrombosis; and (vii) endotheliitis. Selected agents were immune transfer factor (oligo- and polypeptides from porcine spleen, ultrafiltered at <10 kDa; Imuno TF?), anti-inflammatory natural blend (Uncaria tomentosa, Endopleura uchi and Haematoccocus pluvialis; Miodesin?), zinc, selenium, ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, ferulic acid, spirulina, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine sulfate potassium hydrochloride, trans-resveratrol, and maltodextrin-stabilized orthosilicic acid (SiliciuMax?).

Drawing on Niklas Luhmanns systems theory, we propose a model of the food system defined by the relational process of feeding itself; that is, the food system is made of feeding and only feeding, and system structures are produced by the coupling of that process to its various contexts. We argue that this approach moves us away from understandings of the food system that take structures and relations as given, and sees them instead as contingent, thereby helping to identify leverage points for food system change.

CNWL is a large NHS provider and has approximately 7000 staff working across 150 locations, providing mental health and community health services. In response to the need to share learning across the organisation, a trustwide Safety Conversation Day took place to spotlight the work being done to promote safety and to act as a platform to share ideas and learning across the trust. This was the first ever virtual conference organised by the trust. Method The one-day conference included virtual posters and an all-day open access virtual conversation delivered via zoom. The day was divided into 6 safety themes: Safety tools;Safer Environments;Supporting and Involving Staff;Safer use of Medicines;See Think Act and Relational Security;and Prevention is Better than Cure. Frontline staff delivered 5-6 short presentations each hour highlighting new ways of working, quality improvement, local research etc. Staff were also encouraged to submit posters for the event, with webinars held on how to write a poster held prior to the safety conversation to promote engagement. Prizes were awarded for best posters in the different categories. A mentimeter survey was running throughout the day to get feedback from participants. Result This was the largest event of this kind held by the trust. 430 unique viewers logged in during the day to watch the presentations. Feedback was very positive on the mentimeter survey. 3 questions were asked on a likert scale of: Strongly Disagree C Strongly Agree (rated out of 5): I found the posters really useful': 4.5/5 I found the presentations very useful': 4.6/5 I will share what I've learnt about safety': 4.6/5Open space questions and word cloud responses also highlighted qualitative feedback with most frequent responses including inspiring', interesting and stimulating. 174 posters were presented with good representation from all services and staff groups across the trust (18 on safer use of medicines, 15 on co-production, 52 on quality improvement, 50 on COVID and non-COVID safety, 16 on use of technology, 23 on supporting and involving staff).

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) are considered a possible treatment option. We aimed to evaluate the outcome and potential harmful cardiac effects of AZT+HCQ compared to HCQ alone for COVID-19 treatment. Methods: : Pubmed, Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched using appropriate keywords and identified six studies using PRISMA guidelines. The quantitative synthesis was performed using fixed and random effects for the pooling of studies. Result: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the risk of mortality (RR 1.16;0.92-1.46) and adverse cardiac events (OR 1.06;0.82-1.37) demonstrated a small increment though of no significance. There are no increased odds of mechanical ventilation (OR 0.84;0.33-2.15) and significant QTc prolongation (OR 0.84, 0.59-1.21). Neither the critical QTc threshold (OR 1.92, CI 0.81-4.56) nor absolute QTc 60ms (OR 1.95, CI 0.55-6.96) is increased to the level of statistical significance among HCQ+AZT arm compared to HCQ alone;but its slightly increased odds need to be considered in clinical practice. Conclusion: The combination of AZT+HCQ leads to small increased odds of mortality and cardiac events compared to HCQ alone. It is of no statistical significance for the critical QTc threshold and absolute QTc 60ms, but increased odds with HCQ+AZT arm need to be considered in clinical relevance. Our result does not guide against the use of combination or HCQ alone based on the present level of evidence.","output":"Is hydroxychloroquine with macrolide a good combination in COVID-19 compared to hydroxychloroquine alone from cardiac perspective?

How microtubule nucleation and polarity are regulated within neurons remains unclear. We show that -tubulin localises asymmetrically to the somatic Golgi within Drosophila neurons. Microtubules originate from the Golgi with an initial growth preference towards the axon. Their growing plus ends also turn towards and into the axon, adding to the plus-end-out microtubule pool. Any plus ends that reach a dendrite, however, do not readily enter, maintaining minus-end-out polarity. Both turning towards the axon and exclusion from dendrites depend on Kinesin-2, a plus-end-associated motor that guides growing plus ends along adjacent microtubules. We propose that Kinesin-2 engages with a polarised microtubule network within the soma to guide growing microtubules towards the axon; while at dendrite entry sites engagement with microtubules of opposite polarity generates a backward stalling force that prevents entry into dendrites and thus maintains minus-end-out polarity within proximal dendrites.","output":"Microtubules originate asymmetrically at the somatic golgi and are guided via Kinesin2 to maintain polarity within neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed in Italy at the end of January 2020, when the first positive cases for the virus were identified At the beginning of March, the virus had spread to all Italian regions and on 10 March 2020 the lockdown phase began, limiting the movement of people and prohibiting almost all commercial activities, businesses and non-essential industries As a result, millions of people were forced to stay at home, causing a drastic drop in traffic volume, which significantly changed the acoustic environment and air quality of cities On 4 May 2020, the lockdown was partially lifted and activities were progressively reopened Therefore, traffic gradually started to increase and, consequently, the noise emitted by motor vehicles This behaviour was confirmed by the data collected by the DYNAMAP system, an automatic platform developed within the LIFE DYNAMAP project, providing real time traffic noise maps in terms of sound pressure levels and impacts at receivers (people and dwellings exposed to noise level bands) In this paper traffic and non-traffic-related noise events in the cities of Rome and Milan from March to May 2020 are analysed and compared to the corresponding values in 2019 to evaluate the effects of the lockdown period ? 2020 R M Alsina Pags et al , published by De Gruyter","output":"Noise at the time of COVID 19: The impact in some areas in Rome and Milan, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The disease COVID-19 produces serious complications that can lead to cardiorespiratory arrest.

The former primarily deals with the nutritional requirements of old patients in hospitals, whereas the latter focuses on the varied food challenges of space travelers heading to deep space. Although they may seem disconnected, they both investigate similar nutritional issues. This scoping review shows what these two disciplines have in common, highlighting the mutual features between (1) pre-operative vs. pre-launch nutritional programs, (2) hospital-based vs. space station nutritional issues, and (3) post-discharge vs. deep space nutritional resilience.

However, delaying cancer treatment can cause worsening symptoms and shorten life expectancy. This study aimed to assess the outcome of cancer patients at our centre to help inform the optimal way to deliver cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study of over 4000 patients found that the delivery of cancer treatment in the first wave of the pandemic did not have a significantly negative effect on mortality. There were low COVID-19 infection (2%) and death rates (6%). As expected, there was a reduction in cancer treatments mainly in later lines of palliative treatments. This likely reflects patient and clinician choice around those more vulnerable patients. This data can be used to re-assure the continuation of cancer treatment during the pandemic. ABSTRACT: Background: This study aimed to assess the outcome of cancer patients undergoing systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT) at our centre to help inform future clinical decision-making around SACT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients receiving at least one episode of SACT for solid tumours at Guys Cancer Centre between 1 March and 31 May 2020 and the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Data were collected on demographics, tumour type/stage, treatment type (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological-targeted) and SARS-CoV2 infection. Results: A total of 2120 patients received SACT in 2020, compared to 2449 in 2019 (13% decrease). From 2019 to 2020, there was an increase in stage IV disease (62% vs. 72%), decrease in chemotherapy (42% vs. 34%), increase in immunotherapy (6% vs. 10%), but similar rates of biologically targeted treatments (37% vs. 38%). There was a significant increase in 1st and 2nd line treatments in 2020 (68% vs. 81%; p < 0.0001) and reduction in 3rd and subsequent lines (26% vs. 15%; p = 0.004) compared to 2019. Of the 2020 cohort, 2% patients developed SARS-CoV2 infections. Conclusions: These real-world data from a tertiary Cancer Centre suggest that despite the challenges faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SACT was able to be continued without any significant effects on the mortality of solid-tumour patients. There was a low rate (2%) of SARS-CoV-2 infection which is comparable to the 1.4%-point prevalence in our total cancer population.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Delivery of Systemic Anti-Cancer Treatment at Guys Cancer Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary, we discuss some possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in both established and newer democracies We expect that the pandemic will not have grave long-term effects on established democracies We assess the future of democracy after COVID-19 in terms of immediate effects on current democratic leaders, and speculate on the long-term effects on support for democratic institutions and principles We also discuss possible implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global trends in democratic backsliding We predict that, in the short term, the repercussions of the pandemic can aggravate the situation in countries that are already experiencing democratic erosion However, the long term economic effects of the pandemic may be more detrimental to non-democratic governance","output":"How Will the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Democracy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet, as a novel pathogen, knowledge of its biology is still emerging.

One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, we believe climates relationship with SARS-CoV-2 is still worth exploring, as it may have some impact on the distribution of cases. To further examine if there is a link to climate, we build model projections with raw SARS-CoV-2 case data and population-scaled case data in the USA. The case data were from across March 2020, before large travel restrictions and public health policies were impacting cases across the country. We show that SDMs built from population-scaled case data cannot be distinguished from control models (built from raw human population data), while SDMs built on raw case data fail to predict the known distribution of cases in the U.S. from March. The population-scaled analyses indicate that climate did not play a central role in early U.S. viral distribution and that human population density was likely the primary driver. We do find slightly more population-scaled viral cases in cooler areas. Ultimately, the temporal and geographic constraints on this study mean that we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the SARS-CoV-2 distribution.

The hyperinflammatory phenotype is known to be associated with increased multiorgan failure and mortality. In this study, we aimed to identify these phenotypes in COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS: In this prospective observational study done at two UK intensive care units, we recruited patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at baseline. Plasma samples were analysed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR1) using a novel point-of-care assay. A parsimonious regression classifier model was used to calculate the probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype in COVID-19 using IL-6, soluble TNFR1, and bicarbonate levels. Data from this cohort was compared with patients with ARDS due to causes other than COVID-19 recruited to a previous UK multicentre, randomised controlled trial of simvastatin (HARP-2). FINDINGS: Between March 17 and April 25, 2020, 39 patients were recruited to the study. Median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) was 18 kpa (IQR 15C21) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 12 (10C16). 17 (44%) of 39 patients had died by day 28 of the study. Compared with survivors, patients who died were older and had lower PaO(2)/FiO(2). The median probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype was 003 (IQR 001C02). Depending on the probability cutoff used to assign class, the prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype was between four (10%) and eight (21%) of 39, which is lower than the proportion of patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype in HARP-2 (186 [35%] of 539). Using the Youden index cutoff (0274) to classify phenotype, five (63%) of eight patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype and 12 (39%) of 31 with the hypoinflammatory phenotype died. Compared with matched patients recruited to HARP-2, levels of IL-6 were similar in our cohort, whereas soluble TNFR1 was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. INTERPRETATION: In this exploratory analysis of 39 patients, ARDS due to COVID-19 was not associated with higher systemic inflammation and was associated with a lower prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype than that observed in historical ARDS data. This finding suggests that the excess mortality observed in COVID-19-related ARDS is unlikely to be due to the upregulation of inflammatory pathways described by the parsimonious model.

The aim of the study was to determine whether the infection by the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii disrupts RNS balance in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. For this purpose, measurements of nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite (ONOO(?)), protein S-nitrosylation and nitration, and nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in A. thaliana roots from 1 day to 15 days post-inoculation (dpi) were performed. The cyst nematode infection caused generation of NO and ONOO(?) in the infected roots. These changes were accompanied by an expansion of S-nitrosylated and nitrated proteins. The enzyme activity of GSNOR was decreased at 3 and 15 dpi and increased at 7 dpi in infected roots, whereas the GSNOR1 transcript level was enhanced over the entire examination period. The protein content of GSNOR was increased in infected roots at 3 dpi and 7 dpi, but at 15 dpi, did not differ between uninfected and infected roots. The protein of GSNOR was detected in plastids, mitochondria, cytoplasm, as well as endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic membranes. We postulate that RNS metabolism plays an important role in plant defense against the beet cyst nematode and helps the fine-tuning of the infected plants to stress sparked by phytoparasitic nematodes.","output":"Cyst Nematode Infection Elicits Alteration in the Level of Reactive Nitrogen Species, Protein S-Nitrosylation and Nitration, and Nitrosoglutathione Reductase in Arabidopsis thaliana Roots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We have compared 38 isolates of the SARS-CoV complete genome. The main goal was twofold: first, to analyze and compare nucleotide sequences and to identify positions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertions and deletions, and second, to group them according to sequence similarity, eventually pointing to phylogeny of SARS-CoV isolates. The comparison is based on genome polymorphism such as insertions or deletions and the number and positions of SNPs. RESULTS: The nucleotide structure of all 38 isolates is presented. Based on insertions and deletions and dissimilarity due to SNPs, the dataset of all the isolates has been qualitatively classified into three groups each having their own subgroups. These are the A-group with \\"regular\\" isolates (no insertions / deletions except for 5' and 3' ends), the B-group of isolates with \\"long insertions\\", and the C-group of isolates with \\"many individual\\" insertions and deletions. The isolate with the smallest average number of SNPs, compared to other isolates, has been identified (TWH). The density distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions for each group or subgroup, as well as cumulatively for all the isolates is also presented, along with the gene map for TWH. Since individual SNPs may have occurred at random, positions corresponding to multiple SNPs (occurring in two or more isolates) are identified and presented. This result revises some previous results of a similar type. Amino acid changes caused by multiple SNPs are also identified (for the annotated sequences, as well as presupposed amino acid changes for non-annotated ones). Exact SNP positions for the isolates in each group or subgroup are presented. Finally, a phylogenetic tree for the SARS-CoV isolates has been produced using the CLUSTALW program, showing high compatibility with former qualitative classification.

People with HIV (PWH) cluster in geographically compact and densely populated areas, which does not easily lend itself to maps that use unadjusted geographic or political borders. SETTING To illustrate these challenges, we used geographic data from adult PWH at the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic (VCCC), in Nashville, Tennessee, and aggregated data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) from 1998-2015. METHODS We compared choropleth maps, which use differential shading of political/geographic boundaries, and density-adjusted cartograms, which allow for shading and deformed boundaries according to a variable of interest, such as PWH. RESULTS Cartograms enlarged high-burden areas and shrank low-burden areas of PWH, improving visual interpretation of where to focus HIV prevention and mitigation efforts compared to choropleth maps. Cartograms may also demonstrate cohort representativeness of underlying populations (e.g., Tennessee for VCCC or the United States for NA-ACCORD), which can guide efforts to assess external validity and improve generalizability.

Results Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range -0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range -0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99).

Following the lifting of restrictions, respondents engaged in less social mixing, fewer distancing and hygiene behaviors and were less likely to use face coverings. Hierarchical regressions revealed that socio-economic status, age, and gender moderated protective behaviors: while those with higher socio-economic status were more relaxed with regard to hygiene and distancing behaviors, they were more cautious about mixing with others after the end of restrictions.

Participants underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, and laboratory tests, including immune cell profiling and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Clinically suspected pericarditis was diagnosed when classic criteria were present and clinically suspected myocarditis was based on the combination of at least 2 CMR criteria. Results: Median age was 52 (41-57) years, 71.9% were women, and 16.5% were previously hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia.

The GWAS approach has been successfully applied to primary glomerular disorders, providing numerous novel insights into the genetic architecture of IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephropathy appears to have a highly complex polygenic architecture, with nearly 20 genome-wide significant loci of small to moderate effects discovered to date. In contrast, the genetic susceptibility to membranous nephropathy and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome appears to be driven by a small number of large-effect loci. The MHC locus on chromosome 6p21 is strongly associated with genetic susceptibility to all major types of immune-mediated glomerulopathies. However, a distinct set of classical HLA alleles is associated with each individual disease type, pinpointing to specific immune mechanisms underlying each of these conditions. Additional insights from the discovery of non-HLA risk loci reinforced the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of these disorders, and highlighted important susceptibility overlaps between glomerular and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite these initial successes, much larger GWAS and sequencing studies are still needed for each individual glomerular disease type. Increased power will be critical to comprehensively test for genetic effects across the full spectrum of allelic frequencies, to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and to potentially improve the performance of polygenic risk predictors.

Research Design & Methods: The study was performed by means of an online survey questionnaire conducted on 405 students at a Vietnamese university. The survey questionnaire was developed based on prior research. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to test the research model and hypotheses. Findings: The results illustrated that the fear and anxiety of Covid-19 have a negative impact on start-up self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention, while business opportunity recognition is strongly and positively correlated with entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial intention, and behaviour. In addition, entrepreneurial intention is found to be the most important antecedent to predict actual start-up behaviour whereas entrepreneurial intention significantly mediates the association between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial behaviour. Implications & Recommendations: The study offers practical contributions for both universities and policymakers to foster youths' entrepreneurial activities and manage the negative outcome of Covid-19 on students' mental health. Contribution & Value Added: This research contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by addressing the notable gap when testing the linkages between entrepreneurial intention and behaviour. Furthermore, the finding confirms that the fear and anxiety of Covid-19 can decrease entrepreneurial self-efficacy, intention, and behaviour, while business opportunity recognition fosters entrepreneurial activities.","output":"Entrepreneurial behaviour: The effects of the fear and anxiety of Covid-19 and business opportunity recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE T cells play vital roles in the development and progression of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells and immunoregulatory activity mediated by CD4+ T cells. Interleukin (IL)-9 secreting CD4+ T cells (Th9 cells) were recently found to be involved in the onset of ACS. PATIENTS AND METHODS we investigated regulatory role of Th9 cells to CD8+ T cells in patients with stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). RESULTS Circulating Th9 cells percentage, plasma IL-9 level, and PU.1 mRNA relative level was up-regulated in AMI patients compared with controls. There was no significant difference of IL-9 secreting CD8+ T cells percentage among groups. CD8+ T cells from AMI patients revealed increased cytotoxicity than those from controls, which presented as enhanced cytotolytic activity to target cells, increased interferon- and tumor necrosis factor- secretion, elevated perforin and granzyme B production, reduced programmed death-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4. IL-9 stimulation did not affect proliferation, but promoted CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity from both controls and AMI patients. IL-9-secreting CD4+ T cells were enriched in CD4+ CCR4- CCR6- CXCR3- cells. The enhancement of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity induced by CD4+ CCR4- CCR6- CXCR3- cells was dependent on IL-9 secretion. INTERPRETATION The present results indicated that up-regulation of IL-9-secreting CD4+ T cells may contribute to pathogenesis of AMI through enhancement of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.","output":"Interleukin-9-secreting CD4+ T cells regulates CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity in patients with acute coronary syndromes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the analytic form of the two-loop four-graviton scattering amplitudes in Einstein gravity.

Bariatric surgery has long been employed to treat obesity and its related comorbidities. Over time, researchers have amassed significant data to support bariatric surgery in the pursuit of treating diabetes mellitus. This review serves to introduce the most recent findings and their relation to the various bariatric surgical options as bariatric surgery will continue to cement itself in the treatment paradigm of diabetes mellitus. RECENT FINDINGS Numerous studies performed in the past 10 years have demonstrated the improvement or cessation of diabetes with bariatric surgical intervention. In comparing the vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, data demonstrate a more beneficial response of diabetes to the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and an even further exaggerated response with the biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch. The benefit has long been established, but what causes the improvement in diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery? Recent data suggest a decrease in circulating bile salts as well as changes to inflammatory markers and circulating cytokines. Furthermore, tailoring of existing surgical procedures has led to the development of the SIPS procedure, and its benefit is demonstrated in bypassing a large portion of intestine while eliminating an enteroenterostomy, helping to reduce short gut syndrome and resultant diarrhea. SUMMARY The surgical climate within the bariatric field is changing and will continue to do so in the future.

In a national sample of US adults in MayCJune 2020, we examined how both perceptions of uncertainty about COVID-19 and trait-level differences in tolerance of uncertainty arising from various sources (risk, ambiguity, and complexity) are related to vaccine hesitancy-related outcomes, including trust in COVID-19 information, COVID-19 vaccine intentions, and beliefs that COVID-19 vaccines should undergo a longer testing period before being released to the public. Overall, perceptions of COVID-19 uncertainty were not associated with trust in information, vaccine intentions, or beliefs about vaccine testing. However, higher tolerance of risk was associated with lower intentions to get vaccinated, and lower tolerance of ambiguity was associated with lower intentions to get vaccinated and preferring a longer period of vaccine testing. Critically, perceptions of COVID-19 uncertainty and trait-level tolerance for uncertainty also interacted as predicted, such that greater perceived COVID-19 uncertainty was more negatively associated with trust in COVID-19 information among individuals with lower tolerance for risk and ambiguity. Thus, although perceptions of uncertainty regarding COVID-19 may not reduce trust and vaccine hesitancy for all individuals, trait-level tolerance of uncertainty arising from various sources may have both direct and moderating effects on these outcomes.

In this article, based on the molecular division multiple access technology, we propose a novel multiuser MC system, where information molecules with different diffusion coefficients are first employed. Aiming at the user fairness in the considered system, we investigate the optimization of molecular resource allocation, including the assignment of the types of molecules and the number of molecules of a type. Specifically, three performance metrics are considered, namely, min-max fairness for error probability, max-min fairness for achievable rate, and weighted sum-rate maximization. Moreover, we propose two assignment strategies for types of molecules, i.e., best-to-best (BTB) and best-to-worst (BTW). Subsequently, for a two-user scenario, we analytically derive the optimal allocation for the number of molecules when types of molecules are fixed for all users. In contrast, for a three-user scenario, we prove that the BTB and BTW schemes with the optimal allocation for the number of molecules can provide the lower and upper bounds on system performance, respectively. Finally, numerical results show that the combination of BTW and the optimal allocation for the number of molecules yields better performance than the benchmarks.","output":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser Molecular Communication Systems Oriented to the Internet of Medical Things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered substantial economic and social disruptions.

We applied this system to study the unfolding of COVID-19 in Bahia, Brazil, also assessing the effects of varying population compliance.

Since risk perceptions vary by social identities (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, age) they are believed to influence the interpretation and likelihood of following guidance from risk-communication efforts. This study aims to understand how COVID-19 risk perceptions vary by social identity (with an emphasis upon socioeconomic factors), how such identities influence behavior adoption through risk-communication pathways, and how findings can be practically applied in messaging. Previous studies have investigated the role of social factors on risk perceptions, but SES has not been modeled as the main factor. Guided by the Health Belief Model and Social Determinant of Health Frameworks, findings from our 326 participants suggest those with high-risk COVID-19 perceptions identified as higher income and held more advanced educational degrees, suggesting a positive relationship between risk perceptions and SES. Individuals with high-risk perceptions more frequently reported practicing protective behaviors against COVID-19 and reported greater severity, susceptibility, barriers, benefits, trust, confidence, and health literacy in adopting behavior changes against the virus. When applying such findings to create a local risk-communication plan (logic model), it was found that messaging should be culturally relevant, in-plain language, and consistent to improve health literacy.

However, while JHM.WU replicates robustly and induces hepatitis, JHM.SD fails to replicate or induce pathology in the liver. These two JHM variants encode homologous proteins with few polymorphisms, and little is known about which viral proteins(s) is responsible for the liver tropism of JHM.WU. We constructed reverse genetic systems for JHM.SD and JHM.WU and, utilizing these full-length cDNA clones, constructed chimeric viruses and mapped the virulence factors involved in liver tropism. Exchanging the spike proteins of the two viruses neither increased replication of JHM.SD in the liver nor attenuated JHM.WU. By further mapping, we found that polymorphisms in JHM.WU structural protein M and nonstructural replicase proteins nsp1 and nsp13 are essential for liver pathogenesis. M protein and nsp13, the helicase, of JHM.WU are required for efficient replication in vitro and in the liver in vivo. The JHM.SD nsp1 protein contains a K194R substitution of Lys194, a residue conserved among all other MHV strains. The K194R polymorphism has no effect on in vitro replication but influences hepatotropism, and introduction of R194K into JHM.SD promotes replication in the liver. Conversely, a K194R substitution in nsp1 of JHM.WU or A59, another hepatotropic strain, significantly attenuates replication of each strain in the liver and increases IFN- expression in macrophages in culture. Our data indicate that both structural and nonstructural proteins contribute to MHV liver pathogenesis and support previous reports that nsp1 is a Betacoronavirus virulence factor. IMPORTANCE The Betacoronavirus genus includes human pathogens, some of which cause severe respiratory disease. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) into human populations demonstrates the zoonotic potential of emerging coronaviruses, and there are currently no vaccines or effective antivirals for human coronaviruses. Thus, it is important to understand the virus-host interaction that regulates coronavirus pathogenesis. Murine coronavirus infection of mice provides a useful model for the study of coronavirus-host interactions, including the determinants of tropism and virulence. We found that very small changes in coronavirus proteins can profoundly affect tropism and virulence. Furthermore, the hepatotropism of MHV-JHM depends not on the spike protein and viral entry but rather on a combination of the structural protein M and nonstructural replicase-associated proteins nsp1 and nsp13, which are conserved among betacoronaviruses. Understanding virulence determinants will aid in the design of vaccines and antiviral strategies.","output":"The nsp1, nsp13, and M proteins contribute to the hepatotropism of murine coronavirus JHM.WU."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted healthcare delivery worldwide.

The findings suggested that HKIA's passenger network has changed significantly and expanded to many new different destinations. Two regions (East Asia and Southeast Asia) were the most important markets for HKIA, and most key destinations connected by Hong Kong showed healthy growth. Nine factors could explain passenger traffic flows between Hong Kong and its key destinations: Hong Kong GDP per capita, GDP per capita of destinations connected by HKIA, distance, airport hub status of the destination airport, tourist destinations connected by HKIA, numbers of passenger airlines in service, bilateral trade flows, speaking a common language and having strong cultural/colonial links with Hong Kong, and the route presence of Cathay Pacific.","output":"Analysing passenger network changes: The case of Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The corona virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has created serious disruptions to many business operations.

We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers.

Non-intrusive and non-invasive detection methods are a basic requirement for wearable medical devices, especially when these are used in sports applications or by the elderly for self-monitoring. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) is an essential physiological parameter for health monitoring. Most blood pressure measurement devices determine the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure through the inflation and the deflation of a cuff. This technique is uncomfortable for the user and may result in anxiety, and consequently affect the blood pressure and its measurement. The purpose of this paper is the continuous measurement of the ABP through a cuffless, non-intrusive approach. The approach of this paper is based on deep learning techniques where several neural networks are used to infer ABP, starting from photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The ABP was predicted first by utilizing only PPG and then by using both PPG and ECG. Convolutional neural networks (ResNet and WaveNet) and recurrent neural networks (LSTM) were compared and analyzed for the regression task. Results show that the use of the ECG has resulted in improved performance for every proposed configuration. The best performing configuration was obtained with a ResNet followed by three LSTM layers: this led to a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.118 mmHg on and 2.228 mmHg on systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. The results comply with the American National Standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. ECG, PPG, and ABP measurements were extracted from the MIMIC database, which contains clinical signal data reflecting real measurements.

Very few cases of SARS-COV-2-related emphysema have been described, except among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The thoracic CT scan is the key examination for the diagnosis and allows to evaluate the severity of the pulmonary involvement. The prognosis of the patient with giant emphysema (GE) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critical or severe form remains poor. We report an original case of COVID-19 pneumonia, critical form, complicated by a giant compressive left emphysema of 22.4 cm in a young subject without respiratory comorbidities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old man was hospitalized for left laterothoracic pain. He had no prior medical history. The physical examination revealed tympany on percussion of the left lung. The CT scan confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with 95% lung involvement. Also, the presence of a voluminous left sub pleural emphysema of 22.4 cm with compression of the ipsilateral pulmonary parenchyma as well as the mediastinal structures towards the right side. The diagnosis COVID-19 pneumonia, critical form, complicated by a compressive left giant emphysema was made. He was put on oxygen, a dual antibiotic therapy, a corticotherapy, and curative doses of enoxaparin. A thoracic drainage surgery was performed at 24th day of hospitalization, which confirmed the giant emphysema. The patient remains on long-term oxygen therapy. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 has polymorphic manifestations, pneumonia is the most important one. There are relatively few reports associating COVID-19 and emphysema; furthermore, reports associating COVID-19 and giant emphysema are extremely scarce. CT scans can confirm the diagnosis and differentiate it from a pneumothorax.

Currently, nearly 13 million Mexicans are living with diabetes. Moreover, due to poor socioeconomic conditions and the cultural idiosyncrasies of the Mexican population, the use of medicinal plants to treat T2D is a common practice in Mexico. In the Mexican state of Hidalgo, we found the traditional use of Calea urticifolia (CU) to treat this disease. To treat T2D, people drink an infusion made from the aerial part of the plant throughout the day. With the aim of investigating whether the infusion at a traditional dose produces a hypoglycemic effect in either the fasting or postprandial state, we measured the effect of the infusion in a hyperglycemic animal model (rats administered streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NZ)) by conducting a glucose tolerance test and constructing a blood-glucose curve. We then analyzed whether the observed effect was related to the inhibition of glucose absorption in the gut or the inhibition of hepatic glucose output (HGO) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we confirmed our findings by identifying the potential targets of the infusion via a network pharmacology analysis. Through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC), we detected a number of compounds in the extract and identified two of them. The plant extract produced a highly significant hypoglycemic effect under fasting conditions and a weak hypoglycemic effect following glucose or sucrose challenge. Although the plant extract blocked only 20% of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity in vitro, in the pyruvate tolerance test (which measures the liberation of hepatic glucose), it significantly reduced glucose levels. Furthermore, in vitro, the extract diminished the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex by 90%. In addition, by conducting TLC, we detected the presence of chlorogenic acid and rutin, which have been reported to block HGO. The results presented here provide evidence of the hypoglycemic effect of the traditionally used C. urticifolia extract and demonstrate that this effect is associated with both a reduction in glucose synthesis via gluconeogenesis due to the phytochemical composition of the extract and a slight blockage of glucose absorption in the gut.","output":"Hypoglycemic Effect of Calea urticifolia (Mill.)

To prevent parastomal hernia (PSH) formation an extraperitoneal colostomy (EPC) approach has been developed in open colorectal surgery and some studies have suggested a potential advantage to this approach. Here we describe our technique of laparoscopic extraperitoneal stoma formation and present our experience to date. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection between March 1999 and March 2011. We performed the EPC technique as follows: under laparoscopic guidance, a smooth tip instrument was used to gently separate the peritoneum from the posterior aponeurotic plane to create an extraperitoneal tunnel running from the skin incision to the left flank of the abdominal cavity to join the previously dissected paracolic gutter. The colon was exteriorized and the position was checked to ensure the absence of torsion or kinking. RESULTS Twenty-two patients underwent a standard laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with total mesorectal excision. Colostomy was constructed extraperitoneally (EPC) or transperitoneally (TPC) in 12 and 10 patients respectively. There were five complications requiring operative intervention: two stomal necrosis and one surgical site infection in the TPC group and two small bowel occlusions in the EPC group. Four patients from the TPC group developed PSH at 24, 36, 48 and 72 months respectively while there were no cases of PSH in the EPC group.

However, its impact on stress and subsequent professional pathways is not well understood. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being, training, and career choices of Canadian medical clerks within the first three months of the pandemic. It also aims to assess their use of university support systems and their appreciation of potential solutions to common academic stressors. METHODS: An electronic survey composed of four sections: demographics, stressors experienced during the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index, and stress management and resources was distributed to Canadian clerks. RESULTS: Clerks from 10 of the 17 Canadian medical faculties participated in this study (n = 627). Forty-five percent of clerks reported higher levels of stress than usual; 22% reconsidered their residency choice; and 19% reconsidered medicine as a career. The factors that were most stressful among clerks were: the means of return to rotations; decreased opportunities to be productive in view of residency match; and taking the national licensing exam after the beginning of residency. The mean WHO well-being index was 14.8/25  4.5, indicating a poor level of well-being among a considerable proportion of students. Clerks who reconsidered their residency choice or medicine as a career had lower mean WHO well-being indices. Most clerks agreed with the following suggested solutions: training sessions on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases; being allowed to submit fewer reference letters when applying to residency; and having protected time to study for their licensing exam during residency. Overall, clerks were less concerned with being infected during their rotations than with the impact of the pandemic on their future career and residency match.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study of data from nationwide registries in Sweden, all individuals who acquired immunity from either previous COVID-19 infection or full vaccination until May 26, 2021, were considered for inclusion. Each person with immunity was matched 1:1 to an individual without immunity from an identified cohort of individuals with families comprising 2 to 5 members. EXPOSURES: Number of immune family members in each family on April 14, 2021 (index date), who acquired immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection or full vaccination (2 doses of the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2 mRNA, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident COVID-19 infection in nonimmune family members from April 15 to May 26, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 1 789 728 individuals from 814 806 families were included in the analysis. Each family comprised 2 to 5 family members, with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 51.3 (19.5) years. During a mean (range) follow-up time of 26.3 (1-40) days, 88 797 of 1 549 989 (5.7%) nonimmune family members (mean [SD] age, 51.6 [17.7] years; 790 276 men [51.0%]) were diagnosed with COVID-19. There was an inverse dose-response association between the number of immune members in each family and the risk of incident COVID-19 infection in nonimmune family members. Nonimmune families with 1 immune family member had a 45% to 61% lower risk of contracting COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39-0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.61, P < .001). The risk reduction increased to 75% to 86% in families with 2 immune family members (HR, 0.14-0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.27; P < .001), 91% to 94% with 3 immune family members (HR, 0.06-0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.10; P < .001), and 97% with 4 immune family members (HR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02-0.05; P < .001).

Initially in India, this disease was concentrated in major urban cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, and Chennai, which were the national hotspots for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in subsequent months, returning migrants (mainly day labour) brought the disease back to their home;this vector triggered significant spread to semi-urban and rural areas. This highlighted serious concerns in rural India, where access to sophisticated healthcare and mitigation strategies were lacking. There is little data on this new pattern of disease spread.

In addition, we found that the triphosphate of the antiviral Ribavirin, with broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, was hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit with a lower efficiency compared to Remdesivir-TP. NUDT18 activity was also tested with the triphosphates of the antivirals Sofosbuvir and Aciclovir for which low activity, in comparison to activities with Remdesivir-TP and Ribavirin-TP, was detected.

Currently, extensive research and development efforts are aimed at producing a safe and effective vaccine. In the interim, small molecules are being widely investigated for antiviral effects. With respect to viral replication, the papain-like (PL(pro)) and main proteases (M(pro)), are critical for processing viral replicase polypeptides. Further, the PL(pro) possesses deubiquitinating activity affecting key signalling pathways, including inhibition of interferon and innate immune antagonism. Therefore, inhibition of PL(pro) activity with small molecules is an important research direction. Our aim was to focus on identification of potential inhibitors of the protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro). We investigated 300 small compounds derived predominantly from our OliveNet(TM) library (222 phenolics) and supplemented with synthetic and dietary compounds with reported antiviral activities. An initial docking screen, using the potent and selective noncovalent PL(pro) inhibitor, GRL-0617 as a control, enabled a selection of 30 compounds for further analyses. From further in silico analyses, including docking to scenes derived from a publicly available molecular dynamics simulation trajectory (100s PDB 6WX4; DESRES-ANTON-11441075), we identified lead compounds for further in vitro evaluation using an enzymatic inhibition assay measuring SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) protease activity. Our findings indicate that hypericin possessed inhibition activity, and both rutin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the PL(pro), with activity in the micromolar range.

Very few studies assessed the relationship between maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and critical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MEP and critical outcomes. METHODS: This work was a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study of adult patients who required mechanical ventilation for  24 h in an 18-bed ICU. MEP was assessed before extubation after a successful, spontaneous breathing trial. The relationships between MEP and extubation failure, and short-term (30 days) mortality, were investigated. Univariate logistic regressions were computed to investigate the relationship between MEP values and critical outcomes. Two multivariate analyses, with and without maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), both adjusted using principal component analysis, were undertaken. Unadjusted and adjusted ROC curves were computed to compare the respective ability of MEP, MIP and the combination of both measures to discriminate patients with and without extubation failure or premature death. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four patients were included. Median age was 66 years (IQR 18) and median mechanical ventilation duration was 7 days (IQR 6). Extubation failure rate was 15% (18/124 patients) and the rate for 30-day mortality was 11% (14/124 patient). Higher MEP values were significantly associated with a lower risk of extubation failure in the univariate analysis [OR 0.96 95% CI (0.93C0.98)], but not with short-term mortality. MEP was independently linked with extubation failure when MIP was not included in the multivariate model, but not when it was included, despite limited collinearity between these variables. This study was not able to differentiate the respective abilities of MEP, MIP, and their combination to discriminate patients with extubation failure or premature death (adjusted AUC for the combination of MEP and MIP: 0.825 and 0.650 for extubation failure and premature death, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: MEP is related to extubation failure. But, the results did not support its use as a substitute for MIP, since the relationship between MEP and critical outcomes was no longer significant when MIP was included. The use of MIP and MEP measurements combined did not reach higher discriminative capacities for critical outcomes that MEP or MIP alone.

DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study used a gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate risk of COVID-19 infection (ie, presence of at least 1 confirmed COVID-19 resident) in NHs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The model was trained on outcomes from 1146 NHs in Massachusetts, Georgia, and New Jersey, reporting COVID-19 case data on April 20, 2020. Risk indices generated from the model using data from May 4 were prospectively validated against outcomes reported on May 11 from 1021 NHs in California. METHODS: Model features, pertaining to facility and community characteristics, were obtained from a self-constructed dataset based on multiple public and private sources. The model was assessed via out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in the training (via 10-fold cross-validation) and validation datasets. RESULTS: The mean AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model over 10-fold cross-validation were 0.729 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690a??0.767], 0.670 (95% CI 0.477a??0.862), and 0.611 (95% CI 0.412a??0.809), respectively. Prospective out-of-sample validation yielded similar performance measures (AUC 0.721; sensitivity 0.622; specificity 0.713). The strongest predictors of COVID-19 infection were identified as the NH's county's infection rate and the number of separate units in the NH; other predictors included the county's population density, historical Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services cited health deficiencies, and the NH's resident density (in persons per 1000 square feet). In addition, the NH's historical percentage of non-Hispanic white residents was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A machine-learning model can help quantify and predict NH infection risk. The identified risk factors support the early identification and management of presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (eg, staff) entering the NH from the surrounding community and the development of financially sustainable staff testing initiatives in preventing COVID-19 infection.","output":"Predicting Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection Risk and Related Risk Drivers in Nursing Homes: A Machine Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides an introduction to animals that are commonly used for research.

We investigated whether Vo2pk and systemic responses measured during field walking tests were similar to those measured during an incremental treadmill test (ITMT) in obese individuals with treated OSA. METHODS Individuals with treated OSA and a BMI > 30 kg/m2 were recruited. Participants completed an ITMT, two 6-min walk tests (6MWTs), and two incremental shuttle walk tests (ISWTs) on three separate days in a randomized order. Expired gas analysis was performed during all tests. RESULTS The study was completed by 16 patients (nine men) (mean [SD] age, 58 [12] y; BMI, 36.1 [7.6] kg/m2). There was no difference (P = .27) in Vo2pk assessed by the ITMT and the ISWT (2,266 [478] and 2,017 [561] mL/min, respectively). The Vo2pk measured by the 6MWT (1,778 [360] mL/min) was lower than that measured by the ITMT (P < .01). The limits of agreement for Vo2pk between the ISWT and the ITM were  730 mL/min. Cardiorespiratory responses during the ISWT and the ITMT reflected a graded response to a peak, whereas the 6MWT demonstrated a rapid rise to a plateau. CONCLUSIONS The ISWT can be used instead of an ITMT and in preference to the 6MWT to assess cardiorespiratory fitness for a cohort of obese people with treated OSA.

METHODS: About 81,000 COVID-19 confirmed case data, Baidu migration index data, air pollutants, meteorological data, and government response strictness index data were collected from 31 provincial-level regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) and 337 prefecture-level cities. The spatio-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 were explored using spatial autocorrelation, hot spot, and spatio-temporal scanning statistics. At the same time, Spearman rank correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore the relationship between influencing factors and confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The distribution of COVID-19 in China tends to be stable over time, with spatial correlation and prominent clustering regions. Spatio-temporal scanning analysis showed that most COVID-19 high-incidence months were from January to March at the beginning of the epidemic, and the area with the highest aggregation risk was Hubei Province (RR=491.57) which was 491.57 times the aggregation risk of other regions. Among the meteorological variables, the daily average temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and new COVID-19 cases were negatively correlated. The air pollution concentration and migration index were positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the government response strict index was strongly negatively correlated with confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental temperature has a certain inhibitory effect on the transmission of COVID-19; the air pollution concentration and migration index have a certain promoting effect on the transmission of COVID-19.

In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of the effective reproduction numbers R(t) for each country by integrating the equations of the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. We cluster countries based on the estimated R(t) through a suitable time series dissimilarity. The clustering result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we extend the simple SIR model for disease spread to include a social response to explain the number X(t) of new confirmed daily cases. In particular, we characterize the social response with a first-order model that depends on three parameters &#957;1,&#957;2,&#957;3. The parameter &#957;1 describes the effect of relaxed intervention when the incidence rate is low; &#957;2 models the impact of interventions when incidence rate is high; &#957;3 represents the fatigue, i.e., the weakening of interventions as time passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19 epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters &#957;1,&#957;2,&#957;3 and initial conditions, such as R0, for different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social responses.

The aim of this study was to elucidate characteristics of anxiety and depressive symptom networks of Chinese nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A total of 932 nursing students were included. Anxiety and depressive symptom were measured using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), respectively. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified via centrality indices and bridge centrality indices, respectively. Network stability was examined using the case-dropping procedure. Results: Irritability, Uncontrollable worry, Trouble relaxing, and Depressed mood had the highest centrality values. Three bridge symptoms (Depressed mood, Nervousness, and Anhedonia) were also identified. Neither gender nor region of residence was associated with network global strength, distribution of edge weights or individual edge weights. Limitations: Data were collected in a cross-sectional study design, therefore, causal relations and dynamic changes between anxiety and depressive symptoms over time could not be inferred. Generalizability of findings may be limited to Chinese nursing students during a particular phase of the current pandemic. Conclusions: Irritability, Uncontrollable worry, Trouble relaxing, and Depressed mood constituted central symptoms maintaining the anxiety-depression network structure of Chinese nursing students during the pandemic. Timely, systemic multi-level interventions targeting central symptoms and bridge symptoms may be effective in alleviating co-occurring experiences of anxiety and depression in this population.","output":"Network analysis of anxiety and depressive symptoms among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Belatacept may impair humoral immunity, impacting the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in transplant recipients. We investigated immunogenicity after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in kidney transplant recipients who are and are not taking belatacept. METHODS Participants were recruited between 12/9/2020 - 4/1/2021. Blood samples were collected after dose 1 and dose 2 (D1, D2), and analyzed using either an anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme immunoassay against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) was used to compare immunogenicity and a weighted logistics regression was used to calculate fold change of positive response. RESULTS Among the 609 participants studied, 24 (4%) were taking belatacept. After dose 1, 0/24 (0%) belatacept patients had detectable antibodies, compared to 77/568 (14%) among the equivalent nonbelatacept population (p=0.06). After dose 2, 1/19 (5%) belatacept patients had detectable antibodies, compared to 190/381 (50%) among the equivalent nonbelatacept population (p<0.001). Belatacept use was associated with 16.7-fold lower odds of having a positive post-D2 titer result (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS Additional measures need to be explored in order to protect kidney transplant recipients taking belatacept.

The purpose of this case study is to understand the provider's perspective of embedding a CHA into the care team and the resulting impact on the practice and patients. Blue Shield also sought to identify best practices and barriers of a CHA program within primary and specialty care practices. As part of an ongoing two-year mixed-methods impact evaluation (2019C2021), 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 18 providers and office staff at five primary care and specialty practices where CHAs have been embedded. We also conducted two focus groups with the same five CHAs at different points in time. Several themes emerged from the provider, office staff, and CHA interviews. Provider practices found great value in adding a CHA to their care team as the CHA brings flexibility and continuity to patient care. They also found that having access to a CHA with shared life experiences of the communities they served is a key component to the program's success. Providers and staff reported a new understanding of the social determinants of health that impacts a patient's wellbeing with the embedding of a CHA in the care team. Overall, practitioners expressed high satisfaction with the CHA program.

In 2009, the California Department of Public Health reported a dramatic increase (350) in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in Humboldt County. To better understand the evolution of rabies, deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt outbreak. For each sample, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Average coverage was 17,448 and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths. Phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date (1995 vs. 2009) and geographic location (northern vs. southern). A single amino acid change in the G protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks, suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region. Deep-sequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 20032010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995.

To identify factors that motivate or fail to motivate patients to update their vaccination status would help to design future strategies and awareness campaigns. Objective: Our aim was to assess the impact of primary care physicians on the immunization status of their adult patients, and to explore possible explanations. Methods: We invited students and collaborators of Geneva University to bring their paper vaccination records to receive an assessment of their immunization status and personalized vaccination recommendations. Participants completed a first questionnaire at the recruitment phase, and a second 2C3 months later. We assessed their immunization status with the viavac algorithms based on the Swiss national immunization plan. Results: Having a primary care physician did not correlate with better immunization status: only 22.5% patients who reported having a physician and 20% who reported having no physician were up-to-date (n = 432; p > 0.5). A linear regression indicates that the frequency of medical consultations did not affect patients' immunization status either. Even the participants who recently showed their vaccination record to their primary care physician did not have a better vaccination status. We explored possible explanatory factors and found evidence for the patients' overconfidence about their own immunization status: 71.2% of the participants who predicted that they were up-to-date were wrong about their actual status, and 2C3 months after having received their immunization assessment, 52.8% of the participants who remembered having received the assessment that they were up-to-date were wrong: they had in fact received the opposite information that they were not up-to-date. This substantial proportion of wrong beliefs suggests that adult patients are unworried and overconfident about their own immunization status, which is likely to induce a passive resistance toward vaccination updating. Conclusions: This study indicates that the vaccination coverage and beliefs of adults about their immunization status is suboptimal, and that primary care physicians need further support to improve their health-protection mandate through routine immunization check-ups.

In turn, we underpin that telDNA reservoir is progressively depleted during aging, and that it is scarcer in men than in women.

Ongoing clinical trials were suspended, some never to re-start. A survey was conducted to get a better understanding of both the successes and failures in dealing with the pandemic. Methods: : European contract research organisations (CROs) were asked to determine the extent to which the pandemic impacted on their operations in terms of the trial site conduct and investigator performance as well as its impact on subjects and patients involved in ongoing trials and the quality of data generated. Results: : Forty-nine companies provided responses to the questionnaire. Data indicated that the challenges faced during the pandemic had a marked impact on clinical trial conduct and delivery. We saw an almost immediate decline in clinical trial activity associated with reduced subject/patient recruitment and a reluctance of study participants to undergo follow-up due to their fears of exposure to infection. There was insufficient data to determine the full extent of the pandemic on clinical trial performance and associated limitations in access to bed spaces and the resources necessary to perform procedures and subject follow-up. The introduction of remote monitoring by CROs provided the opportunity for essential activities associated with clinical trials to resume/continue. However, implementing these solutions required research organisations to implement changes to trial documentation and procedures. This placed marked burdens on budgets and clinical resources.

Methods : A retrospective analysis was performed using outpatient clinic logs for patients seen during the first 10 weeks of 2020 and compared to outpatient clinic logs for 10 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the twenty-week period, the number of appointments, intravitreal injections, and surgeries, most commonly retinal detachments, epiretinal membrane (ERM), and vitreous hemorrhages, were compared. Additionally, consideration was given to potential measures to reduce the spread and maintain prepandemic clinical care levels. The number of appointments, injections administered, and surgeries completed or postponed were analyzed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice implemented additional precautions for patients and staff. These included, but were not limited to, temperature checks, hand sanitizer availability, required use of face masks, and asking patients to come alone to appointments;with the exception of patients that were wheelchair bound, suffered from dementia, were under the age of 18, or required a translator. Results : During the first 10 weeks of 2020, the practice saw an average of 2,205 visits a week. In week one of the pandemic, the average was 1,147 patients per week, a 54% drop. An overall 40% drop was seen in surgical cases;vitreous hemorrhage surgeries decreased by 35%, retinal detachment surgeries decreased 25%, and ERM peels reduced by 60%. The drop in ERM's were mostly due to rescheduling. Intravitreal injections during the first 10 weeks averaged 1,025 (SD112) per week. During the start of the 10 COVID-19 weeks, intravitreal injections averaged 852 (SD122) per week and by the last weeks injections averaged 972 (SD142) per week. Conclusions : In the early stages, the initial number of outpatient visits declined by 54%, the average number of intravitreal injections did not change in a similar pattern.

However, aging-mediated dysregulation in communication between the oocytes and granulosa cells affects the oocyte quality. In the present study, we examined the defected germline-soma communication and reduced mRNA levels encoding key structural components of transzonal projections (TZPs) in maternally aged oocytes. Oral administration of melatonin to aged mice substantially increased TZPs and maintained the cumulus cells-oocyte communication, which played a central role in the production of adequate oocyte ATP levels and reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and spindle/chromosomal defects. This beneficial effect of melatonin was inhibited by carbenoxolone (CBX), a gap junctional uncoupler, which disrupts bidirectional communications between oocyte and somatic cells. Simultaneously, melatonin significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels corresponding to genes associated with TZPs and prevented TZP retraction in in vitro-cultured cumulus-oocyte complex (COCs). Furthermore, we infused melatonin and CBX into the COCs in vitro culture system and monitored the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH) in cumulus cells and oocytes. Notably, COCs treated with melatonin demonstrated improved NADPH and GSH levels. Of note, CBX was capable of reducing NADPH and GSH levels, aggravated the ROS accumulation and ER stress. Collectively, our data demonstrate the role of melatonin in preventing age-associated germline-soma communication defects, aiding the relay of antioxidant metabolic molecules for the maintenance of oocyte quality from cumulus cells, which have important potential for improving deficient phenotypes of maternally aged oocytes and the treatment of woman infertility.","output":"Melatonin improves the quality of maternally aged oocytes by maintaining intercellular communication and antioxidant metabolite supply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to examine the policy synergy between the provincial government of east java and the central government in dealing with COVID-19.

Long COVID is characterised by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms, making it challenging to derive an unambiguous definition. Studies of electronic health records are a crucial element of the US National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand long COVID, identify treatments, and accurately identify who has itthe latter is the aim of this study. METHODS: Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) electronic health record repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning models to identify potential patients with long COVID. We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age 18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. We examined demographics, health-care utilisation, diagnoses, and medications for 97 995 adults with COVID-19. We used data on these features and 597 patients from a long COVID clinic to train three machine learning models to identify potential long COVID among all patients with COVID-19, patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalised. Feature importance was determined via Shapley values. We further validated the models on data from a fourth site. FINDINGS: Our models identified, with high accuracy, patients who potentially have long COVID, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 092 (all patients), 090 (hospitalised), and 085 (non-hospitalised). Important features, as defined by Shapley values, include rate of health-care utilisation, patient age, dyspnoea, and other diagnosis and medication information available within the electronic health record. INTERPRETATION: Patients identified by our models as potentially having long COVID can be interpreted as patients warranting care at a specialty clinic for long COVID, which is an essential proxy for long COVID diagnosis as its definition continues to evolve. We also achieve the urgent goal of identifying potential long COVID in patients for clinical trials. As more data sources are identified, our models can be retrained and tuned based on the needs of individual studies.

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts at an unprecedented scale. In less than 5 months, more than 12,000 research items and in less than seven months, more than 30,000 items were indexed, while it is projected that the number could exceed 80,000 by the end of 2020, should the current trend continues. With the health crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major coronavirus diseases, i.e., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Interesting recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct cohorts of studies: (i) studies linked to public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies on chemical constitution of the virus; and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with category (i) seem to have been relatively earliest to emerge, they have overall received relatively smaller number of citations compared to publications the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been disseminated across a broader variety of journals and across a more diverse range of subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak as well as the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MERS. Considering the speed at which the Covid-19-related literature is accumulating, an interesting dimension that warrants further exploration could be to assess if the quality and rigour of these publications have been affected.","output":"Covid-19 pandemic and the unprecedented mobilisation of scholarly efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systems for regular, preventive maintenance of infrastructure are needed to ensure safe water access globally. Emerging and growing across rural sub-Saharan Africa, professionalized maintenance arrangements feature legal, regulated service providers who maintain infrastructure in exchange for consumer payment through contracts. However, little is understood about the conditions that enable service providers to retain consumer contracts, an important component of their sustainability that indicates consistent demand and payment. This paper uses fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to identify combinations of operational, natural, physical, political, and social conditions enabling high contract retention across 22 implementation cases in Uganda, uncovering 2 pathways to success. In both pathways, consistent expansion by the service provider normalizes concepts such as tariff payment and local government participation increases trust and accountability between the service provider and consumers. The predominant pathway features one additional condition, coordinated sector aid, ensuring consistent implementation and mitigating harmful dependencies. The alternative pathway relies on large user communities and ease of access to those communities to counteract uncoordinated aid. Thus, operational, social, and political conditions may be sufficient to enable high contract retention irrespective of natural and physical conditions.

The standard analgesic regimes for renal colic are often ineffective; in some studies, less than half of patients achieve complete pain relief, and a large proportion of patients require rescue analgesia within 4 h. Current analgesic regimes are also associated with significant side effects including nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory depression. It has been hypothesised that beta adrenoreceptor agonists, such as salbutamol, may reduce the pain of renal colic. They have been shown to impact a number of factors that target the physiological causes of pain in renal colic (ureteric spasm and increased peristalsis, increased pressure at the renal pelvis and prostaglandin release with inflammation). There is biological plausibility and a body of evidence sufficient to suggest that this novel treatment for the pain of renal colic should be taken to a phase II clinical trial. The aim of this trial is to test whether salbutamol is an efficacious analgesic adjunct when added to the standard analgesic regime for patients presenting to the ED with subsequently confirmed renal colic. METHODS: A phase II, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will be performed in an acute NHS Trust in the East Midlands. Patients presenting to the emergency department with pain requiring IV analgesia and working diagnosis of renal colic will be randomised to receive standard analgesia  a single intravenous injection of Salbutamol. Secondary study objectives will explore the feasibility of conducting a larger, phase III trial. DISCUSSION: The trial will provide important information about the efficacy of salbutamol as an analgesic adjunct in renal colic. It will also guide the development of a definitive phase III trial to test the cost and clinical effectiveness of salbutamol as an analgesic adjunct in renal colic.

Several factors have been linked with a poor prognosis for this disease, including demographic factors, pre-existing comorbidities and laboratory parameters such as white blood cell count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine and electrolytes. Electrolyte abnormalities particularly potassium disorders are common among Covid-19 patients. Based on our pooled analysis, hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur in 24.3% and 4.15% of Covid-19 patients, respectively. Potassium level deviation from the normal range may increase the chances of unfavorable outcomes and even death. Therefore, this article reviewed the epidemiology of potassium disorders and explained how hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are capable of deteriorating cardiac outcomes and the prognosis of Covid-19 for infected patients.

Globally, more than 14.6 M people have been diagnosed and more than 595 K deaths are reported. Currently, no effective vaccine or drugs are available to combat COVID-19. Therefore, the whole world is looking for new drug candidates that can treat the COVID-19. In this study, we conducted a virtual screening of natural compounds using a deep-learning method. A deep-learning algorithm was used for the predictive modeling of a CHEMBL3927 dataset of inhibitors of Main protease (Mpro). Several predictive models were developed and evaluated based on R(2), MAE MSE, RMSE, and Loss. The best model with R(2)=0.83, MAE = 1.06, MSE = 1.5, RMSE = 1.2, and loss = 1.5 was deployed on the Selleck database containing 1611 natural compounds for virtual screening. The model predicted 500 hits showing the value score between 6.9 and 3.8. The screened compounds were further enriched by molecular docking resulting in 39 compounds based on comparison with the reference (X77). Out of them, only four compounds were found to be drug-like and three were non-toxic. The complexes of compounds and Mpro were finally subjected to Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for 100 ns. The MMPBSA result showed that two compounds Palmatine and Sauchinone formed very stable complex with Mpro and had free energy of ?71.47 kJ mol(?1) and ?71.68 kJ mol(?1) respectively as compared to X77 (?69.58 kJ mol(?1)). From this study, we can suggest that the identified natural compounds may be considered for therapeutic development against the SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

There is, therefore, considerable potential in nanoparticles which achieve delivery of the right drug(s) using the right route of administration to the right location at the right time, monitoring the process by non-invasive molecular imaging. A challenge is harnessing immunotherapy via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for the development of vaccines against major infectious diseases and cancer. In immunotherapy, delivery of the vaccine components to lymph nodes (LNs) is essential for effective stimulation of the immune response. Although some promising advances have been made, delivering therapeutics to LNs remains challenging.

Consequently, there is growing interest in whether modulation of the inflammatory response could help to promote nerve regeneration in the PNS. However, to date, there are no practical therapeutic strategies for manipulating inflammation after nerve injury. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein containing five domains. The lectin-like domain of TM has the ability to suppress the inflammatory response. However, whether TM can modulate inflammation in the PNS during nerve regeneration has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: We investigated the role of TM in switching proinflammatory type 1 macrophages (M1) to anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophages (M2) in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and evaluated the therapeutic application of TM in transected sciatic nerve injury in rats. RESULTS: The administration of TM during M1 induction significantly reduced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a (p < 0.05), IL-6 (p < 0.05), and CD86 (p < 0.05), in THP-1 cells. Simultaneously, the expression levels of M2 markers, including IL-10 (p < 0.05) and CD206 (p < 0.05), were significantly increased in TM-treated THP-1 cells. Inhibition of IL-4R-c-Myc-pSTAT6-PPAR signaling abolished the expression levels of IL-10 (p < 0.05) and CD206 (p < 0.05). The conditioned medium (CM) collected from M1 cells triggered an inflammatory response in primary Schwann cells, while CM collected from M1 cells treated with TM resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in inflammation. TM treatment led to better nerve regeneration when tested 6 weeks after injury and preserved effector muscle function. In addition, TM treatment reduced macrophage infiltration at the site of injury and led to potent M1 to M2 transition, thus indicating the anti-inflammatory capacity of TM. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrate the anti-inflammatory role of TM during nerve regeneration. Therefore, TM represents a potential drug for the promotion and modulation of functional recovery in peripheral nerves that acts by regulating the M1/M2 ratio.","output":"Thrombomodulin facilitates peripheral nerve regeneration through regulating M1/M2 switching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Frequently occurring drought stress negatively affects the production of maize worldwide. Numerous efforts have been made to develop drought-tolerant maize lines and to explore drought tolerant mechanisms in maize. However, there is a lack of comparative studies on transcriptomic changes between drought-tolerant and control maize lines. RESULTS: In the present study, we have developed a drought-tolerant maize mutant (C7C2t) by irradiating the seeds of maize inbred line ChangC7C2 (C7C2) with (60)Co-. Compared to its wild type C7C2, C7C2t exhibited a significantly delayed wilting and higher drought tolerance under both the controlled and field conditions, indicating its high water-holding ability. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between C7C2 and C7C2t during drought. As a result, a total of 4552 DEGs were implied in drought tolerance of C7-2 and C7-2t. In particular, the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in C7C2 was inhibited, whereas these genes in C7C2t were almost unaffected under drought. Moreover, a specific set of the DEGs were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and taurine (hypotaurine) metabolism in C7C2t; these DEGs were enriched in cell components associated with membrane systems and cell wall biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The drought tolerance of C7C2t was largely due to its high water-holding ability, stable photosynthesis (for supporting osmoregulation) and strengthened biosynthesis of cell walls under drought conditions.","output":"Identification of drought tolerant mechanisms in a drought-tolerant maize mutant based on physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infections after COVID-19 vaccination are not unexpected, but those occurring more than 14 days after second vaccine dose need to be investigated.

Since then, surgeries were halted in a bid to prevent transmission. However, since such a long halt is infeasible, a general protocol of screening the carriers, especially asymptomatic carries, is a dire need of time. The objective of our study is to propose an economically feasible protocol of COVID 19 screening. Simple but effective screening strategies can help to restore the workings of hospital surgical departments. Methods We analyzed the clinical data of patients turning up for elective surgeries at the Rawal General Hospital (RGH), Islamabad from the 24th of March to the 15th of May, 2020. Asymptomatic patients with negative COVID 19 contact and travel histories were screened with COVID 19 Immunochromatography (ICT) IgM / IgG Ab Test. Complete blood count (CBC) was done and interpreted in conjunction with the ICT results. Results 39 patients with a mean age of 49 years were studied. The result of ICT for COVID-19 was positive in 9 cases (23%). The entire positive ICT patients population expressed significantly lower lymphocyte count (p<0.01); 8 patients had high monocyte count (p<0.05) whereas only 4 patients had a combined high neutrophil and monocyte count (P<0.05). All of these four patients with high neutrophil count were females. The combined interpretation of CBC and ICT IgM / IgG Ab Test had a high accuracy in diagnosing asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers that were later confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Conclusion We propose that joint CBC-ICT interpretation should be adopted on a large scale to help in the diagnoses of asymptomatic carriers as both tests are simple and inexpensive and thus suit the developing countries limited health budget. Future research projects should be adopted in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed protocol on a large scale.

This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in pathology and mortality. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives changes in immune cell-derived factors that then interact with receptors expressed by the sensory neuronal innervation of the lung to further promote important aspects of disease severity, including ARDS. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions. Our findings reveal a landscape of ligand-receptor interactions in the lung caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and point to potential interventions to reduce the burden of neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19 pulmonary disease. In particular, our work highlights opportunities for clinical trials with existing or under development rheumatoid arthritis and other (e.g. CCL2, CCR5 or EGFR inhibitors) drugs to treat high risk or severe COVID-19 cases.","output":"A pharmacological interactome between COVID-19 patient samples and human sensory neurons reveals potential drivers of neurogenic pulmonary dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease that has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, mainly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome. In addition to the widely described respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 may cause life-treating complications directly or indirectly related to this infection. Among these, thrombotic complications have emerged as an important issue in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients in intensive care units. Thrombotic complications due to COVID-19 are likely to occur due to a pro-coagulant pattern encountered in some of these patients or to a progressive endothelial thrombo-inflammatory syndrome causing microvascular disease. In the present authors' experience, from five different hospitals in Italy and the UK, imaging has proved its utility in identifying these COVID-19-related thrombotic complications, with translational clinical relevance. The aim of this review is to illustrate thromboembolic complications directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, this review will show complications related to thromboembolism due to a pro-coagulant pattern from those likely related to an endothelial thrombo-inflammatory syndrome.","output":"Thromboembolic complications of COVID-19: the combined effect of a pro-coagulant pattern and an endothelial thrombo-inflammatory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a considerable threat to the swine industry and implementing biosecurity measures is essential for the control of its transmission. The aims of this study were: (1) to describe biosecurity practices in production sites located in a moderate density (MD) and a high density (HD) pig area according to production type; (2) to group sites in different patterns according to their biosecurity practices; and (3) to determine the geographical distribution of sites according to biosecurity patterns. Biosecurity practices were selected based on PRRS epidemiology. A questionnaire was completed on 125 breeding sites (MD=54; HD=71) and 120 growing (HD) sites, between 2005 and 2008. Depending on area and production type, the frequency of biosecurity practices used ranged from 0 to 2% for barrier at site entrance, 0 to 19% for use of shower, 25 to 35% for washing truck between loads of pigs, 51 to 57% for absence of rendering or rendering without access to the site, and 26 to 51% for absence of gilt purchase or purchase with quarantine. Better practices pertaining to entrance protocol (i.e. \\"no-entry\\" sign, shower, 24 h downtime) were reported more frequently on breeding sites in the MD than the HD area (P<0.05). In the HD area, growing sites had in general a lower level of biosecurity than breeding sites. Using a two-step clustering procedure performed separately for breeding and growing sites, two different patterns were obtained for each production type, which corresponded to a high and low level of biosecurity. For breeding sites, a higher biosecurity level was observed at sites located away from other pig sites, set at more than 300 m from the public road, having higher sow inventory, or being part of an integrated production (P<0.05). Spatial clusters of sites for each biosecurity pattern were detected. This study identified some shortcomings regarding biosecurity that should be addressed before implementing any PRRSV regional control. Vicinity of sites with different biosecurity levels also suggests difficulties in planning priorities of intervention based on geographical distribution of sites.","output":"Epidemiological investigations in regard to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in Quebec, Canada.

The electrical properties of the skin, also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), are considered as an indirect measure of autonomous nervous system. AIM This study explores EDA changes during endotracheal suction in sedated adult critical care patients; and compares these changes to other monitoring parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime intensive care nursing and treatment in an adult Intensive Care Unit. 4h-measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level (group A: Ramsay sedation scale 2-4 and group B: 5-6 respectively) of the patients. Selected recordings before and after endotracheal suction (stress events) were performed. Seven stress events from Group A and 17 from Group B were included for further analysis. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed via 2 independent observers. RESULTS In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than in other monitoring parameters. Yet, in group A only selected parameters were significantly changed after the start of the procedure, while in group B, every parameter showed significant change (p<0.05). Groups were similar for other co-founding factors. CONCLUSION EDA measurements are more sensitive to stress stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. Deeper sedation seems to affect more the intensity of EDA changes during suction.","output":"Electrodermal Activity Monitoring during Endotracheal Suction in Sedated Adult Intensive Care Unit Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteriophage T7 infection has been studied in Escherichia coli strains showing both increased and decreased ribosome fidelity and in the presence of streptomycin, which stimulates translational misreading, in an effort to determine effects on the apparent programmed translational frameshift that occurs during synthesis of the gene 10 capsid protein. Quantitation of the protein bands from SDS-PAGE failed to detect any significant effects on the amounts of the shifted 10B protein relative to the in-frame 10A protein under all fidelity conditions tested. However, any changes in fidelity conditions led to inhibition of phage morphogenesis in single-step growth experiments, which could not be accounted for by reduced amounts of phage protein synthesis, nor, at least in the case of decreased accuracy, by reduced amounts of phage DNA synthesis. Reduction in phage DNA synthesis did appear to account for a substantial proportion of the reduction in phage yield seen under conditions of increased accuracy. Similar effects of varying ribosomal fidelity on growth were also seen with phage T3, and to a lesser extent with phage T4. The absence of change in the high-frequency T7 gene 10 frameshift differs from earlier reports that ribosomal fidelity affects low-frequency frameshift errors.","output":"Bacteriophage T7 morphogenesis and gene 10 frameshifting in Escherichia coli showing different degrees of ribosomal fidelity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, a partial-filling affinity capillary electrophoresis (pf-ACE) method was developed for the cross-validation of fragment hits revealed by chromogenic factor XIIa (FXIIa) assay.

We use international comparisons as a starting point. METHODS: New York City, consisting of some 175 zip codes, is an ideal arena to pursue the above study given the large variation in case incidence rates across zip codes. We conducted systematic regression studies employing data with zip code granularity. Our model specifications are based on a well-established epidemiologic model that explains the effects of household sizes on R0. RESULTS: Average household size emerges as the single most important driver behind the large variation in COVID-19 incidence rates. It independently explains 62% of the variation. The percentage of the population above the age of 65 and the percentage below the poverty line are also strongly positively associated with zip code incidence rates. As to ethnic/racial characteristics, the percentages of African Americans, Hispanics and Asians within the population are significantly associated, but the magnitude of the impact is smaller. (The proportion of Asians within a zip code has a negative association.) Contrary to common belief, population density, by itself, does not have a significantly positive impact (other than when a high population is driven by large household sizes).

This paper investigates change in patterns of mortality at local authority level in England (2010-11 to 2017-18) and the relation with fiscal austerity measures. METHODS: Data from official local authority administrative records are used to quantify the gap between observed deaths and what was anticipated in the 2010-based subnational population projections. Regression analyses are used to explore the relation between excess deaths, austerity and wider process of population change at local authority level. RESULTS: We estimate 231 707 total excess deaths, the majority of which occurred since 2014-15 (89%) across the majority of local authorities (91%). Austerity is positively associated with excess deaths. For working age adults, there is a clear gradient to the impact of austerity, whereas for older adults, the impact is more uniform. CONCLUSIONS: Fiscal austerity policies contributed to an excess of deaths for older people and widened social inequalities for younger populations. These results call for an end to all austerity measures and require further research into areas with the highest total excess deaths as a priority following the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Why were there 231 707 more deaths than expected in England between 2010 and 2018?

We also revised possible pathogenic mechanisms associated with. Available data suggest that, in patients with RA and SpA, the immunosuppressive therapy, older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbidities (hypertension, lung disease, diabetes, CVD, and chronic renal insufficiency/end-stage renal disease) could be associated with an increased risk of infections and high rate of hospitalization. Other studies have shown that lower odds of hospitalization were associated with bDMARD or tsDMARDs monotherapy, driven largely by anti-TNF therapies.

In this context, data are very scarce and studies available did not clarify if having an autoinflammatory disorder could be or not a risk factor to develop a more severe COVID-19.

It remains poorly understood whether this is due to illness severity or personal or health system barriers. We explored the experiences of stroke patients with financial barriers in a qualitative descriptive pilot study, seeking to capture perceived challenges that interfere with their poststroke health and recovery. METHODS We interviewed six adults with a history of stroke and financial barriers in Alberta, Canada, inquiring about their: (1) experiences after stroke; (2) experience of financial barriers; (3) perceived reasons for financial barriers; (4) health consequences of financial barriers; and (5) mechanisms for coping with financial barriers. Two reviewers analyzed data using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS The participants developed new or worsened financial circumstances as a consequence of stroke-related disability. Poststroke impairments and financial barriers took a toll on their mental health. They struggled to access several aspects of long-term poststroke care, including allied health professional services, medications, and proper nutrition. They described opportunity costs and tradeoffs when accessing health services. In several cases, they were unaware of health resources available to them and were hesitant to disclose their struggles to their physicians and even their families. CONCLUSION Some patients with financial barriers perceive challenges to accessing various aspects of poststroke care. They may have inadequate knowledge of resources available to them and may not disclose their concerns to their health care team.

This study aimed to clarify the perceptions of undergraduate medical students on emergency medical care with a focus on comparing their perceptions before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic. METHODS: Fourth\\\\year undergraduate medical students were invited to complete a self\\\\administered questionnaire in 2017 and 2020. Free comments on emergency medical care were analyzed via text mining. The relationships among categorical words were evaluated via correlation matrix and correspondence analysis. RESULTS: The number of written words per student were not significantly different between 2017 (4.9  3.4) and 2020 (5.3  4.1). In 2017, the most frequently used word was busy, and the words patients, life, and care were not related to each other significantly. In 2020, the frequency of the word busy decreased and the word patients was related to life (P < 0.01) and care (P < 0.01). In the correspondence analysis, seven words including life and care were associated with patients, which demonstrates that these words tended to occur together. CONCLUSIONS: Although the responses of the medical students regarding emergency medical care before and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic included similar words, their expressions tended to be related to patient care or patient life during the pandemic.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for its pathogenesis. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Initially, it was thought to be limited to the respiratory system; however, we now recognize that COVID-19 also affects several other organs, including the nervous system. Two similar human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are also known to cause disease in the nervous system. The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are growing rapidly, as evidenced by several reports. There are several mechanisms responsible for such manifestations in the nervous system. For instance, post-infectious immune-mediated processes, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states are commonly involved. Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) and its variants, dysfunction of taste and smell, and muscle injury are numerous examples of COVID-19 PNS (peripheral nervous system) disease. Likewise, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, encephalitis, meningitis, encephalopathy acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, endothelialitis, and venous sinus thrombosis are some instances of COVID-19 CNS disease. Due to multifactorial and complicated pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a large-scale threat to the whole nervous system. A complete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurological impairments is still lacking, but our knowledge base is rapidly expanding. Therefore, we anticipate that this comprehensive review will provide valuable insights and facilitate the work of neuroscientists in unfolding different neurological dimensions of COVID-19 and other CoV associated abnormalities.","output":"Evidence of Coronavirus (CoV) Pathogenesis and Emerging Pathogen SARS-CoV-2 in the Nervous System: A Review on Neurological Impairments and Manifestations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients under mechanical ventilation with COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

METHODS: In this qualitative study, in-person and phone semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 participants. Participants included NPs (n=5), physicians (n=5), and stakeholders including members of professional regulatory bodies and government, academics and other clinicians (n=8). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis and software (NVivo 12.4.0) for data management. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: 1) Pervasive Barrier of Stigma; 2) Perceived Complexity of Patients Living with OUD; 3) NP Education and Practice Supports and; 4) Health Care Context and NP Role Implementation.

So far, acute upper limb ischaemia (ULI) has been reported only in critically ill patients. CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we aimed to present a case of a 29-year-old, otherwise healthy male volleyball player, with acute ischaemic signs in the upper extremity who was diagnosed with COVID-19 1 month before the ischaemic event. It has been shown that volleyball players experience repetitive stress that involves their hands and, in particular, their fingers. Repetitive trauma can lead to local vascular abnormalities, such as reduced capillarization and lower resting blood flow that can lead to pain and cold digits, but never acute ULI. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of such a hypercoagulable synergistic mechanism that leads to a high thrombus burden. Intra-arterial local thrombolysis and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty failed to succeed, and percutaneous large-bore embolectomy with the Indigo Aspiration System (Penumbra Inc., CA, USA) was deemed necessary.","output":"A case report of COVID-19-associated acute hand ischaemia in a young professional volleyball player"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although clinical pharmacy is a discipline that emerged in the 1960s, the question of precisely how pharmacists can play a role in therapeutic optimization remains unanswered. In the field of mental health, psychiatric pharmacists are increasingly involved in medication reconciliation and therapeutic patient education (or psychoeducation) to improve medication management and enhance medication adherence, respectively. However, psychiatric pharmacists must now assume a growing role in team-based models of care and engage in shared expertise in psychopharmacology in order to truly invest in therapeutic optimization of psychotropics. The increased skills in psychopharmacology and expertise in psychotherapeutic drug monitoring can contribute to future strengthening of the partnership between psychiatrists and psychiatric pharmacists. We propose a narrative review of the literature in order to show the relevance of a clinical pharmacist specializing in psychiatry. With this in mind, herein we will address: (i) briefly, the areas considered the basis of the deployment of clinical pharmacy in mental health, with medication reconciliation, therapeutic education of the patient, as well as the growing involvement of clinical pharmacists in the multidisciplinary reflection on pharmacotherapeutic decisions; (ii) in more depth, we present data concerning the use of therapeutic drug monitoring and shared expertise in psychopharmacology between psychiatric pharmacists and psychiatrists.

Respiratory infections occur primarily in the majority of patients treated with COVID-19. In light of the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the need for diagnostic tools to identify COVID-19 infection at early stages is of vital importance. For decades, chest X-ray (CXR) technologies have proven their ability to accurately detect respiratory diseases. More recently, with the availability of COVID-19 CXR scans, deep learning algorithms have played a critical role in the healthcare arena by allowing radiologists to recognize COVID-19 patients from their CXR images. However, the majority of screening methods for COVID-19 reported in recent studies are based on 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although 3D CNNs are capable of capturing contextual information compared to their 2D counterparts, their use is limited due to their increased computational cost (i.e. requires much extra memory and much more computing power). In this study, a transfer learning-based hybrid 2D/3D CNN architecture for COVID-19 screening using CXRs has been developed. The proposed architecture consists of the incorporation of a pre-trained deep model (VGG16) and a shallow 3D CNN, combined with a depth-wise separable convolution layer and a spatial pyramid pooling module (SPP). Specifically, the depth-wise separable convolution helps to preserve the useful features while reducing the computational burden of the model. The SPP module is designed to extract multi-level representations from intermediate ones. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve reasonable performances when evaluated on a collected dataset (3 classes to be predicted: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal). Notably, it achieved a sensitivity of 98.33%, a specificity of 98.68% and an overall accuracy of 96.91%","output":"Hybrid-COVID: a novel hybrid 2D/3D CNN based on cross-domain adaptation approach for COVID-19 screening from chest X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nephrosplenic space (NSS) ablation has been demonstrated to be an effective technique for prevention of left dorsal displacement of the large colon and multiple laparoscopic techniques, among which ablation with mesh or with a barbed suture, have been proposed.

The restrictions in Israel included limitations on movement, reduction of working capacity and closure of the educational system. The present study focused on patients treated at a referral center for burns in northern Israel. Our goal was to investigate temporal variations in burn injuries during this period. Data was retrospectively extracted from the medical records of burn patients treated at our hospital between March 14, 2020 and April 20, 2020 (i.e., the period of aggravated lockdown). Data from this period was compared to that from paralleling periods between 2017-2019. During the lockdown and paralleling periods, 178 patients were treated for burn injuries, of whom 44% were under 18. Although no restrictions were enforced during the virus outbreak period with regard to seeking medical care, we noticed a decrease in the number of patients admitted to the emergency room for all reasons. Of particular interest was a 66% decrease in the number of adult burn patients (p&0.0001). Meanwhile, among the pediatric population, no significant decrease was observed. Nonetheless, subgroups with higher susceptibility to burn injuries included children aged 2-5 years (56.3% vs 23.8%, p=0.016) and female patients from all pediatric age groups (57.1% vs 25%, p=0.027). These findings may be explained by the presumably busier kitchen and dining areas during the lockdown.

With the limited number of suggested therapies under clinical trials, the discovery of novel therapeutic agents is essential. Here, a previously identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound named Compound 13 (1,2,5-Oxadiazole-3-carboximidic acid, 4,4-(methylenediimino) bis,bis[[(2-hydroxyphenyl)methylene]hydrazide) was subjected to an iterated virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) using a combination of Ligand Designer and PathFinder. PathFinder, a computational reaction enumeration tool, was used for the rapid generation of enumerated structures via default reaction library. Ligand designer was employed for the computerized lead optimization and selection of the best structural modification that resulted in a favorable ligandCprotein complex. The obtained compounds that showed the best binding to M(pro) were re-screened against TMPRSS2, leading to the identification of 20 shared compounds. The compounds were further visually inspected, which resulted in the identification of five shared compounds M1C5 with dual binding affinity. In vitro evaluation and enzyme inhibition assay indicated that M3, an analogue of Compound 13 afforded by replacing the phenolic moiety with pyridinyl, possesses an improved antiviral activity and safety. M3 displayed in vitro antiviral activity with IC(50) 0.016 M and M(pro) inhibition activity with IC(50) 0.013 M, 7-fold more potent than the parent Compound 13 and potent than the antivirals drugs that are currently under clinical trials. Moreover, M3 showed potent activity against human TMPRSS2 and furin enzymes with IC(50) 0.05, and 0.08 M, respectively. Molecular docking, WaterMap analysis, molecular dynamics simulation, and R-group analysis confirmed the superiority of the binding fit to M3 with the target enzymes. WaterMap analysis calculated the thermodynamic properties of the hydration site in the binding pocket that significantly affects the biological activity. Loading M3 on zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) increased the antiviral activity of the compound 1.5-fold, while maintaining a higher safety profile. In conclusion, lead optimized discovery following an iterated virtual screening in association with molecular docking and biological evaluation revealed a novel compound named M3 with promising dual activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. METHOD: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between 'serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria' and 'patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method'. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. RESULT: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. DISCUSSION: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.","output":"Helping doctors hasten COVID-19 treatment: Towards a rescue framework for the transfusion of best convalescent plasma to the most critical patients based on biological requirements via ml and novel MCDM methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This in vitro study determined the anti-viral efficacy of a unique blend of powder cellulose supplemented with powdered garlic extract (PGE) and a signalling agent.

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls). RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, P=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, P<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.","output":"SARS2-CoV-2 and Stroke in a New York Healthcare System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2).

Despite the efforts made by some producers and some authorities to strengthen the already important contribution of the minerals and metals industry to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the production of minerals and metals has negative impacts both on the global and on local ecosystems. It already contributes to 16% of global CO(2) emissions (OECD 2019) and it generates about 50 bn t solid waste per year, 25 times the estimated annual amount of urban waste (Franks et al. 2021). This waste is composed of mostly barren rock fragments, essentially overburden that needed to be stripped to access the ore, and of fine-grained ore processing tailings. The latter, if containing sulphides such as pyrite and residual minerals containing elements such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium or tellurium, can become highly problematic for the well-being of future generations. The production of minerals and metals also can be a source of conflicts and of social disruption. Failure to globally and sustainably manage the production of minerals and metals, in a transparent and multilateral framework providing a stable, foreseeable and level playing field for investors and for trade, could limit the capacity of the industry to reply to future demand and lead to potentially disastrous global conflicts. Depending on the practices of individual producers, on the quality of national and/or regional regulatory frameworks and on the effectiveness of their implementation, a same mineral or metal can be produced under very differing environmental and social conditions. Despite progress on sustainability performance reporting and of transparency of some parts of the industry, end-users of minerals and metals do not know how the minerals and metals they use have been produced and they hardly can choose among various supply sources, although from a sustainability perspective there are great differences among the practices of individual producers. The development of an international governance framework to support the development of transparency and verifiable corporate accountability, to foster research and innovation to reduce the negative impacts of the industry and to provide incentives rewarding pro-sustainability action, is called for. Support to document and disseminate best practice and best available technologies as well as to strengthen the global institutional capacities to manage this very complex and vital industry is needed. This could be an important role for a future International Minerals and Metals Agency. So far, only the exploration and mining of deep-sea mineral deposits located in international zones of the oceans are internationally regulated under the UN Convention On the Law Of the Sea (UNCLOS), with a specific International Agency in charge of its implementation and of the provision of scientific and technical guidance: the International Seabed Authority (Kingston, Jamaica), created in 1994. The European Union could and should play an important role in these developments as it is an important global end-user of minerals and metals mostly produced outside its borders. The EUs environmental footprint outside its borders is very high and growing. According to EUROSTAT trade data, EU imports of goods from beyond its borders doubled in value from 2002 to 2018, with Chinas share having grown by over 460% over this period, representing 19% of the total imports of goods. China is the world largest greenhouse gas emitter. EUs very strong point is its long history of successful research and innovation, dating back to the Renaissance (15th Century BCE). Its very large and highly qualified human resources in science and innovation much benefits from progressive European-scale structuration and integration of mineral- and metal-related research and innovation thanks to the European Union raw materialCrelated policies developed since 2008 (European Commission 2008) under the EU Raw Materials Initiative (see p. 20 ff.). The EIT Raw Materials, launched in 2015, is the world largest organised and funded mineral- and metal-related innovation network, linking over 120 partners from academia, industry and research organisations (EIT Raw Materials, 2021). But, despite these positive developments, it so far lacks the legal basis to develop its own mineral resource policy and its own homogeneous regulatory framework. It nevertheless can act in different areas that are linked to the development of a global, minerals and metals industry based on sustainable development principles through its capacity to act as European Union in domains such as development cooperation, energy, environment, higher education, research and innovation, as well as trade. It will require long-term vision and political leadership to develop and implement a sustainable EU raw materials policy that would also act as a catalyst for the development of much needed global minerals and metals governance. The publication by the European Commission, in September 2020, of its Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials, part of the European Raw Materials Initiative launched in 2008, could be an important step to address the issues outlined in this paper.","output":"Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century and a sustainable European Union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Epilepsy is a common, chronic neurologic disease with continued disparities in care.

impact of remdesivir (RDV) on COVID-19 mortality is controversial, and the mortality effect in sub-groups of baseline disease severity has been incompletely explored. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of RDV with mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study we compared persons receiving RDV to persons receiving best supportive care (BSC). Patients hospitalized between 2/28/20 - 5/28/20 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included when they developed COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiography, and hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen or SpO2  94% on room air. The primary outcome was overall survival assessed with time-dependent Cox proportional-hazards regression and multivariable adjustment, including calendar time, baseline patient characteristics, corticosteroid use and effects for hospital. RESULTS 1,138 patients were enrolled including 286 who received RDV, and 852 treated with BSC, 400 of whom received hydroxychloroquine. Corticosteroids were used in 20.4% of the cohort (12.6% in RDV and 23% in BSC). In persons receiving RDV compared to those receiving BSC the HR (95%CI) for death was 0.46 (0.31 - 0.69) in the univariate model, p<0.001 and 0.60 (0.40 - 0.90) in the risk-adjusted model, p=0.014. In the sub-group of persons with baseline use of low-flow oxygen, the HR (95%CI) for death in RDV compared to BSC was 0.63 (0.39 - 1.00), p=0.049. CONCLUSION Treatment with RDV was associated with lower mortality compared to BSC.

Academic medical centers do not always have the community connections needed for the most effective population health approaches. We describe how a bridge between a community health center partner (Roots Community Health Center) and a large academic medical center (Stanford Medicine) brought complementary strengths together to address the regional public health crisis. The 2 institutions began the crisis with an overlapping clinical and research faculty member (NKT). Building on that foundation, we worked in 3 areas. First, we partnered to reach underserved populations with the academic center's newly developed COVID test. Second, we developed and distributed evidence-based resources to these same communities via a large community health navigator team. Third, as telemedicine became the norm for medical consultation, the 2 institutions began to research how reducing the digital divide could help improve access to care.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and lockdown resulted in an interruption in physical follow-up. In this situation, tele-follow-up may be helpful. We report the feasibility and usefulness of a telephonic follow-up in patients with TBM. METHODS: Patients with TBM managed by us from January 2017 to March 2020 were included from the TBM registry. Their presenting symptoms, and clinical and investigation findings were noted. We contacted these patients telephonically and their clinical status was obtained using a questionnaire. Based on the telephonic information, outcomes were categorized as death, poor or good. Patients with the new medical problems were advised as to relevant investigations and the reports were obtained through WhatsApp for prescribing treatment. RESULTS: The telephone numbers of 103 of 144 (71.5%) patients were viable. Twenty-seven (26.2%) patients died, 15 (19.7%) had a poor outcome and 61 (80.2%) had a good outcome. Twenty-five (32.9%) patients had new medical problems: 18 TBM related and 7 TBM unrelated. The medical problems of 23 patients could be managed telephonically and only 3 (4%) patients needed a physical visit. Sixty-five (85.5%) patients happily answered the questionnaire and willing responders needed a treatment modification more frequently than the reluctant responders (p=0.008). Patients on active antitubercular treatment needed treatment modification more frequently (80% vs 21.3%).

These include higher rates of comorbid illness and more limited health care access, higher rates of disadvantageous labor market positioning and community and housing conditions, greater exposure to long-term care residence, and higher incarceration rates. COVID-19 also exposes African Americans' greater vulnerability to recession, and possibly greater susceptibility to accompanying behavioral health problems. If they are left unaddressed, the very vulnerabilities COVID-19 exploits may perpetuate themselves. However, continuing and supplementing health and economic COVID mitigation policies can disproportionately benefit African Americans and reduce short- and long-term adverse effects.

The chronic inflammatory nature of inflammatory bowel disease has been identified as a predominant reason for a state of Virchow's triad (i.e., endothelial dysfunction, stasis, and general hypercoagulability), eventually leading to the onset of venous thromboembolism. Recent studies show that certain factors, such as demographics, medication history, and history of surgical intervention may increase thromboembolism risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, to date, no study has attempted to evaluate the effect of different risk factors associated with the development of venous thromboembolism in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Objective: To evaluate the risk factors that can influence the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: Academic literature was systematically searched based on the PRISMA guidelines across five databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, and MEDLINE. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the hazard ratio for the risk factors (i.e., aging, gender, steroid therapy, surgery, and ulcerative colitis) that can influence the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Results: From a total of 963 studies, 18 eligible studies with 1,062,985 (44.59  10.18 years) patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease were included in the review. A meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of aging (Hazard's ratio: 2.19), steroids (1.87), surgery (1.48), and ulcerative colitis (2.06) on venous thromboembolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We also found that the female gender (0.92) did not increase the incidence of venous thromboembolism in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Conclusion: The study provides preliminary evidence regarding high risks associated with ulcerative colitis, steroid consumption, and aging for the development of venous thromboembolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The findings from this study may contribute to developing awareness among clinicians, better risk stratification and prevention of venous thromboembolic complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.","output":"Risk Factors of Venous Thromboembolism in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the roles of mobile health, or mHealth, in the psychosocial health of pregnant women and mothers.

Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Due to the high heterogeneity and variability of the included studies, data synthesis was conducted narratively. RESULTS: 44 studies were included among 11 999 identified articles. Most studies reported mixed findings on the roles of mHealth interventions in the psychosocial health of pregnant women and mothers; mHealth improved self-management, acceptance of pregnancy/motherhood and social support, while mixed results were observed for anxiety and depressive symptoms, perceived stress, mental well-being, coping and self-efficacy. Furthermore, pregnant women and mothers from vulnerable populations benefited from the use of mHealth to improve their psychosocial health. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that mHealth has the potential to improve self-management, acceptance of pregnancy/motherhood and social support. mHealth can also be a useful tool to reach vulnerable pregnant women and mothers with barriers to health information and facilitate access to healthcare services. However, the high heterogeneity limited the certainty of evidence of these findings.

It enters by binding with ACE2 receptor present on the outer surface of a cell by cleaving S1/S2 with proteolytic protein Furin. Further viral replication or transcription then takes place with the help of main protease 3CLpro and polymerase RdRp. This in silco study was carried out to block ACE2, Furin, 3CLpro and RdRP with various phytochemicals to prevent SARS- CoV-2 entry and replication or transcription. Twenty different phytochemicals were screened to understand the drug-likeliness obeying Lipinski's rule 5 and further, molecular docking was performed using these phytochemicals to block their respective target proteins. All the phytochemicals follow Lipinski's rule of five and molecular docking result shows best binding affinity of Podofilox - 7.54 kcal/mol with ACE2, Psoralidin - 8.04 kcal/mol with Furin, Ursolic acid - 8.88 kcal/mol with 3CLpro and Epiafzelechin - 8.26 kcal/mol with RdRp. Thus, blocking two human receptors ACE2 and Furin with Podofilox and Psoralidin respectively may prevent the viral entry into the cells. Also blocking viral proteins 3CLpro and RdRp with Ursolic acid and Epiafzelechin may prevent viral replication or transcription.

Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin  cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3.

At the same time, the mechanism of how microbiota contributes to liver diseases goes beyond the traditional function of the gutCliver axis which could lead to liver injury and inflammation.

The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells.

Data were collected using focus group interviews with physicians, registered nurses (RNs), and respiratory therapists (RTs), and individual interviews with both patient care and medical directors at each site. Initial coding was based on the Ottawa Model of Research Use (OMRU) categories of elements known to influence the uptake of innovations. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty healthcare professionals from nine different healthcare institutions participated in this study. Lack of leadership in the form of a research champion, a lack of consensus about the benefits of MDI/spacers among staff, perceived resistance from patients/parents, and perceived increased cost and workload associated with MDI/spacer use were the most prevalent barriers to the adoption of the MDI/spacer. Common strategies used by early-adopting sites included the active participation of all professional groups in the adoption process in addition to a well-planned and executed educational component for staff, patients, and families. Early adopter sites were also more likely to have the MDI/spacer included in a clinical protocol/pathway.

The COVID-19 vaccine is a key intervention towards containing the pandemic. Over three billion doses of the vaccine have already been administered globally and over 800,000 doses administered in Ghana, representing less than 5% vaccination coverage. Fear, uncertainty, conspiracy theories and safety concerns remain important threats to, a successful rollout of the vaccine if not managed well. OBJECTIVE: Ascertain the predictors of citizens probability of participating in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and subsequently accept the vaccine when given the opportunity. METHODOLOGY: The study was an online nation-wide survey among community members (n = 1556) from 18th September to 23rd October, 2020 in the 16 regions in Ghana. Binary probit regression analysis with marginal effect estimations was employed to ascertain the predictors of community members willingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and uptake the vaccine. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of respondents said they will not participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial; 65% will take the vaccine, while 69% will recommend it to others. Willingness to voluntarily participate in COVID-19 vaccine trial, uptake the vaccine and advise others to do same was higher among adults aged 18C48 years, the unmarried and males (p < 0.05). Significant predictors of unwillingness to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial and uptake of the vaccine are: married persons, females, Muslims, older persons, residents of less urbanised regions and persons with lower or no formal education (p < 0.05). Predominant reasons cited for unwillingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and take the vaccine included fear, safety concerns, lack of trust in state institutions, uncertainty, political connotations, spiritual and religious beliefs. CONCLUSION: The probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ghana is high but the country should not get complacent because fear, safety and mistrust are important concerns that have the potential to entrench vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine rollout campaigns should be targeted and cognisant of the key predictors of citizens perceptions of the vaccine.

The results demonstrate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is toward increasing U-content and reducing genome-size. C, G and A to U mutations have all contributed to this U-content increase. Mutations of C, G and A at codon position 1, 2 or 3 have no significant difference in most SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Current viruses are more cryptic and more efficient in replication, and are thus less virulent yet more infectious. Delta and Omicron variants have high mutability over other lineages, bringing new threat to human health.

At laparoscopy, the small intestine was run to exclude the presence of midgut volvulus. In six cases, normal rotation was confirmed and no abnormal pathology was found. Two proceeded to laparotomy and underwent correction of malrotation. All infants recovered without complication. CONCLUSION Laparoscopy is an excellent modality for further investigation of infants presenting acutely in whom intestinal malrotation cannot be formally excluded radiologically. The positive identification of the DJ flexure and cecum in correct anatomical sites, both fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, provides adequate reassurance of low risk of volvulus and avoids a full laparotomy. We recommend diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of inconclusive upper gastrointestinal contrast study.","output":"Diagnostic laparoscopy to exclude malrotation following inconclusive upper gastrointestinal contrast study in infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW Food insecurity can have a negative health impact for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period; however, there are a range of barriers to meeting nutritional guidelines during pregnancy. Food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications and mental and physical health outcomes. This review aims to provide insight into programmes and interventions which have targeted food insecurity in pregnant and early postpartum women. The central research question for this review is as follows: What programmes and interventions have sought to address food insecurity among pregnant and postpartum women? A systematic search of five electronic databases including Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, Embase, and Cochrane was undertaken on August 2021. Key thematic areas searched were food insecurity, pregnancy, nutritional outcomes, and interventions or programmes. Only studies that were published since 2000 in English were considered. RECENT FINDINGS Eleven studies were included in this review. Studies employed a range of methods and outcomes measures. They were conducted in mostly low- and middle-income countries, and in general, focused on nutritional supplementation, with some studies also incorporating nutrition education or counselling. The findings of this review suggest that while there are a range of possible interventions that seek to address food insecurity and hunger among pregnant and postpartum women, the limited number of robust evaluations or long-term interventions mean that evidence for any one intervention type is limited. Furthermore, the programmes and interventions that do exist are generally embedded within a single context or structure, and as such, may not be able to be widely implemented.

Deciphering viral-host protein interactions is essential for understanding the flavivirus life cycle as well as development of effective antiviral strategies. To uncover novel host factors that are co-opted by multiple flaviviruses, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome wide knockout (KO) screen was employed to identify genes required for replication of Zika virus (ZIKV). Receptor for Activated Protein C Kinase 1 (RACK1) was identified as a novel host factor required for ZIKV replication, which was confirmed via complementary experiments. Depletion of RACK1 via siRNA demonstrated that RACK1 is important for replication of a wide range of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, including West Nile Virus (WNV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Powassan Virus (POWV) and Langat Virus (LGTV) as well as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, but not for YFV, EBOV, VSV or HSV. Notably, flavivirus replication was only abrogated when RACK1 expression was dampened prior to infection. Utilising a non-replicative flavivirus model, we show altered morphology of viral replication factories and reduced formation of vesicle packets (VPs) in cells lacking RACK1 expression. In addition, RACK1 interacted with NS1 protein from multiple flaviviruses; a key protein for replication complex formation. Overall, these findings reveal RACK1s crucial role to the biogenesis of pan-flavivirus replication organelles. IMPORTANCE Cellular factors are critical in all facets of viral lifecycles, where overlapping interactions between the virus and host can be exploited as possible avenues for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening approach to identify novel cellular factors important for flavivirus replication we identified RACK1 as a pro-viral host factor for both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2. Using an innovative flavivirus protein expression system, we demonstrate for the first time the impact of the loss of RACK1 on the formation of viral replication factories known as 'vesicle packets' (VPs). In addition, we show that RACK1 can interact with numerous flavivirus NS1 proteins as a potential mechanism by which VP formation can be induced by the former.","output":"Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Identifies RACK1 as a Critical Host Factor for Flavivirus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

However, the intrinsic low reversible conversion ability of lithium polysuldes to sulfur/Li2S during charging/discharging seriously hinder the sulfur utilization, resulting in poor cycling life of batteries. Herein we report an improvement of core-shell structured sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin ?-MnO2 nanosheets electrode materials prepared by a simple precipitation reaction method, in which the ultrathin ?-MnO2 nanosheets as a catalytic layer can promote the chemical adsorption of lithium polysuldes and their conversion rates to sulfur/Li2S. Using a combination of UV-visible adsorption spectra and rst-principles calculation, the results indicate that the Mn-O coordination center on the surface of MnO2 structure plays an efficient catalytic role in the conversion reaction of lithium polysuldes to insoluble S/Li2S. The sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin ?-MnO2 nanosheets composite with a high S mass ratio of 82 wt % reveal a high specic capacity of 846 mAh g-1 at 1C rate and good cycling stability. Moreover, the areal capacity of the electrode with high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm-2 is 5.2 mAh cm-2 , approaching the practical application standard at a current density of 1 mA cm-2.","output":"A Core-Shell structured Sulfur Cathode: Ultrathin ?-MnO2 Nanosheets as Catalytic Conversion Shell for Lithium Polysulfides in High-Sulfur Content Lithium-Sulfur Batteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of selecting appropriate air pollution monitoring sites in a city is vital for accurately reporting air quality, enhancing the quality of high-resolution modelling and informing policy to implement measures to deliver cleaner air in the urban environment. COVID-19 restrictions impacted air quality in urban centres worldwide as reduced mobility led to changes in traffic-related air pollution (TRAP). As such, it offered a unique dataset to examine the spatial and temporal variations in air quality between monitoring stations in Dublin, Ireland. Firstly, an analysis of mobility data showed reductions across almost all sectors after COVID-19 restrictions came into place, which was expected to lower TRAP. In addition, similar changes in air quality were evident to other cities around the world: reductions in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and an increase in ozone (O3) concentrations. Average daily and diurnal concentrations for these three pollutants presented more statistically significant spatial and temporal changes during COVID-19 restrictions at monitoring sites with urban or traffic classifications than suburban background sites. Furthermore, substantial reductions in the range of average hourly pollutant concentrations were observed, 79% for PM2.5 and 75% for NO2, with a modest 24% reduction for O3. Correlation analysis of air pollution between monitoring sites and years demonstrated an improvement in the R2 for NO2 concentrations only, suggesting that spatiotemporal homogeneity was most notable for this TRAP due to mobility restrictions during COVID-19. The spatiotemporal representativeness of monitoring stations across the city will change with greener transport, and air quality during COVID-19 can provide a benchmark to support the introduction of new policies for cleaner air.","output":"Spatiotemporal representativeness of air pollution monitoring in Dublin, Ireland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of psychological distress This study evaluates the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs in a national paediatric referral centre METHODS: This was a survey-based study that collected demographic, work environment and mental health data from paediatric HCWs in the emergency, intensive care and infectious disease units Psychological impact was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with psychological distress RESULTS: The survey achieved a response rate of 93 9% (430 of 458) Of the 430 respondents, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were reported in 168 (39 1%), 205 (47 7%) and 106 (24 7%), respectively Depression was reported in the mild (47, 10 9%), moderate (76, 17 7%), severe (23, 5 3%) and extremely severe (22, 5 1%) categories Anxiety (205, 47 7%) and stress (106, 24 7%) were reported in the mild category only Collectively, regression analysis identified female sex, a perceived lack of choice in work scope/environment, lack of protection from COVID-19, lack of access to physical activities and rest, the need to perform additional tasks, and the experience of stigma from the community as risk factors for poor psychological outcome CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was reported among frontline paediatric HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic Personal psychoneuroimmunity and organisational prevention measures can be implemented to lessen psychiatric symptoms At the national level, involving mental health professionals to plan and coordinate psychological intervention for the country should be considered","output":"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we report a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and dengue coinfection, presented as a fatal stroke in our hospital, in S?o Jos do Rio Preto, S?o Paulo State, a Brazilian city hyperendemic for dengue viruses and other arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) and currently facing a surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level. Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540). Results. About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] smaller than .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Conclusions. Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.","output":"Pre-outbreak determinants of perceived risks of corona infection and preventive measures taken.

METHOD The DNT was primarily distributed for clinical use, with (72.8%) of individuals requesting access for clinical purposes. To assess reliability and validity of the DNT, anonymous data from DNT test administrations were analyzed and compared to a large, non-clinical normative sample from TMB. RESULTS DNT test scores showed acceptable to very good split-half reliability (.68-.99). Factor analysis revealed three latent factors, corresponding to processing speed, working memory, and a broader general cognitive ability factor that included perceptual reasoning and episodic memory. Average test scores were slightly poorer for the DNT sample than for the TMB comparison sample, as expected given the clinical use of the DNT. CONCLUSIONS Initial estimates of reliability and validity of DNT tests support their use as digital measures of neuropsychological functioning.

Little is known about the extent of use, forms, or effectiveness of AHD in Post-graduate medical education. This scoping review summarizes existing literature and describes the learning outcomes, according to the Kirkpatrick model of learning evaluation, of AHD experiences on Post-graduate medical trainees. Methods Authors used Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework, searching electronic scientific literature databases from the years of 1977-2019 with relevant key terms and identifying 735 papers. Two independent raters completed title/abstract screening and then extracted pertinent data from papers meeting specified criteria. Results Authors identified 38 relevant papers published in English, originating from programs in US (n = 19) and Canada (n = 19), spanning 4 disciplines: Medicine (n = 17, 45%), Pediatrics (n = 10, 26%), Critical Care/Surgery (n = 9, 24%), Radiology (n = 2, 5%). A majority (n = 33, 87%) described specific educational experiences; most focused on residents only (n = 27). The educational experiences included various teaching strategies; few were didactics only (n = 4) and most were multi-modal including simulation, case-based learning, problem-based learning, and/or self-directed online study. AHD size ranged from 5 to 364 participants (median 39). AHD length was 1.5-6 h (median 3). Required resources were inconsistently described. When evaluations of the specific educational experience were reported (n = 35 studies), the majority of studies used weak research designs (e.g., one group, pre/post-test, n = 19); few studies used strong research designs (e.g., randomized controlled trial, n = 2). Positive effects of AHD ranged across Kirkpatrick levels 1-3 learner outcomes. Conclusions The composition and content of AHD in Post-graduate medical education vary.

The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has, to date, been effectively contained in China, but the threat of imported cases and local risks still exist. The systematic identification of the viruss path of influence and intensity is significant for economic recovery. This study is based on a refined multi-regional general equilibrium analysis model, which measures the economic and industrial impacts at different epidemic risk levels in China and simulates development trends and the degree of damage to industries and the economy under changes to supplies of production materials and product demand. The results show that, at the macroeconomic level, Chinas GDP will decline about 0.4% to 0.8% compared to normal in 2020, with an average drop of about 2% in short-term consumption, an average drop in employment of about 0.7%, and an average increase in prices of about 0.9%. At the industry level, the epidemic will have the greatest short-term impact on consumer and laborintensive industries. For example, the output value of the service industry will fall 6.3% compared to normal. Looking at the impact of the epidemic on the industrial system, the province most affected by the epidemic is Hubei, which is the only province in China in the level-1 risk category. As the disease spread outward from Hubei, there were clear differences in the main industries that were impacted in different regions. In addition, simulation results of recovery intensity of regional economies under the two epidemic response scenarios of resumption of work and production and active fiscal stimulus policies show that an increase in fiscal stimulus policies produces a 0.3% higher rate of gross regional product growth but it causes commodity prices to rise by about 1.8%.

DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition.

METHODS: INTERACT3 is a pragmatic, international, multicenter, stepped-wedge (4 phases/3 steps), cluster-randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a multifaceted care package in adult (age  18 years) patients (target 8360) with acute ICH (< 6 h of onset) recruited from 110 hospitals (average of 19 consecutive patients per phase) in low- and middle-income countries. After a control phase, each hospital implements the intervention (intensive BP lowering, target systolic < 140 mmHg; glucose control, target 6.1C7.8 mmol/L and 7.8C10.0 mmol/L in those without and with diabetes mellitus, respectively; anti-pyrexia treatment to target body temperature  37.5 C; and reversal of anticoagulation, target international normalized ratio < 1.5 within 1 h). Information will be obtained on demographic and baseline clinical characteristics, in-hospital management, and 7-day outcomes. Central trained blinded assessors will conduct telephone interviews to assess physical function and health-related quality of life at 6 months. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 months analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. The sample size of 8360 subjects provides 90% power ( = 0.05) to detect a 5.6% absolute improvement (shift) in the primary outcome of the intervention versus control standard care, with various assumptions.

Although post-LSG gastric stenosis (GS) is less frequent, it has not been well defined and lacks standardized management procedures. The objective of the present study was to describe a series of patients with GS symptoms after LSG and to develop a standardized management procedure for this complication. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients presenting with GS after LSG procedures performed between January 2008 and March 2014. The primary efficacy criterion was the frequency of post-LSG GS. GS was classified as functional (i.e. a gastric twist) or organic. The secondary efficacy criteria included the time interval between LSG and diagnosis of GS, the type of stenosis, the type of management, and the follow-up data. RESULTS During the study period, 1210 patients underwent primary or secondary LSG. Seventeen patients had post-operative symptoms of GS (1.4%); one patient had achalasia that had not been diagnosed preoperatively and thus was excluded from our analysis. The median time interval between LSG and diagnosis of GS was 47.2 days (1-114). Eleven patients had organic GS and six had functional GS. Seven patients required nutritional support. Endoscopic treatment was successful in 15 patients (88.2%) after balloon dilatation (n = 13) or insertion of a covered stent (n = 2). Two of the 15 patients required conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (11.8%). CONCLUSION GS after LSG is a rare complication but requires standardized management. Most cases can be treated successfully with endoscopic balloon dilatation.","output":"Gastric Stenosis After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: Diagnosis and Management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding peoples knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding a new infectious disease is crucial to the prevention and control of it. Human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) was first identified on March 31, 2013 in China. Out of the total number of 134 cases confirmed from March to September 2013 in China, Zhejiang Province saw the greatest number (46 cases). OBJECTIVE: This study employed a mobile Internet survey to assess KAP regarding H7N9 among mobile phone users in Zhejiang Province. This study intended to examine KAP by region and the association between sociodemographic variables and KAP. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A cross-sectional survey was executed through a mobile Internet application platform of China Unicom in 5 regions in Zhejiang Province. Stratified and clustered sampling methods were applied and mobile phone users were invited to participate in the study voluntarily. RESULTS: A total of 9582 eligible mobile phone users participated in the survey with a response rate of 1.92% (9582/5,000,000). A total of 9105 valid responses (95.02%) were included for statistical analysis. Generally, more than three-quarters of the participants had some basic knowledge of H7N9 and held the attitude recommended by the Zhejiang CDC toward eating cooked poultry (77.55%, 7061/9105) and visiting a hospital at the occurrence of symptoms (78.51%, 7148/9105). Approximately half of the participants worried about contracting H7N9, and took preventive practices recommended by the Zhejiang CDC. But only 14.29% (1301/9105) of participants kept eating cooked poultry as usual. Although worry about H7N9 infection did not differ by region, Hangzhou saw the largest proportion of participants with knowledge of H7N9, which was probably because Hangzhou had the greatest number of H7N9 cases. KAP varied by some sociodemographic variables. Female participants were more likely to know about symptoms of H7N9 (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61), to worry about contracting it (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27), and to report their lives being influenced by it (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15-1.41). They were also more likely to take the recommended precautions. Male participants and younger participants were less likely to comply with advocated protective practices.

Some who had an apparently 'mild' COVID-19 infection continue to suffer from persistent symptoms, including chest pain, breathlessness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, paraesthesia, muscle and joint pains. This has been labelled 'long COVID'. This paper reports the experiences of doctors with long COVID. METHODS: A qualitative study; interviews with doctors experiencing persistent symptoms were conducted by telephone or video call. Interviews were transcribed and analysis conducted using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen doctors participated. The following themes are reported: making sense of symptoms, feeling let down, using medical knowledge and connections, wanting to help and be helped, combining patient and professional identity. Experiencing long COVID can be transformative: many expressed hope that good would come of their experiences. Distress related to feelings of being 'let down' and the hard work of trying to access care. Participants highlighted that they felt better able to care for, and empathize with, patients with chronic conditions, particularly where symptoms are unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the literature on the experiences of doctors as patients, in particular where evidence is emerging and the patient has to take the lead in finding solutions to their problems and accessing their own care.

However, systemic administration of higher dosages of doxorubicin is hampered by its toxic side effects. In this study, we aim to increase doxorubicin deposition in the primary breast tumour without changing systemic doxorubicin concentration and thus without interfering with systemic efficacy and toxicity. This is to be achieved by combining Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox, Celsion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA) with mild local hyperthermia, induced by Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU). When heated above 39.5C, LTLD releases a high concentration of doxorubicin intravascularly within seconds. In the absence of hyperthermia, LTLD leads to a similar biodistribution and antitumour efficacy compared with conventional doxorubicin. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-arm phase I study in 12 chemotherapy-na?ve patients with de novo stage IV HER2-negative breast cancer. Previous endocrine treatment is allowed. Study treatment consists of up to six cycles of LTLD at 21-day intervals, administered during MR-HIFU-induced hyperthermia to the primary tumour. We will aim for 60 min of hyperthermia at 40C-42C using a dedicated MR-HIFU breast system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada). Afterwards, intravenous cyclophosphamide will be administered. Primary endpoints are safety, tolerability and feasibility. The secondary endpoint is efficacy, assessed by radiological response.This approach could lead to optimal loco-regional control with less extensive or even no surgery, in de novo stage IV patients and in stage II/III patients allocated to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Ag-RDTs are more rapid, but less reliable in terms of sensitivity, and real-life data on their performance in comparison with the real time RT-PCR test are lacking. Methods: We aimed at assessing the diagnostic performance of the third-generation antigenic swab LumiraDx? compared with real time RT-PCR in a retrospective cohort study at the Infectious Diseases Unit of Padua. All of the patients who were consecutively tested for SARS-CoV-2 in our centre (by both real time RT-PCR and Ag-RTD LumiraDx(TM)) from 19 January to 30 May 2021, were included.

Results: Among the 282 patients included, 80.9% (N = 228) tested positive to real time RT-PCR, and among these, 174 tested positive also to LumiraDx?. Compared with real time RT-PCR, which is considered as the gold standard for the assessment of the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, LumiraDx? showed an overall sensitivity of 76.3% and specificity of 94.4%.

METHODS: NVL measured through the Nucleocapsid and RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase genes and sgRNA RT-PCRs were performed in 2 consecutive swabs from 84 health-care workers. RESULTS: NVL provided similar and accurate quantities of both genes of SARS-CoV-2 at two different time-points of infection, overcoming Ct-value and swab collection variability. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, 51.19% were sgRNA-positive in the 1 (st)RT-PCR and 5.95% in the 2 (nd)RT-PCR. All sgRNA-positive samples had >4log(10)RNAcopies/1000cells, while samples with 1log(10) NVL were sgRNA-negative.

Results: Of 16 patients (median [range] age, 38 [25-89] years; 13 [81%] women), 14 patients self-identified as White and 2 as Asian. The delayed localized cutaneous reactions developed in a median (range) of 7 (2-12) days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. These reactions occurred at or near the injection site and were described as pruritic, painful, and edematous pink plaques. None of the participants had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Results of a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated a mild predominantly perivascular mixed infiltrate with lymphocytes and eosinophils, consistent with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction. Of participants who had a reaction to first vaccine dose (15 of 16 patients), most (11 patients) developed a similar localized injection-site reaction to the second vaccine dose; most (10 patients) also developed the second reaction sooner as compared with the first-dose reaction. Conclusions and Relevance: Clinical and histopathologic findings of this case series study indicate that the localized injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. These reactions may occur sooner after the second dose, but they are self-limited and not associated with serious vaccine adverse effects. In contrast to immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, urticaria), these delayed reactions (dubbed \\"COVID arm\\") are not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination.","output":"Delayed Localized Hypersensitivity Reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rare diseases occur globally during every stage of life. Patients, families, and caregivers have many unmet medical and social needs leading to extraordinary psychosocial and economic burdens. Efforts to improve diagnostic capabilities and to develop therapies for an estimated 7000 rare diseases have met with considerable success. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is one affecting fewer than 200,000 people. In the European Union (EU) a rare disease is any disease affecting fewer than 5 people in 10,000 (less than1 in 2000 people).However, more than 90 percent of rare diseases have no effective treatments available . A need exists to expand awareness, advocacy, and outreach to everyone including those with low incomes, poor literacy, minority ethnic status, and living in underserved and marginalized populations in urban and rural areas as well as in developing nations throughout the world. The acceptance of patients as research partners complements the increased research emphasis and major regulatory initiatives leading to expedited review and approval programs for products for serious or life-threatening conditions. The pipeline of new therapies provides hope to untreated patients. Advances in medical bioinformatics, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning with access to big data continue to identify novel therapeutics for screening and evaluation.

In Saudi Arabia, there is a paucity of studies on the factors associated with early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. AIMS: We aimed to assess the exclusive breastfeeding rates and to identify the risk factors for early breastfeeding cessation at maternal and institutional levels. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective observational study carried out at King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: It included all postpartum women who had given birth to full term, singleton, healthy newborns, and were breastfeeding before discharge. Data were collected before discharge, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks postpartum using an adapted instrument. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Using JMP14 software with appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: The study included 136 mothers, of whom 37.5% were exclusively breastfeeding in the first 2 weeks; this rate dropped to 19% with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001). Early breastfeeding cessation was significantly associated with maternal age, health status, mother's knowledge, and attitude, in addition to other modifiable factors that was encountered during hospital stay such as latching difficulties and introduction of formula feeding. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported low exclusive breastfeeding rates in the first 2 months postpartum among Saudi mothers. Multiple factors were associated with breastfeeding, and some are modifiable.

The main aim of the study was to determine the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (800 mg daily, p.o.) on the lipid profile of 30 selected patients. The patients were managed over a period of 180 days with diagnosis and treatment given daily for the study duration. During a specified three visits, vitals and blood samples were collected initially and for follow up, and blood plasma was processed for triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high- density lipo-proteins (HDL) were measured. The lipid indices were calculated using these values and apolipoprotein B, and C-II were evaluated. The blood flow rate was also measured in the retina of the eyes using a laser doppler flowmetry. The heparin-lipoprotein lipase (HP-LPL) was also estimated using standard procedures. Genotyping of S447X was also done. Findings showed that LDL, HDL and Casteli II lipogenic index were elevated with the duration of administration of DHA and EPA while TG, total cholesterol (TC), and other lipogenic markers: Casteli I, Apo CII and Atherogenic indices were lowered with repeat visits and continued use of DHA and EPA combined with exercise and diet plan. The HP-LPL activity was also increased with each subsequent visit and study. In conclusion, the regimen significantly improved blood flow rate, lipid profile and lowered the risk for cardiovascular events in the selected study subjects.

Here, we proposed a hierarchical graphical model to estimate TF activity from mRNA expression by building TF complexes with protein cofactors and inferring TFs downstream regulatory network simultaneously. Then we applied our model on flower development and circadian rhythm processes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The computational results show that the sequence specific bHLH family TF HFR1 recruits the chromatin regulator HAC1 to flower development master regulator TF AG and further activates AGs expression by histone acetylation. Both independent data and experimental results supported this discovery. We also found a flower tissue specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak at AG gene body and a HFR1 motif in the center of this H3K27ac peak. Furthermore, we verified that HFR1 physically interacts with HAC1 by yeast two-hybrid experiment. This HFR1CHAC1CAG triplet relationship may imply that flower development and circadian rhythm are bridged by epigenetic regulation and enrich the classical ABC model in flower development.

We tested the capability of the raw (RBC) and Fe-impregnated (FeBC) biochars to immobilize As in a paddy soil under various Eh conditions (from -400 to +300 mV) using a biogeochemical microcosm system.

The laryngeal anatomy of young children makes them particularly susceptible to upper airway obstruction, and during acute infections this is exacerbated by inflammation and edema of the airway mucosa. The most common cause of infective upper airway obstruction in children is viral laryngotracheobronchitis, or croup, which is usually a mild and self-limiting illness, but management with corticosteroids may still be necessary. Bacterial causes of upper airway obstruction have fortunately become rare since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) immunization, but a few cases of epiglottitis do still occur due to nonimmunization, vaccine failure, and infection with non-HiB organisms. These cases constitute a medical emergency due to the risk of rapid progression to complete airway obstruction. Other rare conditions are discussed including bacterial tracheitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal, and peritonsillar abscesses. Key learning points in this chapter include the main discriminating factors of the various causes of infective upper airway obstruction, the importance of a calm and minimally distressing approach to the child presenting with stridor, and the need for early anesthetic team involvement in cases with a suspected bacterial etiology or signs of impending airway obstruction.","output":"23 Acute Infections That Produce Upper Airway Obstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing and impacting lives on a global scale In this paper, we introduce a mean-field game model in controlling the propagation of epidemics on a spatial domain The control variable, the spatial velocity, is first introduced for the classical disease models, such as the SIR model For this proposed model, we provide fast numerical algorithms based on proximal primal-dual methods Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model illustrates how to separate infected patients in a spatial domain effectively ? 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","output":"Controlling propagation of epidemics via mean-field control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has inevitably changed the treatment of many chronic diseases which has been suspended or has suffered dangerous slowdowns.

However, despite the fact that a large number of genetically diverse SL-CoV sequences have been detected in bats, only two strains (named WIV1 and WIV16) have been successfully cultured in vitro These two strains differ from SARS-CoV only in containing an extra open reading frame (ORF) (named ORFX), between ORF6 and ORF7, which has no homology to any known protein sequences. In this study, we constructed a full-length cDNA clone of SL-CoV WIV1 (rWIV1), an ORFX deletion mutant (rWIV1-X), and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mutant (rWIV1-GFP-X). Northern blotting and fluorescence microscopy indicate that ORFX was expressed during WIV1 infection. A virus infection assay showed that rWIV1-X replicated as efficiently as rWIV1 in Vero E6, Calu-3, and HeLa-hACE2 cells. Further study showed that ORFX could inhibit interferon production and activate NF-B.

After all population analyses, patients were analyzed separately according to the type of treatment, multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), and according to age group. RESULTS: Faster aspart significantly improved metabolic control, increasing time in range (TIR) (42 vs.54%, respectively; P = 0.007) and decreasing time above range (TAR) (52 vs.40%, respectively; P = 0.009), without an increased time in hypoglycemia (7% before and after faster asparts introduction; P = 0.933).

Occurrence of fear, anxiety and depression were measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS) on fear, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), respectively. A total of 2299 eligible participants were enrolled from the authors institution, including 2042 medical staff and 257 administrative staff. The severity of fear, anxiety and depression were significantly different between two groups. Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a single tertiary academic medical center. Adult patients admitted between March 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020 who tested positive for COVID-19 were included. Demographic and hospital outcome data were collected. Code status orders during this admission and prior admissions were trended. Data were analyzed with multivariable analysis to identify predictors of code status choice. Results: A total of 720 patients were included. The majority (70%) were full code and 12% were in do-not-attempt resuscitation (DNAR) status on admission; by discharge, 20% were DNAR. Age (p < 0.001), time in the intensive care unit (ICU) (p < 0.001), and having Medicaid (p = 0.04) compared to private insurance were predictors of DNAR. Fourteen percent had no code status order. Older age (p < 0.001), time in the ICU (p = 0.01), and admission to a teaching service (p < 0.001) were associated with having an order. Of patients with a prior admission (n = 227), 33.5% previously had no code status order and 44.5% had a different code status for their COVID-19 admission. Of those with a change, most transitioned to less aggressive resuscitation preferences. Conclusions: Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in our study elected to be full code.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of virtual CT sonography for radiofrequency ablation of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma poorly defined on B-mode sonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred one patients enrolled in the study were separated into two groups. Fifty-one patients with 65 hepatocellular carcinomas underwent prospective virtual CT sonography as guidance for radiofrequency ablation. Fifty patients with 63 hepatocellular carcinomas managed with B-mode sonographic guidance were retrospectively selected under the same conditions as the virtual CT sonography group to act as a historical control group. RESULTS In the virtual CT sonography group, technically successful ablation was achieved in a single session in 92% (47/51) of the patients and in two sessions in 8% (4/51). In the B-mode sonography group, technical success was achieved in a single session in 72% (36/50) of the patients, in two sessions in 24% (12/50), and in three sessions in 4% (2/50). Treatment analysis showed that the technical success rate after a single treatment session was significantly (p = 0.017) higher for the virtual CT sonography group. The number of treatment sessions was significantly (p = 0.021) lower for the virtual CT sonography group (mean, 1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 1.3 +/- 0.3 sessions).

METHODS Based on a systematic literature search, hospital-based studies published between January 1990 and September 2015 were selected when they reported the prevalence of total, mild, and major post-stroke NCD diagnosed by using specified criteria. Factors affecting prevalence were assessed using meta-regression analysis. RESULTS Among the 7,440 references evaluated, 16 hospital-based studies were selected, corresponding to a total of 3,087 patients. The overall prevalence of total post-stroke NCD was 53.4% (95% CI: 46.9-59.8): 36.4% for mild post-stroke NCD (95% CI: 29-43.8) and 16.5% (95% CI: 12.1-20.8) for major post-stroke NCD. The overall prevalence was mainly influenced by the threshold score used for categorization (p = 0.0001) and, in the subgroup of studies using a conservative threshold (i.e., 7th percentile), by the recurrent stroke rate (p = 0.0005). The prevalence of major post-stroke NCD was mainly influenced by age (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION More than half of stroke survivors experience post-stroke NCD, corresponding to mild post-stroke NCD in two-thirds of cases and major post-stroke NCD in one-third of cases.

METHODS: Between March and April 2020, old adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (single or recurrent episode) as defined by the DSM-5 were recruited from psychiatric clinics or inpatient wards, whereas 31 healthy older adults without a history of depression or other psychiatric illnesses were recruited from voluntary organisations or elderly community centres. Their depressive symptoms, perceived severity of the pandemic, perceived time spent on receiving related information, perceived health, levels of loneliness, perceived coping efficacy, suicidal ideation, and the level of symptomatic responses to a specific traumatic stressor in the past week were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 21 men and 43 women aged 61 to 89 years were interviewed through telephone by trained research assistants. Of them, 33 were older adults with LLD (cases) and 31 were healthy older adults (controls). Older people with LLD had a higher level of suicidal ideation than healthy controls, after controlling for the level of depression and medical comorbidity (F (1, 59) = 5.72, p = 0.020). Regression analyses showed that coping efficacy and loneliness accounted for a significant portion of the variance in suicidal ideation, and loneliness significantly predicted the level of stress. Mediation analyses reveal an indirect effect between group and suicidal ideation through coping efficacy (Z = 2.43, p = 0.015).

However, there is no current objective standard to assess the educational quality of these user-uploaded videos. A new approach was used to objectively validate these videos by comparing them to high quality educational sources for the seven most commonly used nerve blocks. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the educational quality of user-uploaded videos when compared to the highest quality anesthesia society websites (NYSORA, ACEP, USRA). METHODS: After reviewing the instructional material available for the seven most frequently conducted nerve blocks on high-quality reference websites, we documented the educational characteristics present including such things as indications, volume, anatomy, etc. Next we reviewed the five most popular videos on YouTube for each block (by views) and documented the presence or absence of these educational characteristics. RESULTS: Eighteen educational characteristics were documented in the \\"high-quality\\" anesthesia society reference material. Correlation was sought between this material and YouTube videos. Although there were varying degrees of correlation between the high quality sources and the videos, rarely did YouTube videos contain as high a percentage of these educational characteristics as the well-established sources. Some videos contained very few of these important educational characteristics.

Supplemental oxygen therapy is a risk factor for chronic respiratory symptoms in infants with BPD. Hyperoxia induces cell injury and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin) is a DAMP which binds Clec9a, a C-type lectin selectively expressed on CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs). Co-stimulation of Clec9a and TLR3 induces maximal proinflammatory responses. We have shown that neonatal hyperoxia (a model of BPD) increases lung IL-12+Clec9a+CD103+ DCs, pro-inflammatory responses and airway hyperreactivity following rhinovirus (RV) infection. CD103+ DCs and Clec9a are required for these responses. Hyperoxia increases F-actin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We hypothesized that the F-actin severing protein gelsolin attenuates neonatal hyperoxia-induced Clec9a+CD103+ DC-dependent pro-inflammatory responses to RV and preserves alveolarization. We exposed neonatal mice to hyperoxia and treated them with gelsolin intranasally. Subsequently we inoculated the mice with RV intranasally. Alternatively, we inoculated normoxic neonatal mice with BALF from hyperoxia-exposed mice (hyperoxic BALF), RV and gelsolin. We analyzed lung gene expression two days after RV infection. For in vitro studies, lung CD11c+ cells were isolated from C57BL/6J or Clec9agfp-/- mice and incubated with hyperoxic BALF and RV. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In neonatal mice, gelsolin blocked hyperoxia-induced Il12p40, TNF- and IFN-?3 mRNA and protein expression in response to RV infection. Similar effects were observed when gelsolin was co-administered with hyperoxic BALF and RV. Gelsolin decreased F-actin levels in hyperoxic BALF in vitro and inhibited hyperoxia-induced D103lo DC expansion and inflammation in vivo. Gelsolin also attenuated hyperoxia-induced hypoalveolarization. Further, incubation of lung CD11c+ cells from WT and Clec9agfp-/- mice with hyperoxic BALF and RV, showed Clec9a is required for maximal hyperoxic BALF and RV induced IL-12 expression in CD103+ DCs. Finally, in tracheal aspirates from mechanically ventilated human preterm infants the F-actin to gelsolin ratio positively correlates with FiO2, and gelsolin levels decrease during the first two weeks of mechanical ventilation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a promising role for gelsolin, administered by inhalation into the airway to treat RV-induced exacerbations of BPD and prevent chronic lung disease.","output":"Gelsolin Attenuates Neonatal Hyperoxia-Induced Inflammatory Responses to Rhinovirus Infection and Preserves Alveolarization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The currently known animal reservoir for MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel. The clinical pattern of the MERS-CoV field infection in dromedary camels is not yet fully studied well. Some pathological changes and the detection of the MERS-CoV antigens by immunohistochemistry have been recently reported. However, the nature of these changes by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) was not revealed. The objective of this study was to document some changes in the respiratory organs induced by the natural MERS-CoV infection using the SEM. We previously identified three positive animals naturally infected with MERS-CoV and two other negative animals. Previous pathological studies on the positive animals showed varying degrees of alterations. MERS-CoV-S and MERS-CoV-Nc proteins were detected in the organs of positive animals. In the current study, we used the same tissues and sections for the SEM examination. We established a histopathology lesion scoring system by the SEM for the nasal turbinate and trachea. Our results showed various degrees of involvement per animal. The main observed characteristic findings are massive ciliary loss, ciliary disorientation, and goblet cell hyperplasia, especially in the respiratory organs, particularly the nasal turbinate and trachea in some animals. The lungs of some affected animals showed signs of marked interstitial pneumonia with damage to the alveolar walls. The partial MERS-CoV-S gene sequencing from the nasal swabs of some dromedary camels admitted to this slaughterhouse confirms the circulating strains belong to clade-B of MERS-CoV. These results confirm the respiratory tropism of the virus and the detection of the virus in the nasal cavity.

METHODS Trained USPs visited 5 clinical settings: information desks, registration desks, two outpatient departments and the emergency departments in 10 hospitals across 3 cities of Inner Mongolia, China. USPs observed the hospital air ventilation and distance from the nearest hand-washing facilities to each clinical setting, then mimicked symptoms of either tuberculosis or influenza before observing the HCW's behavior. A total of 480 clinical-setting assessments were made by 19 USPs. RESULTS The overall adequacy of triage services was 86.7% and for prevention of the spread of airborne droplets was 83.5%. Almost all hospitals offered adequate air ventilation. Compared to the information desk, adequacy of triage and preventing the spread of airborne droplets by physicians in the three clinical departments was less likely to be adequate. Triage services for USPs simulating symptoms of influenza were 2.6 times more likely to be adequate than for those simulating symptoms of tuberculosis but there was no significant difference in the prevention of the spread of airborne droplets.

Epidemic risk analysis can help in rapidly predicting potentially serious outcomes and flagging the need for rapid response. We developed a multifactorial risk analysis tool EpiRisk to provide rapid insight into the potential severity of emerging epidemics by combining disease-related parameters and country-related risk parameters. An initial set of 18 disease and country-related risk parameters was reduced to 14 following qualitative discussions and the removal of highly correlated parameters by a correlation and clustering analysis. Of the remaining parameters, three risk levels were assigned ranging from low (1) moderate (2) and high (3). The total risk score for an outbreak of a given disease in a particular country is calculated by summing these 14 risk scores, and this sum is subsequently classified into one of four risk categories: low risk (<21), moderate risk (21C29), high risk (30C37) and extreme risk (>37). Total risk scores were calculated for nine retrospective outbreaks demonstrating an association with the actual impact of those outbreaks. We also evaluated to what extent the risk scores correlate with the number of cases and deaths in 61 additional outbreaks between 2002 and 2018, demonstrating positive associations with outbreak severity as measured by the number of deaths.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID-19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles. METHODS: This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented for COVID-19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri between March 2020 and September 2020. We classified and analyzed patients according to their pre-existing asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID-19 testing results. RESULTS: Patients suspected of having COVID-19 (N = 435) were enrolled in this study. The proportions of patients testing positive for COVID-19 were 69.2% and 81.9% in the groups with asthma and without asthma, respectively. The frequencies of relevant symptoms were similar between the groups with asthma with positive and negative COVID-19 test results. In the population diagnosed as having COVID-19 (n = 343), asthma was not associated with several indicators of COVID-19 severity, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, death due to COVID-19, and in-hospital mortality after multivariate adjustment. Patients with COVID-19 with asthma exhibited significantly lower levels of plasma interleukin-8 than patients without asthma (adjusted P = .02).

METHODS: A multicentric, retrospective analysis involving one public and two private hospitals in metropolitan Cairo, and two university hospitals in upper Egypt (Aswan and Assuit). Cases that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of mucormycosis, with a prior or concurrent COVID-19 infection, were included. RESULTS: Of the 26 patients included in the final analysis, 15 (57.7%) were from Cairo and 11 (42.3%) were from upper Egypt. Twenty-five patients (96.2%) had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and 20 (76.9%) had received corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19, of which 30.8% had mild or moderate disease. The median duration from COVID-19 till the onset of CAM was 20.5 days. No visual function could be detected in the affected eye of 16 patients (61.6%) on presentation. The mortality rate was 46.2% despite surgical debridement in half of the cases that died. CONCLUSION: CAM continues to be a concrete threat throughout Egypt, especially in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and those who inadvertently receive steroid therapy. It remains to be seen if increased vaccination coverage and early detection due to increased awareness would result in declining rates and adverse sequelae of CAM. A national registry would allow for better monitoring of the disease trends.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of a Series of COVID-Associated Mucormycosis Patients in Two Different Settings in Egypt Through the Third Pandemic Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the research on the analysis of the impact of social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on gaseous air pollutant concentrations. For this purpose, the authors presented (thermal maps) and analyzed the concentrations of selected gases such as NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 particles during the strict quarantine period in Poland and other EU countries. Statistical analysis of the concentration level of these gases was performed. It was noticed that in Poland, Germany, and France, the concentrations of such gases as CO, NO2, and PM2.5 particles decreased, while in Italy and Spain, the tendency was the opposite. To verify whether the discovered dependencies are not a natural continuation of the trends shaping the given phenomenon, the time series of gas and PM2.5 particle emissions were analyzed. On this basis, the emission forecast up to 2023 was created, using the ARIMA class models. The obtained results allowed to construct five scenarios for the development of NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 emissions until 2023, considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Studies were screened and then extracted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Narratives were synthesised and data pooled for global and continental prevalence and relative risk of severity and mortality in HIV-infected COVID-19 patients using random-effect model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa score, Eggers test and presented as funnel plots. ResultsA total of 46 studies were included involving 18,034,947 COVID-19 cases of which 31,269 were PLWH. The global prevalence of PLWH with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1% (95% CI = 0.9% -1.1%) with the highest prevalence observed in sub-Saharan Africa. The relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 severity was significant only in Africa (RR, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.08 - 1.24) while risk of COVID-19 mortality was 1.53% (95% CI = 1.45 - 2.03) globally. The prevalence of PLWH in COVID-19 cases was significantly low, and the calculated global risk ratio show that HIV infection may be linked with increased COVID-19 death.

Therefore, this study aims to provide more additional evidence for clinical work of talaromycosis. METHODS: To collect clinical information of patients with talaromycosis admitted to hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2020, retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics and prognosis, COX multivariate regression analysis was used for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled, including 76 males, 73 HIV-positive patients, with an average age of 40.1  13.0. Compared to HIV-positive group, the negative group had higher admission age (47.7  14.6 vs 38.1  11.9, p = 0.003) and lower proportion of male (89.0% vs 57.9%, p = 0.004), there was no significant difference in imaging of lungs. There were significantly more HIV-positive patients in those with pleural effusion (100% vs 69.4%, p = 0.001).

The risk of this occurring depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, transmission from pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to as non-symptomatic) infectious hosts can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. Here, by using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when non-symptomatic transmission can occur. We construct a branching process model that includes non-symptomatic transmission and explore the effects of interventions targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. We consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. We find that seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate non-symptomatic infected hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.","output":"Interventions targeting non-symptomatic cases can be important to prevent local outbreaks: SARS-CoV-2 as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in screening patients suspected of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Western population. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent chest CT because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were included. CT scans were prospectively evaluated by frontline general radiologists who were on duty at the time when the CT scan was performed and retrospectively assessed by a chest radiologist in an independent and blinded manner. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of the frontline general radiologists were compared to those of the chest radiologist using the McNemar test. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the frontline general radiologists were 89.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 71.8%, 97.7%], 32.1% (95% CI: 15.9%, 52.4%), 56.8% (95% CI: 41.0%, 71.7%), and 75.0% (95% CI: 42.8%, 94.5%), respectively.

The mathematical modeling platform developed for the Stockholm Paradigm (SP) indicates strongly that it has retro-colonized humans from an unidentified animal reservoir originally infected by humans. The relationship between Omicron and all other SARS-CoV-2 variants indicates oscillations among hosts, a core part of the SP. Such oscillations result from the emergence of novel variants following colonization of new hosts, replenishing and expanding the risk space for disease emergence. The SP predicts that pathogens colonize new hosts using pre-existing capacities. Those events are thus predictable to a certain extent.

The use of interstitial fluid (ISF) as a matrix for biomarkers has recently gained interest. This study aimed to compare levels of inflammatory markers in ISF from suction blister fluid (SBF) and plasma. METHODS: Plasma and SBF were collected from 18 healthy individuals. Samples were analyzed for 92 inflammation-related protein biomarkers by Proximity Extension Assay (PEA). Protein profiles in the two matrices were compared using traditional and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Out of 92 targeted proteins, 70 were successfully quantified in both plasma and SBF. Overall, plasma and SBF displayed distinct protein profiles with up to 40-fold difference in abundance of specific proteins. The levels of 25 proteins were significantly correlated between plasma and SBF and several of these were recognized as potential markers to monitor health using ISF. CONCLUSIONS: Skin ISF and plasma have unique protein profiles but many inflammatory markers are proportionally related between the matrices at the individual level.

This calls for the exploration of an alternative therapy. MAIN BODY: The anti-uropathogenic and bactericidal activity of many plant extracts was reported by many researchers, which involves only preliminary antibacterial studies using different basic techniques like disk diffusion, agar well diffusion, or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the crude plant extracts, but reports on the specific action of the phytoconstituents against uropathogens are limited. Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (cranberry) is the best-studied home remedy for UTI. Some evidences suggest that proanthocyanins present in cranberry, prevent bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, subsequently blocking the further steps of uropathogenesis. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are beneficial microorganisms that may act by the competitive exclusion principle to defend against infections in the urogenital tracts. Reports on potential vaccine agents and antibodies targeting the different toxins and effecter proteins are still obscure except uropathogenic E. coli.

Methods: Between March 24th and April 27th, 2020, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from 3,348 patients from nursing homes and assisted living facilities in 22 states in the US were tested by Capstone Healthcare for SARS-CoV-2, 24 other respiratory viruses, and 8 respiratory bacteria. Total nucleic acid was extracted with MagMAXTM Viral/Pathogen Ultra nucleic acid isolation kit. SARS-Co-V-2 was detected with the CDC 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel. Total nucleic acid was pre-amplified before analysis for other respiratory pathogens with Taqman OpenArrayTM Respiratory Tract Microbiota Plate. Results: Patients mean age was 76.9 years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 1,413 patients (42.2%). Among them, 1,082 (76.6%) and 737 (43.7%) patients were detected with at least one bacterium or another virus, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were more likely to have bacterial co-occurrences (76.6%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (70.0%) (p<0.0001). The most common co-occurring bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia, detected in 55.8% and 40.1% SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, respectively.

On 18 September, the Ethiopian Minister of Health advised the Parliament the possibility of reopening schools provided certain conditions were met. Schools are currently reopening in the country for the first time since March 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge and preventive health behaviours toward COVID-19 and associated factors among secondary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 370 secondary school students were included. Bivariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression model were fitted to identify the predictors of knowledge about COVID-19. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis were done to identify factors associated with preventive behaviour. A p<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: Only one-fourth (23.5%, 95% CI 19.5% to 28.1%) of the participants had a good knowledge about COVID-19. The mean score of preventive behaviour was 22.8SD 6.2. Marital status, religion, father education, living arrangement and sources of information were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Being female and using health professionals as source of information increased the engagement in preventive behaviours. On the other hand, student whose father employed in non-governmental organisation and other jobs had decreased engagement in preventive health behaviours. CONCLUSION: Significant number of the students had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and poorly engaged in COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Thus, it is suggested to include and disseminate about COVID-19 in related academic sessions, using school clubs and minimedias.

However, published studies on immunoprevalence are limited by small test cohorts, low frequencies of antigen-specific cells and lack of data correlating eluted HLA ligands with T-cell responsiveness. As the protective role of pre-existing cross-reactivity to homologous peptides is unclear, we aimed to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific minimal epitopes recognized by CD8 T-cells among 48 peptides eluted from prevalent HLA alleles, and an additional 84 predicted binders, in a large cohort of convalescents (n=83) and pre-pandemic control samples (n=19).

Only two of these were derived from the Spike protein, included in current vaccines. We found a strong correlation between immunoprevalence and immunodominance.

Current predictions of tropical biotic responses to global warming are based on correlations between species elevational distributions and temperatures. Because biotic attritions, range shifts, and mountaintop extinctions result from complex demographic processes, predictive models must be based on mechanistic associations between temperature and fitness. Our study combines long-term temperature records with experimental demography to determine the contribution of local adaptation to organismal resilience in a warming world. On the Barva volcano in Costa Rica, Cephaloleia belti (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) displays high-elevation (960-2,100 m asl) and low-elevation (50-960 m asl) mitochondrial haplotypes. We reared haplotype cohorts at temperatures prevalent along the elevational gradient (i.e., 10-30C). Based on ambient temperatures recorded every half hour for 4 years, we projected average instantaneous population growth rates ([Formula: see text]) at current and future temperatures (i.e., +1 to 6C) for each beetle haplotype. Haplotypes are adapted to local temperatures, but with a temperature increase beyond 2C, both haplotypes will face lower-elevation demographic attritions and extinctions. Upper distribution limits serve as potential elevational refugia from global warming.

General population studies, as well as insight into the outcomes for particular groups, will be necessary in order to mitigate potentially long-term effects as well as to prepare for future epidemics or pandemics. The pandemic conditions have been marked by rapid and abrupt changes and unpredictability which are circumstances that leave the autistic population particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes following the distinctive features of the diagnosis. Studies are only beginning to delineate the outcomes of the global autism community and the present study adds to these findings by providing a local, multi-perspective, qualitative analysis of the lived experiences of the Swedish autism community. In this study, autistic youth and adults, caregivers of autistic individuals, as well as representatives of Swedish interest organizations were interviewed. Thematic analysis was performed on the population as a whole and patterns of results were formalized according to the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF-CY). Participants report wide-ranging adverse outcomes of the pandemic relating to mental health and access to support, participation in daily activities and socialization, education, and work as well as parental resources. However, participants also report positive outcomes relating to a reduction in specific social and everyday demands, and normalization of lived experiences. Additionally, interviews outlined some strategies used to cope during pandemic conditions.

As the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin has been shown to have inconsistent roles in the incidence of NDs. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to evaluate the effect of metformin exposure on onset of NDs. METHODS The observational studies that investigated the associations between metformin and the incidence of NDs were searched in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. A random-effect model was performed using STATA to calculate the combined ORs. RESULTS In total, 23 comparisons out of 19 studies with 285 966 participants were included. Meta-analysis found there was no significant effect on incidence of all the subtypes of NDs with metformin exposure (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). However, metformin monotherapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of PD incidence compared with non-metformin users or glitazone users (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.42). CONCLUSION Metformin has failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on NDs. In addition, it may increase the risk of PD development. In light of current results, how metformin would impact NDs, especially the potential risk of PD, needs to be scrutinized. The underlying mechanisms are vital to achieve some more profound understanding on the regimen.

This virus has a broad spectrum of presentation that may overlap with Kawasaki disease in terms of presenting symptoms and laboratory and cardiac findings. Our objective was to review and summarise published evidence regarding the most important aspects of PIMS-TS, with special emphasis on the treatment strategies suggested for middle-income and low-income countries. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in the principal medical databases including PubMed, Embase (OVID) and Google Scholar between December 2019 and August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 69 articles were identified in the described databases. Altogether, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria and were eligible. The most frequently described symptoms of PIMS-TS include fever (82%), shock (67%) and gastrointestinal (87%), skin (71%) and cardiac disorders (75%). In most series, it has been observed between 4 and 6 weeks after the pandemic appears in the general population. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is presented as a great systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which sometimes presents as shock requiring fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drug support (26%). Several treatment strategies have been used, including immunoglobulin, steroids, aspirin, anakinra and anticoagulation among others. These general and specific interventions should be guided by an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary team, especially in settings with limited resources. CONCLUSIONS: PIMS-TS COVID-19 is a new type of presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an exaggerated inflammatory response and frequentbut not exclusivedigestive and myocardial involvement.

We aimed to describe microbiologically confirmed co-infections and secondary infections, and antimicrobial use, in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods: The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study is an ongoing, prospective cohort study recruiting inpatients from 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales, conducted by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium. Patients with a confirmed or clinician-defined high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion in the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study. For this specific study, we excluded patients with a recorded negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and those without a recorded outcome at 28 days after admission. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, therapeutic, and outcome data were collected using a prespecified case report form. Organisms considered clinically insignificant were excluded. Findings: We analysed data from 48 902 patients admitted to hospital between Feb 6 and June 8, 2020. The median patient age was 74 years (IQR 59-84) and 20 786 (426%) of 48 765 patients were female. Microbiological investigations were recorded for 8649 (177%) of 48 902 patients, with clinically significant COVID-19-related respiratory or bloodstream culture results recorded for 1107 patients. 762 (706%) of 1080 infections were secondary, occurring more than 2 days after hospital admission. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens causing respiratory co-infections (diagnosed &#8804;2 days after admission), with Enterobacteriaceae and S aureus most common in secondary respiratory infections. Bloodstream infections were most frequently caused by Escherichia coli and S aureus. Among patients with available data, 13 390 (370%) of 36 145 had received antimicrobials in the community for this illness episode before hospital admission and 39 258 (852%) of 46 061 patients with inpatient antimicrobial data received one or more antimicrobials at some point during their admission (highest for patients in critical care). We identified frequent use of broad-spectrum agents and use of carbapenems rather than carbapenem-sparing alternatives. Interpretation: In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, microbiologically confirmed bacterial infections are rare, and more likely to be secondary infections. Gram-negative organisms and S aureus are the predominant pathogens. The frequency and nature of antimicrobial use are concerning, but tractable targets for stewardship interventions exist.

The inflamed diverticulum was resected, and the hernia was repaired with synthetic mesh. No postoperative complication occurred. No previous study has reported a similar approach. DISCUSSION It is most unusual for an uncomplicated inflamed sigmoid colon diverticulum to be found in the hernia sac when performing acute repair of an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Resection of the diverticulum and subsequent repair of the hernia with synthetic mesh is an attractive alternative. CONCLUSION Acute diverticulitis should always be considered in patients with an acute abdomen, this includes those with a painful hernia. Emergency surgery should not be delayed, and local resection of the inflamed diverticulum may be an option if no perforation is apparent, and the surrounding colon is unaffected.","output":"Management of inflamed sigmoid diverticulum inside an incarcerated right inguinal hernia: Case report of a rare discovery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Job erosion is a major concern globally, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills might have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers. We leverage a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills and IT use, which are also integrated with household labor force survey data on workers' wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. We find that basic IT skills increase employment probability, and these employment effects can be explained by both increased labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills are not significantly associated with higher employment, conditioning on basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages and incrementally increases the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effects of basic IT skills on employment are significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. Additionally, IT skills complement occupations that have a higher share of nonroutine tasks that cannot be performed by predefined rules. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and basic IT training to traditionally socially disadvantaged groups to reduce the IT skills gap and close the digital divide. We contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the role of different IT skills in the entire labor force across multiple occupations and demographics, going beyond IT professionals and employed workers who have predominantly been studied in the information systems literature. We discuss implications for the future of work and education and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment for workers with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Information Technology Skills and Labor Market Outcomes for Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein D614G mutation became the predominant globally circulating variant after its emergence in the early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Studies showed that this mutation results in an open conformation of the S glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and increased angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and fusion, which result in an increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and infectivity Dynamic tracking of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the D614G variant became predominant after emergence in Europe and North America, but not in China The current absence of selective pressures from antiviral treatment suggests that the driving force for viral evolution could be variations in human population genetics Results show that ACE2 expression is higher in Asian populations than that in European, North American, and African populations This supports the idea that lower ACE2 expression is a driving force in the positive selection for the D614G mutation This study suggests that the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation during the early-to-mid pandemic is associated with enhanced transmission efficiency in populations with lower ACE2 expression Understanding the role that human genetic diversity plays in the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 may have an important impact on public health and measures to control the pandemic","output":"Impact of Genetic Variability in ACE2 Expression on the Evolutionary Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614G Mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: International literature suggests that disadvantaged groups are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to poorer living/working conditions and barriers to healthcare access.

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case fatality and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. RESULTS: We analyzed 213 180 COVID-19 cases, including 15 974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalized {[adjusted rate ratio (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44]} and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower human development index (HDI).

This study aimed to evaluate the psychological and financial impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions on those separated from their partners or immediate families, as well as temporary visa holders who were unable to migrate. Methods: Between 4 November 2021 to 1 December 2021, we executed a cross-sectional online survey targeting three specific groups; (1) those stranded from their partners; (2) those stranded from immediate families; and (3) temporary visa holders unable to migrate or cross international borders. We collected data on respondents demographic profile; the nature of COVID-19-related travel impacts; depression, anxiety, and stress levels (using the validated DASS-21); and finally, data on respondents financial, employment and accommodation situation. Results: 1363 respondents located globally completed the survey. 71.2% reported financial stress, 76.8% reported moderate-to-extremely severe depression, 51.6% moderate-to-extremely severe anxiety, and 62.6% moderate-to-extremely severe stress levels. Statistically significant factors associated with moderate-to-extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress included being female, chronic illness, and experiencing financial stress. Employment during COVID-19, specifically essential services workers or unemployed, was associated with higher levels of anxiety and stress, with only essential workers being a predictor of higher stress severity. Factors that provided psychological protection included being older and having children. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to explore the impact COVID-19-related international travel restrictions have had on the financial status and psychological health of affected individuals. It highlights the significant human cost associated with the restrictions and identifies psychologically vulnerable populations. These results will help the design of targeted health and social policy responses.","output":"Psychological and financial impacts of COVID-19-related travel measures: An international cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This policy and practice note describes and discusses two recent decisions by the District Court in Amsterdam regarding the applicability of YouTubes and Facebooks Community Guidelines on Covid-19 misinformation.

Therefore, the investigation of endogenous pathways leading to resolution of inflammation is of interest to uncover strategies for mitigating inflammation in people with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. This becomes particularly urgent in individuals with preexisting pathologies characterized by chronic respiratory inflammation and prone to bacterial infection, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we analyzed the immune responses to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virion spike 1 glycoprotein (S1) of macrophages (M) from volunteers with and without CF and tested the efficacy of resolvins (Rv) D1 and D2 in regulating the inflammatory and antimicrobial functions of M exposed to S1. S1 significantly increased chemokine release, including interleukin (IL)\\\\8, in CF and non\\\\CF M, while it enhanced IL\\\\6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\\\\ in non\\\\CF M, but not in CF cells. S1 also triggered the biosynthesis of RvD1 and modulated microRNAs miR\\\\16, miR\\\\29a, and miR\\\\103, known to control the inflammatory responses.

The key component of VV-ECMO is the double-lumen cannula (DLC) that enables single-site access. The biofluid dynamics of this compact device is particularly challenging for neonatal patients due to high Reynolds numbers, tricuspid valve location and right-atrium hemodynamics. In this paper we present detailed findings of our comparative analysis of the right-atrial hemodynamics and salient design features of the 13Fr Avalon Elite DLC (as the clinically preferred neonatal cannula) with the alternate Origen DLC design, using experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics. Highly accurate 3D-reconstructions of both devices were obtained through an integrated optical coherence tomography and micro-CT imaging approach. Both cannula configurations displayed complex flow structures inside the atrium, superimposed over predominant recirculation regimes. We found that the Avalon DLC performed significantly better than the Origen alternative, by capturing 80% and 94% of venous blood from the inferior and superior vena cavae, respectively and infusing the oxygenated blood with an efficiency of more than 85%. The micro-scale geometric design features of the Avalon DLC that are associated with superior hemodynamics were investigated through 14 parametric cannula configurations. These simulations showed that the strategic placement of drainage holes, the smooth infusion blood stream diverter and efficient distribution of the venous blood capturing area between the vena cavae are associated with robust blood flow performance. Nevertheless, our parametric results indicate that there is still room for further device optimization beyond the performance measurements for both Avalon and Origen DLC in this study. In particular, the performance envelope of malpositioned cannula and off-design conditions require additional blood flow simulations for analysis.","output":"Hemodynamic performance limits of the neonatal Double-Lumen cannula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Spring 2020, Georgia public schools implemented remote learning to manage the spread of COVID\\\\19.

On 25 March 2020, Intercollegiate guidelines were published in the UK to promote safe surgical provision during the COVID-19 outbreak advocating non-operative management or avoidance of laparoscopy when surgery is essential. The effects of this on the investigation and management of appendicitis remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study from the start of the new guidelines to the 6th of May 2020. We included all patients referred to surgical teams with suspected appendicitis. A recent historical cohort was identified for comparison. The primary outcome was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of non-operative management in appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included imaging, negative appendicectomy rate (NAR), length of stay (LOS) and 30-day complications. RESULTS: A total of 63/164 (38%) patients compared to 79/191 (41%) were diagnosed with appendicitis before and after the guidelines were introduced (p = 0.589). CT scanning increased (71/164 vs 105/191; p = 0.033) while ultrasound scanning decreased (71/164 vs 62/191; p = 0.037). Appendicitis was more likely to be managed non-operatively (11/63 vs 51/79; p < 0.001) and, of those managed surgically, with an open approach (3/52 vs 26/28 p < 0.001). The NAR also reduced (5/52 vs 0/28; p = 0.157). LOS was shorter in non-operatively managed patients (1 day vs 3 days; p < 0.001) without a difference in complications (10/51 vs 4/28; p = 0.760). CONCLUSION: Introduction of the guidelines was associated with changes in practice. Despite these changes, short-term complications did not increase and LOS decreased. Questions remain on the longer-term complication rates in non-operatively managed patients.","output":"Suspected appendicitis and COVID-19, a change in investigation and management-a multicentre cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corrected legend is given below.","output":"Correction to: Development of a Novel Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Diffuse Lung Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: A 56 year old Hispanic woman with a history of asthma presented with five days of progressive dyspnea and hemoptysis. CASE PRESENTATION: Two months prior, she was treated for COVID-19 complicated by intermittent hemoptysis. Subsequently, her hemoptysis gradually worsened resulting in dyspnea on exertion and hypoxia (SpO2 88%). At presentation, she was febrile (100.8 F), tachycardic (141 bpm), tachypneic (36 breaths/min) and hypoxic (SpO2 85%). Exam was notable for coarse breath sounds and crackles on auscultation. Labs were notable for hemoglobin 6.7 g/dL and a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Chest CT showed extensive ground-glass and reticular opacities (upper lungs) and a cluster of air cysts (left lower lobe). The imaging findings in conjunction with frank hemoptysis and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Bronchoscopy showed bloody secretions throughout the airway. Serial lavage aliquots returned progressively bloodier washings confirming DAH. She received empiric antibiotics with subsequent unremarkable infectious workup. She also received pulse dose steroids and underwent an autoimmune workup notable for: positive ANA (1:40), positive p-ANCA (1:1280), and positive MPO IgG (106 AU/mL) concerning for ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Hospital course was complicated by intermittent fevers, hemoptysis, and hypoxia - likely progression of DAH secondary to her vasculitis. She was started on intravenous steroids and cyclophosphamide with resolution of hemoptysis and hypoxia. Post discharge, her rheumatological workup was negative for anti-cardiolipin antibodies, phosphatidylserine autoantibodies, beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies, and DRVVT screen. DISCUSSION: DAH is a life-threatening condition that commonly presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea while hemoptysis may be absent in a third of patients. Bronchoscopic evaluation reveals progressively bloodier aliquots during lavage as noted in our patient. Treatment warrants addressing the underlying etiology, which may be cessation of the inciting drug, treatment of infection, or glucocorticoids for vasculitides. SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly cause DAH by inciting pulmonary endothelialitis. In contrast, our patient had a positive autoimmune workup for AAV, which was thought to be the immediate cause of her DAH. Without prior systemic manifestations of AAV (rash, arthritis, renal disease), either the patient developed AAV triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, or she had asymptomatic AAV that manifested due to the infection. There are multiple reports of COVID-19 predisposing to the development of autoimmune diseases, such as GBS and vasculitides, by triggering chronic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that our patient likely developed DAH because the infection led to ANCA-associated vasculitis that manifested as DAH rather than directly damaging her pulmonary blood vessels.

These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology, and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries over the last six years that promise to propel the field forward. METHODS: We conducted a search of two electronic databases, PubMed? and EMBASE? for experimental studies involving novel HIV immunogen design between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they (1) were written in a non-English language and/or (2) were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov?, to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. FINDINGS: The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth over the last three decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several novel rationally-designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last six years including native-like Env trimers, nanoparticle and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others. Several of these strategies have demonstrated enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human phase 1 clinical trials.

Fifty-eight studies were included, principally coming from Australia and Europe, describing 33 unique interventions, which targeted mostly male participants in team sports. The settings-based approach was not yet applied in sports clubs, as more than half of the interventions implemented in sports club targeted only one level of the socio-ecological model, as well as focused only on study participants rather than the club overall.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with a carotid web in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) were selected for hemodynamic evaluation with computational fluid dynamics models based on lumen segmentations obtained from CT angiography scans. Hemodynamic parameters, including the area of recirculation zone, time-averaged wall shear stress, transverse wall shear stress, and the oscillatory shear index, were assessed and compared with the contralateral carotid bifurcation. RESULTS In our study, 9 patients were evaluated. Distal to the carotid webs, recirculation zones were significantly larger compared with the contralateral bifurcation (63 versus 43 mm2, P = .02). In the recirculation zones of the carotid webs and the contralateral carotid bifurcation, time-averaged wall shear stress values were comparable (both: median, 0.27 Pa; P = .30), while transverse wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index values were significantly higher in the recirculation zone of carotid webs (median, 0.25 versus 0.21 Pa; P = .02 and 0.39 versus 0.30 Pa; P = .04). At the minimal lumen area, simulations showed a significantly higher time-averaged wall shear stress in the web compared with the contralateral bifurcation (median, 0.58 versus 0.45 Pa; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Carotid webs are associated with increased recirculation zones and regional increased wall shear stress metrics that are associated with disturbed flow.

While active and reactive case detection have been successful in localized areas of low transmission, concerns over scalability and sustainability keep the approaches from being widely accepted. Mobile health interventions are poised to address these shortcomings by automating and standardizing portions of the surveillance process. In this study, common challenges associated with current data aggregation methods have been quantified, and a web-based mobile phone application is presented to reduce the burden of reporting rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results in low-resource settings. METHODS: De-identified completed RDTs were collected at 14 rural health clinics as part of a malaria epidemiology study at Macha Research Trust, Macha, Zambia. Tests were imaged using the mHAT web application. Signal intensity was measured and a binary result was provided. App performance was validated by: (1) comparative limits of detection, investigated against currently used laboratory lateral flow assay readers; and, (2) receiver operating characteristic analysis comparing the application against visual inspection of RDTs by an expert. Secondary investigations included analysis of time-to-aggregation and data consistency within the existing surveillance structures established by Macha Research Trust. RESULTS: When compared to visual analysis, the mHAT app performed with 91.9% sensitivity (CI 78.7, 97.2) and specificity was 91.4% (CI 77.6, 97.0) regardless of device operating system. Additionally, an analysis of surveillance data from January 2017 through mid-February 2019 showed that while the majority of the data packets from satellite clinics contained correct data, 36% of data points required correction by verification teams. Between November 2018 and mid-February 2019, it was also found that 44.8% of data was received after the expected submission date, although most (65.1%) reports were received within 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mHAT mobile app was observed to be sensitive and specific when compared to both currently available benchtop lateral flow readers and visual inspection. The additional benefit of automating and standardizing LFA data collection and aggregation poses a vital improvement for low-resource health facilities and could increase the accuracy and speed of data reporting in surveillance campaigns.

This disease is characterized by important damage at a multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS-CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network, we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.","output":"Fractional diffusion on the human proteome as an alternative to the multi-organ damage of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fomite mediated transmission can be an important pathway causing significant disease transmission in number of settings such as schools, daycare centers, and long-term care facilities. The importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person-person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs. Here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues. METHODS: We developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces. We consider two sub-types of fomite-mediated transmission: direct fomite (e.g., shedding onto fomites) and hand-fomite (e.g., shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites). We use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics (influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus) in four venue types. To parameterize the model for each pathogen we conducted a thorough literature search. RESULTS: Based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ([Formula: see text] ) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered, suggesting that this route can sustain transmission. For influenza, on the other hand, [Formula: see text] for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission. Additionally, the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand-fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus, compared to norovirus. The relative importance of the hand-fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands. Sensitivity analysis stresses the need for accurate measurements of environmental inactivation rates, transfer efficiencies, and pathogen shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Fomite-mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined. The effectiveness of environmental interventions differs significantly both by pathogen and venue. While fomite-based interventions may be able to lower [Formula: see text] for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission, rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ([Formula: see text] ) that single environmental interventions are unlikely to interrupt fomite transmission for these pathogens.

These effects were more prominent in vulnerable communities that experienced prior similar disasters. The study aimed to examine the likelihood and correlates of anxiety symptoms among Fort McMurray (FMM) residents, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey questionnaire was applied between 24 April and 2 June 2021, at FMM, to gather sociodemographic, COVID-19, and clinical information, including generalized anxiety disorder (using GAD-7 scale). Results: Overall, 186 individuals completed the survey (response rate 74.7%). Most of the respondents were females (159, 85.5%); above 40 years (98, 52.7%); employed (175, 94.1%); and in relationship (132, 71%). The prevalence of moderate-to-severe anxiety was (42.5%, 71) on GAD-7 self-reported scale. Subscribers who reported that they would like to receive mental health support; have received no family support since COVID-19 declaration; and have lost their job during the pandemic were all more likely to report moderate-to-severe anxiety (OR = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.29C8.88), (OR = 4.85; 95% CI: 1.56C15.03), and (OR = 4.40; 95% CI: 1.01C19.24), respectively.

Usually, after the occurrence of some newsworthy event, discussion topics are generated in networks that influence the formation of initial public opinion. After a period of propagation, some of these topics are further derived into new subtopics, which intertwine with the initial public opinion to form a multidimensional public opinion. This paper is concerned with the formation process of multi-dimensional public opinion in the context of derived topics. Firstly, the initial public opinion variation mechanism is introduced to reveal the formation process of derived subtopics, then Brownian motion is used to determine the subtopic propagation parameters and their propagation is studied based on complex network dynamics according to the principle of evolution. The formula of basic reproductive number is introduced to determine whether derived subtopics can form derived public opinion, thereby revealing the whole process of multi-dimensional public opinion formation. Secondly, through simulation experiments, the influences of various factors, such as the degree of information alienation, environmental forces, topic correlation coefficients, the amount of information contained in subtopics, and network topology on the formation of multi-dimensional public opinion are studied. The simulation results show that: (1) Environmental forces and the amount of information contained in subtopics are key factors affecting the formation of multi-dimensional public opinion. Among them, environmental forces have a greater impact on the number of subtopics, and the amount of information contained in subtopics determines whether the subtopic can be the key factor that forms the derived public opinion. (2) Only when the degree of information alienation reaches a certain level, will derived subtopics emerge. At the same time, the degree of information alienation has a greater impact on the number of derived subtopics, but it has a small impact on the dimensions of the final public opinion. (3) The network topology does not have much impact on the number of derived subtopics but has a greater impact on the number of individuals participating in the discussion of subtopics. The multidimensional public opinion dimension formed by the network topology with a high aggregation coefficient and small average path length is higher.

We describe our technique of controlled rectal transection and robotic purse-string placement by use of the da Vinci Robotic system. METHODS Three patients with rectal cancer who were scheduled to undergo a robot-assisted low anterior resection were selected to undergo this procedure. Safety, feasibility, and immediate postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed in all 3 patients with no intraoperative complications. One patient had a postoperative bilateral femoral neuropathy that resolved spontaneously. The mean operating time was 339.6 minutes, and all 3 patients were sent home by the fifth postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS The advanced surgical dexterity of the da Vinci Robot enables a controlled rectal transection and purse-string suture placement on the rectal stump. This achieves a right-angled rectal division and a secure, single-stapled anastomosis in a low anterior resection.

Our goal was to evaluate for discordance in SARS-CoV-2 detection in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies based on the site analyzed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review METHODS: This single-institution study evaluated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomies placed during their treatment. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results after tracheostomy. All included patients had nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples taken within a 48-hour period, allowing us to characterize rate of test concordance. RESULTS: Forty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. Thirty-two (71.1%) patients had entirely concordant results after tracheostomy. However, 13 (28.9%) patients had at least one set of discordant results, the majority of which were NP negative and TR positive. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical variables, including time to tracheostomy and time to testing, among patients with concordant versus discordant SARS-CoV-2 results. CONCLUSION: This represents the first study to examine SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAAT concordance between NP and TR sites in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies. One-third of patients demonstrated discordant testing when NP and TR specimens were collected within a 48-hour time period.

Methods: We optimize a set of simple finite impulse response (FIR) models comprising of a scaling factor and time-delay between officially reported cases, ICU admissions and deaths time series using the least squares method. Combined with randomized PCR study results, we utilize this simple model to estimate the total number of infections in Sweden, and the corresponding IFR. Results: The model class provides a good fit between ICU admissions and deaths throughout 2020. Cases fit consistently from July 2020, by when PCR tests had become broadly available. We observe a diminished IFR in late summer as well as a strong decline during 2021, following the launch of a nation-wide vaccination program. The total number of infections during 2020 is estimated to $1.3$ million. Conclusions: A FIR model with a delta filter function describes the evolution of epidemiological data in Sweden well. The fact that we found IFR, ICR and IIAR constant over large parts of 2020 is in contrast with claims of healthcare adaptation or mutated virus variants importantly affecting these ratios. The model allows us to retrospectively estimate the COVID-19 epidemiological trajectory, and conclude that Sweden was far from herd immunity by the end of 2020.","output":"Estimating the SARS-CoV-2 infected population fraction and the infection to-fatality ratio: A data-driven case study based on Swedish time series data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major international emergency leading to unprecedented medical, economic and societal challenges. Countries around the globe are facing challenges with diabetes care and are similarly adapting care delivery, with local cultural nuances. People with diabetes suffer disproportionately from acute COVID-19 with higher rates of serious complications and death. In-patient services need specialist support to appropriately manage glycaemia in people with known and undiagnosed diabetes presenting with COVID-19. Due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, people with diabetes may suffer longer-term harm caused by inadequate clinical support and less frequent monitoring of their condition and diabetes-related complications. Outpatient management need to be reorganised to maintain remote advice and support services, focusing on proactive care for the highest risk, and using telehealth and digital services for consultations, self-management and remote monitoring, where appropriate. Stratification of patients for face-to-face or remote follow-up should be based on a balanced risk assessment. Public health and national organisations have generally responded rapidly with guidance on care management, but the pandemic has created a tension around prioritisation of communicable vs non-communicable disease. Resulting challenges in clinical decision-making are compounded by a reduced clinical workforce. For many years, increasing diabetes mellitus incidence has been mirrored by rising preventable morbidity and mortality due to complications, yet innovation in service delivery has been slow.

Mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach programs have been shown to improve colorectal cancer screening rates in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), with improvements ranging from 22% - 45%.

As part of the Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention (PROMPT) study, a partnership with a Los Angeles-based FQHC that provides medical services to over 300,000 patients annually (82% Latino), we used BCT to gather input from patients and staff to develop messaging and materials for patients in need of a follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal FIT. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted BCT using a digital platform. Eligible patient participants were Latino, ages 50 to 75 years, Spanish-speaking, and willing to participate in three virtual sessions. Recruitment and BCT materials were developed in English and Spanish, but all three sessions were held in Spanish consistent with patient preferences. The sessions included presentations on colorectal cancer screening, effective messaging to improve Latino screening participation, and brainstorming sessions to obtain feedback on messaging and materials. Summary of the new unpublished data: A total of 10 adults (7 patients and 3 clinic staff) participated in the BCT sessions. Key themes learned were 1) increasing awareness about the colonoscopy procedure (why it is important, what the procedure is, how to prepare), 2) using simple and clear wording, including statistics, and using family as a motivator, and 3) providing different patient outreach modalities to broaden reach, such as patient-facing fact sheets, videos in clinic or sent by text. Statement of the conclusions: Using BCT, we successfully incorporated feedback from Spanish-speaking Latino patients to design culturally relevant materials to promote follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal FIT results. Targeted efforts are needed to improve rates of follow-up colonoscopy among patients with abnormal FIT results in FQHC settings. (Final materials, including patient-facing fact sheets and screenshots from short videos, will be showcased in the poster.).","output":"Incorporating Latino patient input in messaging for follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal fecal testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ceftobiprole combines an excellent spectrum for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) pathogens, with a low/medium MDR risk, and the -lactams safety in frail patients admitted to the hospital in internal medicine wards which may be at high risk of adverse events by anti-MRSA coverage as oxazolidinones or glycopeptides.

Infectious disease outbreaks increase psychological stress, and life events impact sleep quality. American Indians have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether childhood trauma predicts changes in sleep quality following onset of the pandemic and test whether pandemic stress contributes to changes in sleep. METHODS: In a sample of 210 American Indian adults (Age M (SD) = 55.09 (13.10), 59.5% female) demographics, childhood trauma and sleep quality were measured at Time 1. One month following the onset of the pandemic, psychological stress specific to the pandemic and sleep quality were measured. RESULTS: Using linear regression controlling for age, sex, income, and sleep quality at Time 1, childhood adversity predicted both psychological stress specific to the pandemic and changes in sleep quality from Time 1 to Time 2 (? = 0.33, t(205) = 4.88, P < .001, &#916;R2 = 0.10) and (? = 0.24, t(204) = 3.48, P < .001, &#916;R2 = 0.05), respectively. Mediation analyses indicated a significant indirect effect between childhood adversity and changes in sleep quality through COVID-19 stress (indirect effect [standard error, SE] = (0.03[0.01], 95% confidence interval = [0.003, 0.03]). CONCLUSIONS: In American Indians childhood trauma predicts greater declines in sleep quality associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because greater psychological stress related to COVID-19. Future work should identify factors which alleviate stress related to life events for individuals who experienced childhood trauma in order to improve health behaviors and health.","output":"Childhood trauma as a predictor of changes in sleep quality in American Indian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-organ failure is one of the common causes of fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients.

As a result, the relative incidence of deaths resulting from non obstetric causes has increased. Chief among nonobstetric causes are neurologic disorders. Those most common during pregnancy are low back pain, intracranial tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and neurotrauma. The management of the neurosurgical pathologies during pregnancy needs some specifications for both the mother and the fetus. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study evaluating the clinical, radiological, and surgical characteristics of 9 patients who have cranial neuropathologies and have undergone neurosurgical intervention. RESULTS: Most of the patients in this study had vaginal delivery. Prominent neurosurgical disease related to cerebral damage. Every patient underwent a laboratory and radiological evaluation. All except one survived the neurosurgical pathology. Neither baby nor mother had significant problem during delivery and neurosurgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women may face to every kind of neurosurgical pathology that nonpregnant women have faced. In addition, pregnancy itself, gives rise some metabolic changes in the women and those changes may cause some neurologic pathologies to be symptomatic or to aggravate the present symptomatology. Because of those reasons, close neurologic follow up of a pregnant woman is of vital importance.

Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular, it was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in children protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try to reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not monotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that depends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with most existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked for ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the protease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The negative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not paradoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation that predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus propagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to protect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low ACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the inflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the angiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation triggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its many post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower ACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the alternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the anti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.","output":"Is Covid-19 severity associated with ACE2 degradation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases have been one of the major causes of human mortality, and mathematical models have been playing significant roles in understanding the spread mechanism and controlling contagious diseases. In this paper, we propose a delayed SEIR epidemic model with intervention strategies and recovery under the low availability of resources. Non-delayed and delayed models both possess two equilibria: the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. When the basic reproduction number $ R_0 = 1 $, the non-delayed system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation. For the delayed system, we incorporate two important time delays: $ \\\\tau_1 $ represents the latent period of the intervention strategies, and $ \\\\tau_2 $ represents the period for curing the infected individuals. Time delays change the system dynamics via Hopf-bifurcation and oscillations. The direction and stability of delay induced Hopf-bifurcation are established using normal form theory and center manifold theorem. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that local Hopf bifurcation implies global Hopf bifurcation. Stability switching curves and crossing directions are analyzed on the two delay parameter plane, which allows both delays varying simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that by increasing the intervention strength, the infection level decays; by increasing the limitation of treatment, the infection level increases. Our quantitative observations can be useful for exploring the relative importance of intervention and medical resources. As a timing application, we parameterize the model for COVID-19 in Spain and Italy. With strict intervention policies, the infection numbers would have been greatly reduced in the early phase of COVID-19 in Spain and Italy. We also show that reducing the time delays in intervention and recovery would have decreased the total number of cases in the early phase of COVID-19 in Spain and Italy.

Eligible patients were randomized to receive high-flow NBO by a Venturi mask (FiO(2) 50%, flow 15 L/min) or routine low-flow oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula (flow 3 L/min) after vessel recanalization for 6 h. Patient demographics, procedural metrics, complications, functional outcomes, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and infarct volume were assessed. A total of 91 patients were treated with high-flow NBO. NBO treatment revealed a common odds ratio of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.26 to 3.87) favoring the distribution of global disability scores on the mRS at 90 days. The mortality at 90 days was significantly lower in the NBO group than in the control group, with an absolute difference of 13.86% (rate ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13C0.93). A significant reduction of infarct volume as determined by MRI was noted in the NBO group.

Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, also known as acute adrenal insufficiency due to adrenal gland hemorrhage, is an uncommon and frequently fatal condition classically presenting with fever, shock, rash, and coagulopathy. Although most often associated with Meningococcemia, many other etiologies have been implicated, including reports of Staphylococcus aureus infection on autopsy examinations. This report details an adult intravenous drug user with adrenal hemorrhage associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use presented to the hospital with weakness. Vitals were initially normal and exam findings were notable for decreased right-sided motor strength. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cervical epidural abscess with spinal cord compression. Despite initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluids, the patient progressed to shock, requiring vasopressor administration, and his blood cultures later grew MRSA. Further imaging of the abdomen/pelvis was completed, revealing bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. Random cortisol at that time was 5.6 g/dL, confirming a diagnosis of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency in addition to likely septic and spinal shock. The patient was initiated on hydrocortisone with improvement in his hypotension. He was transitioned to prednisone and fludrocortisone in addition to 8 weeks of antibiotics after achieving clinical stability. CONCLUSIONS: This report brings to attention the risk of adrenal hemorrhage and acute adrenal insufficiency as a sequela of the relatively common illness of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

Previously, groups had targeted conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a conserved 2O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, combining a 2O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2O MTase in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines. Significance Emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised. This study illustrates that despite success in young models, the NSP16 mutant carries too much risk for pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy. Importantly, the NSP16 mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations.

The highest frequency of double positives (PGL-I+/RLEP+) were detected in the new case group (40/87, 46%) with lower numbers for treated (12/52, 23.1%), household contacts (46/296, 15.5%) and healthy endemic controls (0/31, 0%). The frequencies in these groups were reversed for double negatives (PGL-I-/RLEP-) for new cases (6/87, 6.9%), treated leprosy cases (15/52, 28.8%) and the highest in household contacts (108/296, 36.5%) and healthy endemic controls (24/31, 77.4%). The data strongly suggest that household contacts that are double positive have latent disease, are likely contributing to shedding and transmission of disease to their close contacts and are at the highest risk of progressing to clinical disease. Proposed strategies to reduce leprosy transmission in highly endemic areas may include chemoprophylactic treatment of this group of individuals to stop the spread of bacilli to eventually lower new case detection rates in these areas.","output":"Latent leprosy infection identified by dual RLEP and anti-PGL-I positivity: Implications for new control strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected the whole world in a short time. One of the most influential public health initiatives modern medicine has to offer, the vaccine has become even more important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen worldwide.

Allergic reactions to vaccines were reported shortly after their approval. These reactions, in general, are rare, but, in some circumstances, they can be serious. Allergy to vaccines can occur because of either the active vaccine component or vaccine ingredients. The spectrum of the reactions may be just a local hypersensitiviy reaction or may be as severe as an anaphylaxis, which is an acute severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitive reaction, and it requires quick intervention. If an allergy is suspected, a correct examination followed by algorithms is important for true diagnosis, treatment, and decision regarding revaccination. Patients who experience an allergic reaction with the first dose of covid 19 vaccine should be directed to the allergy-immunologist, and the evaluation of at-risk patients should be individualized.

It is important to emphasize two components of this definition. First, that inflammation is a normal response and, as such, is expected to occur when tissue is damaged. Infact, if injured tissue does not exhibit signs of inflammation this would be considered abnormal and wounds and infections would never heal without inflammation. Secondly, inflammation occurs in living tissue, hence there is need for an adequate blood supply to the tissues in order to exhibit an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response may be triggered by mechanical injury, chemical toxins, and invasion by microorganisms, and hypersensitivity reactions. Three major events occur during the inflammatory response: the blood supply to the affected area is increased substantially, capillary permeability is increased, and leucocytes migrate from the capillary vessels into the surrounding interstitial spaces to the site of inflammation or injury. The inflammatory response represents a complex biological and biochemical process involving cells of the immune system and a plethora of biological mediators.

This study identified frequent underlying conditions and their attributable risk of severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS: We used data from more than 800 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) to describe hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 from March 2020 through March 2021. We used multivariable generalized linear models to estimate adjusted risk of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death associated with frequent conditions and total number of conditions. RESULTS: Among 4,899,447 hospitalized adults in PHD-SR, 540,667 (11.0%) were patients with COVID-19, of whom 94.9% had at least 1 underlying medical condition. Essential hypertension (50.4%), disorders of lipid metabolism (49.4%), and obesity (33.0%) were the most common. The strongest risk factors for death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27C1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25C1.31), and diabetes with complication (aRR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24C1.28), as well as the total number of conditions, with aRRs of death ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41C1.67) for patients with 1 condition to 3.82 (95% CI, 3.45C4.23) for patients with more than 10 conditions (compared with patients with no conditions).

Trait equanimity is expected to protect individuals from psychological distress associated with social isolation. The aim of this study is to examine the link between social isolation and psychological distress via the mediator equanimity. It was hypothesised that objective (few social contacts) and perceived social isolation (loneliness) would predict psychological distress and that equanimity would mediate these relationships. METHODS: Five hundred and seventy-eight adult United States participants were recruited and completed measures of objective social isolation and perceived social isolation (De Jong Gierveld Social Isolation scale), trait equanimity (Phenomenological Experience of Meditative Equanimity Scale), and psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, Short Form, DASS-21). RESULTS: Objective social isolation negatively predicted psychological distress, but equanimity did not mediate this relationship. Perceived social isolation positively predicted psychological distress and equanimity mediated this relationship. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its cross-sectional and self-report design and by a United States sample, which may affect the generalisability of findings. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than a lack of social contact it is the perceived nature of isolation that is related to psychological distress and this relationship indirectly operates through trait equanimity.

However, as the pandemic unfolded it became apparent that patients who were admitted to hospital had high rates of AKI and this initiated a change in local clinical guidelines during early April 2020. We aimed to ascertain the impact of judicious intravenous fluid use on mortality, length of hospitalisation and AKI. METHOD: An observational cohort study of 158 adults admitted with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 between 18(th) March and 9(th) May 2020 was conducted in a teaching hospital and designated centre for infectious diseases, London, UK. Key clinical and demographic data collected included clinical severity markers on admission, biochemical and haematological parameters as well as radiological findings. Primary outcomes were inpatient mortality, mortality at 6-weeks post discharge, length of hospitalisation and intensive care (ICU) admission. We also measured requirement for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and AKI recovery rate at discharge. Using tests of difference, we compared key outcomes between patients treated with varying fluid regimens and then identified risk factors for AKI and mortality using multivariate logistic regression with results expressed as odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The median age was 74.4 (IQR 59.90 - 84.35) years, 66% were male, 53% white with hypertension and diabetes being the commonest co-morbidities. The median duration of illness prior to admission was 7 days (IQR 2 C 10) with respiratory symptoms and fever most prevalent. The people who presented with AKI on admission were more likely to receive fluids (34% vs 15%, p=0.02). 118 patients (75%) received fluids within 24-hours of admission with no difference in volume administered after local guidance change (p=0.78). Comparing patients receiving fluids with those who did not, we observed no difference in mortality (p=0.97), duration of hospital stays (p=0.26) or requirement for ICU admission (p=0.70). 18% died as an inpatient, and 52 patients were either admitted with or developed AKI. Of these 52 patients, 43 received fluids and 9 did not with no difference in KRT requirement (p=0.34), mortality (p=0.50) or AKI recovery (p=0.63). Peak AKI stage was greater among participants who received fluids though stage of AKI at presentation was also greater (p=0.04). Mortality rate in patients with an AKI is higher compared to overall inpatient mortality (31% vs 18%). Of the 36 patients with AKI who were discharged home, 25 patients (69.4%) had renal recovery by the time of discharge. Increasing age and clinical severity on admission were associated with higher mortality (see Figure 1). Older age was associated with 34 - 53 times higher risk of death compared with those aged  65 years (age 76 - 85 years: OR 34.26, 95% CI: 3.94 - 297.48, p=0.001; age > 85 years: OR 53.07, 95% CI: 5.23 - 539.03, p=0.001). Patients with NEWS2 >4 on admission has 5-fold increased risk of death than those with a score 4 (OR 5.26, 95% CI: 1.32 - 20.92). Black ethnicity was associated with a 16-fold increased risk of developing AKI (OR 15.86, 95% CI: 1.67 - 150.99). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of fluid management on inpatient mortality as well as on renal-associated outcomes of COVID-19 admission.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a shift to virtual care models in order to reduce patient exposure to high-risk environments and to preserve valuable health care resources. This report describes one large primary care systems model for rapid transition to virtual care (RTVC). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A RTVC model was implemented at the VA Connecticut Health Care System (VACHS), which delivers care to over 58,000 veterans. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The RTVC model included immediate virtual care conversion, telework expansion, implementation of virtual respiratory urgent care clinics, and development of standardized note templates. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Outcomes include the rates of primary encounter types, staff teleworking, and utilization of virtual respiratory urgent care clinics. In under 2 weeks, most encounters were transitioned from in-person to virtual care, enabling telework for over half of the medical staff. The majority of virtual visits were telephone encounters, though rates of video visits increased nearly 18-fold. DISCUSSION: The RTVC model demonstrates expeditious and sustained transition to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experiences help inform institutions still reliant on traditional in-person visits, and future pandemic response.","output":"A Model for Rapid Transition to Virtual Care, VA Connecticut Primary Care Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salinity is an important environmental factor that can affect the metabolism of aquatic organisms, while cholesterol can influence cellular membrane fluidity which are vital in adaption to salinity changes. Hence, a 4-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of water salinity (normal 23 psu and low 5 psu) and three dietary cholesterol levels (CH0.16, 0.16%, CH1.0, 1.0% and CH1.6, 1.6%) on osmoregulation, cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid composition, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis, oxidative stress (OS), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) of the euryhaline fish black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii). The results indicated that in low salinity, fish fed with the CH1.0 diet improved ion reabsorption and osmoregulation by increased Na+ concentration in serum as well as expression levels of osmoregulation-related gene expression levels in gills. Both dietary cholesterol level and water salinity significantly affected most cholesterol metabolic parameters in the serum and tissues, and the results showed that low salinity promoted cholesterol synthesis but inhibited cholesterol catabolism. Besides, in low salinity, hepatic expression levels of LC-PUFA biosynthesis genes were upregulated by fed dietary cholesterol supplementation with contents of LC-PUFAs, including EPA and DHA being increased. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly increased in low-salinity environment, whereas MDA content was decreased in fish fed with dietary CH1.0 by activating related antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression levels. A similar pattern was recorded for ERS, which stimulated the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (nf-b), triggering inflammation. Nevertheless, fish reared in low salinity and fed with dietary CH1.0 had markedly alleviated ERS and downregulated gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, these findings demonstrate that cholesterol, as an important nutrient, plays vital roles in the process of adaptation to low salinity of A. schlegelii, and provides a new insight into underlying adaptive strategies of euryhaline marine fish reared in low salinity.","output":"A New Insight Into the Underlying Adaptive Strategies of Euryhaline Marine Fish to Low Salinity Environment: Through Cholesterol Nutrition to Regulate Physiological Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES to assess the temporal variation in excess total mortality and the portion of excess explained by COVID-19 deaths by geographical area, gender, and age during the COVID-19 epidemic.

This study performed a review and synthesis of information available in the PubMed database and from national SLP organizations across 6 countries. Observations From the search, 22 publications on tracheostomy and 3 referring to laryngectomy were identified. After analysis of titles and abstracts followed by full-text review, 4 publications were identified as presenting guidelines for specific approaches to tracheostomy and were selected; all 3 publications on laryngectomy were selected. The main guidelines on tracheostomy described considerations during management (eg, cuff manipulation, suctioning, valve placement) owing to the increased risk of aerosol generation and transmission during swallowing and communication interventions in this population. Regarding laryngectomy, the guidelines focused on the care and protection of both the professional and the patient, offering recommendations on the management of adverse events and leakage of the tracheoesophageal prosthesis.

PURPOSE: The objectives and strategies used by an ambulatory care pharmacy team operating within a large health systems pharmacy incident command structure during the initial response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are discussed. SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, a pharmacy ambulatory action team was formed to provide ambulatory clinical pharmacy expertise and meet an immediate and ongoing need to limit nonemergent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. By building a strong communication infrastructure and partnership with ambulatory care providers, clinic medical and operational leaderships, clinical laboratory staff, and infusion centers, the team was able to swiftly execute solutions and respond to new issues and requests. Ambulatory care pharmacy practice continued to advance through provision of services to vulnerable patient populations with chronic conditions that were anticipated to experience gaps in care management during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts resulted in expansion of pharmacists involvement in collaborative drug therapy management, support of patients transition from in-clinic injection to home self-administration, provision of medication assistance support, and management of 1,300 patients via protocol-based warfarin management. Additionally, ambulatory pharmacy services in 15 primary care, anticoagulation, and specialty clinic sites were transitioned to telehealth. The ambulatory action team also implemented several strategies to manage medication therapy associated with COVID-19Crelated shortages and implemented electronic decision support to guide prescribing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. CONCLUSION: Building a strong communication infrastructure and a pharmacy ambulatory action team were essential to respond to a crisis and continue ambulatory clinical pharmacy services expansion.","output":"Advancing ambulatory pharmacy practice through a crisis: Objectives and strategies used in an ambulatory care action teams response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We draw on a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research on restricting human rights and increasing discrimination through COVID-19 vaccination certificates, and to explore this, we inspected, used, and replicated survey data from Access Now, Ada Lovelace Institute, Associated Press, Dynata, Morning Consult, and Redpoint Global, performing analyses and making estimates regarding rational and ethical COVID-19 vaccine certification schemes.

Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they can be expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, in the absence of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be significantly higher than that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be incorporated in the mechanism for estimating the key epidemiological parameters, like rate of transmission, rate of recovery, reproduction rate, etc., and hence, for forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a new dynamic version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to assimilate the impact of the time-varying proportion of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As a demonstration, the proposed methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida. Results suggest significant amount of underreporting of cases in both states. Further, posterior estimates obtained from the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model show that average reproduction numbers associated with undetected infectives [California: 1.464; Florida: 1.612] are substantially higher than those associated with quarantined infectives [California: 0.497; Florida: 0.359].

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of medical records of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at Hospital Nacional Hiplito Unanue (HNHU) during the months of April to August 2020. The dependent variable was in-hospital mortality. Independent variables included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, physical examination findings, oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) at admission, treatment received during hospitalization and laboratory results at admission. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios for associated factors. RESULTS: We included 1418 patients. Median age was 58 years (IQR 47C68 years) and 944 (66.6%) were male. The median length of hospitalization was 7 (4C13) days, and the mortality rate was 46%. The most frequent comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. In the adjusted analysis, mortality was associated with age (HR 1.02; 95%CI 1.02C1.03), history of surgery (HR 1.89; 95%CI 1.31C2.74), lower oxygen saturation at admission (HR 4.08; CI95% 2.72C8.05 for SaO(2)<70% compared to SaO(2)>94%), the presence of poor general condition (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.29C2.53), altered state of consciousness (HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.18C2.11) and leukocyte levels (HR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00C1. 02). Treatment with ivermectin (HR 1.44; 95%CI 1.18C1.76) and azithromycin (HR 1.25; 95%CI 1.03C1.52) were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses was associated with lower mortality (HR 0.56 95%CI 0. 37C0. 86) in comparison to no steroid use. CONCLUSION: A high mortality was found in our cohort. Low oxygen saturation at admission, age, and the presence of hematological and biochemical alterations were associated with higher mortality. The use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin or azithromycin was not useful and was probably associated with unfavorable outcomes. The use of corticosteroids at moderate doses was associated with lower mortality.","output":"Mortality and associated risk factors in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in a Peruvian reference hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common and underdiagnosed medical condition characterized by recurrent sleep-dependent pauses and reductions in airflow. While a narrow, collapsible oropharynx plays a central role in the pathophysiology of OSAS, there are other equally important nonanatomic factors including sleep-stage dependent muscle tone, arousal threshold, and loop gain that drive obstructive apneas and hypopneas. Through mechanisms of intermittent hypoxemia, arousal-related sleep fragmentation, and intrathoracic pressure changes, OSAS impacts multiple organ systems. Risk factors for OSAS include obesity, male sex, age, specific craniofacial features, and ethnicity. The prevalence of OSAS is rising due to increasing obesity rates and improved sensitivity in the tools used for diagnosis. Validated questionnaires have an important but limited role in the identification of patients that would benefit from formal testing for OSA. While an in-laboratory polysomnography remains the gold standard for diagnosis, the widespread availability and accuracy of home sleep apnea testing modalities increase access and ease of OSAS diagnosis for many patients. In adults, the most common treatment involves the application of positive airway pressure (PAP), but compliance continues to be a challenge. Alternative treatments including mandibular advancement device, hypoglossal nerve stimulator, positional therapies, and surgical options coupled with weight loss and exercise offer possibilities of an individualized personal approach to OSAS. Treatment of symptomatic patients with OSAS has been found to be beneficial with regard to sleep-related quality of life, sleepiness, and motor vehicle accidents. The benefit of treating asymptomatic OSA patients, particularly with regard to cardiovascular outcomes, is controversial and more data are needed.","output":"Evaluation and Management of Adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Industrial pollution is considered to be a detrimental factor for human health. This study, therefore, explores the link between health status and industrial pollution for the top 20 industrialised countries of the world.

RESULTS: The research findings indicate that industrial pollution arising from both variables has a detrimental impact on human health and significantly increases the death rate, while an increase in economic growth, number of physicians, urbanisation, sanitation facilities and schooling decreases the death rate. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, minimisation of industrial pollution should be the topmost policy agenda in these countries. All the findings are consistent theoretically, and have empirical implications as well. The policy implication of this study is that the mitigation of industrial pollution, considering other pertinent factors, should be addressed appropriately by enunciating effective policies to reduce the human death rate and improve health status in the studied panel countries.","output":"Is industrial pollution detrimental to public health?

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between early BUP-NX initiation and health-related outcomes among insured adults with opioid use disorder (OUD). METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the Optum's de-identified Clinformatics? Data Mart Database from 2010 to 2018. Patients who initiated BUP-NX within 30 days of OUD diagnosis were classified as early initiators. Patients who initiated BUP-NX later, but within the one-year follow-up, were defined as late initiators. Outcomes included opioid overdose, opioid overdose-related emergency department (ED) visits, and all-cause healthcare cost during the year after OUD diagnosis. We employed generalized linear models to compare outcomes between early and late initiators, adjusting for baseline covariates and accounting for missing information for covariates using multiple imputation. RESULTS A total of 8,388 patients with OUD were identified; mean age was 39.9 years; 36% were female; and 67.6% were early initiators. Early initiators had an estimated 42% lower rate of opioid overdose (adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.64); 51% lower rate of opioid overdose-related ED visits (aRR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.55); and 31% lower total healthcare cost (adjusted cost ratio = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.72), compared to late initiators.

The precise pathophysiological mechanism causing this symptom is unknown. This report describes a case of sudden hearing loss in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, was examined. She experienced sudden hearing loss in her right ear and disabling tinnitus. She underwent combined corticosteroid therapy (oral and intratympanic), resulting in an isolated improvement of 250 kHz in the right ear (from 60 dB, the threshold became 15 dB) and of 4, 6, and 8 kHz in the left ear (from 35 dB, 20 dB, and 35 dB, the thresholds became 15 dB, 5 dB and 20 dB, respectively).

Intra-arterial therapy remains a potential reperfusion strategy in these patients; however, supporting data are scarce. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected consecutive intra-arterial therapies from October 2010 to March 2015 comparing OAC (vitamin-K antagonists and novel oral anticoagulants) versus normal hemostasis versus intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator patients. Primary safety end point is parenchymal hematoma. Secondary safety end point is 90-day mortality. Efficacy end points are successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, 2b-3) and good outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). Logistic regression for predictors of parenchymal hematoma was performed. RESULTS A total of 604 patients were qualified for the study. Baseline and outcomes variables were overall similar for vitamin-K antagonists (n=29) and novel oral anticoagulants (n=17) patients. When compared with normal hemostasis (n=265) and intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (n=297), OAC (n=46) patients were older and had more comorbidities. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of parenchymal hematoma (8% versus 5%; P=0.42), 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 (30% versus 40%; P=0.26), and 90-day mortality (32% versus 26%; P=0.46) among OAC and normal hemostasis patients. Similarly, there were no significant differences between OAC and intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator patients in terms of parenchymal hematoma (8% versus 4%; P=0.16), 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 (30% versus 43%; P=0.13), and 90-day mortality (32% versus 22%; P=0.18). The use of OAC was not associated with the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma on multivariate logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS Intra-arterial therapy seems to be safe in patients taking OACs; however, our study showed a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhage and mortality with a nonsignificant decrease in good outcomes in comparison with non-OAC patients.

Temporal variations, if any, in the rate of CpG depletion during virus evolution in the host remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the CpG content of over 1.4 million full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes representing over 170 million documented infections during the first 17 months of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that the extent of CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is modest. Interestingly, the rate of CpG depletion is highest during early evolution in humans and it gradually tapers off, almost reaching an equilibrium; this is consistent with adaptations to the human host. Furthermore, within the coding regions, CpG depletion occurs predominantly at codon positions 2-3 and 3-1. Loss of ZAP (Zinc-finger antiviral protein)-binding motifs in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is primarily driven by the loss of the terminal CpG within the motifs. Nonetheless, majority of the CpG depletion in SARS-CoV-2 genomes occurs outside ZAP-binding motifs. SARS-CoV-2 genomes selectively lose CpGs-motifs from a U-rich context; this may help avoid immune recognition by TLR7. SARS-CoV-2 alpha-, beta-, and delta-variants of concern have reduced CpG content compared to sequences from the beginning of the pandemic. In sum, we provide evidence that the rate of CpG depletion in virus genomes is not uniform and it greatly varies over time and during adaptations to the host. This work highlights how temporal variations in selection pressures during virus adaption may impact the rate and the extent of CpG depletion in virus genomes.","output":"The Slowing Rate of CpG Depletion in SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Is Consistent with Adaptations to the Human Host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past decades, the striking development of cationic polypeptides and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) tailored for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery has been fuelled by the conception of nuclear acid therapy and precision medicine.

In the case of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an important paediatric pathogen, a decrease in the number of cases and delayed outbreaks was previously described. Aim and Methods: The genetic characteristics of the RSV circulating strains in paediatric patients in Buenos Aires, Argentina before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were studied. RSV (+) samples taken from hospitalised patients with respiratory tract infections (2018- 2021) were analysed through G gene sequencing and evolutionary analyses. Results: No RSV hospitalised paediatric patients were registered in Buenos Aires during 2020; however, RSV reemerged in 2021 with a lower number of cases and a delayed outbreak, peaking in July-August. A total of 147 G gene sequences were analysed. RSV-B (N = 85) predominated during 2018 and 2021 whereas in 2019 RSV-A were more prevalent (N = 62). All RSV-A sequences were ON1-like strains, and all RSV-B were BA-like. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the same genetic lineages circulated before and after 2020, but RSVs from 2021 corresponded to new viral introductions rather than cryptic circulation of the previous genetic clusters in Buenos Aires during 2020. Conclusions: Following the reopening of borders, the reemergence of RSV in Argentina brought new viral introductions from other countries. Therefore, it is important to continue a deep global molecular surveillance to characterise RSV strains in post-pandemic circulation with an impact in future vaccine implementation.","output":"RSV reemergence in Argentina since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has created unanticipated changes in health care delivery for people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkeyTM electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists' perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included ?-IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey, MS specialist physicians and other clinicians serving on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US reported profound changes in how they are delivering MS care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"How the COVID-19 Pandemic has changed multiple sclerosis clinical practice: Results of a nationwide provider survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to a pandemic with an overwhelming impact on daily living and the health care system.

We grouped sites into organisational tertiles by number of patients arriving 2.5 h and treated 3 h, percentage arriving 2.5 h and treated 3 h, and numbers treated 3 h. We assigned scores of 1-3 (lower/middle/upper) per variable and 2 for onsite thrombectomy. We classified sites as lower efficiency (summed scores 3-5), medium efficiency (6-8) or higher efficiency (9-11). Sites were also grouped by adherence with European product label and ESO guideline: 'label adherent' (>95% on-label), 'guideline adherent' (5% off-label, 95% on-guideline) or 'guideline non-adherent' (>5% off-guideline). We cross-tabulated site-efficiency and adherence. We estimated the potential benefit of universally selecting by ESO guidance, using onset-to-treatment time-specific numbers needed to treat for day 90 mRS 0-1. Results A total of 56,689 patients at 597 sites were included: 163 sites were higher efficiency, 204 medium efficiency and 230 lower efficiency. Fifty-six sites were 'label adherent', 204 'guideline adherent' and 337 'guideline non-adherent'. There were strong associations between site-efficiency and adherence (P < 0.001). Almost all 'label adherent' sites (55, 98%) were lower efficiency. If all patients were treated by ESO guidelines, an additional 17,031 would receive alteplase, which translates into 1922 more patients with favourable three-month outcomes.

Kinases play pivotal roles in many cellular biological processes, whereas dysregulation of kinases may lead to various diseases, particularly cancer. However, the role of kinases in HCC malignancy remains unclear. In this study, we employed a kinome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library, comprising 710 kinase-related genes, to screen whether any kinases were essential for cell proliferation in various HCC cell lines. Through a kinome siRNA library screening, we found that MAP3K7 was a crucial gene for HCC cell proliferation. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of MAP3K7 diminished the growth, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, including primary HCC cells. Stable knockdown of MAP3K7 attenuated tumor formation in a spheroid cell culture model and tumor xenograft mouse model. In addition, silencing MAP3K7 reduced the phosphorylation and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in HCC cells. MAP3K7 expression was positively correlated with mTOR expression in tumors of patients with HCC. Higher co-expression of MAP3K7 and mTOR was significantly associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Taken together, our results revealed that the MAP3K7-mTOR axis might promote tumorigenesis and malignancy, which provides a potential marker or therapeutic target for HCC patients.","output":"The MAP3K7-mTOR Axis Promotes the Proliferation and Malignancy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses how border guards as members of a state organisation shape the movement of non-nationals into the territory of a nation state.

It is prevalent, affects quality of life, and can cause absenteeism. Although evidence-based medical treatment options exist, women may not tolerate these or may prefer to use nonmedical treatments. Physical activity has been recommended by clinicians for primary dysmenorrhea since the 1930s, but there is still no high-quality evidence on which to recommend its use. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the effectiveness of physical activity for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. STUDY DESIGN Systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and OpenGrey were performed, from database inception to May 24, 2017. Google searches and citation searching of previous reviews were also conducted. Studies were selected using the following PICOS criteria: participants were nonathlete females experiencing primary dysmenorrhea; intervention was physical activity delivered for at least 2 menstrual cycles; comparator was any comparator; outcomes were pain intensity or pain duration; and study type was randomized controlled trials. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses for pain intensity and pain duration were conducted, with prespecified subgroup analysis by type of physical activity intervention. Strength of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS Searches identified 15 eligible randomized controlled trials totaling 1681 participants. Data from 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Pooled results demonstrated effect estimates for physical activity vs comparators for pain intensity (-1.89 cm on visual analog scale; 95% CI, -2.96 to -1.09) and pain duration (-3.92 hours; 95% CI, -4.86 to -2.97). Heterogeneity for both of these results was high and only partly mitigated by subgroup analysis. Primary studies were of low or moderate methodological quality but results for pain intensity remained stable during sensitivity analysis by study quality. GRADE assessment found moderate-quality evidence for pain intensity and low-quality evidence for pain duration.

Viruses have developed diverse strategies to subvert host defense mechanisms and increase their survival.

In the present work, the effect of the absence of gene 7 on the host cell, during infection, was further analyzed by transcriptomic analysis. The pattern of gene expression of cells infected with a recombinant mutant TGEV, lacking gene 7 expression (rTGEV-7), was compared to that of cells infected with the parental virus (rTGEV-wt). Genes involved in the immune response, the interferon response, and inflammation were upregulated during TGEV infection in the absence of gene 7. An exacerbated innate immune response during infection with rTGEV-7 virus was observed both in vitro and in vivo. An increase in macrophage recruitment and activation in lung tissues infected with rTGEV-7 virus was observed compared to cells infected with the parental virus. In summary, the absence of protein 7 both in vitro and in vivo led to increased proinflammatory responses and acute tissue damage after infection.

The consequences of stigma are worse for racial and/or ethnic minorities compared to racial and/or ethnic majorities since the former often experience other social adversities such as poverty and discrimination within policies and institutions. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence on the impact of differences in mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis included cross-sectional studies comparing mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities. Systematic searches were conducted in the bibliographic databases of PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE until 20th December 2018. Outcomes were extracted from published reports, and meta-analyses, and meta-regression analyses were conducted in CMA software. RESULTS After screening 2787 abstracts, 29 studies with 193,418 participants (N = 35,836 in racial minorities) were eligible for analyses. Racial minorities showed more stigma than racial majorities (g = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.12 ~ 0.27) for common mental disorders. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of these results. Multivariate meta-regression analyses pointed to the possible moderating role of the number of studies with high risk of bias on the effect size. Racial minorities have more stigma for common mental disorders when compared with majorities. Limitations included moderate to high risk of bias, high heterogeneity, few studies in most comparisons, and the use of non-standardized outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Mental illness stigma is higher among ethnic minorities than majorities.

This paper reviews the pandemic response of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia CHAMP 3D Lab, a point-ofcare3D printing team that supports clinical and research projects across the hospital network. The CHAMP team responded to a variety of COVID-19 healthcare needs including providing protective eyewear and ventilator components, creating a transport hook, and designing a novel transparent facemask. This case series details our response to these needs, describing challenges experienced and lessons learned in overcoming them so that others may learn from our experiences. Challenges to responding to the pandemic included the need to handle urgent pandemic related requests in addition to our standard fare. This required us to not only expand our capacity without additional resources, but also to develop a system of prioritization. Specific changes made included: streamlining workflows, identifying safety review processes, and developing/enlisting a network of collaborators. Further, we consider how to transition to a future, post-pandemic world without losing the cohesive drive of emergency-induced innovation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges that have further exacerbated the risk of burnout in anesthesiologists. It is critical to develop effective strategies to promote well-being and decrease burnout for physicians in this specialty. The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate the impact of a Physician Well-Being Initiative on distress and well-being in anesthesiologists. It was hypothesized that the wellness intervention would promote an improvement in well-being scores. METHODS: The Physician Well-Being Initiative was launched in August 2019 in the Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Management and Perioperative Medicine at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. The Physician Well-Being Initiative was designed to address several of the key factors that improve physician wellness, including 1) a sense of autonomy; 2) positive view of leadership; and 3) flexible schedule opportunities. To assess the impact of the Physician Well-Being Initiative on the well-being and distress scores of participating anesthesiologists, the physicians were emailed the validated Well-Being Index survey at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months. The Well-Being Index evaluates multiple items of distress in the healthcare setting. The sample size was limited to the 54 anesthesiologists at Henry Ford Hospital. RESULTS: Forty-four of the 54 anesthesiologists completed the baseline questionnaire. A total of 44 physicians answered the questionnaire at baseline, with more male than female physicians (35 males and 7 females) and the majority (17/44) in practice for 5-10 years. Thirty-two physicians completed the survey at 3 and 6 months, and 31 physicians at 12 months after the launch of the Physician Well-Being Initiative. Twenty-one physicians completed the questionnaire at all 4 time points. Although the COVID-19 pandemic started shortly after the 6-month surveys were submitted, results indicated that there was a 0.05 decrease in the Well-Being Index sum score for every 1-month of time (coefficient -0.05, 95% CI -0.01, -0.08, P = 0.013). This study shows that, with the wellness initiative in place, the department was able to maintain and potentially even reduce physician distress despite the concurrent onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Following the launch of a sustained wellness initiative, this study demonstrates that physician wellness improved with time. This suggests that it takes time for a wellness initiative to have an effect on well-being and distress in anesthesiologists.","output":"The Burnout Epidemic Within A Viral Pandemic: Impact of a Wellness Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Using WHO standards in pediatric practice is still controversial for many countries. It is suggested that national growth charts best reflect the genetic and ethnic characteristics of a population. The aim of this study was to compare length/height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) in healthy Turkish children of ages 0 to 18 with those proposed by WHO as the international growth standards. Methods: The data of Turkish children were collected from infant/child population aged 0-5 years (2391 boys, 2102 girls) and children of ages between 6-18 years (1100 boys, 1020 girls). For comparison, the 50th, 3rd, and 97th percentile curves for length/height, weight, and BMI in Turkish children were plotted together with respective WHO data. Results: Heights were essentially similar in the Turkish and WHO data at ages between 3-10 years. Turkish children were markedly taller compared to the WHO standards after age 10 years. Evaluation of the 3rd percentile data revealed that Turkish boys were shorter than the WHO subjects in the first 2 years of life. From 6 months of age, Turkish children showed higher weight for age values in the 3rd, 50th, and 97th percentiles. In all age groups between 6 months and 3 years, and in between 6-18 years of age, z score values, as well as the 50th, 15th, 85th, and 95th percentile values were higher in Turkish children. The differences were particularly noteworthy at ages 1-2 years and in the pubertal years. Conclusion: WHO growth standards do not reflect the growth of Turkish children and may substantially alter the prevalence of short stature and underweight in Turkish children 0-5 years of age.

METHODS Medline, WHO COVID-19, and MedRxIV databases were searched; studies meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed in parallel, and variables describing study characteristics, study quality, and risk factor data were abstracted. Study quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Random effects meta-analysis of relative risks (categorical variables) and unstandardized mean differences (continuous variables) was performed; multivariate models and clinical prediction rules were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS A total of 551 studies were identified and 22 studies were included. The median or mean age ranged from 38 to 68 years. All studies included only inpatients, and mortality rates ranged from 3.2% to 50.5%. Individual risk factors most strongly associated with mortality included increased age, c-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, heart rate, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin as well as decreased oxygen saturation, the presence of dyspnea, and comorbid coronary heart and chronic kidney disease. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes reported most frequently by multivariate models include increasing age, increased CRP, decreased lymphocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, elevated temperature, and the presence of any comorbidity. Simple risk scores and multivariate models have been proposed but are often complex, and most have not been validated. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review identifies several risk factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19-infected inpatients that are often available in the outpatient and primary care settings: increasing age, increased CRP or procalcitonin, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased oxygen saturation, dyspnea on presentation, and the presence of comorbidities. Future research to develop clinical prediction models and rules should include these predictors as part of their core data set to develop and validate pragmatic outpatient risk scores.","output":"Primary Care Relevant Risk Factors for Adverse Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has drastically changed everyday life worldwide. This study aimed to determine how COVID-19 affected the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe burn injury by examining a city-wide burn database in Tokyo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in 14 burn centers using the Tokyo Burn Unit Association registry from 1999C2020. The pandemic started in 2020, while the stay-at-home order lasted from April to May. The demographics, mechanisms, severity, and clinical outcomes were assessed before and during these two time periods. RESULTS: In total, 7061 patients with burn injury were enrolled. During the pandemic, there were less patients during the pandemic than previous years, except for AprilCMay; this decreased toward the end of 2020. There were also more scald/contact burns in the upper extremity, less intended and assault injuries, shorter length of hospital stay, and lower in-hospital mortality. During the stay-at-home order, there was increased incidence of flame burns, inhalation injuries, and in-hospital mortality, as well as higher total body surface area of full-thickness burns.

Despite the continuous exchange of membrane components among them, the organelles maintain their characteristic protein and lipid compositions such that the traffic remains selective, thus, avoiding intermixing of components. This membrane traffic recycles components from the cell surface to the interior of the cell and back to the cell surface again. The membrane traffic between the ER and the cell surface involves a major sorting problem. Little is known of how the animal cell has solved this problem in molecular terms. One experimental tool in this direction is provided by some enveloped animal viruses, which mature at the cell surface of infected cells.

However, activation of compensatory mechanisms and biological processes facilitates high altitude acclimatization. A large number of lowlanders stay at high altitude regions from weeks to months for work and professional commitments, and thus are vulnerable to altitude-associated disorders. Despite this, there is a scarcity of information for molecular changes associated with long-term stay at high altitudes. In the present study, we evaluated oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) of lowlanders after short- (7 days, HA-D7) and long-term (3 months, HA-D150) stay at high altitudes, and used TMT-based proteomics studies to decipher plasma proteome alterations. We observed improvements in SpO2 levels after prolonged stay, while HR, SBP, and DBP remained elevated as compared with short-term stay. Plasma proteomics studies revealed higher levels of apolipoproteins APOB, APOCI, APOCIII, APOE, and APOL, and carbonic anhydrases (CA1 and CA2) during hypoxia exposure. Biological network analysis also identified profound alterations in lipoprotein-associated pathways like plasma lipoprotein assembly, VLDL clearance, chylomicron assembly, chylomicron remodeling, plasma lipoprotein clearance, and chylomicron clearance. In corroboration, lipid profiling revealed higher levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) for HA-D150 whereas high density lipoproteins (HDL) levels were lower as compared with HA-D7 and sea-level indicating dyslipidemia. We also observed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF, and CRP for HA-D150 along with oxidized LDL (oxLDL), suggesting vascular inflammation and proartherogenic propensity.

Abnormal hematological findings are thought to have a role in early risk stratification and prognostication of COVID-19 patients. However, the data on hematological abnormalities associated with the disease among Ethiopian COVID-19 patients are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude of hematological abnormalities among COVID-19 patients admitted at Millennium COVID-19 referral treatment center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 referral treatment center from May to July, 2020. A total of 334 COVID-19 patients were included using convenience sampling. Socio-demographic data and disease severity status of admitted patients were recorded. Three milliliters of venous blood was collected and analyzed by Beckman Coulter DXH-600 automated analyzer to determine complete blood count (CBC). The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Association of age, sex, and disease severity with hematological abnormalities was analyzed using binary logistic regression. An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to measure the strength of association. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 334 admitted COVID-19 patients, the majority were males (62.3%) and 69.8% had moderate disease conditions. The overall magnitude of any cytopenia and pancytopenia was 41% and 1.8%, respectively. The magnitude of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia was 24.9%, 21.6%, and 5.4%, respectively. Lymphopenia (72.2%) was the most common hematological abnormality. COVID-19 patients with severe and critical disease were more likely to develop anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilia-lymphopenia than those with moderate disease condition, with a significant association. CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia was the most common hematological abnormality observed among COVID-19 patients. Hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilia-lymphopenia were significantly associated with disease severity. Monitoring and evaluation of hematological parameters could provide prognostic insight into the management and risk stratification of COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Based on the daily reported new cases and the population-movement data between 1 and 31 January, we examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the geographical expansion of the infection in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan using different closing-date scenarios. RESULTS: We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the COVID-19 cases. The spatial distribution of cases per unit of outflow population indicated that the infection in some areas with a large outflow of population might have been underestimated, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. Further analysis revealed that if the city-closure policy had been implemented 2 days earlier, 1420 (95% confidence interval, 1059-1833) cases could have been prevented, and if 2 days later, 1462 (1090-1886) more cases would have been possible.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 14-item survey was sent to PDs of ACGME-accredited OS residencies. Questions were designed to assess the pros, cons, and robustness of VIs compared to their antecedent in-person format. RESULTS: Forty-seven PDs responded to our survey. VIs antagonized PDs' ability to assess applicants' fit to program (76.6%), commitment to specialty (64%), and interpersonal skills (68.1%). This led to heavier dependence upon applicants' portfolios (64%). Almost all respondents (97.9%) found VIs to be more cost-efficient, saving a median of $3000 in interview-related expenses. Overall, only 8.5% of PDs were willing to conduct exclusive VIs in future cycles, compared to the majority in favor of dual formats (51.5%) or exclusive in-person interviews (40.4%).

Limited information is available regarding the appropriate approaches to the management of catatonia in COVID-19 infection, particularly with reference to the safety and efficacy of benzodiazepines and Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT). We present our experience of five patients with catatonia consequent to heterogeneous underlying causes and concurrent COVID-19 infection, who received care at the psychiatric COVID unit of our tertiary care psychiatric hospital. An interesting observation included varying underlying causes for catatonia and the potential role that COVID-19 infection may have played in the manifestation of catatonia. In our experience, new-onset catatonia with or without pre-existing psychiatric illness and concurrent COVID-19 can be safely and effectively managed with lorazepam and/or ECTs. However, critical to the same is the need to implement modified protocols that integrate pre-emptive evaluation for COVID-19 disease and proactive monitoring of its relevant clinical parameters, thereby permitting judicious and timely implementation of catatonia-specific treatment options.","output":"Concurrent catatonia and COVID-19 infection C An experiential account of challenges and management of cases from a tertiary care psychiatric hospital in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledgeable FAQ chatbots are a valuable resource to any organization.

Our aim was to investigate adherence to SCIT with aeroallergens during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate clinical consequences of treatment disruptions in real life. METHODS: Visual analogue scale for quality of life (VAS-QoL), VAS for symptom scores (VAS-symptom), medication scores (MSs), and total symptom scores (TSS-6) were recorded during the pandemic in 327 adult allergic rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients receiving maintenance SCIT, and these scores were compared with the pre-pandemic data. Patients were grouped according to SCIT administration intervals; no delay (Group 1), <2 months (Group 2), and &#8805;2-month intervals (Group 3). RESULTS: A total of 104 (31.8%) patients (Group 3) were considered as nonadherent which was mostly related to receiving SCIT with HDMs and using public transportation for reaching the hospital. Median MS, VAS-symptom, and TSS-6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre-pandemic scores (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas median VAS-QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre-pandemic scores (p < 0.001). Median TSS-6 and VAS-symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared with other groups (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS-QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared with Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.001, p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be encouraged to regularly adhere to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","output":"Adherence to subcutaneous immunotherapy with aeroallergens in real-life practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research presents the NatVi Framework for Agile Software Development, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and Quality Assurance (QA). The research took place in a context of profound and rapid changes in business environments that affect the software development environment. Our previous work did a Systematic Literature Review trying to find articles dealing with SOA and Agile and the challenges inherent in this combination of solutions. In order to build the Framework, this work took the shortcomings found in the solutions presented in the papers and further incorporated the necessary QA concept. In this context, the Framework attempts to provide an answer to how to develop software with quality and rapid deliveries in an ever-changing environment, where the traditional forms of software development may not handle it. Background research identified trade-offs among SOA, QA, and Agile, e.g., formality, documentation, and planning. The background research also identified strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in papers that addressed solutions to problems that arise in software development in the presented context. The results of the background research were assessed and exploited in Framework construction. In a single life-cycle, the NatVi Framework combines Agile, SOA, and QA and addresses the values and principles that guide them in 13 phases distributed in four layers. Each phase is carried out by people who perform specific roles, expressed in terms of inputs, tasks, and outputs.

The Older Adult Mental Health Wards in Bridgend were relocated from the district general hospital (Princess of Wales) and merged at Angelton Clinic, an off site separate unit. It was therefore essential that patients had clear escalation of care plans as access to medical input was limited and transfer to hospital potentially not appropriate in the later stages of chronic illness such as dementia. The initial aim of the PDSA cycle was to assess the level of compliance with Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) discussions and if appropriate, DNAR documentation. The other aim was to assess the utilisation of Escalation of Care plans. Method An audit of patients MDT medical notes on 38 admitted to Angelton clinic was carrired out in March. It was documented if the patient had a clear DNAR or Escalation plan that was easily accessible in the front of the notes. The guidelines compared to were the GMC recommendations that patients 12 months of should have a discussion about risks and benefits associated with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. If the patient lacks capacity a best interest decision should be made with nearest relatives. Discussions should also be had with patients and family in in regards to and transfer to a medical ward. Upon completion of the initial PDSA cycle, views were sought from the wider MDT a new escalation of care proforma was designed. This was implemented by education and communication with members of the medical team. This was to be clearly placed in the notes, with the DNAR form if that was appropriate. Result All inpatient notes were audited at Angelton Clinic in March 2020. It was found that only 18% of patients had Escalation of Care plans in comparison to 84% of notes which had DNAR forms. Previous escalation of care forms were not being utilised appropriately. Upon implementation of the Escalation of Care proforma, a re-audit of the audit cyle was completed. In July 2020 it was found that 78% of notes had completed Escalation of Care forms with 83% had completed DNAR forms. Conclusion To enable ongoing sustained improvement, the unit Nurse Practitioner will champion its completion.

However, next-generation sequencing has not been used for routine viral detection in clinical respiratory samples owing to its sophisticated technology. Here, several pharyngeal samples with COPD were collected to enrich viral particles using an optimized method (M3), which involved M1 with centrifugation, filtration, and concentration, M2 (magnetic beads) combined with mixed nuclease digestion, and M4 with no pretreatment as a control. Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses showed that the M3 method for viral enrichment was superior in both viral sequencing composition and viral taxa when compared to M1, M2, and M4. M3 acquired the most viral reads and more complete sequences within 15-h performance, indicating that it might be feasible for viral detection in multiple respiratory samples in clinical practice. Based on sequence similarity analysis, 12 human viruses, including nine Anelloviruses and three coronaviruses, were characterized. Coronavirus OC43 with the largest number of viral reads accounted for nearly complete (99.8%) genome sequences, indicating that it may be a major viral pathogen involved in exacerbation of COPD.","output":"An Optimized Metagenomic Approach for Virome Detection of Clinical Pharyngeal Samples With Respiratory Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adults with diabetes often receive self-management support from family and friends (care partners) living in and outside of their home. Helpful involvement from care partners (CPs) has positive impacts on diabetes self-management. Less is known regarding the relationship between the number of CPs and the level of helpful and harmful involvement. We examined the relationship between the number of in and out-of-home CPs and helpful and harmful involvement in patients' diabetes self-management. Methods: Adults with type 2 diabetes (N=369) were recruited from a web-based panel. Participants completed the Family and Friend Involvement in Adults' Diabetes (FIAD) scale and reported the number of in and out-of-home CPs who provide help with their diabetes self-management. A two-step hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the linear and quadratic trends between number of in and out-of-home CPs and helpful and harmful involvement in diabetes self-care, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: There was a positive linear relationship between the number of in and out-of-home CPs, and helpful and harmful involvement (p's;range < .001 to .003). The addition of quadratic terms accounted for a significant increase in explained variance in helpful and harmful involvement (p's < .001). There was a positive trend between the number of in and out-of-home CPs and helpful and harmful involvement among adults with up to approximately 5 CPs. In contrast, there was a negative trend between these variables among individuals with 5 or more CPs. Conclusions: Patients with a relatively small or large number of CPs, receive less helpful and harmful support. Large CP networks are not necessarily indicative of high levels of helpful involvement in patients' diabetes self-care. CP interventions should attempt to enhance helpful involvement while minimizing harmful involvement in these populations.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Worries on Diabetes Distress and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Nicaraguan government's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been nothing short of absurd Rather than implementing measures advised by the public health experts, the government has been organizing mass gatherings and hiding the scale of infection This essay argues that current governmental behavior is both consistent with and a continuation of the crimes against humanity committed in 2018 and 2019","output":"Love in the Time of Covid-19: Or, Nicaragua, the Strange Country Where Children Still Go to School"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation Zoonosis, the natural transmission of infections from animals to humans, is a far-reaching global problem. The recent outbreaks of Zika virus, Ebola virus and Corona virus are examples of viral zoonosis, which occur more frequently due to globalization. In the case of a virus outbreak, it is helpful to know which host organism was the original carrier of the virus. Once the reservoir or intermediate host is known, it can be isolated to prevent further spreading of the viral infection. Recent approaches aim to predict a viral host based on the viral genome, often in combination with the potential host genome and arbitrarily selected features. These methods have a clear limitation in either the number of different hosts they can predict or the accuracy of their prediction. Results Here, we present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral host prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence only. To ensure a high prediction accuracy, we developed an effective selection approach for the training data to avoid biases due to a highly unbalanced number of known sequences per virus-host combinations. We tested our deep neural network on three different virus species (influenza A, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A). We reached for each virus species an AUG between 0.93 and 0.98, outperforming previous approaches and allowing highly accurate predictions while only using fractions (100-400 bp) of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural networks are suitable to predict the host of a virus, even with a limited amount of sequences and highly unbalanced available data. The deep neural networks trained for this approach build the core of the virus-host predicting tool VIDHOP (Virus Deep learning HOst Prediction). Availability The trained models for the prediction of the host for the viruses influenza A, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A are implemented in the tool VIDHOP.

Local approval was obtained at individual sites. Data was analysed in Stata SE v16. RESULTS: 118 responses (17 surgeons, 7 specialties) were collected from June to September 2020. 77.1% used enhanced PPE. There was no association between enhanced PPE use and overall workload (p = 0.151) as measured with SURG-TLX, although surgeons wearing enhanced PPE commonly reported finding individual procedures harder than expected (37% vs 0%, p < 0.001).

The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients and the secondary endpoint was the outcomes of COVID-19-infected cancer patients with incidence of severe illness and death rate. We calculated the pooled prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using a random-effects model, and performed meta-regression analyses to explore heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on continent, country, age, sample size and study design. Findings A total of 107 eligible global studies were included in the systematic review. 90 studies with 94,845 COVID-19 patients in which 4,106 patients with cancer morbidity were included in the meta-analysis for prevalence of cancer morbidity among COVID-19 patients. 21 studies with 70,969 COVID-19 patients in which 3,351 patients with cancer morbidity who had severe illness or death during the studies. The overall prevalence of cancer among the COVID-19 patients was 0.07 (95% CI 0.05~0.09). The cancer prevalence in COVID-19 patients of Europe (0.22, 95% CI 0.17~0.28) was higher than that in Asia Pacific (0.04, 95% CI 0.03~0.06) and North America (0.05, 95% CI 0.04~0.06). The prevalence of COVID-19-infected cancer patients over 60 years old was 0.10 (95% CI 0.07~0.14), higher than that of patients equal and less than 60 years old (0.05, 95% CI 0.03~0.06). The pooled prevalence of severe illness among COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27~0.43) and the pooled death rate of COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.18 (95% CI 0.14~0.18). The pooled incidence of severe illness of COVID-19 patients with cancers from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.38(0.24, 0.52), 0.36(0.17, 0.55), and 0.26(0.20, 0.31), respectively; and the pooled death rate from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.17(0.10, 0.24), 0.26(0.13, 0.39), and 0.19(0.13, 0.25), respectively.

Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews and artifacts, including the course materials and screen recordings of teaching in online virtual classrooms. A qualitative and interpretive analysis reveals three patterns of changes in the teachers feedback-giving practice. The first pattern was positive changes in the teachers feedback-giving motivation, design, and awareness of the relational nature of teacher feedback, and the second pattern was reduction in formative feedback activities, difficulties in securing student response, and increased physical and emotional feedback workload.

Patients undergoing TAVI between January 2012 and November 2017 in the Nationwide Readmission Database were identified. Trends in cause-specific readmissions were assessed using Poisson regression. Thirty-day TAVI cost burden (cost of index TAVI hospitalization plus total 30-day readmissions cost) was adjusted to 2017 U.S. dollars and trended over year from 2012 to 2017. Overall, 47,255 TAVI were included and 30-day readmissions declined from 20% to 12% (p<0.0001). Most common causes of readmission (heart failure, infection/sepsis, gastrointestinal causes, and respiratory) declined as well, except arrhythmia/heart block which increased (1.0% to 1.4%, p<0.0001). Cost of TAVI hospitalization ($52,024 to $44,110, p<0.0001) and 30-day cost burden ($54,122 to $45,252, p<0.0001) declined. While costs of an average readmission did not change ($9,734 to $10,068, p=0.06), cost burden of readmissions (per every TAVI performed) declined ($4,061 to $1,883, p<0.0001), including reductions in each of the top 5 causes except arrhythmia/heart block ($171 to $263, p=0.04). Index TAVI hospitalizations complicated by acute kidney injury, length of stay 5 days, low hospital procedural volume, and skilled nursing facility discharge were associated with increased odds of 30-day readmissions. In conclusion, the costs of index hospitalizations and 30-day cost burden for TAVI in the U.S. significantly declined from 2012-2017. However, readmissions due to arrhythmia/heart block and their associated costs increased. Continued strategies to prevent readmissions, especially those for conduction disturbances, are crucial in the efforts to optimize outcomes and costs with the ongoing expansion of TAVI.","output":"Trends in Costs and Risk Factors of 30-Day Readmissions for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China is one of the worlds most important countries for waterfowl because of the large amount of potential habitat and its position along major migratory routes.

Factors that activate the endothelium include inflammatory cytokines, mechanical stretch, and pathological shear stress. These signals can activate the endothelium to promote upregulation of adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which promote leukocyte adhesion and migration to the activated endothelium. More importantly, it is now recognized that some of these signals may in turn promote endothelial antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II.

However, the poor bioavailability, low stability on gastrointestinal systems, and fast plasma elimination limit further clinical applications of Ginsenoside Rh2 for cancer treatments. In this study, a novel formulation of niosomal Ginsenoside Rh2 was prepared using the thin film hydration technique. Methods The niosomal formulation contained Span 60 and cholesterol, and cationic lipid DOTAP was evaluated by determining particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, the polydispersity index (PDI), and surface morphology. The cytotoxic effects of free Ginsenoside Rh2 and Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomes were determined using the MTT method in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. For the investigation of the in vitro cellular uptake of Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosome, two formulations were prepared: the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula containing 5% DOTAP and the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula without DOTAP. Results The mean size, DPI, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded nanoniosomal formulation containing DOTAP were 93.52.1 nm, 0.2030.01, +4.650.65, and 98.32% 2.4, respectively. The niosomal vesicles were found to be round and have a smooth surface. The release profile of Ginsenoside Rh2 from niosome was biphasic. Furthermore, a two-fold reduction in the Ginsenoside Rh2 concentration was measured when Ginsenoside Rh2 was administered in a nanoniosomal form compared to free Ginsenoside Rh2 solutions in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. After storage for 90 days, the encapsulation efficiency, vesicle size, PDI, and zeta potential of the optimized formulation did not significantly change compared to the freshly prepared samples. The cellular uptake experiments of the niosomal formulation demonstrated that by adding DOTAP to the niosomal formulation, the cellular uptake was enhanced. Discussion The enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxic activity of the Ginsenoside Rh2 nanoniosomal formulation on the PC3 cell make it an attractive candidate for application as a nano-sized delivery vehicle to transfer Ginsenoside Rh2 to cancer cells.","output":"Assessment of a New Ginsenoside Rh2 Nanoniosomal Formulation for Enhanced Antitumor Efficacy on Prostate Cancer: An in vitro Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, laryngoscopy was the mandatory gold standard for the accurate assessment and diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction.

We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 transcription and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, while adjusting for expression of: (i) the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), (ii) soluble ACE2, (iii) age, and (iv) biological sex. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of n = 424 \\"participants\\" aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex to patients who tested negative. Viral load and host gene expression were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Analysis showed no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P = 0a?092). Mean relative transcription of transmembrane (P = 0a?00012) and soluble (P<0a?0001) ACE2 isoforms, as well as TMPRSS2 (P<0a?0001) was higher in COVID-19-negative participants than COVID--19 positive ones, yielding a negative correlation between targeted host gene expression and positive COVID-19 diagnosis. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, transcription of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (B = 0a?49, R2=0a?14, P<0a?0001), transcription of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (B= -0a?85, R2= 0a?26, P<0a?0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 transcription (B= -0a?042, R2=<0a?10, P = 0a?69). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 transcription (&#914;= 0a?89, 95%CI: [0a?59 to 1a?18]), while transcription of the soluble isoform appears to protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (&#914;= -0a?099, 95%CI: [-0a?18 to -0a?022]). INTERPRETATION: Nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transcription of the transmembrane ACE2 isoform positively correlates, while transcription of the soluble isoform negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex, and transcription of TMPRSS2.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed unrelated cases of the children with confirmed multiple indoor allergen sensitization due to prolonged exposure to unhealthy indoor environment with infestation and water damage, who, in addition to multiple health problems related to allergy and asthma, also developed neuroimmune complications and growth delay. Results Documented early in life atypical neurologic and behavioral changes were common in all cases. Clinical analysis did not establish other causative reason aside from prenatal and early life exposure to unhealthy living conditions. Alternaria Alternara and Penicillium/Aspergillus molds were found in all homes and sensitization was confirmed in all cases. Significant similarities in the symptoms recorded in all three families led us to a hypothesis that, likely, a significant level of the immune response to external immunogenic pathological stimulus such as mold spore protein, mycotoxin protein, dust mite protein, decay-related volatile particles (VOC) skewed a balance of the neuroimmune interactions, and further affected neuronal network establishment. As all children exhibited significant spectrum of the systemic inflammatory conditions early in life, coupled with inability to follow normal neurodevelopment, we hypothesize that an overwhelming activation of the aggressive immune mechanisms by the epigenetic factors led to glia activation, cytokine storm and break of tolerance. Conclusions We hypothesize that developing immune system exhibited aggressive responses due to environmental danger signals, subsequently TH-1 or TH-2 switch enables multiple clinical syndromes development with atypical presentation due to the described novel mechanism. An increased due to the COVID-19 lock-down may increase an amount of exposure of vulnerable people to indoor biological particles and volatile organic compounds present in unhealthy buildings.

We developed a model to adapt and test the implementation of a postpartum depression prevention intervention (Reach Out and Stay Strong, Essentials for new Mothers -- ROSE) in shelter. Our model entailed: (1) Intervention Adaptation and Planning (2) Feasibility Testing, (3) Monitoring Outcomes. The adapted intervention was called Strong in Shelter (SIS). Methods: Intervention adaptation and planning entailed provider engagement, shelter resident input, and responsive adaptations. Feasibility testing began in pilot sites, and we made modifications based on feedback. Fidelity to the model was tracked through session checklists, audio recordings and weekly consultations. Additional modifications were made due to COVID-19. Outcome measures were collected pre- and post-intervention, and included measures of depression (PHQ-9), perceived social support (MSPSS) and perceived stress (PSS). We also collected data on trauma exposure. Paired Samples T-Test analyses were conducted to examine changes in PHQ-9, MSPSS and PSS scores over time. These repeated measures were stratified by interpersonal trauma, mode, and number of sessions completed using general linear model analyses. Results: Involving the community being served and the intervention facilitators early on was an important factor in the success of SIS. Barriers to participant engagement were seen across each phase of SIS, but once residents did engage 70% (40 of 57 women who were consented) attended at least half the sessions. Satisfaction was high, with nearly 100% of women participating in SIS and receiving a consistent questionnaire reporting the group was helpful (N=22). The PHQ-9 decreased by 2.68 points after SIS (p=0.002);this change was stronger for those who experienced interpersonal trauma, and findings were consistent in the virtual implementation during COVID-19 (N=46). Conclusions: Providing evidence-based preventive interventions to underserved populations is essential to ensure that effective programs reach those in need. Our data suggest that by engaging staff and the population early and continually, and utilizing an iterative and flexible process, EBIs such as SIS can effectively be implemented in institutional settings, and may reduce depressive symptoms among women in shelter.","output":"From Feasibility to Outcomes: the Case of a Postpartum Depression Prevention Intervention in Shelter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism destinations are now facing a dilemma choice of controlling the epidemic or developing the economy.

This includes limitations in interfaces, search capabilities, provision of quality information and the lack of definite standards and implementation guidelines. Many Semantic Web specifications and technologies are specifically designed to address the publication of data on the web. In addition, many official publication bodies encourage and foster the development of Open Data standards based on Semantic Web principles. However, no existing solution for managing Open Data takes full advantage of these possibilities and benefits. In this paper, we present our solution Piveau, a fully-fledged Open Data management solution, based on Semantic Web technologies.

These sectors are becoming increasingly interlinked in environmental policy-making and with regard to achieving supply security. There is a pressing need for a systematization of impacts and responses beyond individual disruptions. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the implications of COVID-19 on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. First, it integrates the academic literature related to single cases and disruptions to provide a broader view of COVID-19 demand- and supply-side disruptions and immediate effects. Then, the major, long-term impact categories of medicalization/hygienization, (re)localization of production, and demand fluctuations are highlighted. These impacts result in priority cross-links such as irrigation, energy requirements for local food production, energy use for water and wastewater treatment, or water for energy use. Finally, sector-level insights on impacts and responses are provided, drawing from illustrative cases. The analysis of impacts of COVID-19 on the WEF nexus reflects heterogeneous experiences of short-term adaptations, and highlights the revaluation of the water-food-trade nexus. Revived debates on food sufficiency can benefit from green applications to minimize expected trade-offs. The current crisis also reveals some gaps in the WEF nexus debates with regard to the lack of risk-based perspectives and the need for a better consideration of spatial aspects in resource integration. Regarding resource-security issues in the WEF nexus, the COVID-19 stress test boosts debates concerning the adequacy of the production value chains (e.g., contingency and storage, diversification, and self-sufficiency) and the value of cross-border integration (e.g., trade, globalization, and aid).","output":"The water-energy-food nexus and COVID-19: Towards a systematization of impacts and responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate and unprecedented impact on children with disabilities, their parents and families.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of vedolizumab (VDZ), a gut-selective anti-integrin, on COVID-19 outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Methods Utilizing data from the Surveillance of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for IBD (SECUREIBD), an international, collaborative registry of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19, we studied the impact of VDZ use compared to non-use, and VDZ monotherapy compared to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monotherapy, on hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation and/or death) in adult IBD patients using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Backward selection of covariates was performed to obtain parsimonious models. P values #0.05 were considered significant for all analyses. Results Of 2,631 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 on any IBD medication in the registry as of November 11, 2020, 312 (11.9%) patients were on VDZ of whom 236 (9.0%) were on VDZ monotherapy. A total of 731 (27.8%) patients were on an anti-TNF monotherapy. COVID-19 outcomes were similar for VDZ users versus non-users [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.09 for hospitalization and 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.10 for severe COVID-19, Table]. However, compared to anti-TNF monotherapy, VDZ monotherapy was positively associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (aOR 1.66, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.35 and 4.71, 95% CI 1.65 to 13.45, respectively). Discussion VDZ use, compared to non-use, was not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. However, when compared to anti-TNF monotherapy, VDZ monotherapy was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and ICU requirement/death. These findings suggest the comparable safety of VDZ relative to most other IBD therapies. The observed effect of anti-TNF may be related to improved safety and/or a possible protective effect against more aggressive COVID-19.(Table presented) Table: Multivariable regression analyses with backward selection of covariates for COVID-19 outcomes by medication class from adult cases in the SECURE-IBD registry","output":"Fr494 THE IMPACT OF VEDOLIZUMAB THERAPY ON COVID-19 OUTCOMES IN ADULT IBD PATIENTS IN THE SECURE-IBD REGISTRY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are currently living in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic that imposes a significant stress on health care providers and facilities.

Peer reviewed data is sparse comparing glycemic control and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients with vs. without DM2, and thus we sought to address this gap. Methods: We selected patients at least 18 years old who expired or were discharged between March 16, 2020 through September 15, 2020. Principal analysis compared glycemic patterns among patients with DM2 vs. non-DM2. Median, coefficient of variation (CV), maximum and minimum glucose parameters were computed to characterize longitudinal glycemic patterns. Logistic regression modeling identified significant (p<.05) associations between composite outcome vs. glycemic parameters and putative risks for progression to severe COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified cut points for glycemic parameters. Cox regression models were employed to control for significant confounders. Continuous data summarized as median was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Discrete data were compared with Pearsons chi-square test. Two-tailed p<.05 was significant. Results: Among 494 patients, 157 (32%) had DM2 with no intergroup differences in age (68 [56C79]), sex (52% male, 48% female), or race (68% Caucasian, 19% Other, 13% African American). Insulin was administered to DM2 (93%) and non-DM2 (54%) patients (p<.0001). Comorbidities were more prevalent in DM2, including cardiovascular (68% vs. 54%, p=.003), renal (72% vs. 52%, p<.0001) and obesity (51% vs. 38%, p<.0001). Markers including D-dimer (0.98 [0.61C1.95] mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (308 [230C392] U/L), ferritin (436 [174C856] ng/mL), and triglycerides (172 [109C239] mg/dL), were not different in DM2 vs. non-DM2 (p>.05). CRP was greater in patients with (8.6 [3.6C14.6]) vs. without (6.1 [2.0C12.6]) DM2 (p=.005). Baseline glucose in DM2 (163 [121C253] mg/dL) vs. non-DM2 (107 [96C124] mg/dL) was significantly greater, with former an independent predictor of composite outcome (p=.0005). Cox modeling of other glucose parameters in DM2 vs. non-DM2 demonstrated various impact regarding risk for composite outcome including median (155 [128C209], p=.46) vs. (103 [94C118], p=.09); coefficient of variation (28 [19C38], p=.08) vs. (15 [9C20], p=.002); maximum (252 [187C362], p=.0005) vs. (129 [110C156], p=.002); and minimum (99 [79C128], p=.95) vs. (89 [81C98], p=.02).

Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in hMDM. Although, hMDM expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, no or very low levels of transmembrane protease serine 2 were found.

In the brain, this information can be used in several important ways, including to examine tissue abnormalities associated with brain disorders and to infer anatomical connectivity and the organization of white matter bundles through the use of tractography algorithms. However, dMRI also presents certain challenges. For example, historically, the biological validation of tractography models has shown only moderate correlations with anatomical connectivity as determined through invasive tract-tracing studies. Some of the factors contributing to such issues are low spatial resolution, low signal-to-noise ratios, and long scan times required for high-quality data, along with modeling challenges like complex fiber crossing patterns.

METHODS: A retrospective study of DRPs and pharmacists interventions for neurology patients was performed during a non-consecutive 24-month study period. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics, and pharmacists intervention records were collected. The characteristics and severity ratings of DRPs were categorized using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) DRP classification tool V9.00 and the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP) classification respectively. RESULTS: A total of 242 DRPs were detected for 974 admitted patients, an average of 0.25 DRPs per patient. Treatment safety was the major type of DRPs (106;43.8%) followed by treatment effectiveness (78;32.2%). The primary causes of DRPs were drug selection (124;44.1%) and dose selection (92;32.7%). Clinical pharmacists provided 525 interventions, and most interventions occurred at the prescriber level (241;45.9%). A total of 91.4% of these interventions were accepted, contributing to solving 93.0% of the identified problems.

This evidence mapping was based on a total of 167 CAM patients with a mean age of 51  14.62 years, and 56.28% of them were male. Diabetes mellitus (73.65% (n = 123)), hypertension (22.75% (n = 38)), and renal failure (10.77% (n = 18)) were the most common co-morbidities among CAM patients. The most common symptoms observed in CAM patients were facial pain, ptosis, proptosis, visual acuity, and vision loss. Survival was higher in patients who underwent both medical and surgical management (64.96%). Overall mortality among CAM patients was found to be 38.32%. In conclusion, this study found a high incidence of CAM with a high mortality rate. Optimal glycemic control and early identification of mucormycosis should be the priority to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CAM.","output":"COVID-19-Associated Mucormycosis (CAM): An Updated Evidence Mapping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to limited data, we conducted a meta-analysis to re-evaluate the relationship between obesity and coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19).

Consequences in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes and mortality of congenital heart patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) is still to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To study the COVID-19 pandemic implications in Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes. METHODS: We conducted a national online survey covering all states that perform Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery from 10 November to 22 November, 2020, using a Google forms questionnaire. We formulated questions related to impact on surgical volume, case-mix, and mortality. Then we asked about short-term post-operative COVID-19 infection and outcomes. RESULTS: We received responses from 46 centres representing all states where there were a Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programme and all high-volume centres across the country. All but one centre experienced a significant decrease in surgical volume, and 23.9% of the responders revealed less than one-quarter of volume decrement. On the other hand, in over 70% of the centres, there was a significant surgical volume reduction. In addition to this, there was a shift in case-mix in 41 centres (89.1%) towards more complex cases. More than one-third of the responders revealed increased mortality in 2020 compared to previous years, and 43.5% of the programmes (20 centres) had at least one patient contaminated by SARS-Cov-2, accounting for 48 patients. Mortality in post-operative infected patients was 45.8% (22 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In general, Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes were severely affected by decreased surgical volume, unbalanced case-mix towards more complex cases, and increased mortality.

This resulted in an urgent need for doctors with competence in working with critically ill COVID-19 patients. A training course and a theoretical test for non-intensivist doctors were developed. The aims of this study were to gather validity evidence for the theoretical test and explore the effects of the course. METHODS: The 1-day course was comprised of theoretical sessions and hands-on training in ventilator use, hemodynamic monitoring, vascular access, and use of personal protective equipment. Validity evidence was gathered for the test by comparing answers from novices and experts in intensive care. Doctors who participated in the course completed the test before (pretest), after (posttest), and again within 8 weeks following the course (retention test). RESULTS: Fifty-four non-intensivist doctors from 15 different specialties with a wide range in clinical experience level completed the course. The test consisted of 23 questions and demonstrated a credible pass-fail standard at 16 points. Mean pretest score was 11.9 (SD 3.0), mean posttest score 20.6 (1.8), and mean retention test score 17.4 (2.2). All doctors passed the posttest. CONCLUSION: Non-intensivist doctors, irrespective of experience level, can acquire relevant knowledge for working in the ICU through a focused 1-day evidence-based course. This knowledge was largely retained as shown by a multiple-choice test supported by validity evidence.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research method and tools applied in the article are subordinated to the identification of the occurence of statistically significant differences between average values of numbers of applications filed with CEIDG in the assumption category on a month-to-month basis. As part of the research process post hoc tests, preceded by the one-way analysis of variance, ANOVA, were used. Due to the imperfection of statistical tests and the nature of deterministic methods for the verification of the research hypothesis the Kruskal-Wallis was also used. The ANOVA was preceded by the verification of meeting the distribution normality criterion (by means of the Kolmogorowv-Smirnov test and the Shapiro-Wilk test) and of the variance uniformity (the Levine test). Findings: A stable economic situation in a macroeconomic aspect together with an unchanging regulatory, economic and financial, technical and organisational as well as market environment translates to a statistical repeatability of market behaviours. In this context, a projection of the number of applications filed with CEIDG including seasonal fluctuations was developed. Practical Implications: The knowledge of seasonality in terms of undertaking economic activity may prove helpful in selecting the right economic policy tools, in organising entrepreneur administrative service processes as well as useful for companies providing outsourcing services (inter alia, within the scope of marketing, bookkeeping and human resources service or recapitalisation) for new businesses. Originality/Value: This type of analyses have not been conducted to date on such a wide and diversified time spectre.

We propose that people commonly respond to health threats by managing their emotions with cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, which can reduce fear and protect mental health. However, because fear can also motivate health behaviors, reducing fear may also jeopardize health behaviors. In two diverse U.S. samples (N = 1,241) tracked across 3 months, sequential and cross-lagged panel mediation models indicated that reappraisal predicted lower fear about an ongoing health threat (COVID-19) and, in turn, better mental health but fewer recommended physical health behaviors. This trade-off was not inevitable, however: The use of reappraisal to increase socially oriented positive emotions predicted better mental health without jeopardizing physical health behaviors.

Population aging and greater public awareness of dementia may contribute to an increasing prevalence of self-reported cognitive impairment. However, population-level trends in self-reported cognitive impairment among Latinos are unclear and it is unknown whether there are differences among Latino subgroups. Thus, this study aims to examine heterogeneity in self-reported cognitive impairment among older U.S. Latino subgroups. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the 1997C2018 National Health Interview Survey to document age-specific patterns in self-reported cognitive impairment among U.S.-born Mexican, foreign-born Mexican, island-born Puerto Rican, foreign-born Cuban, and U.S.-born non-Latino Whites aged 60 and older. We estimated hierarchical ageCperiodCcohort cross-classified random effects models (HAPC-CCREM) to isolate age patterns in self-reported cognitive impairment across disaggregated Latino subgroups and U.S.-born non-Latino Whites. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of self-reported cognitive impairment increased from 6.0% in 1997 to 7.1% in 2018. This increase was evident among U.S.-born non-Latino Whites and U.S.-born and foreign-born Mexicans but not other Latino subgroups. Fully adjusted HAPC-CCREM estimates indicated that Latinos were more likely to self-report cognitive impairment than U.S-born non-Latino Whites (b = 0.371, p < .001). When disaggregated by Latino subgroup, the difference in the likelihood for self-reported cognitive impairment compared to U.S.-born non-Latino Whites was greatest for island-born Puerto Ricans (b = 0.598, p < .001) and smallest for foreign-born Cubans (b = 0.131, p > .05). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We found evidence of considerable heterogeneity in the age patterns of self-reported cognitive impairment among U.S. Latino subgroups. We also detected large differences in the likelihood for self-reported cognitive impairment between U.S. Latino subgroups compared to U.S.-born non-Latino Whites. These results underscore the importance of differentiating between unique Latino subpopulations when studying population-level trends in cognitive function.","output":"Age Patterns in Self-Reported Cognitive Impairment Among Older Latino Subgroups and Non-Latino Whites in the United States, 1997C2018: Implications for Public Health Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is thought to play a role in determining the outcomes of COVID-19. India has a high prevalence of VDD. We hypothesized that VDD as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) &amp;lt;20 ng/mL is associated with severe COVID-19 infection. Outcomes were assessed by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI)1, the need for oxygen therapy, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and inflammatory markers. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was proven by RT-PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV2. Serum 25OHD and PTH were measured in addition to the standard protocol for COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed using SPSS v22.0. Patients with OSCI score &amp;lt;5 were classified as mild and 5 as severe disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. A total of 410 patients (127 females, 9 pediatric, 17 asymptomatic) were included with a median age of 54 years (6C92 years) with 272(66.3%) having at least one co-morbid condition, including diabetes (190, 46.3%) and hypertension (164,40%). Patients with VDD (197,48%) were significantly younger (46.717.1 vs. 57.814.7 years) and had lesser prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (39.1% vs 52.4%, 29.4% vs 49.5%). Proportion of severe cases (26,13.2% vs. 31,14.6%), mortality (4, 2% vs. 11, 5.2%), oxygen requirement (68,34.5% vs.92,43.4), ICU admission (29, 14.7% vs. 42, 19.8%), need for inotropes (7,3.6% vs.12,5.7%) was not significantly different between patients with VDD and those with normal 25OHD level. The proportion of severe cases was similar across all 25OHD categories. There was no significant correlation between 25OHD levels and outcome OSCI, inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer, ferritin, LDH). PTH levels positively correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010) and LDH (r0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with cholecalciferol with a median dose of 60000 IU. The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, baseline levels of 25OHD did not determine the severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 or levels of inflammatory markers.

When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process.

In April 2021, about 40% of U.S. public school students were not offered full-time in-person education. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. DESIGN: An agent-based network model was developed to simulate transmission in elementary and high school communities, including home, school, and interhousehold interactions. SETTING: School structure was parametrized to reflect average U.S. classrooms, with elementary schools of 638 students and high schools of 1451 students. Daily local incidence was varied from 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 persons. PARTICIPANTS: Students, faculty, staff, and adult household members. INTERVENTION: Isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individual's contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening. MEASUREMENTS: Transmission was projected among students, staff, and families after a single infection in school and over an 8-week quarter, contingent on local incidence. RESULTS: School transmission varies according to student age and local incidence and is substantially reduced with mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular testing because of the subclinical nature of most children's infections. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, and asymptomatic screening improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission. LIMITATION: Uncertainty exists about the susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and precision is low regarding the effectiveness of specific countermeasures, particularly with new variants. CONCLUSION: With controlled community transmission and moderate mitigation, elementary schools can open safety, but high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening can facilitate reopening at higher local incidence while minimizing transmission risk.

It is shown that using the appropriate choice of initial popularity values, the node degree distribution follows a power-law distribution with arbitrary parameter $\\\\alpha>2$, i.e. fraction of nodes with degree $d$ is proportional to $d^{-\\\\alpha}$. An active fingerprinting deanonymization attack strategy called the augmented information threshold attack strategy (A-ITS) is proposed which uses the attacker's knowledge of the node degree distribution along with the concept of information values for deanonymization.

These observed structural alterations lead to activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors which together contribute to oncogenesis. To date, few targeted therapies for osteosarcoma have been identified. It is likely that effectiveness of targeted therapies will vary greatly in subsets of tumors with distinct key driver events.

Real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) identified a significantly increased rate of generalized viral dissemination within the organism in vaccinated cases versus nonvaccinated cases (45% vs. 16%, respectively; P = 0.008). Vaccinated cases also showed high viral loads, reaching Ct values below 10, especially in the upper airways and lungs. This was accompanied by high rates of pulmonal bacterial or mycotic superinfections and the occurrence of immunocompromising factors such as malignancies, immunosuppressive drug intake, or decreased immunoglobulin levels. All these findings were particularly accentuated in partially vaccinated patients compared to fully vaccinated individuals.

In this study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated in serum samples obtained from 127 household ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) in the Province of Valencia (Spain). Two ferrets tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 (1.57%) by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike antigen. Furthermore, anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persisted at detectable levels in a seropositive SARS-CoV-2 domestic ferret beyond 129 days since the first-time antibodies were detected.

In this study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated in serum samples obtained from 127 household ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) in the Province of Valencia (Spain). Two ferrets tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 (1.57%) by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike antigen. Furthermore, anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persisted at detectable levels in a seropositive SARS-CoV-2 domestic ferret beyond 129 days since the first time antibodies were detected. This study reports for the first time the evidence of household pet ferrets exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Spain to date.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Household Domestic Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a parsimonious, yet effective, susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-type model that incorporates the time change in the transmission and death rates.

This situation could had amplified risk factors on the psychological wellbeing of mothers-to-be. Indeed, the last trimester of pregnancy is a period of increased vulnerability itself.Method: For better support women who experience pregnancy during social lockdown, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on psychic wellbeing of two samples of pregnant women (40 living in Lombardy and 35 in Tuscany).Results: T-test and correlations analyses revealed that women living in the Lombardy had a higher perception of the centrality of COVID-19. Further, women that considered the pandemic as a significant event, experienced a higher perinatal depressive symptom. Those symptoms also arose in women who presented a higher number of intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms and a lower ability to plan.Conclusion: Pregnant women should be closely monitored and supported, especially those who live in high-risk areas, such as Lombardy Region.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A double-blind, parallel group study was performed on 305 patients with URTI (nasal airflow resistance [NAR] of > 0.25 Pa cm3 s and a global pain score of at least moderate intensity). NAR and pain relief/intensity scores were measured over 4 h after initial dose. Patients then dosed up to three times daily for 3 days and recorded nasal congestion and pain intensity scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Nasal airflow conductance (NAC) and pain relief after the initial dose were primary objectives. NAC was calculated from NAR. Pain relief was measured on a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) and pain intensity and nasal congestion on a 4-point VRS. Data were analysed using analysis of covariance. Safety was assessed by adverse events. RESULTS A single dose of the combination was superior to paracetamol and placebo for NAC (p = 0.0001) and was superior to pseudoephedrine and placebo for pain relief (p < or = 0.048). Multiple doses of the combination were also superior to paracetamol and placebo for decongestion (p < or = 0.021) and were superior to pseudoephedrine and placebo for pain reduction (p < or = 0.0057). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS The combination treatment provided a greater decongestant effect than either paracetamol or placebo and better pain relief than either pseudoephedrine or placebo.

Virus infectivity is mediated by the binding of Spike transmembrane glycoprotein to specific protein receptors present on cell host surface. Spike is a homotrimer that emerges from the virion, each monomer containing two subunits named S1 and S2, which are related to cell recognition and membrane fusion, respectively. S1 is subdivided in domains S1A (or NTD) and S1B (or RBD), with experimental and in silico studies suggesting that the former binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, such as CD147, whereas the latter binds to ACE2 receptor. Recent findings indicate that the ABO blood system modulates susceptibility and progression of infection, with type-A individuals being more susceptible to infection and/or manifestation of a severe condition. Seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this susceptibility, we carried out an extensive bibliographic survey on the subject. Based on this survey, we hypothesize that the correlation between the ABO blood system and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be presumably explained by the modulation of sialic acid-containing receptors distribution on host cell surface induced by ABO antigens through carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, which could maximize or minimize the virus Spike protein binding to the host cell. This model could explain previous sparse observations on the molecular mechanism of infection and can direct future research to better understand of COVID-19 pathophysiology.","output":"The influence of ABO blood groups on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: a molecular hypothesis based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ugandan healthcare system was already under severe strain due to a lack of human resources, poor working conditions, and poor management. At the center of these challenges are nurses, the backbone of the health system. This study investigated post-traumatic stress disorder and associated predictive factors during the second wave of COVID-19 among frontline nurses in the country. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted among 601 nurses between May and June 2021. Post-traumatic stress disorder was assessed using PTSD Checklist-Civilian. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the factors predicting PTSD. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant at 95% CI. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 65.7%. In the multivariate logistic regression, the predictive factors of PTSD among the study participants were social support (AOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 034C0.60; p  0.001), fear of getting infected with COVID-19 (AOR: 3.10; 95% CI: 2.17C4.43; p < 0.001) and increased workload (AOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.16C2.34; p < 0.001).

As a result, current information is mainly based on reports and case series. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the psychopathological characteristics and the grouping of the symptoms of the Cotard's syndrome cases reported in the medical literature. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of all reported cases of Cotard's syndrome from 2005 to January 2018 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics of each case were collected. An exploratory factor analysis of the symptoms was performed. RESULTS: The search identified 86 articles, of which 69 were potentially relevant. After reviewing the full texts, 55 articles were selected for the systematic review, in which we found 69 cases. We found that the diagnosis of major depression (P<0.001) and organic mental disorder (P=0.004) were more frequent in the older group with Cotard's syndrome. An exploratory factor analysis extracted 3 factors: psychotic depression, in which it includes patients with delusions of guilt (0.721), suicidal ideas (0.685), delusions of damnation (0.662), nihilistic delusions of the body (0.642), depression (0.522), and hypochondriacal delusions (0.535); delusive-hallucinatory, with patients who presented delusions of immortality (0.566), visual hallucinations (0.545) and nihilistic delusions of existence (0.451), and mixed, with patients who presented nihilistic delusions of concepts (0.702), anxiety (0.573), and auditory hallucinations (0.560).

Materials and Methods This retrospective study from March 10, 2020, to April 6, 2020, involved three institutions, two in a region considered a hot spot (area of high prevalence) for COVID-19. Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency department (ED) with primary nonrespiratory (gastrointestinal or neurologic) symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 at non-chest CT but not concurrent chest CT, and underwent COVID-19 testing in the ED. Group 1 patients had reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results obtained before CT scan reading (COVID-19 suspected on presentation); group 2 had RT-PCR results obtained after CT scans were read (COVID-19 not suspected). Presentation and imaging findings were compared, and outcomes were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results Group 1 comprised 62 patients (31 men, 31 women; mean age, 67 years 17 [standard deviation]), and group 2 comprised 57 patients (28 men, 29 women; mean age, 63 years  16).

Country documents were selected based on convenience sampling and were analyzed in deliberative dialogues. RESULTS. 173 documents from the three countries were reviewed. There was convergence around: prioritization of prevention of community transmission of the virus over promotion of the exercise of children's rights; lack of participation of children and adolescents in the process of developing public policies; and lack of progress in the recognition and protection of the exercise of childrens rights overall. There were no major divergences beyond identified inequality gaps grounded in the reality of each country. CONCLUSION. The pandemic has affected the functioning of the economic, social, health, education, environmental, and governance systems in these three countries.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between HLA system and children with SSNSWR and SDNS/FRNS and clarified the value of HLA allele detection for precise typing of childhood SSNS. METHODS: A total of 241 Chinese Han individuals with SSNS were genotyped using GenCap-WES Capture Kit, and four-digit resolution HLA alleles were imputed from available Genome Wide Association data. The distribution and carrying frequency of HLA alleles in SSNSWR and SDNS/FRNS were investigated. Additionally, logistic regression and mediating effects were used to examine the relationship between risk factors for disease process and HLA system. RESULTS: Compared with SSNSWR, significantly decreased serum levels of complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4) at onset were detected in SDNS/FRNS (C3, P < 0.001; C4, P = 0.018). The average time to remission after sufficient initial steroid treatment in SDNS/FRNS was significantly longer than that in SSNSWR (P = 0.0001). Low level of C4 was further identified as an independent risk factor for SDNS/FRNS (P = 0.008, odds ratio = 0.174, 95% confidence interval 0.048C0.630). The HLA-A*11:01 allele was independently associated with SSNSWR and SDNS/FRNS (P = 0.0012 and P = 0.0006, respectively). No significant HLA alleles were detected between SSNSWR and SDNS/FRNS.

Here, we provide some suggestions for early identification of COVID-19 and differential diagnosis in patients with lung cancer who have fever and respiratory symptoms. Our medical team also provide clinical recommendations on lung cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic, for carrying out meticulous and individualized clinical management of lung cancer patients and maximum protection to effectively prevent COVID-19.

Since it is a new pandemic, research is sparse in the domain of employees psychological wellbeing in relation to the phenomenon. Drawing on social support and job demand-resource perspectives, this research adds to the factors affecting employees wellbeing due to the coronavirus outbreak. Specifically, this study is an investigation of co-workers instrumental support in predicting employees emotional exhaustion via employees perceived uncertainties experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we tested for the contextual specificity of family support on uncertainties and its link with employees emotional exhaustion. With data drawn from two universities (n = 275), the findings reveal a negative association between co-worker task support and an employees emotional exhaustion, and an employees perceived uncertainties mediate this relationship. Moreover, the moderating analysis exhibits that family support mitigates the negative effect of uncertainty perception on emotional exhaustion. Our study reveals that coworker and family support are extremely important during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are equally valuable for organizations and society to mitigate the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees wellbeing.","output":"Social support and perceived uncertainties during COVID-19: Consequences for employees wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated to be a global threat to public health. Analysis of the use of radiology resources may render us insight regarding the public health behavior during pandemic. We measured the influence COVID-19 had on the use of radiology resources in terms of the number of examinations performed, and turnaround time for portable radiography. METHODS: This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital located in area where the prevalence of COVID-19 infection was low (0.01%). We compared the number of radiology examinations 1) before pandemic (in 2019) vs. during peak of pandemic (January to March 2020), and 2) before pandemic vs. after the peak of pandemic (April to June 2020) via t-tests. We repeated similar analyses for subgroups as follows: gender, age, department (outpatient, inpatient, emergency, screening), body parts, and modality. We also performed a survey of radiologic technologists regarding the turnaround time and rate-limiting step of portable radiography for patients with and without suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19. RESULTS: Although not statistically significant, the daily number of examinations during the peak of pandemic decreased by 9 percentage points (2,638 vs. 2,413; difference [95% CI], -225 [-489, 38]; P = 0.094). The percentage change was especially notable for children, emergency, and screening department (25, 19, and 44 percentage points, respectively). After the peak of the pandemic, the number of examinations increased back to near the pre-pandemic level (2,638 vs. 2,588; -50 [-317, 218]; P = 0.71). The turnaround time for portable radiography tended to be longer for patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19, with donning personal protective equipment being the major rate-limiting step. CONCLUSION: The number of examinations decreased during the pandemic, reflecting the tendency of the public to refrain from seeking medical care even in a community of low infection risk. Nevertheless, burden of healthcare providers may not have decreased as much, considering longer turnaround time required for COVID-19 related examinations.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Use of Radiology Resources in a Tertiary Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly utilized in the medical device industry as it can address unmet demands in clinical sites and provide more patient treatment options.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of breastfeeding on children's health and its relationship to NRAMP1 expression. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 124 toddlers in October 2020CJune 2021. Toddlers were selected purposively from three Community Health Centers in Central Jakarta. The first group (n = 62) was exclusive breastfeeding and the second group (n = 62) was not exclusive breastfeeding. The characteristics of mothers and toddlers were collected using a structured questionnaire supported by medical record data. Meanwhile, NRAMP1 expression and NRAMP1 protein levels were obtained from the examination of blood samples. Examination of NRAMP1 gene mRNA expression by real-time PCR method and serum NRAMP1 protein levels by ELISA method. Data were analyzed using t-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression. The results obtained that the average mRNA expression of NRAMP1 gene and protein levels of NRAMP1 in infants who were not exclusive breastfeeding were 6.88 fold change (FC) and 315.02 pg/ml compared to those who received exclusive breastfeeding of 11.36 FC and 1087.74 pg./ml.

As such, we aimed to assess the effect on STEMI admissions and outcomes in Portuguese centers. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, observational, retrospective study including all patients admitted to our hospital due to STEMI between the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 case diagnosed in Portugal and the end of the state of emergency (March and April 2020). Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A total of 104 STEMI patients were assessed, 55 in 2019 and 49 in 2020 (-11%). There were no significant differences between groups regarding age (6212 vs. 6514 years, p=0.308), gender (84.8% vs. 77.6% males, p=0.295) or comorbidities. In the 2020 group, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients transported to the hospital in pre-hospital emergency medical transportation (38.2% vs. 20.4%, p=0.038), an increase in system delay (49 [30-110.25] vs. 140 [90-180] minutes, p=0.019), a higher Killip-Kimball class, with a decrease in class I (74.5% vs. 51%) and an increase in class III (1.8% vs. 8.2%) and IV (5.5% vs. 18.4%) (p=0.038), a greater incidence of vasoactive support (3.7% vs. 26.5%, p=0.001), invasive mechanic ventilation usage (3.6% vs. 14.3%, p=0.056), and an increase in severe left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p=0.03). In-hospital mortality was 14.3% in the 2020 group and 7.3% in the 2019 group p=0.200). CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of significant variation in the absolute number of STEMI admissions, there was an increase in STEMI clinical severity and significantly worse outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An increase in system delay, impaired pre-hospital care and patient fear of in-hospital infection can partially justify these results and should be the target of future actions in further waves of the pandemic.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on ST-elevation myocardial infarction admissions and outcomes in a Portuguese primary percutaneous coronary intervention center: Preliminary Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The varied spectrum of presentation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is intriguing. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection. A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). With only very limited cases reported from the west, MIS-A is considered a rare and serious complication of COVID-19. However, it is not as uncommon as we think. Many cases go undiagnosed for lack of COVID -19 like symptoms and unawareness among treating clinicians about this newer clinical entity. Further, antibody testing and inflammatory markers are not easily available in many of the Indian hospitals especially in rural India where the second wave had been intense, thereby making it difficult for the diagnosis of MIS-A. Also, there is no clear treatment guideline for MIS-A unlike MIS-C where the treatment protocol is well laid out. Awareness about MIS-A among treating clinicians can thus help in further evaluation and increased identification of the syndrome at the early stages thereby helping in the early institution of treatment. Our tertiary COVID care hospital in South India which has handled about 5200 cases of COVID-19 is been able to identify 04 cases of MIS-A proving that this clinical entity is not as rare as it is thought but lacks reporting and prompt identification. Here we describe 04 cases of MIS-A and strive to bring in the various aspects of it, including the clinical presentation, laboratory markers, diagnostic criteria and treatment considerations in this post second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. ? 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

Strategies for the efficient management of this parasitic infection include adequate treatment with anti-malarial therapeutics and vaccination. However, the emergence and spread of resistant strains of malaria parasites to the majority of presently used anti-malarial medications, on the other hand, complicates malaria treatment. Other shortcomings of anti-malarial drugs include poor aqueous solubility, low permeability, poor bioavailability, and non-specific targeting of intracellular parasites, resulting in high dose requirements and toxic side effects. To address these limitations, liposome-based nanotechnology has been extensively explored as a new solution in malaria management. Liposome technology improves anti-malarial drug encapsulation, bioavailability, target delivery, and controlled release, resulting in increased effectiveness, reduced resistance progression, and fewer adverse effects. Furthermore, liposomes are exploited as immunological adjuvants and antigen carriers to boost the preventive effectiveness of malaria vaccine candidates. The present review discusses the findings from studies conducted over the last 40 years (1980C2020) using in vitro and in vivo settings to assess the prophylactic and curative anti-malarial potential of liposomes containing anti-malarial agents or antigens.

Methods: An immunogenicity evaluation was carried out among health care workers (HCW) vaccinated at the Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri (IFO). All HCW were asked to be vaccine by the national vaccine campaign at the beginning of 2021. Serum samples were collected on day 1 just prior to the first dose of the vaccine and on day 21 just prior to the second vaccination dose. Thereafter sera samples were collected 28, 49, 84 and 168 days after the first dose of BNT162b2. Quantitative measurement of IgG antibodies against S1/S2 antigens of SARS-CoV-2 was performed with a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay. Results: Two hundred seventy-four HWCs were analyzed, 175 women (63.9%) and 99 men (36.1%). The maximum antibody geometric mean concentration (AbGMC) was reached at T2 (299.89 AU/mL; 95% CI: 263.53C339.52) with a significant increase compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Thereafter, a progressive decrease was observed. At T5, a median decrease of 59.6% in COVID-19 negative, and of 67.8% in COVID-19 positive individuals were identified with respect to the highest antibody response. At T1, age and previous COVID-19 were associated with differences in antibody response, while at T2 and T3 differences in immune response were associated with age, gender and previous COVID-19. At T4 and T5, only COVID-19 positive participants demonstrated a greater antibody response, whereas no other variables seemed to influence antibody levels. Conclusions: Overall our study clearly shows antibody persistence at 6 months, albeit with a certain decline.

The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14++monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1+monocytes in the ERS. CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the na?ve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1 and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.

Aerial video footage of all three landslides obtained by local people using drones, and ground-based footage of one of them in progress, allowed a detailed examination of their characteristics and contexts to be made despite the global travel and activity restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The windfarm bogflow appears to have resulted from removal of toe support by an earlier peat flow that was itself probably caused by construction of an access road; the other two landslides were most likely triggered by rainfall. All three are consistent with previous examples of their respective types in their general characteristics and appear to be associated with well-known causal factors including hydrological, topographic and/or forestry influences.

Data collected from electronic patient notes and Somerset Cancer MDT electronic database included: 1) patient demographics and co-morbidities;2) Pathway parameters - duration of symptoms prior to presentation, 2WW timeframes, interval between referral and endoscopy, performance status, elective vs emergency presentation, and 3) Tumour parameters - cancer site, TNM staging. 90-day mortality, where available was also recorded.Results163 patients were included C 82 patients in pre-COVID (2019) and 81 in peri-COVID (2020) cohorts. In the pre-COVID group, 25 were oesophageal cancers, 8 gastric, 21 pancreatic, and 26 liver cancers. In the peri-COVID group, 31 were oesophageal cancers, 13 gastric, 17 pancreatic, and 18 liver cancers.

Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is provided by regional OOH services. Changes in consultation rates at OOH services may be regarded as a warning system for failures elsewhere in the healthcare system. Therefore in this study, we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the use of primary care OOH services during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: Routine electronic health records data were used from 60% of OOH services in the Netherlands, collected by the Nivel Primary Care Database. We compared consultation rates per week (2020) for COVID-19-like symptoms and other health problems (e.g. small traumas, urinary tract infections), for different age groups, the proportion of remote consultations, and different levels of urgency during the pandemic compared to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The number of consultations for COVID-19-like symptoms peaked at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, while consultations for other health problems decreased. These changes in consultation rates differed between age groups. Remote consultations took place more frequently for all health problems, while the proportion of non-urgent health problems increased. CONCLUSION: There were significant changes in the number of consultations and the proportion that were remote for COVID-19-like symptoms and other health problems. Especially care for babies and young children decreased, while the number of consultations for older adults remained stable. The continued use of OOH services by older adults suggests there were unmet care needs elsewhere in our healthcare system.

Standard Affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level, i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene, and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression. The increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants clearly brings up the necessity of updating this gene-level annotation to a refined transcript-level. RESULTS: Through performing rigorous alignments of the Affymetrix probe sequences against a comprehensive pool of currently available transcript sequences, and further linking the probesets to the International Protein Index, we generated transcript-level or protein-level annotation tables for two popular Affymetrix expression arrays, Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array and Human Genome U133A Array. Application of our new annotations in re-examining existing expression data sets shows increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and strengthened expression correlation between interacting proteins. CONCLUSION: By refining the standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level, one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data, which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism.","output":"Transcript-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets improves the interpretation of gene expression data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Date seeds are a major waste product that can be utilised as a valuable and nutritional material in the food industry.

Two types of flour were used (white flour and whole wheat) at two different baking temperatures: 180 and 200 C. The incorporation of date seed had no or slight effect on moisture, ash, fat and protein content of the baked cookies. On the other hand, incorporation significantly affected the lightness and hardness of cookies; the higher level of addition, the darker and crispier the resulting cookies. The sensory analysis indicated that the produced cookies were acceptable in terms of smell, taste, texture and overall acceptability. The results indicate that the most acceptable cookies across all evaluated parameters were produced using whole wheat flour with 7.5% levels of date seed powder using Khalas and Zahidi varieties.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how mental health practitioners have changed their practices during the pandemic. The authors hypothesize that mental health practitioners would increase tele-mental health services and that certain provider types would be better able to adapt to tele-mental health than others. METHODS: The study surveyed 903 practitioners, primarily psychologists/doctoral-level (Psych/DL) providers, social workers/master's-level (SW/ML) providers, and neuropsychologists employed in academic medical centers or private practices. Differences among providers were examined using Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and one-way Bonferroni-adjusted analyses of covariance. RESULTS: The majority of the 903 mental health practitioners surveyed rapidly adjusted their practices, predominantly by shifting to tele-mental health appointments (n=729, 80.82%). Whereas 80.44% (n=625) were not using tele-mental health in December 2019, only 22.07% (n=188) were not by late March or early April 2020. Only 2.11% (n=19) reported no COVID-19-related practice adjustments. Two-thirds (596/888, 67.10%) reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns. Neuropsychologists were less likely and Psych/DL providers and SW/ML providers were more likely than expected to transition to tele-mental health (P<.001). Trainees saw fewer patients (P=.01) and worked remotely more than licensed practitioners (P=.03). Despite lower rates of information technology service access (P<.001), private practice providers reported less difficulty implementing tele-mental health than providers in other settings (P<.001). Overall, the majority (530/889, 59.62%) were interested in continuing to provide tele-mental health services in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of mental health providers in this study made practice adjustments in response to COVID-19, predominantly by rapidly transitioning to tele-mental health services. Although the majority reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns, only a small subset endorsed offering such services to medical providers. This has implications for future practical directions, as frontline workers may begin to seek mental health treatment related to the pandemic. Despite differences in tele-mental health uptake based on provider characteristics, the majority were interested in continuing to provide such services in the future. This may help to expand clinical services to those in need via tele-mental health beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mental Health Practitioners' Immediate Practical Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients who died from COVID-19 often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease.

Methods A multi-centered facility based study was conducted among 1440 participants aged 40+ years attending chronic outpatient medical care. Two complimentary methods (interview and review of medical records) were employed to collect the data on socio-demographic, behavioral and disease related characteristics. The data were analyzed by STATA V.16 and R Software V.4.1.0. We run descriptive statistics and fitted logistic regression and latent class analyses (LCA) models to determine associated factors and patterns of multimorbidity. Statistical significance was considered at p-value ,<=0.05. Results The magnitude of individual chronic conditions ranged from 1.4% to 37.9%, and multimorbidity was identified in 54.8% (95% CI=52.2%-57.4%) of the sample. The likelihood of developing multimorbidity was higher among participants aged from 45-54 years (AOR: 1.5, 95%CI= 1.1, 2.1), 55-64 years (AOR: 2.5, 95%CI=1.7, 3.5) and 65 years or more (AOR: 2.4, 95%CI=1.7, 3.5), among individuals classified as overweight (AOR: 1.6, 95%CI=1.2, 2.1) or obese (AOR: 1.9, 95%CI=1.3, 3.0) and among those individuals who believe in external locus of control (AOR: 1.8, 95%CI=1.3, 2.5).

When R0>1, the disease spread will potentially lead to an outbreak, such that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. During the evolution of an outbreak, various non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact of which is frequently assessed by the reduction that they introduce to the effective reproduction number Rt; reduction below 1 is an indication of eventual dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0 essentially expresses the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, in this work, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that during the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various interventions were in place, Rt had a clear relation with the explosive timescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is shown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of the epidemics implies Rt>1, while its absence implies Rt<1. In addition, as this timescale converges/diverges with the immediately slowest one, Rt approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that timescale analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various interventions, since it reflects the insight provided by the effective reproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population model, nor the parameter estimation process followed for model calibration.","output":"On the relation of the COVID-19 reproduction number to the explosive timescales: the case of Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emergence of COVID-19 has led to increased attention to mathematical models of epidemiology, one of the main parameters of which is the basic reproductive number R-0.

Aim: Develop a methodology for determining the R-0 value for COVID-19, taking into account a reasonably rapid and significant change in its value over time. Methods: a method for calculating reproduction number R-0 was proposed for assessing COVID-19 R-0, taking into account the change in the contagiousness of the infected people during the infectious process. Results and Discussion: In Russia in June-August 2020, the reproduction rate was slightly less 1, but in September R-0 began to grow, exceeded 1, which was caused a noticeable increase in the incidence. During June in Brazil, R-0 stabilized at a value of 1. The activity of transmission of the pathogen is influenced by seasonal changes in the reproduction rate R-0 and the level of community immune status. Based on the assessment of the dynamics of the incidence of other pneumonia, it was found that the change of R-0 during the year is about 10%, with a minimum in summer. Conclusions: while maintaining the current activity of anti-epidemic measures due to seasonal factors of the activity of the transmission mechanism and accumulation of the immune individuals in the coming months, the situation in the Russian Federation will worsen with an increase in the incidence doubled within six months, and in Brazil in six months - improve with a decrease in the incidence ten times.

OBJECTIVES to describe the time trend of the mortality in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic accounting for age, gender, and geographical areas. DESIGN analysis of mortality trend, by region, age, and gender. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the Italian mortality data, released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), have been considered for the analyses. The data refer to the first four months of 2015-2019 and 2020, involving 7,270 municipalities, corresponding to 93% of the Italian population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the mortality rates in the first four months of 2015-2019 and 2020, age-adjusted, have been calculated together with the percent variation. The data were analysed by gender, age class (<65; >=65 years), Region, and geographical areas (Northern versus Central-Southern Italy). The overall daily mortality series have been represented as rates over 100,000 resident population. RESULTS in addition to the geographical location, the age component was a major determinant of the mortality pattern. The greater increase in the overall mortality was evidenced among elderly subjects in the Northern Italian Regions most affected by the epidemic. In these areas, also gender component played an important role in determining the mortality excess: higher mortality rates in the first four months of 2020 are observed for males in comparison to female populations. CONCLUSIONS this research reveals that the population components are an important issue in determining the COVID-19 mortality excess. For this reason, it is of primary importance to monitor mortality (overall and by COVID-19) by age and gender and to consider these components and the related factors (comorbidity, exposures affecting the lung) in the public prevention policies towards the protection of the most fragile population groups.","output":"[Gender and age factors affecting the mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of metabolic deregulation in myeloid malignancies has led to the investigation of metabolic-targeted therapies considering that cells undergoing leukemic transformation have excessive energy demands for growth and proliferation. However, the most difficult challenge in agents targeting metabolism is to determine a window of therapeutic opportunities between normal and neoplastic cells, considering that all or most of the metabolic pathways important for cancer ontogeny may also regulate physiological cell functions. Targeted therapies have used the properties of leukemic cells to produce altered metabolic products when mutated.

METHODS: Observational multicenter study. We recorded sociodemographic factors (age, sex), smoking status, date of symptom onset, biological data, need for supplemental oxygen, comorbidities, cognitive and functional status, in-hospital mortality. We calculated a Frailty Index (FI) as the ratio between deficits presented and total deficits considered for each patient (theoretical range 0-1). We also assessed the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Mortality at follow-up was ascertained from a regional registry. RESULTS: In total, 1344 patients were included; median age 68 years (Q1-Q3, 56-79); 857 (64%) were men. Median CFS score was 3 (Q1-Q3 2-5) and was lower in younger vs older patients. Median FI was 0.06 (Q1-Q3 0.03-0.09) and increased with increasing age. Overall, 244 (18%) patients died in-hospital and 288 (22%) over a median follow-up of 253 days. FI and CFS were significantly associated with risk of death.

The main objective of this study was to gain a better insight into the main management characteristics of the actors in the sector. It was assumed that more efficient management of financial investments (acquisitions, loans) caused higher risk financial investment decisions in the pharmaceutical industry in order to place companies in a better position in view of equity investors, illustrated best as the profitability of equity (ROE). This paper examined one possible means of covering the extremely high indirect costs (R&D, marketing) of pharmaceutical companies, also justified by the restructuring of the industry and the effect of investments in long term financial instruments on the ROE of the same business entities. Built on the EMIS database, the analysis only used the indicators of those companies operating in the pharmaceutical industry in Visegrad countries for 2019. The authors sought to draw conclusions about possible management characteristics of the entire pharmaceutical sector of these countries using cluster analysis and linear regression. The initial assumption, or main hypothesis of the study, was that in one of the countries studied or for those businesses operating above a certain revenue category, the impact of a companys risk-taking (which can also be expressed in terms of asset-based financial income) on profitability, may appear or intensify. The performed studies did not show a strong correlation between the explanatory and profit variables either at the national level or at the level of groups formed by regional market position. In other words, the extremely high level of indirect costs were mostly covered by sales of successful cash products, and companies not indebted to suppliers undertook significant risks in the field of financial investments, thereby offsetting the positive impact of the latter on earnings.","output":"The Effect of Financial Risk Taking on Profitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes a case of 45 years old male patient who tested positive for COVID-19 presented to the emergency department on March 2021 complaining of fever, cough, runny nose, and shortness of breath.

The identification of Kcr sites is critical to better understanding their functional mechanisms. However, the existing experimental techniques for detecting Kcr sites are cost-ineffective, to a great need for new computational methods to address this problem. We here describe Adapt-Kcr, an advanced deep learning model that utilizes adaptive embedding and is based on a convolutional neural network together with a bidirectional long short-term memory network and attention architecture. On the independent testing set, Adapt-Kcr outperformed the current state-of-the-art Kcr prediction model, with an improvement of 3.2% in accuracy and 1.9% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Compared to other Kcr models, Adapt-Kcr additionally had a more robust ability to distinguish between crotonylation and other lysine modifications. Another model (Adapt-ST) was trained to predict phosphorylation sites in SARS-CoV-2, and outperformed the equivalent state-of-the-art phosphorylation site prediction model. These results indicate that self-adaptive embedding features perform better than handcrafted features in capturing discriminative information; when used in attention architecture, this could be an effective way of identifying protein Kcr sites. Together, our Adapt framework (including learning embedding features and attention architecture) has a strong potential for prediction of other protein posttranslational modification sites.","output":"Adapt-Kcr: a novel deep learning framework for accurate prediction of lysine crotonylation sites based on learning embedding features and attention architecture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Utilization of basic public health services (BPHS) allows for disease prevention and management and is an essential component for protecting health. Disparities in utilization exist between rural-to-urban migrants and their local counterparts in China. This study sought to determine the frequency of BPHS utilization and whether social support, discrimination, and sociodemographic features were risk factors for low BPHS utilization by Chinese female migrants. METHODS: Data were derived from a survey of female rural-to-urban migrants at nine work sites in Changsha, China. The association between social support, discrimination, sociodemographic factors and BPHS utilization was obtained using Chi-square and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Between December 2017 and April 2018, 307 female participants completed the survey. A total of 24.7% reported having had health education, 26.1% had breast and cervical cancer screening, 27.2% had established a health care record, and 40.9% had received basic contraceptive services. Two factors were associated with the reduced likelihood of BPHS utilization: Length of migration and health record establishment (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.31, 0.92) and years of education and basic contraceptive service use (OR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.67). The remaining six factors were associated with an increased likelihood of BPHS utilization: Living circumstances and health record establishment (OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.17, 3.80), health education (OR = 2.71; 95% CI = 1.51, 4.87) and cancer screening (OR = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.30, 4.36). Utilization of social support was associated with health record establishment (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.44), basic contraceptive service use (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.42) and cancer screening (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.10, 1.51). Objective social support was associated with health education utilization (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.26), while subjective social support was associated with basic contraceptive service use (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.18) and cancer screening (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.17). Family location was associated with basic contraceptive service use (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.12, 3.44) and migration time in Changsha was associated with basic contraceptive service use (OR = 2.24; 95% CI = 1.18, 4.27). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was low utilization rate for four BPHS by Chinese female migrants, and social support appears to be an important factor in this setting. Government, community, and workplace education efforts for enhancing BPHS utilization among female rural-to-urban migrants are recommended.","output":"Frequency of basic public health services utilization by married female migrants in China: associations of social support, discrimination and sociodemographic factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sedation is an important consideration in the care of the neurocritically ill patient. It provides anxiety and relief, facilitates procedures and nursing tasks, and minimizes intolerance of mechanical ventilation. Alpha-2 agonists such as dexmedetomidine and clonidine have been shown to be an effective alternative in the general critical care population by reducing duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), as compared to traditional sedative agents such as propofol or benzodiazepines. However, there is a paucity of literature detailing their utility and safety in neurocritical care, a population that presents unique considerations for management of global and cerebral hemodynamics, agitation, and facilitation of neurological assessments. The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of alpha-2 agonists for non-procedural sedation in mechanically ventilated brain-injured patients. METHODS We will search the Embase and MEDLINE databases for all randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies examining neurocritically ill adult patients aged 18 years and older who are on mechanical ventilation and receiving alpha-2 agonists for non-procedural sedation. Primary outcomes of interest include effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Secondary outcomes include adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation, 30-day mortality, ICU length of stay, incidence of delirium, and quality of sedation. Continuous outcomes will be presented as means and mean differences and discrete counting events will be presented as event rates. Pre-defined criteria for heterogeneity are provided for determination of pooling eligibility. Where appropriate, we will pool estimates for individual outcomes. Planned subgroup analyses include specific alpha-2 agonist agent, study design, clinical diagnosis, dosing regimen, and use of adjunctive agents. Quality of evidence for the recommendation will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach where appropriate. DISCUSSION This systematic review will summarize the evidence on the efficacy and safety for the use of alpha-2 agonists as sedative agents in the neurocritical care population.

METHODS: 1917 corneae (1000 patients) were allocated to decades of age, classified according to Belin's ABCD KC grading system and the stage distribution was analysed. RESULTS: 73 per cent (n=728) of the patients were males, 27% (n=272) were females. The highest KC prevalence occurred between 21 and 30 years (n=585 corneae, 294 patients). Regarding anterior (A) and posterior (B) curvature, the frequency of A was significantly higher than B in all age groups for stage 0, 1 and 2 (A0>B0; A1>B1; A2>B2; p<0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). There was no significant difference between the number of A3 and B3, but significantly more corneae were classified as B4 than A4 in all age groups (p<0.02). The most frequent A|B combinations were A4|B4 (n=451), A0|B0 (n=311), A2|B4 (n=242), A2|B2 (n=189) and A1|B2 (n=154). Concerning thinnest pachymetry (C), most corneae in all age groups were classified as C0>C1>C2>C3>C4 (p<0.04, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). For the best distance visual acuity (D), a significantly higher number of corneae were classified as D1 compared to D0 (p<0.008; D1>D0>D2>D3>D4). CONCLUSION: The stage distributions in all age groups were similar. Early KC rather becomes manifest in the posterior than the anterior corneal curvature whereas advanced stages of posterior corneal curvature coincide with early and advanced stages of anterior corneal curvature. Thus, this study emphasises the necessity of posterior corneal surface assessment in KC as enabled by the ABCD grading system.","output":"Keratoconus staging by decades: a baseline ABCD classification of 1000 patients in the Homburg Keratoconus Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The causes of arterial embolism are acute myocardial infarction, heart aneurysms, valvular defects accompanied by cardiac arrhyth-mias.

Also, it is not well studied that whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause COVID-19 laden cough droplets to transport farther in the air, and make the current social distancing practice ineffective. In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out to analyze the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of COVID laden droplets emitted by coughs, with the different environmental conditions, cough velocities and Relative Humidity using the developed bus model of size 12 m x 3.5 m x 3.2 m. Different conditions of sneezing and coughing from the humans i.e., the laminar and the turbulent flows of the laden droplets in the air inside the bus were also examined. The distance between the two virtual humans is set as 6 m for a 12 m bus length in order to track the distance covered by cough particles. The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. It is found that due to the ambient air and humidity, the generation of secondary laden droplets occur which travels far and accumulates on the ground or any other third human being around and causes a strong potential risk to their health. The secondary droplets are transforming into large droplets due to high humidity and the hygroscopic effect is evaluated. The 6 feet social distancing is found to be ineffective for halting the spread of viruses among human beings because the micro-laden droplets caused during the sneezing and coughing are influenced by the convection effects and transport from one body to another within 5 s.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of practicing Tiny Habits(?) on self-reported gratitude, as measured by the 6-Item Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6). In January 2021, 154 adult participants with GQ-6 <35/42 were randomized to one of 3 groups: Tiny Habits for Gratitude (n = 50), Tiny Habits Control (n = 52), and Inactive Control (n = 52).

Identifying potential drug leads that bind to SOD1 and characterizing their interactions by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is complicated by the fact that SOD1 is a homodimer. Creating a monomeric version of SOD1 could alleviate these issues. A specially designed monomeric form of human superoxide dismutase (T2M4SOD1) was cloned into E. coli and its expression significantly enhanced using a number of novel DNA sequence, leader peptide and growth condition optimizations. Uniformly (15)N-labeled T2M4SOD1 was prepared from minimal media using (15)NH(4)Cl as the (15)N source. The T2M4SOD1 monomer (both (15)N labeled and unlabeled) was correctly folded as confirmed by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy and active as confirmed by an in-gel enzymatic assay. To demonstrate the utility of this new SOD1 expression system for NMR-based drug screening, eight pyrimidine compounds were tested for binding to T2M4SOD1 by monitoring changes in their (1)H NMR and/or (19)F-NMR spectra. Weak binding to 5-fluorouridine (FUrd) was observed via line broadening, but very minimal spectral changes were seen with uridine, 5-bromouridine or trifluridine. On the other hand, (1)H-NMR spectra of T2M4SOD1 with uracil or three halogenated derivatives of uracil changed dramatically suggesting that the pyrimidine moiety is the crucial binding component of FUrd. Interestingly, no change in tryptophan 32 (Trp32), the putative receptor for FUrd, was detected in the (15)N-NMR spectra of (15)N-T2M4SOD1 when mixed with these uracil analogs. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) studies indicate that interaction with Trp32 of SOD1 is predicted to be weak and that there was hydrogen bonding with the nearby aspartate (Asp96), potentiating the Trp32-uracil interaction. These studies demonstrate that monomeric T2M4SOD1 can be readily used to explore small molecule interactions via NMR.","output":"Cloning and high-level expression of monomeric human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and its interaction with pyrimidine analogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Periodontal disease (PD) comprises a group of diseases involving inflammatory aspects of the host and dysbiotic events that affect periodontal tissues and could have systemic implications.

METHOD: Data were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions. RESULTS: Relative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Current smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities. IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.","output":"Negative vaccine attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 in relation to smoking status: a population survey of UK adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite contributing to healthy diets for billions of people, aquatic foods are often undervalued as a nutritional solution because their diversity is often reduced to the protein and energy value of a single food type ('seafood' or 'fish')1-4. Here we create a cohesive model that unites terrestrial foods with nearly 3,000 taxa of aquatic foods to understand the future impact of aquatic foods on human nutrition. We project two plausible futures to 2030: a baseline scenario with moderate growth in aquatic animal-source food (AASF) production, and a high-production scenario with a 15-million-tonne increased supply of AASFs over the business-as-usual scenario in 2030, driven largely by investment and innovation in aquaculture production. By comparing changes in AASF consumption between the scenarios, we elucidate geographic and demographic vulnerabilities and estimate health impacts from diet-related causes. Globally, we find that a high-production scenario will decrease AASF prices by 26% and increase their consumption, thereby reducing the consumption of red and processed meats that can lead to diet-related non-communicable diseases5,6 while also preventing approximately 166 million cases of inadequate micronutrient intake.

METHODS: Pompano (n = 21) were purchased from the local fish market and examined for parasitic copepods. Morphological features of the copepods were examined and drawn using an Olympus BX51 equipped with a drawing tube. Key diagnostic characters were scanned using a confocal laser scanning microscope and a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: Caligus madeirensis sp. nov., can be distinguished from all congeners (270 spp.) by the combination of the following characters: (i) an accessory process on the 3 outer terminal spines located on the distal exopodal segment of leg 1, (ii) a mandible with 14 teeth, (iii) a sternal furca with parallel, spatulate tines, (iv) a maxilliped with 2 simple setae at base of a claw, (v) a leg 3 with second endopodal segment with 5 pinnate setae, (vi) a 2-segmented leg 4 exopod with I; III spine formula, (vii) a male antenna with 4 overlapping plates on the distal segment, (viii) a male maxilliped corpus bearing a prominent myxal process ornamented with dense corrugations along inner margin. CONCLUSION: Together with Caligus madeirensis sp. nov., the Caligus fauna of Portugal consists of 13 species reported from 17 Portuguese marine fishes. Considering the large number of marine fish species (510 spp.) currently recorded from Portuguese waters it seems that only 3.3% of the Portuguese marine fishes have been found to be infested with species of the genus Caligus O.F.

Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specific functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and inflammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specific functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy, and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM. Finally, we review chemical biology-based experimental approaches for identifying autophagy regulatory pathways that may have implications for the development of therapeutics.","output":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease at the Intersection of Autophagy and Immunity: Insights from Human Genetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUE: For several weeks, prophylactic messages against the extension of Covid-19 have saturated the public space. To protect populations, efficient measures have been rapidly put to limit the movement of people and manufactured goods. These policies have reduced global greenhouse gas emissions as well as air pollution, especially in China. PROBLEM: If climate change were an epidemic, we would probably have already restored it. But it results directly from the thermo-industrial activities linked to the consumption society. For Friel (Lancet, 2020), the dramatic consequences of this disturbances have to be considered as an essential health issue. She advocates for 'climate change and health alliances'. RESULTS: Within such alliances, health professionals have the responsibility (1) to describe the morbidity inherent in our thermo-industrial societies (2) to alert populations, and (3) to work with allies to tackle climate change and protect human populations, starting with the most vulnerable. This type of alliance is underway in the battle against air pollution, as it has been for years for fighting smoking. Alliances are intended to extend to all population health issues, with a complete decompartmentalization of minds and practices at large scale. LESSONS: Health professionals have to be mindful not to cause any harm while practicing. The health system alone produces up to 8% of global greenhouse gas in developed countries (Pichler, 2019; HCWH, 2019). There is room for action. Since 2009, the British health care system (NHS) has adopted an efficient decarbonation policy, reducing global emission from 8 to 4%, but this outstanding initiative remains an exception worldwide. KEY MESSAGES: A review of public health strategies is necessary to meet the energy, environmental and health issues, both in terms of health risks due to climate change and of decarbonation of care activities.

We described the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in a large urban jail system, including signs and symptoms at time of testing and risk factors for hospitalization. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all patients aged &#8805;18 years who were tested for COVID-19 during March 11-April 28, 2020, while in custody in the New York City jail system (N = 978). We described demographic characteristics and signs and symptoms at the time of testing and performed Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with hospitalization among those with a positive test result. RESULTS: Of 978 people tested for COVID-19, 568 received a positive test result. Among symptomatic patients, the most common symptoms among those who received a positive test result were cough (n = 293 of 510, 57%) and objective fever (n = 288 of 510, 56%). Of 257 asymptomatic patients who were tested, 58 (23%) received a positive test result. Forty-five (8%) people who received a positive test result were hospitalized for COVID-19.

In this work, we propose rapid production methods of an extended segment of the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in HEK293SF cells cultured in suspension, in serum-free media, as a major component of a COVID-19 subunit vaccine under development. The expression of RBD, engineered with a sortase-recognition motif for protein-based carrier coupling, was achieved at high yields by plasmid transient transfection or human type-5-adenoviral infection of the cells, in a period of only two and three weeks, respectively. Both production methods were evaluated in 3L-controlled bioreactors with upstream and downstream bioprocess improvements, resulting in a product recovery with over 95% purity. Adenoviral infection led to over 100 g/mL of RBD in culture supernatants, which was around 7-fold higher than levels obtained in transfected cultures. The monosaccharide and sialic acid content was similar in the RBD protein from the two production approaches. It also exhibited a proper conformational structure as recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against key native Spike epitopes. Efficient direct binding to ACE2 was also demonstrated at similar levels in RBD obtained from both methods and from different production lots. Overall, we provide bioprocess-related data for the rapid, scalable manufacturing of low cost RBD based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, with the added value of making a functional antigen available to support further research on uncovering mechanisms of virus binding and entry as well as screening for potential COVID-19 therapeutics.","output":"Rapid High-Yield Production of Functional SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain by Viral and Non-Viral Transient Expression for Pre-Clinical Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Siupolu Tavui had been working as a nurse co-ordinator at a Counties Manukau Health orthopaedic ward when she was called onto the Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) team in June With a long-time interest in public health, Tavui was drawn to the yearlong contract for an operations manager at ARPHS's COVID-19 response \\"How do you explain to a family with eight children that they may be best in separate hostel rooms at a quarantine facility for two weeks, rather than altogether at home?\\" But the cultural connection \\"doesn't take away the frustration and worry\\" of families, who continue to feel there is a stigma to contracting the virus - despite director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield's message that the virus is the problem, not people, she said","output":"Pacific nurses make 'huge difference'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pyrazine-labeled multicompartment nanostructures are shown to exhibit enhanced pH-responsive blue-shifted fluorescence emission intensities compared to their simpler core-shell spherical analogs.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 107 patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis who underwent ultrasound-guided release of the plantar fascia. The series included 62 males (57.9%) and 45 females (42.1%) treated between April 2014 and February 2018, with a mean follow-up of 21.05  10.96 months (7C66) and a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The mean age was 48.10  10.27 years (27C72). Clinical assessments and ultrasound examination were carried out before treatment, after 1 week, and then after 1, 3, 12, and 24 months. The clinical assessment was based on a visual analog scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. RESULTS: Heel pain improved in 92.5% (99) of patients, but not in 7.4% (8 patients). In the group of patients whose heel pain improved, 9 experienced overload on the lateral column and dorsum of the foot, which improved with the use of plantar orthoses and a rehabilitation program. We recorded no nerve complications (e.g., paresthesia), vascular injuries, or wound-related problems. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided partial plantar fasciotomy with a needle is safe, since structures are under direct visualization of the surgeon and the risk of damage is minimal. Stitches are not necessary, and recovery is fast. Consequently, costs are low, and the patient can return to work quickly.

The pandemic has also increased clinical mentors' need to follow their mentees' educational progress via virtual technology, including smartphone-based educational apps. The aim of the study is to propose a model in psychiatric and medical interprofessional practice e-assessment. METHODS: In this study, 228 undergraduate healthcare students underwent a training period in interprofessional practice across specialties being assessed by Ecological Momentary e-Assessment (EMeA), and consisting of ongoing or before/after Interprofessional Education (IPE) learning evaluations with the assistance of an IPE-app linked to online surveys. The Goodness of Fit Test Chi-square and t-test statistics analyzed the data. RESULTS: Surveys during, at entry and exit points in IPE captured increased percentages of learners, specifically, reporting high patient satisfaction with interprofessional teams (c2=22.54; p<.01), learners experiencing very good quality of care when delivered by interprofessional teams (c2=30.02; p<.01) assessed by distance technology, and learners selecting less frequently peers from the same clinical background when support was needed in patient care (c2=19.84; p<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Contextual assessment (in the real-time and real-world scenario) of IPE learning moments via EMeA shows its value and applicability during the current covid-19 pandemic when the assessment of learning cannot occur face-to-face between learners and teachers.

Results Of the 160 patients with benign uterine disease included in the present study. Forty received NAVH and remaining 120 received LAVH. There were significant differences between the groups regarding operation time and hemoglobin change. Notably, although the operation time was shorter for LAVH, hemoglobin change was lower for NAVH. Additionally, although maximum hospitalization duration was shorter for LAVH, the average length of hospitalization was similar between NAVH and LAVH. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other variables.

Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors and types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS), alcohol abuse/dependence and depression. RESULTS Current alcohol abuse/dependence symptom counts 3 years after the outbreak were positively associated with having been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, during the outbreak. However, having had family members or friends contract, SARS was not related to alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count. Symptoms of PTS and of depression, and having used drinking as a coping method, were also significantly associated with increased alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. The relationship between outbreak exposure and alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count remained significant even when sociodemographic and other factors were controlled for. When the intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal PTS symptom clusters were entered into the model, hyperarousal was found to be significantly associated with alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms.

Amongst the subfamily of MOB(V1) plasmids, three groups of oriT sequences, represented by plasmids pMV158, pT181, and p1414 were identified. In the same subfamily, we found four types of single-strand origins, namely ssoA, ssoU, ssoW, and ssoT. We found that plasmids of the rolling-circle Rep_2 family (to which pMV158 belongs) are more frequently found in Lactobacillales than in any other bacterial order, whereas Rep_1 initiators seemed to prefer hosts included in the Bacillales order. In parallel, MOB(V1) relaxases associated with Rep_2 initiators tended to cluster separately from those linked to Rep_1 plasmids.

Analyzing 94 clinical samples demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug could not. Conclusion: Our research shows that developing multiplex ddPCR assays is possible by combing probe mix and amplitude-based multiplexing, which will help in developing multiplexed ddPCR assays for different SARS-CoV-2 applications.","output":"Developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) have a high prevalence and are associated with high healthcare costs.

This virus is fatal for broad groups of populations, including elderly, men, and patients with comorbidities among which obesity is a possible risk factor. The pathophysiologic connections between obesity/metainflammation and COVID-19 may be directly related to increasing soluble ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2] levels which potentiates the viral entrance into the host cells, or indirectly related to dysregulation of immune system, microvascular injury and hypercoagulability. The SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein interacts mainly with ACE2 or possibly DDP4 receptors to enter into the host cells. The host proteases, especially TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2], support the fusion process and virus entry. While membranous ACE2 is considered a port of entry to the cell for SARS-CoV-2, it seems that soluble ACE2 retains its virus binding capability and enhances its entry into the cells. Interestingly, ACE2 on cell membrane may have protective roles by diminishing cytokine storm-related injuries to the organs. Applying medications that can reduce soluble ACE2 levels, antagonizing TMPRSS2 or blocking DDP4 can improve the outcomes of COVID-19. Metformin and statins through immunomodulatory activities, Orlistat by reducing viral replication, and thiazolidinediones by upregulating ACE2 expression have potential beneficial effects against COVID-19. However, the combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4] inhibitors and spironolactone/eplerenone seems to be more effective by reducing soluble ACE2 level, antagonizing TMPRSS2, maintaining ACE2 on cell membrane and reducing risk of viral entry into the cells.","output":"Metainflammation in COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) protein of murine coronavirus JHMV, variant cl-2, comprises two polypeptides, N-terminal S1 (with an N-terminal signal peptide) and C-terminal S2 (with a C-terminal transmembrane domain).

In cells transfected with the pSFS1utt and pSFS1tmd, 96K and 106K proteins, respectively, were detected by Western blotting. The ssS2 protein expressed by pSFssS2 was 96K, which was slightly larger than the authentic S2 protein. The S1utt and S1tmd proteins were shown by binding studies using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to be antigenically indistinguishable from the authentic S1 protein. The S1tmd and ssS2 proteins were detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescence, whereas the S1utt protein was not.

Saliva-based antigen rapid tests (ARTs) can fulfil this need, but these tests require overnight-fasted samples; without which independent studies have demonstrated sensitivities of only 11.7 to 23.1%. Herein, we report an Amplified Parallel ART (AP-ART) with sensitivity above 90%, even with non-fasted samples. The virus was captured multimodally, using both anti-spike protein antibodies and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. It also featured two parallel flow channels. The first contained spike protein binding gold nanoparticles which produced a visible red line upon encountering the virus. The second contained signal amplifying nanoparticles that complex with the former and amplify the signal without any linker. Compared to existing dual gold amplification techniques, a limit of detection of one order of magnitude lower was achieved (0.0064 ngmL(C)(1)). AP-ART performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva of COVID-19 patients was investigated using a caseCcontrol study (139 participants enrolled and 162 saliva samples tested). Unlike commercially available ARTs, the sensitivity of AP-ART was maintained even when non-fasting saliva was used. Compared to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing on nasopharyngeal samples, non-fasting saliva tested on AP-ART showed a sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI: 84.7C99.8); without amplification, the sensitivity was 72.7% (95% CI: 83.7C94.8). Thus, AP-ART has the potential to be developed for point-of-care testing, which may be particularly important in resource-limited settings, and for early diagnosis to initiate newly approved therapies to reduce COVID-19 severity.

Nonetheless, the predicted 8-h O3 concentrations across China suffered from 1.29% increases during this period. The avoided premature all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease (RD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortalities induced by NO2 decrease during COVID-19 lockdown period reached 3954 (3076 - 4832), 635 (468 - 801), 612 (459 - 765), and 920 (653 - 1186) cases.

Characterizing effective delivery methods of eHealth interventions is required to enable improved design and implementation of evidence-based health behavior change interventions. OBJECTIVE This study aims to systematically review the literature and synthesize evidence on the success of eHealth behavior change interventions in patients with cancer and survivors delivered by synchronous, asynchronous, or combined methods compared with a control group. Engagement with the intervention, behavior change, and health outcomes, including quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, were examined. METHODS A search of Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PubMed was conducted for studies published between March 2007 and March 2019. We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining interventions delivered to adult cancer survivors via eHealth methods with a measure of health behavior change. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to examine whether the method of eHealth delivery impacted the level of engagement, behavior change, and health outcomes. RESULTS A total of 24 RCTs were included predominantly examining dietary and physical activity behavior change interventions. There were 11 studies that used a synchronous approach and 11 studies that used an asynchronous approach, whereas 2 studies used a combined delivery method. Use of eHealth interventions improved exercise behavior (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.48), diet behavior (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-0.70), fatigue (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.50; SMD change 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.35), anxiety (SMD 1.21, 95% CI: 0.36-2.07; SMD change 0.15, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.40), depression (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00-0.30), and quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.34; SMD change 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.24). The mode of delivery did not influence the amount of dietary and physical activity behavior change observed. CONCLUSIONS Physical activity and dietary behavior change eHealth interventions delivered to patients with cancer or survivors have a small to moderate impact on behavior change and a small to very small benefit to quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether asynchronous or synchronous delivery modes yield superior results. Three-arm RCTs comparing delivery modes with a control with robust engagement reporting are required to determine the most successful delivery method for promoting behavior change and ultimately favorable health outcomes.","output":"Impact of the Method of Delivering Electronic Health Behavior Change Interventions in Survivors of Cancer on Engagement, Health Behaviors, and Health Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID-19 reinfected patients suffer from diverse health consequences. Information on the severity of COVID-19 reinfection is scarce. The current study aimed to determine the proportion of COVID-19 reinfection and risk factors associated with its severity. MethodsThis cross-sectional study targeted all COVID-19 patients reported in May 2021 at the Health Information Unit (HIU) of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of Bangladesh. We identified 473 (1.14%) reinfected patients out of 41408 diagnosed cases by reviewing their medical records. Considering the selection criteria and informed consent, we enrolled 404 reinfected patients. Data were collected through telephone interviews and reviewing medical records using a semi-structured questionnaire and a checklist. ResultsThe majority of the reinfected patients were urban residents (98.0%). Around 13.0% of reinfected patients had <90% oxygen saturation, and 64.0% had an interval of 3-6 months between two attacks. The severity of reinfection included asymptomatic (12.9%), mild (8.9%), moderate (66.3%), and severe (11.9%) forms of infection. An interval of 3-6 months between two attacks had less chance of having mild (AOR=0.031, {rho}=0.000), moderate (AOR=0.132, {rho}=0.017), and severe (AOR=0.059, {rho}=0.002) infections. Patients who maintained physical distance had less chance of moderate-intensity reinfection (AOR=0.137, {rho}=0.013), while the vaccinated patients had a higher chance of moderate (AOR=16.127, {rho}=0.001) and severe (AOR=3.894, {rho}=0.047) intensity reinfection. ConclusionTo avert COVID-19 reinfection and its severity, patients should be vigilant about preventive practices even after recovery. The study suggests vibrant interventions aligned with exposure, physical distancing, vaccination, and comorbidities for mitigating reinfection.","output":"Severity of COVID-19 reinfection and associated risk factors: findings of a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Game-based learning environments enable students to engage in authentic, inquiry-based learning. Reflective thinking serves a critical role in inquiry-based learning by encouraging students to think critically about their knowledge and experiences in order to foster deeper learning processes. Free-response reflection prompts can be embedded in game-based learning environments to encourage students to engage in reflection and externalize their reflection processes, but automatically assessing student reflection presents significant challenges. In this paper, we present a framework for automatically assessing students written reflection responses during inquiry-based learning in Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology. Using data from a classroom study involving 153 middle school students, we compare the effectiveness of several computational representations of students natural language responses to reflection promptsGloVe, ELMo, tf-idf, unigramsacross several machine learning-based regression techniques (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron) to assess the depth of student reflection responses.

The first is the need to take planetary health more seriously and move away from reductionist thinking to an approach that sees the planet as a complex system and values more harmony with nature, protects biodiversity and prevents global warming. The second task is to advocate and support governments to govern for health. The key to doing this is putting health and equity before profit, creating healthy urban environments, encouraging participatory decision-making, advocating for healthy economic models and assessing the ways in which corporate determinants of health operate.

Because of the gap between the hire and start date in jobs like academia, onboarding programs should include pre-employment onboarding (preboarding) as well.1,3 Orientation is another part of onboarding new pharmacy faculty and is concerned with the administrative aspects of a new job, such as setting up payroll, parking permits, benefits, ID badges, credentialing, and computer access.3 Orientation is an important part of onboarding as it sets the tone for the new employee's transition and shapes their impression of and relationship to the organization.3 Overall, successful onboarding and orientation programs can lead to increased satisfaction and retention of new faculty.1 Under ordinary conditions it is important for a school to have a formal onboarding process in place, but during a global pandemic it is crucial. While some new faculty may want to move early to unpack and explore their new town, relocating during COVID-19 may require quarantining upon arrival and adjusting timelines. Because of social distancing and decreased gatherings, new faculty may have limited opportunities to meet new people in their community. The orientation mentor can also assist new faculty on their first day of work by helping them to complete required paperwork (eg, benefits, timesheets, payroll, and HR training);acquire an employee ID badge;gain office, building, and practice site keys or access cards;identify internet technology (IT) support for secure, encrypted, WiFi and on-and-off campus network connections;access library and virtual private networks (VPNs);secure computer passwords, equipment, supplies, and parking permits;and obtain and set up an office.8 The orientation mentor can also help new faculty with completing credentialing paperwork necessary to acquire practice site privileges.

Methods: This is an online survey-based observational study administered to 695 OB/GYNs across Canada. Results: Of the 129 respondents, 84% reported a decrease in monthly revenue, with 17% reporting a significant (>50%) decrease. OB/GYNs with the greatest reduction in revenue were those practicing primarily in gynecology. Reproductive Endocrinologists reported the largest reduction in revenue of all subspecialists.

A total of 18 New Zealand white rabbits of similar weight (40  1 day old) were randomly assigned to beet pulp treatment (BP), alfalfa meal treatment (AM), and peanut vine treatment (PV). There were 6 repeats in each treatment and all were raised in a single cage. The predictive period was 7 days and the experimental period was 40 days. The results revealed that AM and PV supplementation increased growth performance, slaughter performance, and intestinal development of meat rabbits compared with the BP treatment, and especially the effect of AM treatment was better. The content of butyric acid was increased in PV and AM treatments compared with the BP treatment. The expression of mitochondrial biosynthesis genes of liver, cecum, and muscle showed that AM treatment increased gene expression of CPT1b compared to the BP treatment. In addition, AM and PV treatments significantly increased the microbial diversity and richness compared with BP treatment, and their bacterial community composition was similar, and there were some differences between AM and PV treatments and BP treatment. Metabonomics analysis of muscle showed that AM treatment significantly increased amino acid and fatty acid metabolites compared with BP treatment, which were mainly concentrated in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid regulation pathways. Furthermore, through correlation analysis, it was found that there was a significant correlation between rumenococci in the cecum and amino acid metabolites in the muscle.

Our findings reveal that the triad of divide, divert, and conquer was crucial to Trumps communications strategy. We argue that racist nativismor racialized national threats to American securityis key to comprehending the external divisiveness in this strategy. When Trump bitterly cast China as the cause of Americas pandemic fallout and Mexico as the source of other key American problems (i.e., crime and low-paid jobs for U.S.-born Americans), he sowed clear racialized divisions between the United States (U.S.). and these two nations.

As the number of infected grew so did the concerns about its capability to cause long-term damage especially with the appearance of the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Proteins from the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were proposed as the cellular receptors, however, due to the ability of the virus to infect a variety of cell lines different strategies to elucidate the tropism of the virus should be investigated. HYPOTHESIS: Pseudotyping is a powerful tool to interrogate the ability of the glycoprotein (GP) to permit entry of viruses. AIM: We aimed to establish a highly tractable pseudotype model using lenti- and retro-viral backbones to investigate the entry pathway of ZIKV. METHODOLOGY: We used different glycoprotein constructs and different lenti- or retro-viral backbones, in a matrix of ratios to investigate production of proteins and functional pseudotypes. RESULTS: Varying the ratio of backbone and glycoprotein plasmids did not yield infectious pseudotypes. Moreover, the supplementation of the ZIKV protease or the substitution of the backbone had no positive impact on the infectivity. We showed production of the proteins in producer cells implying the lack of infectious pseudotypes is due to a lack of successful glycoprotein incorporation, rather than lack of protein production. CONCLUSION: In line with other reports, we were unable to successfully produce infectious pseudotypes using the variety of methods described.

This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway. METHODS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario. RESULTS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery. CONCLUSION: Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate.

The objective of the present systematic review was to identify all research that has assessed changes in levels of cytokines relevant to cytokine storm in response to administration of Echinacea supplementation. The following databases were searched: Medline (Ovid), AMED (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid). Title and abstract screening, full text screening, and data extraction were completed in duplicate using a piloted extraction template. Risk of bias assessment was completed. Qualitative analysis was used to assess for trends in cytokine level changes. The search identified 279 unique publications. After full text screening, 105 studies met criteria for inclusion including 13 human studies, 24 animal studies, and 71 in vitro or ex vivo studies. The data suggest that Echinacea supplementation may be associated with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, as well as an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally high.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare psychobehavioral responses in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered to adults in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the epidemic in each setting. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level, and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the adoption of social distancing measures. RESULTS: Data from 3431 complete responses (Hong Kong, 1663; United Kingdom, 1768) were analyzed.

A large proportion of respondents were abnormally or borderline anxious (Hong Kong: 1077/1603, 60.0%; United Kingdom: 812/1768, 46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (Hong Kong: 94.0%-98.5%; United Kingdom: 69.2%-93.5%; all percentages weighted), with Hong Kong identifying additional routes. Hong Kong reported high levels of adoption of various social distancing measures (Hong Kong: 32.6%-93.7%; United Kingdom: 17.6%-59.0%) and mask-wearing (Hong Kong: 98.8% (1647/1663); United Kingdom: 3.1% (53/1768)). The impact of perceived severity of symptoms and perceived ease of transmission of COVID-19 on the adoption of social distancing measures varied by setting. In Hong Kong, these factors had no impact, whereas in the United Kingdom, those who perceived their symptom severity as high were more likely to adopt social distancing (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as easy were prone to adopt both general social distancing (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social distancing did not vary by setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in populations, as well as prior sensitization to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk should be communicated through suitable media channelsand trust should be maintainedwhile early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","output":"Comparing Public Perceptions and Preventive Behaviors During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the past 5 years, China has quickly followed USs steps to approve the new drug application of biologics for dermatological diseases. There is an increasing interest in the current biologic landscape and further potentials in China. Our study aims to analyze features of clinical trials on non-cancer dermatological biologics and synthesize recent achievements and impediments, in order to forecast the development trends in China. Methods: Three registers (the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Center for Drug Evaluation, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for clinical trials of non-cancer dermatological biologics initiated between 2016 and 2020 in mainland China. Trial information (the first posted year, sponsor type, study phase and site, recruitment status, disease, drug target, and drug registration type) and certain study design (selection of the control group, primary efficacy outcome, and inclusion of patient-reported outcome for nonCphase I or II trials only) information were extracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 60 trials were identified. The number of registered dermatological biologic trials significantly increased with an annual increase of 59% from 2016 to 2020, primarily driven by psoriasis (47/60, 78.3%) and atopic dermatitis (6/60, 10.0%) trials. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-17 remained the hottest drug targets (17/60, 28.3% for TNF- and 18/60, 30.0% for IL-17). In addition to TNF- and IL-17, many new psoriasis drug targets came into place since 2018 (IL-12/23) and 2019 (IL-36 and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)). Thirty percent (18/60) of the trials were conducted for biosimilar products, all of which were sponsored by local pharmaceutical companies and 88.9% of which were targeting on TNF-. Targets of IL-36, IL-5, and IgE were only available in trials sponsored by global companies. Conclusion: There was great progress on the innovation of dermatological biologics in the past 5 years in China in terms of surged number of clinical trials, increased biosimilars and me-too drugs which greatly improved patient access to novel treatments, execution of parallel clinical trials, and improved hospital GCP office and regulatory environment. Further efforts for local pharmaceutical companies should include relocating resources to exploring novel drug targets and dermatological diseases other than psoriasis or atopic dermatitis.

With the increased attention focused on active learning, professors are striving to find better ways to engage students in the classroom. Indeed, numerous studies have focused on investigating many different approaches to this topic. COVID 19 has mandated a rapid transition to remote learning and with this forced change has come what some students describe as Zoom Fatigue [1]. Many students have reported feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and disengaged by the dramatic increase in mandated distance education required by the COVID pandemic. Video conferencing has become the go to panacea for education during this time and students are spending unprecedented amounts of time in front of a screen where normally they would be in a classroom. This heretofore singular and unique approach to education coupled with decreased peer\\\\to\\\\peer interaction has caused a problem with student engagement [2,3]. PROBLEM: Students engagement and performance have decreased during COVID 19 due to forced online learning and lack of peer interaction. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that creating a non\\\\graded, fun, and relaxing physiology\\\\focused trivia night will increase student engagement and performance on summative assessments. PROPOSAL: Using a master's level class progressing through the respiratory physiology module utilizing remote, synchronous lectures to deliver content, we will introduce a voluntary pub trivia night review session with teams randomly assigned to increase interaction amongst peers and review respiratory physiology material. Questions will be provided in rounds and at the end a winning team will be awarded a $100 gift card. EXPECTED RESULTS: We expect students who attend and participate in the pub trivia night will perform better than their peers on summative exams as well as report increased engagement with their classmates over the course of the unit. Analysis of test scores of those who competed and those who did not will be compared. All students in class will be surveyed concerning peer engagement and results compared. LITERATURE CITED: 1.

Therefore, automated COVID-19 diagnosis models are essential to identify the existence of disease from radiological images. Earlier studies have focused on the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using X-ray images on COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper aims to develop a Deep Learning Based MultiModal Fusion technique called DLMMF for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed DLMMF model operates on three main processes namely Weiner Filtering (WF) based pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. The proposed model incorporates the fusion of deep features using VGG16 and Inception v4 models. Finally, Gaussian Na?ve Bayes (GNB) based classifier is applied for identifying and classifying the test CT images into distinct class labels. The experimental validation of the DLMMF model takes place using open-source COVID-CT dataset, which comprises a total of 760 CT images. The experimental outcome defined the superior performance with the maximum sensitivity of 96.53%, specificity of 95.81%, accuracy of 96.81% and F-score of 96.73%.","output":"Deep learning based fusion model for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification using computed tomography images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has shown a diplomatic system that is dysfunctional.

Multiplex immunoblot (IB) assays termed COVID-19 IB assays were developed for detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Recombinant nucleocapsid protein and the S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used as target antigens in the COVID-19 IBs. Specificity of the IB assay was established with 231 sera from persons with allergy, unrelated viral infections, autoimmune conditions and suspected tick-borne diseases, and 32 goat antisera to human influenza proteins. IgG and IgM COVID-19 IBs assays were performed on 84 sera obtained at different times after a positive RT-qPCR test from 37 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Criteria for determining overall IgG and IgM antibody positivity using the four SARS-CoV-2 proteins were developed by optimizing specificity and sensitivity in the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IB assays. The estimated sensitivities and specificities of the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IBs for IgG and IgM antibodies individually or for either IgG or IgM antibodies meet the US recommendations for laboratory serological diagnostic tests. The proportion of IgM-positive sera from the COVID-19 patients following an RT-qPCR positive test was maximal at 83% before 10 days and decreased to 0% after 100 days, while the proportions of IgG-positive sera tended to plateau between days 11 and 65 at 78-100% and fall to 44% after 100 days. Detection of either IgG or IgM antibodies was better than IgG or IgM alone for assessing seroconversion in COVID-19. Both IgG and IgM antibodies detected RBD less frequently than S1, S2 and N proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex COVID-19 IB assays offer many advantages for simultaneously evaluating antibody responses to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in COVID-19 patients.","output":"IgG and IgM antibody formation to spike and nucleocapsid proteins in COVID-19 characterized by multiplex immunoblot assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While the association between relationship status and the development of depressive symptoms in the general population were reported previously, its relation to the severity and the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as the treatment patterns and response rates needs to be elucidated. METHODS: The present international multicenter cross-sectional study performed by the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression (GSRD) investigated socio-demographic and clinical patterns of relationship status in a real-world sample of 1410 adult in- and outpatients with MDD as primary diagnosis. RESULTS: While 49.9% of all MDD patients were partnered, 25.4% were separated, and 24.8% were single. Single relationship status was linked to younger mean age, earlier mean age of onset, and current suicidal risk. Being separated was related to older mean age, unemployment, greater symptom severity, current suicidal risk, and add-on treatment strategies. Partnered relationship status was associated with less frequent current suicidal risk. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective assessment of treatment response that was exclusively based on psychopharmacotherapeutic strategies should be critically considered and weighed while interpreting the present results providing novel insights into the complex interaction of relationship status with the clinical phenotype of MDD. CONCLUSIONS: Although MDD patients living in relationships do not seem to be omitted from the evolution of MDD, they may be spared from chronicity and suicidality. Hence, being aware of the current relationship status might support clinicians in the diagnostic and therapeutic process towards optimized management of such challenging clinical phenomena and their negative consequences.","output":"The Role of Relationship Status in Major Depressive Disorder - Results of the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have recommended their citizens to adopt social distance, hand hygiene, and face mask wearing.

The average concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs differed significantly both temporally and spatially and were the lowest in Kirishima during the warm period (PAHs: 0.11  0.06 ng m-3; NPAHs: 1.23  0.96 pg m-3) and the highest in Shenyang during the cold period (PAHs: 49.7  21.8 ng m-3; NPAHs: 357  180 pg m-3). The average total benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent concentrations were also higher in Shenyang and Vladivostok than in Japanese cities. According to the results of source apportionment, traffic emissions impacted these cities in both the warm and cold periods, whereas coal combustion-generated effects were obvious in Shenyang and Vladivostok during the cold period.

To prevent further spread of the disease, restrictions of population flow from the government and measures to reduce virus transmission from hospitals may lead to the delay of diagnosis and treatment in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: All NPC patients with radiotherapy indications were included from 20 weekdays before (group A) and after (group B) January 31, 2020, when the institute began to take measures against COVID-19. The waiting intervals of each step and variation from the diagnosis and treatment path of NPC between two groups were compared. Results: Significant differences were found between the group A and group B in the median waiting days for pathological biopsy (5 vs 15, P=0.012), radiotherapy immobilization and simulation (3.5 vs 16.5, P&lt;0.001), validation of position and plan (20 vs 61, P&lt;0.001) and initiation of radiotherapy (28 vs 36, P=0.005).

Traditionally, immunoscreenings of expression libraries via polyclonal sera on nitrocellulose membranes or screenings of whole proteome lysates in 2-D gel electrophoresis are performed. However, these methods feature some rather inconvenient disadvantages. Screening of expression libraries to expose novel antigens from bacteria often lead to an abundance of false positive signals owing to the high cross reactivity of polyclonal antibodies towards the proteins of the expression host. A method is presented that overcomes many disadvantages of the old procedures. RESULTS: Four proteins that have previously been described as immunogenic have successfully been assessed immunogenic abilities with our method. One protein with no known immunogenic behaviour before suggested potential immunogenicity. We incorporated a fusion tag prior to our genes of interest and attached the expressed fusion proteins covalently on microarrays. This enhances the specific binding of the proteins compared to nitrocellulose. Thus, it helps to reduce the number of false positives significantly. It enables us to screen for immunogenic proteins in a shorter time, with more samples and statistical reliability. We validated our method by employing several known genes from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented offers a new approach for screening of bacterial expression libraries to illuminate novel proteins with immunogenic features.

The strict containment measures have adversely affected population movements and mobility, daily activities, and the patterns of healthcare-seeking behavior. Although the Emergency and Admission Departments (EADS) activity has never been disrupted, the pandemic had a significant impact on the routine healthcare delivery. This study aims to assess the changes in healthcare delivery, with a focus on the elderly as a vulnerable component of the general population. Design of the study: Retrospective study. Methods: All non-COVID visits to the EAD of the Local Health Unit (ASL1) in Abruzzo (Italy) from 9 March to 3 May 2020 were analyzed. These were compared to the hospital admissions recorded in the same period of the previous year. Results: We found a 60.4% reduction in overall visits during the study period and an increase in the hospitalization rate from 30% to 39%. Emergency department visits have declined markedly for less acute medical conditions, while we have observed a statistically significant increase in the hospitalization rates for all age groups. Moreover, in 2020 we recorded a decrease in the ratio non-urgent/non-deferrable medical conditions for each age group; while the percentage of hospitalizations for each registered red code increased for each group, particularly for the 65-74 age group. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the care-seeking behavior of patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, total hospital admissions have decreased, particularly for less severe illnesses, whereas the percentage of hospitalizations has increased. During 2020, hospital admissions for mild cases decreased, and patients presented to the EAD only in cases of acute medical condition, selecting those in need for more intensive care. However, several patients may have deferred necessary medical care even for potentially urgent conditions. Such reluctance to seek medical care may have caused delays in diagnosis. The impact of deferred care on patients' health is difficult to estimate at this time. This information will serve as a starting point for further research to improve healthcare management not only during emergency but also in non-emergency periods.","output":"The impact of covid-19 pandemic on emergency services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to an increase in intimate partner violence (IPV), posing challenges to health care providers who must protect themselves and others during sexual assault examinations. Victims of sexual assault encountered in prehospital and emergency department (ED) settings have legal as well as medical needs. A series of procedures must be carefully followed to facilitate forensic evidence collection and law enforcement investigation. A literature review detected a paucity of published guidance on the management of sexual assault patients in the ED, and no information specific to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Investigators sought to update the San Diego County sexual assault guidelines, created in collaboration with health care professionals, forensic specialists, and law enforcement, through a consensus iterative review process. An additional objective was to create a SAFET-I Tool for use by frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: The authors present a novel SAFET-I Tool that outlines the following five components of effective sexual assault patient care: stabilization, alert system activation, forensic evidence consideration, expedited post-assault treatment, and trauma-informed care. This framework can be used as an educational tool and template for agencies interested in developing or adapting existing sexual assault policies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of clinical guidance for ED providers that integrates the many aspects of sexual assault patient care, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A SAFET-I Tool is presented to assist emergency health care providers in the treatment and advocacy of sexual assault patients during a period with increasing rates of IPV.","output":"Emergency Department Management of the Sexual Assault Victim in the COVID Era: A Model SAFET-I Guideline From San Diego County"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Newly diagnosed low-grade bilateral breast lymphoma in 63-year-old woman demonstrated intense FDG uptake in the left axillary lymph nodes and the spleen, concerning for lymphomatous involvement.

Mucins are intimately involved in viral transmission. Mucin and virus laden particles can be expelled from the mouth and nose to later infect others. Viruses must also penetrate the mucus layer before cell entry and replication. The role of mucins and their molecular structure have not been well-characterized in coronavirus transmission studies. Laboratory studies predicting high rates of fomite transmission have not translated to real-world infections, and mucins may be one culprit. Here, we probed both surface and direct contact transmission scenarios for their dependence on mucins and their structure. We utilized disease-causing, bovine-derived, human coronavirus OC43. We found that bovine mucins could inhibit the infection of live cells in a concentration- and glycan-dependent manner. The effects were observed in both mock fomite and direct contact transmission experiments and were not dependent upon surface material or time-on-surface. However, the effects were abrogated by removal of the glycans or in a cross-species infection scenario where bovine mucin could not inhibit the infection of a murine coronavirus. Together, our data indicate that the mucin molecular structure plays a complex and important role in host defense. Mucins are sugar-coated proteins covering wet mucosal surfaces in the body. Viruses attach to mucin sugars for adhesion and host-cell entry.

Therefore, blocking malicious domains is the most effective and practical way to combat and reduce hostile activities. There are three limitations in previous methods over domain classification: (1) solely based on local domain features which tend to be not robust enough; (2) lack of a large number of ground truth for model-training to get high accuracy; (3) statically learning on graph which is not scalable. In this paper, we present Ringer, a scalable method to detect malicious domains by dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Ringer first uses querying behaviors or domain-IP resolutions to construct domain graphs, on which the dynamic GCN is leveraged to learn the node representations that integrate both information about node features and graph structure. And then, these high-quality representations are further fed to the full-connected neural network for domain classification. Notably, instead of global statically learning, we adopt time-based hash to cut graphs to small ones and inductively learn the embedding of nodes according to selectively sampling neighbors. We construct a series of experiments on a large ISP over two days and compare it with state of the arts. The results demonstrate that Ringer achieves excellent performance with a high accuracy of 96.8% on average.

Numerous drugs have been repurposed and investigated for therapeutic effectiveness in the disease, including those from Solidarity, an international clinical trial (azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, the fixed combination lopinavir/ritonavir, and remdesivir). OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting for drugs when used in the treatment of COVID-19 compared with use for other indications, specifically focussing on sex differences. METHOD: We extracted reports on COVID-19-specific treatments from the global ADR database, VigiBase, using an algorithm developed to identify reports that listed COVID-19 as the indication. The Solidarity trial drugs were included, as were any drugs reported  100 times. We performed a descriptive comparison of reports for the same drugs used in non-COVID-19 indications. The data lock point date was 7 June 2020. RESULTS: In total, 2573 reports were identified for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. In order of frequency, the most reported ADRs were electrocardiogram QT-prolonged, diarrhoea, nausea, hepatitis, and vomiting in males and diarrhoea, electrocardiogram QT-prolonged, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain in females. Other hepatic and kidney-related events were included in the top ten ADRs in males, whereas no hepatic or renal terms were reported for females. COVID-19-related reporting patterns differed from non-pandemic reporting for these drugs. CONCLUSION: Review of a global database of suspected ADR reports revealed sex differences in the reporting patterns for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19.

The aim of this prospective single-arm phase II trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single low-dose targeted bevacizumab infusion after blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) in adult patients with steroid-refractory brain RN. METHODS: Ten adults with steroid-refractory, imaging-confirmed brain RN were enrolled between November 2016 and January 2018 and followed for 12 months after treatment. Bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg was administered as a one-time targeted intra-arterial infusion immediately after BBBD. Primary outcomes included safety and > 25% decrease in lesion volume. Images were analyzed by a board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to pretrial diagnosis and treatment status. Secondary outcomes included changes in headache, steroid use, and functional status and absence of neurocognitive sequelae. Comparisons were analyzed using the Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U-test, linear mixed models, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and repeated-measures 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Ten adults (mean  SD [range] age 35  15 [22-62] years) participated in this study. No patients died or exhibited serious adverse effects of systemic bevacizumab. At 3 months, 80% (95% CI 44%-98%) and 90% (95% CI 56%-100%) of patients demonstrated > 25% decrease in RN and vasogenic edema volume, respectively. At 12 months, RN volume decreased by 74% (median [range] 76% [53%-96%], p = 0.012), edema volume decreased by 50% (median [range] 70% [-11% to 83%], p = 0.086), and headache decreased by 84% (median [range] 92% [58%-100%], p = 0.022) among the 8 patients without RN recurrence. Only 1 (10%) patient was steroid dependent at the end of the trial. Scores on 12 of 16 (75%) neurocognitive indices increased, thereby supporting a pattern of cerebral white matter recovery. Two (20%) patients exhibited RN recurrence that required further treatment at 10 and 11 months, respectively, after bevacizumab infusion.

Hence new antifungal and anti-bacterial drug targets are urgently needed before the situation goes beyond control. Inteins are polypeptides that self-splice from exteins without the need for cofactors or external energy, resulting in joining of extein fragments. Inteins are present in many organisms, including human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, C. gattii, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Because intein elements are not present in human genes, they are attractive drug targets to develop antifungals and antibiotics. Thus far, a few inhibitors of intein splicing have been reported. Metal-ions such as Zn2+ and Cu2+, and platinum-containing compound cisplatin inhibit intein splicing in M. tuberculosis and C. neoformans by binding to the active site cysteines. A small-molecule inhibitor 6G-318S and its derivative 6G-319S are found to inhibit intein splicing in C. neoformans and C. gattii with a MIC in nanomolar concentrations. Inteins have also been used in many other applications. Intein can be used in activating a protein inside a cell using small molecules. Moreover, split intein can be used to deliver large genes in experimental gene therapy and to kill selected species in a mixed population of microbes by taking advantage of the toxin-antitoxin system.

OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the development process of CoSMoS (COVID-19 Symptoms Monitoring System), which consists of a self-monitoring algorithm-based Telegram bot and a teleconsultation system. We describe all the essential steps from clinical perspectives and technical approaches in designing, developing, and integrating the system into the clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and lessons learned from this development process. METHODS: CoSMoS was developed in three phases: 1) Requirement formation to identify clinical problems and drafting the clinical algorithm. 2) Development-testing iteration using the agile software development method. 3) Integration into clinical practice to design an effective clinical workflow using repeated simulations and role-plays. RESULTS: A total of 19 days was used to complete the development of CoSMoS. In phase 1 (requirement formation), we have identified three main functions: daily automated reminder system for patients to self-check their symptoms, safe patients' risk assessment to guide patients in clinical decision making, and active telemonitoring system with an in-time phone consultation. The system architecture of CoSMoS involved five components: Telegram instant messaging, clinician dashboard, system admin (backend), database, and DevOps infrastructure. The integration of CoSMoS in clinical practice involved the consideration of the COVID-19 infectivity and patient safety.

Despite its significant ill consequences, there is a dearth of studies in low-and middle-income countries. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no study assessed the prevalence of CAD in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess CAD and associated factors among pregnant women in Arba Minch Zuria district, Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 676 pregnant women from January 01 to November 30, 2019.

The Antibiotic Self-Stewardship Time Out Program (SSTOP) evaluated the implementation at VAMCs of an Antibiotic Timeout 3 days after the initiation of antibiotics to encourage providers to review continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. METHODS: Sites launched the SSTOP note templates in a rolling fashion from June 2019-March 2020. Clinical pharmacists largely drove the implementation. The vancomycin note template was implemented at 6 of 8 sites and the antipseudomonal note template across 4 of 8 sites. Two sites were unable to launch the note templates due to lack of resources, however they utilized SSTOP principles/guided tools. From Sept 2019-Nov 2020 we conducted post-launch qualitative interviews with Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) champions involved in implementation across the 8 VAMCs. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. RESULTS: Feedback from ASP providers suggests prescribers had mixed reviews on the note template, but overall liked the process and deemed it to be straightforward. Many valued the algorithm, indicating it was helpful in both thinking about antibiotics prior to initiation, and identification of appropriate antibiotics. Barriers included staffing (e.g., rotating residents/turnover), surgery service, information technology (IT) support, COVID-19, and the need to remind providers to use the template. Facilitators consisted of strong stewardship, local champions (e.g., ID Fellow), medicine service, and SSTOP data feedback reports. Recommendations largely centered on improvements to the note template usability and to SSTOP feedback reports (e.g., inclusion of patient/provider-level data). CONCLUSION: Overall, the SSTOP note templates were considered acceptable and straightforward. By guiding providers to prescribe more appropriate antibiotics, they act as influencers for practice change, and may strengthen provider/ASP relations. Plans for continued utilization of the note templates after the project concludes suggest SSTOP may serve as a way to achieve sustainable promotion of antibiotic use improvements.

So far, chemotherapy has not been totally effective for treatment of the disease. The immunomodulation and tissue repairing capability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ease of isolation, detection and in-vitro culture, have encouraged the biologists to use MSCs for cell therapy in different infections such as cutaneous leishmaniasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS 6-8 week BALB/c mice were infected with L. major and divided into four groups and treated with MSCs, Glucantime, Glucantime + MSCs and PBS. The regression of the lesions, potency of macrophages for phagocytosis, proliferation of immune cells against Leishmania soluble antigen, reduction of spleen parasite burden and healing of the lesions were evaluated on days 10, 20 and 30 of treatment. RESULT The results indicated that the mice intralesionally injected with MSCs showed a significant regression in the lesions produced by L. major by day 30. Proliferation of the splenocytes stimulated with SLA (Soluble Leishmania Antigen) in-vitro in MSC treated mice on day 20 was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The potency of phagocytosis in macrophages of the mice treated with MSCs was significantly higher by day 30 and healing of the lesions in this group of mice showed more progress in histopathological examinations.

It has infected millions of people worldwide. The trajectory of this disease continues to progress in some areas of the United States and worldwide. The Institute for Health Metrics now predicts a resurgence of infections in the fall of 2020. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 includes an inflammatory phase with either resolution or the potential to accelerate to a cytokine storm, characterized by high interleukin (IL)-6 and other inflammatory markers. COVID-19 is a condition without a gold-standard treatment. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir in severe cases of COVID-19, which shortened the recovery time in hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection in one study.

Recent studies indicate that vaccine-induced humoral immunity may not be long-lasting and is weaker in the elderly. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: At the turn of June and July 2021, 653 seniors (426 women and 197 men with a mean age of 74 years) were tested once for antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 in the South Moravian Region between 9 and 161 days after the second dose of vaccine (558 Pfizer -BioNTech, 28 Moderna, 36 AstraZeneca, 1 Johnson & Johnson). Samples of the whole capillary blood were tested in two point-of-care iCHROMA II immunofluorescence assays: (1) COVID-19 Ab against mix of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins (IgM Ab, IgG Ab) and (2) COVID-19 nAb against S1-RBD protein (nAb). Results were analysed in relation to gender, age, vaccine type, and past COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Our results show high variability in the antibody response but indicate an overall relatively weak and decreasing antibody response in the first six months after vaccination. Only 58.4% (95% CI: 54.6-62.3) of subjects had virus neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The level of nAb decreased with time from vaccination - at post-vaccination months 4 and 5, nAb were only detected in 41.1% (95% CI: 30.9-51.3) and 15.4% (95% CI: 1.5-29.3) of subjects, respectively. Vaccinees in older age groups, those vaccinated with AstraZeneca, and naive individuals showed a lower antibody response. CONCLUSION: The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the elderly was relatively weak and decreased in the first six months after vaccination. Although humoral immunity is complex and cellular immune memory is a key element of the humoral response after exposure to the wild virus, our results suggest that vaccine-induced humoral immunity may not be long-lasting. The oldest koncenage groups who have not acquired natural SARS-CoV-2 infection are particularly at risk. This finding is relevant for adjusting vaccination strategies in selected population groups to include a booster dose. More research into the antibody response and the complex immune response after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 over longer time is needed.","output":"Decreasing neutralization antibody levels following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly: an observational study in Southern Moravia, Czech Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study is aimed at evaluating changes in metrics of glucose control in home-isolated patients with type 1 diabetes and COVID-19 using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. METHODS: We included adults aged 18C45 years with type 1 diabetes, using CGM, followed by telemedicine at a Southern Italian University Hospital. Thirty-two home-quarantined subjects with SARS-CoV-2 positive swab constituted the COVID-19 group. Thirty age-matched diabetic individuals without COVID-19 formed the control group.

Participants were asked baseline program information, the number of positions and interview invites offered, and their perspectives on various aspects of the virtual interview process. RESULTS: Sixty-two (75.6%) PDs completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent reported increasing the number of interview offers per available residency spot. On a five-point Likert scale (1, not well at all; 5, extremely well), PDs showed no significant differences in their ability judge an applicants professionalism (3.1  1.1), interpersonal and communication skills (3.2  1.1), and fit with their program (2.9  0.9) during virtual interviews (P = 0.360).

This is the first report of hydrolytically stable haptenic surrogates of heroin with the attachment site at the C1 position in the 4,5-epoxymorophinan nucleus. We prepared respective tetanus toxoid (TT)Chapten conjugates as heroin vaccine immunogens and evaluated their efficacy in vivo. We showed that all TTChapten conjugates induced high antibody endpoint titers against the targets but only haptens 2 and 3 can induce protective effects against heroin in vivo. The epimeric analogues of these haptens, 1 and 4, failed to protect mice from the effects of heroin. We also showed that the in vivo efficacy is consistent with the results of the in vitro drug sequestration assay. Attachment of the linker at the C1 position induced antibodies with weak binding to the target drugs. Only TT-2 and TT-3 yielded antibodies that bound heroin and 6-acetyl morphine. None of the TTChapten conjugates induced antibodies that cross-reacted with morphine, methadone, naloxone, or naltrexone, and only TT-3 interacted weakly with buprenorphine, and that subtle structural difference, especially at the C6 position, can vastly alter the specificity of the induced antibodies.

Eligibility Criteria: We included studies that included formulas within San Yao San Fang with or without Western interventions against Western interventions. Main results: We included 7 studies involving 532 patients.

Nowcast approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmissionthat future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported casesand are optimized to one or two applications, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting software package while investigating the features of each approach that contribute to good or poor performance. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package NobBS) for widespread application and provide practical guidance on implementation.","output":"Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing: A flexible, generalizable model for real-time epidemic tracking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, live video streaming platforms for video games have been gaining popularity.

It is essential to characterise the different forms of participation in services such as Twitch to evaluate the phenomenon and reflect on its advantages and disadvantages. To that end, a survey was carried out of 580 young people and adolescents aged between 14 and 24. The aim of this study is thus to explore the uptake of these platforms, as well as identify user groups, distinguish between different motivations, and address the associated benefits and harms. Applying a methodology based on factor analysis and cluster analysis, user profiles were characterised according to their specific features, gaming/viewing hours, self-perception of their skill level as a player, devices used, and type or genre of video game. Four subgroups of gamers/viewers were thus identified: casual, social, hobby, and problematic. The results showed that older users and female users feature more prominently in the first two groups, as do those spending less time on video games and live streaming platforms. Conversely, in the hobby and problematic groups, we observe just the opposite.

It is a challenge for diagnostic laboratories in non-endemic countries to provide reliable results, as experience of staff is often limited to only a few cases per year. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the fully automated Sysmex XN-31 malaria analyzer in a routine diagnostic setting in a non-endemic region was evaluated. METHODS: Samples from 112 patients suspected for malaria were examined by the Sysmex XN-31 analyzer to determine the absolute count of malaria-infected red blood cells count (MI-RBC/L). Microscopic examination of both Quantitative Buffy Coat capillary tubes and thick and thin blood films were used as reference methods. Limits of blank (LoB), detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) were investigated using an in vitro Plasmodium falciparum culture. Nine hundred twenty samples of patients with RBC abnormalities were included to determine which RBC abnormalities trigger indeterminate or false positive results. RESULTS: No false positive nor false negative results were obtained for the examined patient samples suspected for malaria. For 3% of samples an indeterminate result by the XN-31 was obtained. The Passing-Bablok regression line for diagnostic accuracy of the parasitaemia was y = 39.75 + 0.7892  showing a positive bias of about 21% when comparing the MI-RBC results to microscopy. The LoB, LoD and LoQ were calculated to be 4.7, 5.9, and 19.0 infected RBC/L, respectively. From the 920 abnormal RBC samples collected, 4.6% resulted in a false positive MI-RBC result and almost half of the samples produced indeterminate results. These results were related to increases in nucleated red blood cells, reticulocytes and other abnormal RBC morphologies such as sickle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, the XN-31 is a fast and reliable screening method in the detection and quantification of Plasmodium species in patients However, if an abnormal red blood cell morphology is present, the results of the XN-31 should be interpreted with caution as false positive results can be caused by interfering abnormal erythrocytes.","output":"Fast detection and quantification of Plasmodium species infected erythrocytes in a non-endemic region by using the Sysmex XN-31 analyzer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to empirically examine gender-based differences of contagious negative emotions, notable psychological distress, and mental health burden during the COVID-19 outbreak Building my argument by drawing on data collected from APA, Chapman University, Ginger, GMU/CCCC, HHD, ONS, Pew Research Center, Rek et al (2020), Statista, the University of Melbourne, and YPCCC, I performed analyses and made estimates regarding prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic The structural equation modeling technique was used to test the research model","output":"Gender-based Differences of Contagious Negative Emotions, Notable Psychological Distress, and Mental Health Burden during the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The national COVID-19 conversation in the US has mostly focused on urban areas, without sufficient examination of another geography with large vulnerable populations: the suburbs.

The primary aim was to investigate clinical variables for predicting lithotripsy assistance during transcystic bile duct exploration by laparoendoscopy (PRE-LABEL). Secondary aims were to develop and validate a predictive scoring tool. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients who underwent transcystic LCBDE at a single centre in the UK was performed to investigate clinical variables for PRE-LABEL and develop a scoring tool (ABCdE score: age, bilirubin, CBD diameter, ERCP). Binary logistic regression was used to investigate which independent variables (predictors) were associated with lithotripsy assistance during transcystic LCBDE. The ABCdE score was applied to both UK and Spain patient cohorts to determine its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. RESULTS From 8 pre-operative clinical variables analysed, age  40 years, bilirubin > two-times upper limit of normal, CBD diameter  10 mm and ERCP failure of stone extraction were independent predictors of requiring lithotripsy during transcystic LCBDE and formed the ABCdE score. The hazard ratios were 2.87, 3.79, 2.78 and 10.06, respectively. An ABCdE score  2 resulted in 71% sensitivity, 81% specificity and 79% accuracy in predicting lithotripsy during LCBDE (UK cohort). Validation using a contemporary cohort from Spain yielded similar sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the only study to date reporting independent predictors of requiring lithotripsy assistance during transcystic LCBDE. ABCdE score  2 can highlight patients that may require lithotripsy in order to avoid failure of transcystic LCBDE and therefore avoid choledochotomy or post-operative ERCP.","output":"The ABCdE score for PREdicting Lithotripsy Assistance during transcystic Bile duct Exploration by Laparoendoscopy (PRE-LABEL)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we concentrate on distributed online convex optimization problems over multiagent systems, where the communication between nodes is represented by a class of directed graphs that are time varying and uniformly strongly connected. This problem is in bandit feedback, in the sense that at each time only the cost function value at the committed point is revealed to each node. Then, nodes update their decisions by exchanging information with their neighbors only. To deal with Lipschitz continuous and strongly convex cost functions, a distributed online convex optimization algorithm that achieves sublinear individual regret for every node is developed. The algorithm is built on the algorithm called the push-sum scheme that releases the request of doubly stochastic weight matrices, and the one-point gradient estimator that requires the function value at only one point at every iteration, instead of the gradient information of loss function. The expected regret of our proposed algorithm scales as O ( T2/3 ln2/3(T) ), and T is the number of iterations. To validate the performance of the algorithm developed in this article, we give a simulation of a common numerical example.","output":"Push-Sum Distributed Online Optimization With Bandit Feedback."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the treatment for glioblastoma (GBM), treatment modalities, such as bevacizumab (BEV) and carmustine wafers implants have been approved in Japan since 2013. However, it is unclear whether such a trend in treatment complexity can accelerate treatment centralization. The aim of this study was to reveal the current trend in the treatment of GBM in Japan. METHODS We used diagnostic procedure combination (DPC) database to analyze the data of 1,774 patients from 305 institutions between April 2016 and March 2019. To analyze the situations associated with first-line BEV use during concurrent TMZ (temozolomide)-radiotherapy, we compared TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups. RESULTS Of the 1,774 patients with GBM, tumor removal by craniotomy was performed in 1,572 (88.6%) patients, and stereotactic biopsy was performed in 156 (8.8%) patients. A total of 1,229 (69.3%) patients underwent radiotherapy, and 1,287 (72.5%) patients underwent chemotherapy. TMZ alone was administered to 878 (68.2%) and TMZ combined with BEV in 381 (29.6%) patients. In the TMZ-BEV group, as compared to the TMZ-alone group, the rate of discharge to home was significantly lower (P = 0.0044), and the rate of stereotactic biopsy was significantly higher (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of patients between the TMZ alone and TMZ-BEV groups depending on the scale of institution (P = 0.1240). CONCLUSION First-line BEV administration seems to be selected properly regardless of the institutional scale. This Japan-wide study of GBM treatment revealed that high level and newly introduced treatments have been steadily generalized in Japanese institutions.","output":"Current trend in treatment of glioblastoma in Japan: a national survey using the diagnostic procedure combination database (J-ASPECT study-glioblastoma)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various countries across the globe have been affected by different COVID-19 waves at different points in time and with varying levels of virulence. With the backdrop of the two COVID-19 waves that broke out in Delhi, this study examines the variations in the concentrations of criteria pollutants, air quality, and meteorological variables across the waves and their influence on COVID-19 morbidity/mortality. Descriptive statistics, violin plots, and Spearman rank correlation tests were employed to assess the variations in environmental parameters and investigate their associations with COVID-19 incidence under the two waves. The susceptible-infected-recovered model and multiple linear regression were used to assess the wave-wise basic reproduction number (R0) and infection spreading trajectory of the virus. Our results show that the first wave in Delhi had three successive peaks and valleys, and the first peak of the second wave was the tallest, indicating the severity of per-day infection cases. During the analysed period (April 2020 and April 2021), concentrations of criteria pollutants varied across the waves, and air pollution was substantially higher during the second wave. In addition, the results revealed that during the second wave, NO(2) maintained a significant negative relationship with COVID-19 (cases per day), while SO(2) had a negative relationship with COVID-19 (cumulative cases) during the first wave. Our results also show a significant positive association of O(3) with COVID-19 deaths during the first wave and cumulative cases and deaths during the second wave. The study indicates that a higher relative humidity in Delhi had a negative relation with COVID-19 cumulative cases and mortality during the first wave. The study confirms that the estimated R0 was marginally different during the two waves, and the spread of COVID-19 new cases followed a cubic growth trajectory.

For those who survived COVID-19, post-COVID cardiac damage poses a major threat for the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Currently, the number of COVID-related cases and deaths are increasing in Latin America, where a major COVID comorbidity is Chagas heart disease (caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi). Here, we investigated the effect of T. cruzi infection on the pathogenesis and severity of CoV2 infection and, conversely, the effect of CoV2 infection on heart pathology during coinfection. Methodology/findings We used transgenic human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (huACE2) mice infected with CoV2, T. cruzi, or coinfected with both in this study. Our study shows for the first time that white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as a reservoir for CoV2 and the persistence of CoV2 in WAT alters adipose tissue morphology and adipocyte physiology. Our data demonstrate a correlation between the loss of fat cells and the pulmonary adipogenic signaling (via adiponectin isomers) and pathology in CoV2 infection. The viral load in the lungs is inversely proportional to the viral load in WAT, which differs between male and female mice. Our findings also suggest that adiponectin-PPAR signaling may differently regulate Chagas cardiomyopathy in coinfected males and females. Conclusion We conclude that adipogenic signaling may play important roles in cardio-pulmonary pathogenesis during CoV2 infection and T. cruzi coinfection. The levels of adiponectin isomers differ between male and female mice during CoV2 infection and coinfection with T. cruzi, which may differently regulate inflammation, viral load, and pathology in the lungs of both the sexes. Our findings are in line with other clinical observations that reported that males are more susceptible to COVID-19 than females and suffer greater pulmonary damage.","output":"Sex differences in cardio-pulmonary pathology of SARS-CoV2 infected and Trypanosoma cruzi co-infected mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During a public health emergency, social media is a major conduit or vector for spreading health misinformation. Understanding the characteristics of health misinformation can be a premise for rebuking and purposefully correcting such misinformation on social media. Methods: Using samples of Chinas misinformation on social media related to the COVID-19 outbreak (N=547), the objective of this article was to illustrate the characteristics of said misinformation on social media in China by descriptive analysis, including the typology, the most-mentioned information, and a developmental timeline. Results: The results reveal that misinformation related to preventive and therapeutic methods is the most-mentioned type. Other types of misinformation associated with peoples daily lives are also widespread. Moreover, cultural and social beliefs have an impact on the perception and propaganda of misinformation, and changes in the crisis situation are relevant to the type variance of misinformation. Conclusion: Following research results, strategies of health communication for managing misinformation on social media are given, such as credible sources and expert sources. Also, traditional beliefs or perceptions play the vital role in health communication. To sum up, combating misinformation on social media is likely not a single effort to correct misinformation or to prevent its spread.

This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too.

Virological surveillance was undertaken in reference laboratories of the seven French Defence Zones. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report results of virological analyses performed in the Public Hospitals of Marseille during the first months of the outbreak. (i) Nasal swabs were tested using rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) and two RT-PCR assays. Epidemiological characteristics of the 99 first suspected cases were analyzed, including detection of influenza virus and 18 other respiratory viruses. During three months, a total of 1,815 patients were tested (including 236 patients infected H1N1sw virus) and distribution in age groups and results of RIDT were analyzed. (ii) 600 sera received before April 2009 and randomly selected from in-patients were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay for antibody to the novel H1N1sw virus. (iii) One early (May 2009) and one late (July 2009) viral isolates were characterized by sequencing the complete hemagglutinine and neuraminidase genes. (iiii) Epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of cases that occurred in July 2009 in a summer camp were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents new virological and epidemiological data regarding infection by the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Europe. Distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. The first seroprevalence data made available for a European population suggest a previous exposure of individuals over 40 years old to influenza viruses antigenically related to the pandemic (H1N1)-2009 virus. Genomic analysis indicates that strains harbouring a new amino-acid pattern in the neuraminidase gene appeared secondarily and tended to supplant the first strains. Finally, in contrast with previous reports, our data support the use of RIDT for the detection of infection in children, especially in the context of the investigation of grouped cases.","output":"Novel Virus Influenza A (H1N1sw) in South-Eastern France, April-August 2009"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeFollowing recent scholarship promoting the study of sports-related texts as a vehicle for examining sociopolitical issues, this study aims to identify methods and materials used to facilitate the extended exploration of sociopolitical issues in a secondary sports literature class and to establish how students describe their experiences taking up such activities.Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative study stems from a greater investigation into the teaching of secondary sports literature classes.

Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3-5 exonuclease activity (ExoN) that likely functions in RNA proofreading. In this study, we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of SARS-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged, and immunocompromised mouse models of human SARS. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo.

Two case studies of interest from Nizamuddin and Dharavi provide contrasting pictures of the success in curbing spread. METHODS: A cluster analysis of the worst affected districts in India provides insight about the similarities between them. The effects of public health interventions in flattening the curve in their respective states is studied using the individual contact SEIQHRF model, a stochastic individual compartment model which simulates disease prevalence in the susceptible, infected, recovered and fatal compartments. RESULTS: The clustering of hotspot districts provide homogeneous groups that can be discriminated in terms of number of cases and related covariates. The cluster analysis reveal that the distribution of number of COVID-19 hospitals in the districts does not correlate with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. From the SEIQHRF model for Nizamuddin we observe in the second phase the number of infected individuals had seen a multitudinous increase in the states where Nizamuddin attendees returned, increasing the risk of the disease spread. However, the simulations reveal that implementing administrative interventions, flatten the curve. In Dharavi, through tracing, tracking, testing and treating, massive breakout of COVID-19 was brought under control. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster analysis performed on the districts reveal homogeneous groups of districts that can be ranked based on the burden placed on the healthcare system in terms of number of confirmed cases, population density and number of hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 treatment.

Due to the lack of high-quality evidence, it is difficult to draw a conclusion about optimal anti-shivering medication. The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to analyze and evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of ketamine for preventing postanesthetic shivering. METHODS We searched the following databases: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails for randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome observed was the difference of the incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering between ketamine group and placebo group. The secondary outcomes were the sedation score and incidence of the side effects caused by ketamine and any other drugs utilized in the studies. RESULTS In this meta-analysis, we analyzed a total of 16 trials including 1485 patients. Ketamine reduced the incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering compared to a placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06 to 0.26, P<0.01). Regarding side effects, there was no evident variability of the incidence of nausea and vomiting. Usage of ketamine was associated with a lower rate of hypotension and bradycardia when compared to a placebo. Hallucinations were more frequently observed in patients who received higher doses of ketamine.

The importance of public health surveillance systems to monitor the spread and impact of COVID-19 has been well demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to describe the development and effectiveness of a real-time public health syndromic surveillance system (ACES Pandemic Tracker) as an early warning system and to provide situational awareness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used hospital admissions data from the Acute Care Enhanced Surveillance (ACES) system to collect data on pre-defined groupings of symptoms (syndromes of interest; SOI) that may be related to COVID-19 from 131 hospitals across Ontario. To evaluate which SOI for suspected COVID-19 admissions were best correlated with laboratory confirmed admissions, laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions data were collected from the Ontario Ministry of Health. Correlations and time-series lag analysis between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions were calculated. Data used for analyses covered the period between March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020, ACES Pandemic Tracker identified 22,075 suspected COVID-19 hospital admissions (150 per 100,000 population) in Ontario. After correlation analysis, we found laboratory-confirmed hospital admissions for COVID-19 were strongly and significantly correlated with suspected COVID-19 hospital admissions when SOI were included (Spearmans rho = 0.617) and suspected COVID-19 admissions when SOI were excluded (Spearmans rho = 0.867). Weak to moderate significant correlations were found among individual SOI. Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions lagged in reporting by 3 days compared with suspected COVID-19 admissions when SOI were excluded.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were collected at a single time-point from patients at an urban, public hospital August - November 2020 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, viral culture, and anti-Spike pan-Ig antibody testing. Participant demographics and symptoms were collected through interview. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to identify associations between RT-PCR and serology results with presence of viable virus and frequency of symptoms. RESULTS: Among 592 participants, 129 (21.8%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serology. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was strongly associated with lack of viable virus (p-value=0.016). COVID-19 symptom frequency was similar for patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative and patients testing RT-PCR positive/seropositive. Patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative reported headaches, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting at rates not statistically significantly different from those testing RT-PCR negative/seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: While patients testing SARS-CoV-2 seropositive were unlikely to test positive for viable virus and were therefore low-risk for forward transmission, COVID-19 symptoms were common.

We aimed to describe the core components of the PPC role, the process of implementing the role, and the factors that hindered or facilitated role implementation. METHODS: An exploratory case study was undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually with stakeholders including PPC, managers, and front-line health care professionals (HCP). A directed approach to qualitative content analysis consistent with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the analytic process. Inductive analyses and three stages of thematic synthesis were also conducted. RESULTS: Four PPC, 3 managers, and 6 HCP were interviewed. The core components of the PPC role consisted of (a) acting as knowledge experts and educators, (b) problem-solving for complex patient care issues, (c) conducting crisis management, and (d) acting as a resource to management, HCP, and families. Facilitators for successful implementation included access to external information, a supportive organizational context and culture, dedicated time and resources, and leadership support. Lack of clarity of role definition, insufficient time, pandemic uncertainty and fatigue, inability to change infrastructure, and access to external information hindered implementation. CONCLUSION: The PPC role was successfully implemented within a crisis context. Key barriers (role clarity, time, resources) and facilitators (organizational and leadership support) need to be considered when implementing the PPC role in practice. Future studies are needed to determine the intervention effectiveness of the champion role in changing HCP behavior and health outcomes and further examine implementation processes and mechanisms.","output":"An exploratory case study investigating the implementation of a novel knowledge translation strategy in a pandemic: the Pandemic Practice Champion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim is to study the serum protein fingerprint of patients with laryngeal carcinoma (LC) and to screen for protein molecules closely related to LC during the onset and progression of the disease with surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS).

Q10 protein chips and PBSII-C protein chips reader (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc.) were used. The protein fingerprint expression of all the Serum samples and the resulting profiles between cancer and non-cancer groups were analyzed with Biomarker Wizard system.

Since most public parks were closed, community parks within gated residential areas became the most important green space in Chinese cities, and the use of such space might help to reduce the residents stress levels. This study aimed to investigate to what extent urban residents in China used community parks, engaged in outdoor activity during the lockdown period (23 JanuaryC8 April 2020) and if the use of such spaces helped to reduce their stress levels. An online questionnaire survey (n = 1342) was carried out from 23 March to 23 April 2020. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to analyse the association between community park use, outdoor activity, willingness to engage in outdoor activity, and stress level. All results have been further analysed by two-sampled t-test to explore the difference between young and old age groups. We found that the overall self-reported stress level of the respondents was relatively moderate during the lockdown period. Respondents had generally reduced their use of community parks and engagement in outdoor activity. There was no significant association between stress level and the use of community parks or the engagement in outdoor activities. However, we found that older people showed much lower stress levels, used community parks more frequently, and engaged in more outdoor activities than younger adults. The findings suggest that outdoor activities and spatial characteristics in urban China differ from Western studies and advance the need to integrate the stress management role of community parks with urban green space policy to optimise the use of community parks blended in with everyday life, particularly during the lockdown period.","output":"Use of Urban Residential Community Parks for Stress Management During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the ratio of the mass in the inflection point over asymptotic mass for 81 nestlings of blue tits and great tits from an urban parkland in Warsaw, Poland (growth data from literature).

Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.","output":"The effect of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness and task performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID-19 effected the global business sector include the tourism industry.

METHODS The scoping review followed the York framework and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase and CINAHL were searched using key terms. Screening and selection were conducted by two independent reviewers. A standardized, pilot-tested form was used for extracting data, which were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS The review included 211 studies, originating from 29 countries, with the USA (18.8%) and China (12.26%) as leading contributors. Thirty-four different terms for structural endplate defects were reported, but were never defined in most studies (65%). Of the 34 different terms used, some appeared to represent the same phenomenon, while the same terms were occasionally defined differently between studies. Schmorl's nodes were most commonly investigated (n = 99 studies) and defined similarly across studies, with the main difference relating to whether the indentation (node) was required to have a sclerotic margin. There were also similarities in definitions for endplate sclerosis. However, there was great variability in the definitions of other terms, such as lesions, irregularities, abnormalities, erosions and changes. CONCLUSION With the possible exception of Schmorl's nodes, we lack a common language for effectively communicating structural endplate findings.

To realize further benefits of this minimal invasive procedure and to offer less postoperative pain, shorter recovery time, reduced complications, and improved cosmetic results, attempts are being made to minimize the number of necessary skin incisions for trocar positioning. One method is to use only one port for laparoscopic access to perform diverticular-related elective sigmoidectomies. METHODS Between 7 July and 4 August 2009, 10 consecutive patients were referred for partial left colon resection due to multiple episodes of diverticulitis. In all cases, access to the abdomen was achieved through a 2- to 2.5-cm single incision via the umbilicus followed by insertion of the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS?) port system. Outcomes such as change in the procedural method, operative time, postoperative complications, and length of stay were recorded. RESULTS Of the 10 consecutive sigmoidectomies, 9 were performed successfully with the SILS? procedure using only one incision in the umbilicus. No mortalities or major complications were noted. The median operating time was 120 min, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. CONCLUSION As an alternative to the standard laparoscopic procedure, single-incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy via the umbilicus is technically feasible and effective. This attractive procedure aims to increase the patient's comfort further after abdominal surgery.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery: a promising approach to sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the continued scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still seeking out-of-the-box solutions to break its transmission cycle and contain the pandemic. There are different transmission routes for viruses, including indirect transmission via surfaces. To this end, we used two relevant viruses in our study. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the pandemic and human norovirus (HuNV), both known to be transmitted via surfaces. Several nanoformulations have shown attempts to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. However, a rigorous, similar inactivation scheme to inactivate the cords of two tedious viruses (SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant and HuNV) is lacking. The present study demonstrates the inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant and the decrease in the murine norovirus (MNV, a surrogate to HuNV) load after only one minute of contact to surfaces including copperCsilver (CuCAg) nanocomposites. We thoroughly examined the physicochemical characteristics of such plated surfaces using diverse microscopy tools and found that Cu was the dominanting element in the tested three different surfaces (~56, ~59, and ~48 wt%, respectively), hence likely playing the major role of Alpha and MNV inactivation followed by the Ag content (~28, ~13, and ~11 wt%, respectively). These findings suggest that the administration of such surfaces within highly congested places (e.g., schools, public transportations, public toilets, and hospital and live-stock reservoirs) could break the SARS-CoV-2 and HuNV transmission.

The authors reviewed a spectrum of published disaster response models addressing public health or health care delivery, focusing in particular on the type of disaster and response decisions considered, decision makers targeted, choice of outcomes evaluated, modeling methodology, and reporting format. They developed initial recommendations for best practices for creating and reporting such models and refined these guidelines after soliciting feedback from response modeling experts and from members of the Society for Medical Decision Making. RESULTS . The authors propose 6 recommendations for model construction and reporting, inspired by the most exemplary models: health sector disaster response models should address real-world problems, be designed for maximum usability by response planners, strike the appropriate balance between simplicity and complexity, include appropriate outcomes that extend beyond those considered in traditional cost-effectiveness analyses, and be designed to evaluate the many uncertainties inherent in disaster response. Finally, good model reporting is particularly critical for disaster response models. CONCLUSIONS . Quantitative models are critical tools for planning effective health sector responses to disasters.

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts for studies that addressed physical activity/exercise and cognition in people with HIV. Authors reviewed full texts to identify articles that met our inclusion criteria. One author extracted the data, then we collated the results and summarized the characteristics of included studies.

METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings in 100 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Hubei Women & Children Healthcare Hospital (Guanggu District), of whom 22 patients died in hospital, and 78 patients survived. RESULTS: We found that age, lymphocyte count, and total bilirubin concentration were an independent prognostic factor for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Of particular importance, we observed a significant elevation of myocardium injury biomarkers, including CK-MB, high-sensitivity cardiac troponini I (hs-cTnI), and Mb, in the non-survivor group. These myocardium injury biomarkers appeared to correlate with the time of survival, and two multivariate models have suggested hs-cTnI was a novel prognostic factor with a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 84.9%.

Single-vessel PCI was performed in 3,137 patients (87%): 2,174 (69%) had multiple complex plaques and 963 (31%) had a single complex plaque. Compared with those with a single complex plaque, patients with multiple complex plaques were older (p <0.0001) and had more co-morbidities. The presence of multiple complex plaques was an independent predictor of 3-year MACE (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.98, p <0.0001), and death alone (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.70, p = 0.03).

Mind-body medicine (MBM) interventions have shown success for a variety of conditions, and training in MBM has been associated with decreased burnout and improved professional satisfaction.8 We piloted MBM collaborative visits led by faculty physicians and facilitated by medical learners. We then assessed their efficacy treating patients with complex needs. Methods We conducted a series of eight weekly 2.5-hour MBM interventions for groups of five to eight participants (52 in total) with chronic health conditions. Matched-pair hypothesis t tests analyzed nine health indicators measured pre- and postintervention: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as well as participants' perceived mental and physical health, stress and stress coping, agency, and capacity to connect with others. We made conservative calculations of effect size using Hedges' g. Results Participants showed significant, large improvements in their PHQ-9 scores ( P<.005, g=0.807), and moderate improvements in ability to cope with stress (P<.005, g=0.502), sense of control over their diagnoses (P<.05, g=0.413), and perceived overall mental health (P<.05, g=0.424). Other outcomes were nonsignificant, including a small improvement in participants' perceived overall health ( P=.071, g=0.286). Conclusions Patients completing the intervention enjoyed largely improved outcomes despite unchanged stress at work and home.

The purpose of this paper was to find out the impact of migrant population on the epidemic, aiming to provide data support and suggestions for control measures in various epidemic areas. Generalized additive model was utilized to model the relationship between migrant population and the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. The difference of spatial distribution was analyzed through spatial autocorrelation and hot spot analysis. Generalized additive model demonstrated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases was positively correlated with migration index and population density. The predictive results showed that, if no travel restrictions are imposed on the migrant population as usual, this number of COVID-19 would have reached 27,483 (95% CI 16,074, 48,097; the actual number was 23,177). The increase in one city (Jian) would be 577.23% (95% CI 322.73%, 972.73%) compared with the real confirmed cases of COVID-19. The average increase in 73 cities was 85.53% (95% CI 19.53%, 189.81%). Among the migration destinations, the number of cases in cities of Hubei province, Chongqing, and Beijing was relatively high, and there were large-scale high-prevalence clusters in eastern Hubei province. Without restrictions on migration, the high prevalence areas in Hubei province and its surrounding areas will be further expanded. The reduced population mobility and population density can greatly slow down the spread of the epidemic. All epidemic areas should suspend the transportation between cities, strictly control the population travel, and decrease the population density, so as to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.","output":"Comparative sequence analyses of a new mammalian reovirus genome and the mammalian reovirus S1 genes from six new serotype 2 human isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Co-delivery of chemotherapeutics in cancer treatment has been proven essential for overcoming multidrug resistance and improving the outcome of therapy.

Aggressive endovascular management has led to survival rates of 35-50%. We report the largest series of endovascular reconstruction of occluded dominant vertebral arteries prior to basilar thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective database since August 2010 of all neuroendovascular interventions was mined for patients undergoing basilar artery thrombolysis from which a group with vertebral artery reconstruction was selected. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed for relevant clinical, technical, and outcome data. RESULTS From August 2010 to September 2012, six patients were identified who underwent vertebral reconstruction prior to basilar thrombectomy. Patients ranged in age from 42 to 57 years (mean 51 years). Mean time from symptoms until recanalization was approximately 6 h. Angiographic Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction IIB reconstitution of the basilar trunk was achieved in all cases. There were no technical complications. Two patients had care withdrawn secondary to massive completed brainstem infarction and poor neurological status post intervention. Three patients are now independent at 12, 14, and 31 months, respectively. One patient, after a follow-up of only 8 months, has achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 3. CONCLUSIONS Complete vertebral occlusion below a basilar thrombus can be recanalized prior to thrombectomy. In this case series, 100% of the acutely occluded vertebral arteries could be opened using either anterograde or retrograde access.

METHODS: In a single-blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT), participants were randomised to either receive access to the website or a waiting-list control. At baseline, post-intervention (week 4) and follow-up (week 8), measures of parental food allergy-related QoL, depression, anxiety, stress, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and self-efficacy were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 205 participants were randomised; 97% were females, 91% white and 78% educated  degree level, with a mean age of 38.95 years (SD = 6.89). 44.9% (n = 92) were retained at follow-up.

Since the transition, several modifications have been made to improve surveillance methods, and there is a growing body of data regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and preventability of VAEs. RECENT FINDINGS The VAE surveillance definition algorithm is based on objective criteria and includes three tiers: ventilator-associated conditions, infection-related ventilator-associated complications, and possible and probable VAP. VAE surveillance expands the purview of surveillance beyond pneumonia alone to include additional complications of mechanical ventilation. Most VAEs are caused by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. VAEs are associated with adverse outcomes including prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care and hospital length-of-stay, and higher mortality rates. Studies to date suggest that minimizing sedation and optimizing fluid management can reduce VAE rates.

There were statistically significant differences in fever numbers, WBC count, lymphocyte count, CRP, ALT, AST, albumin, LDH, SCr, D-dimer, and fibrinogen between the two groups based on the oxygenation index. CONCLUSIONS Age, WBC count, LDH, and SCr may be related to the duration of COVID-19 disease.

Objectives: To determine the frequency of detection of infectious agents in a population of hospitalized foals with diarrhea and to determine if detection of specific pathogens is associated with age, outcome, or clinicopathologic data. Animals: Two hundred and thirty\\\\three foals  10 months of age with diarrhea examined at a referral institution. Methods: Retrospective case series. Each foal was examined for Salmonella spp., viruses, Clostridium difficile toxins, Clostridium perfringens culture, C. perfringens enterotoxin, Cryptosporidium spp., and metazoan parasites in feces collected at admission or at the onset of diarrhea. Results: At least 1 infectious agent was detected in 122 foals (55%). Rotavirus was most frequently detected (20%) followed by C. perfringens (18%), Salmonella spp. (12%), and C. difficile (5%). Foals < 1 month of age were significantly more likely to be positive for C. perfringens (odds ratio [OR] = 15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5C66) or to have negative fecal diagnostic results (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7C5.2) than older foals.

We sought to characterize the current practice of ICM insertion procedures to evaluate the influence of prophylactic antibiotic administration on the occurrence of infections. METHODS We characterized insertion procedures and procedure-related infections from an ongoing multicenter registry (Reveal LINQ(TM) Registry). In order to accurately capture infections, only patients enrolled before or the day of insertion who also had a record of whether or not preoperative antibiotics were used were included in this analysis. Infections were defined based on the physician's assessment and reported upon occurrence. Patients were categorized into two analysis cohorts based on prophylactic antibiotic use. RESULTS We analyzed 375 patients from 14 U.S. centers (age 63.1  15.6 years; male 54.1%). Approximately two-thirds of patients (66.4%) did not receive any preprocedural antibiotics. The overall infection rate was 1.1% (0.3-2.7% confidence interval [CI]) and corresponded to four events. In the group that did not receive preprocedural antibiotics, there were two minor infections (0.8%, [0.1-2.9% CI]), whereas in the group receiving preprocedural antibiotics a serious and a minor infection occurred (1.6%, [0.2-5.6% CI]); this serious infection resulted in an explant.

As many cancer patients are recovering from COVID-19, there is an urgent need for reliable clinical information. Herein, we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma in which we were able to successfully resume chemotherapy after infection with SAR-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 38-year-old non-smoking Japanese woman with no significant medical history. She had fever on days 5 and 6 of her second course of adjuvant FEC therapy, and on day 7, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. She was hospitalized for 11 days. We resumed the therapy on day 25 after discharge, as she had no remaining clinical symptoms. The patient completed four courses of the initial chemotherapy without any major adverse events nor the recurrence of COVID-19, and subsequently completed four courses of docetaxel as her second regimen therapy.

However, COVID-19-related lockdown measures may have disrupted these support systems, with possible implications for mental health. Here, we use a cross-sectional analysis among individuals who gave birth at different stages of the pandemic to test (i) if instrumental support access in the form of help with household tasks, newborn care, and care for older children has varied temporally across the pandemic, and (ii) whether access to these forms of instrumental support is associated with lower postpartum depression scores. METHODS: This study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant persons in the United States. Participants completed postnatal surveys between April 30 C November 18, 2020 (n = 971). Logistic regression analysis tested whether birth timing during the pandemic was associated with odds of reported sustained instrumental support. Linear regression analyses assessed whether instrumental support was associated with lower depression scores as measured via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression survey. RESULTS: Participants who gave birth later in the pandemic were more likely to report that the pandemic had not affected the help they received with household work and newborn care (p < 0.001), while access to childcare for older children appeared to vary non-linearly throughout the pandemic. Additionally, respondents who reported that the pandemic had not impacted their childcare access or help received around the house displayed significantly lower depression scores compared to participants who reported pandemic-related disruptions to these support types (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The maintenance of postpartum instrumental support during the pandemic appears to be associated with better maternal mental health. Healthcare providers should therefore consider disrupted support systems as a risk factor for postpartum depression and ask patients how the pandemic has affected support access. Policymakers seeking to improve parental wellbeing should design strategies that reduce disease transmission, while facilitating safe interactions within immediate social networks (e.g., through investment in COVID-19 testing and contact tracing). Cumulatively, postpartum instrumental support represents a potential tool to protect against depression, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Associations between postpartum depression and assistance with household tasks and childcare during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from American mothers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several clinical trials started during the COVID-19 pandemic to discover effective therapeutics led to identifying a few candidates from the major clinical trials.

Antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa pose unwavering and increasing threats. Antimicrobial stewardship has been a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a majority of those hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection given antibiotics as a safeguard against secondary bacterial infection. This increased usage, along with increased handling of sanitizers and disinfectants globally, may further accelerate the development and spread of cross-resistance to antibiotics. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the primary causative agent of morbidity and mortality in people with the life-shortening genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Prolonged periods of selective pressure, associated with extended antibiotic treatment and the actions of host immune effectors, results in widespread adaptive and acquired resistance in P. aeruginosa found colonizing the lungs of people with CF. This review discusses the arsenal of resistance mechanisms utilized by P. aeruginosa, how these operate under high-stress environments such as the CF lung and how their interconnectedness can result in resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance mechanisms will be described, with a focus on how each layer of resistance can serve as a building block, contributing to multi-tiered resistance to antimicrobial activity. Recent progress in the development of anti-resistance adjuvant therapies, targeting one or more of these building blocks, should lead to novel strategies for combatting multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy holds great promise, not least because resistance against such therapeutics is predicted to be rare. The non-bactericidal nature of anti-resistance adjuvants reduce the selective pressures that drive resistance. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy may also be advantageous in facilitating efficacious use of traditional antimicrobials, through enhanced penetration of the antibiotic into the bacterial cell. Promising anti-resistance adjuvant therapeutics and targets will be described, and key remaining challenges highlighted. As antimicrobial stewardship becomes more challenging in an era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and global conflict, innovation in antibiotic adjuvant therapy can play an important role in extending the shelf-life of our existing antimicrobial therapeutic agents.","output":"The Building Blocks of Antimicrobial Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Implications for Current Resistance-Breaking Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: An increasing number of patients are voicing their opinions and expectations about the quality of care in online forums and on physician rating websites (PRWs). This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. RESULTS: According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs.

Here, we generated 649 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from infected patients in New Zealand with samples collected between 26 February and 22 May 2020, representing 56% of all confirmed cases in this time period. Despite its remoteness, the viruses imported into New Zealand represented nearly all of the genomic diversity sequenced from the global virus population. The proportion of D614G variants in the virus spike protein increased over time due to an increase in their importation frequency, rather than selection within New Zealand. These data also helped to quantify the effectiveness of public health interventions. For example, the effective reproductive number, Re, of New Zealand's largest cluster decreased from 7 to 0.2 within the first week of lockdown. Similarly, only 19% of virus introductions into New Zealand resulted in a transmission lineage of more than one additional case. Most of the cases that resulted in a transmission lineage originated from North America, rather than from Asia where the virus first emerged or from the nearest geographical neighbour, Australia.

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia compromises the clearance of invading pathogens by impairing macrophage phagocytosis. Previously, we have shown that the exposure of mice to hyperoxia induces the release of the nuclear protein high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) into the pulmonary airways. Furthermore, extracellular HMGB1 impairs macrophage phagocytosis and increases the mortality of mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The aim of this study was to determine whether GTS-21 (3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene) anabaseine), an 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) agonist, could (1) inhibit hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 release into the airways; (2) enhance macrophage phagocytosis and (3) increase bacterial clearance from the lungs in a mouse model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. METHOD: GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg) or saline were administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice that were exposed to hyperoxia ( 99% O(2)) and subsequently challenged with PA. RESULTS: The systemic administration of 4 mg/kg i.p. of GTS-21 significantly increased bacterial clearance, decreased acute lung injury and decreased accumulation of airway HMGB1 compared to the saline control. To determine the mechanism of action of GTS-21, RAW 264.7 cells, a macrophage-like cell line, were incubated with different concentrations of GTS-21 in the presence of 95% O(2). The phagocytic activity of macrophages was significantly increased by GTS-21 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, GTS-21 significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic translocation and release of HMGB1 from RAW 264.7 cells and attenuated hyperoxia-induced NF-B activation in macrophages and mouse lungs exposed to hyperoxia and infected with PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that GTS-21 is efficacious in improving bacterial clearance and reducing acute lung injury via enhancing macrophage function by inhibiting the release of nuclear HMGB1. Therefore, the 7nAChR represents a possible pharmacological target to improve the clinical outcome of patients on ventilators by augmenting host defense against bacterial infections.","output":"The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist GTS-21 improves bacterial clearance in mice by restoring hyperoxia-compromised macrophage function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health-care workers are thought to be highly exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, screening was offered to health-care workers in the Capital Region of Denmark, including medical, nursing, and other students who were associated with hospitals in the region. Screening included point-of-care tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Test results and participant characteristics were recorded. Results were compared with findings in blood donors in the Capital Region in the study period. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and April 23, 2020, we screened 29 295 health-care workers, of whom 28 792 (9828%) provided their test results. We identified 1163 (404% [95% CI 382C427]) seropositive health-care workers. Seroprevalence was higher in health-care workers than in blood donors (142 [304%] of 4672; risk ratio [RR] 133 [95% CI 112C158]; p<0001). Seroprevalence was higher in male health-care workers (331 [545%] of 6077) than in female health-care workers (832 [366%] of 22 715; RR 149 [131C168]; p<0001). Frontline health-care workers working in hospitals had a significantly higher seroprevalence (779 [455%] of 16 356) than health-care workers in other settings (384 [329%] of 11 657; RR 138 [122C156]; p<0001). Health-care workers working on dedicated COVID-19 wards (95 [719%] of 1321) had a significantly higher seroprevalence than other frontline health-care workers working in hospitals (696 [435%] of 15 983; RR 165 [134C203]; p<0001). 622 [535%] of 1163 seropositive participants reported symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom that was most strongly associated with seropositivity (377 [3239%] of 1164 participants with this symptom were seropositive vs 786 [284%] of 27 628 without this symptom; RR 1138 [1022C1268]). The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04356560. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of health-care workers with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was low but higher than in blood donors. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers was related to exposure to infected patients. More than half of seropositive health-care workers reported symptoms attributable to COVID-19.

However, outlets with different political slants, when talking about the same news story, usually emphasize various aspects and choose their language framing differently. This framing implicitly shows their biases and also affects the reader's opinion and understanding. Therefore, understanding the framing in the news stories is fundamental for realizing what kind of view the writer is conveying with each news story. In this paper, we describe methods for characterizing moral frames in the news. We capture the frames based on the Moral Foundation Theory. This theory is a psychological concept which explains how every kind of morality and opinion can be summarized and presented with five main dimensions.

DESIGN: Review of 913 randomly selected practice Web sites and associated social media accounts in January and August 2016. SETTING: Obstetric practice Web sites and associated social media accounts, United States of America. PARTICIPANTS: N/A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of obstetric practice Web sites and linked social media accounts providing Zika virus information. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent and 35% of obstetric practice Web sites had information posted about Zika virus in January 2016 and August 2016, respectively. Between the 2 time points, the proportion of practices posting Zika virus content on Facebook and Twitter declined (Facebook: 15% in January, 9% in August; Twitter: 12% in January, 8% in August). In August, the most frequently observed Zika virusCrelated content themes were the use of insect repellent (14%) and travel advisories (14%). At both time points, practices affiliated with large university hospitals were more likely to have posted information on Zika virus than independent OB/GYN-only practices: January: odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 5.68 (3.50-9.20); August: OR (95% CI) = 8.37 (5.31-13.17). Similarly, practices associated with nonuniversity hospitals were more likely to have posted information than independent OB/GYN-only practices: January: OR (95% CI) = 2.71 (1.88-3.92); August: OR (95% CI) = 6.75 (4.75-9.60). CONCLUSION: Obstetric care practices are not fully utilizing their practice Web sites to relay Zika virus information to their patients. Since practitioner-sponsored Web sites have the capacity to directly reach the populations at greatest risk for Zika virus complications, public health professionals should consider adapting their materials and provider outreach campaigns to more easily accommodate Web siteCbased information dissemination during this type of public health emergency. There must be greater recognition of the value information gains in the eyes of the patient when it is validated by their own provider, especially when that patient is part of the highest-risk population for a given emergency.

METHODS: Based on the UK Biobank, we conducted a matched cohort study, including 13,602 European individuals with asthma diagnosed before 18 years old and 136,008 matched unexposed individuals without such an experience. Ascertainment of asthma was based on self-reported data (97.6%) or clinical diagnosis in healthcare registers (2.4%). We studied three height outcomes, including (1) the attained adult height (in centimeters), (2) the height deviation measured as the difference between a persons rank of genetically determined height (based on generated polygenetic risk score) and their rank of attained adult height in the study population (deviation in % of height order after standardization), and (3) the presence of height deficit comparing genetically determined and attained height (yes or no). We applied linear mixed-effect models to assess the associations of asthma diagnosed at different ages with attained adult height and height deviation, and conditional logistic regression models to estimate the associations of asthma with the risk of height deficit. RESULTS: 40.07% (59,944/149,610) of the study participants were born before 1950, and most of them were men (57.65%). After controlling for multiple covariates, childhood asthma was associated with shorter attained adult height, irrespective of age at asthma diagnosis. However, in the analysis of height deviation (deviation in %), we observed the greatest height deviation among individuals with asthma diagnosed before 4 years of age (? 2.57 [95% CI ? 4.14 to ? 1.00] and ? 2.80 [95% CI ? 4.06 to ? 1.54] for the age of  2 and 3C4 years, respectively). The magnitude of height deviation in relation to asthma declined thereafter and became null after age 6. Similarly, there was a statistically significant height deficit in relation to an asthma diagnosis at ages  2 and 3C4 (odds ratios = 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.40, and 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29) but not thereafter. The result pattern was similar when separately analyzing asthma with or without inhaled glucocorticoid (ICS) use, despite that the estimates were consistently stronger among asthma individuals who used ICS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a notable association of childhood asthma, primarily asthma diagnosed at an early age, with adult height, after consideration of genetic heterogeneity in height and use of ICS.

We investigated the dissipation of three PPCPs: ibuprofen (IBP), diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS), separately and in mixtures, in the ppm range in biopurification system (BPS) microcosms, paying special attention to their effect on bacterial ecotoxicity, as well as bacterial community structure and composition. The results reveal that BPS microcosms efficiently dissipate IBP and DCF with 90% removed after 45 and 84 days of incubation, respectively. However, removal of TCS required a longer incubation period of 127 days for 90% removal. Furthermore, dissipation of the PPCPs was slower when a mixture of all three was applied to BPS microcosms. TCS had an initial negative effect on bacterial viability by a decrease of 34-43% as measured by live bacterial cell counts using LIVE/DEAD? microscopy; however, this effect was mitigated when the three PPCPs were present simultaneously. The bacterial communities in BPS microcosms were more affected by incubation time than by the PPCPs used. Nonetheless, the PPCPs differentially affected the composition and relative abundance of bacterial taxa. IBP and DCF initially increased bacterial diversity and richness, while exposure to TCS generally provoked an opposite effect without full recovery at the end of the incubation period. TCS, which negatively affected the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Methylophilales, and Legionellales, had the largest impact on bacterial groups. Biomarker OTUs were identified in the BPS microcosms which were constrained to higher concentrations of the PPCPs and thus are likely to harbour degradation and/or detoxification mechanisms. This study reveals for the first time the effect of PPCPs on bacterial ecotoxicity and diversity in biopurification system microcosms and also facilitates the design of further applications of biomixtures to eliminate PPCPs.","output":"Bacterial ecotoxicity and shifts in bacterial communities associated with the removal of ibuprofen, diclofenac and triclosan in biopurification systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sucking of an iota-carrageenan containing lozenge releases sufficient iota-carrageenan into the saliva of healthy subjects to neutralize representatives of the most common respiratory virus families causing common cold and SARS-CoV-2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocentric, open label, prospective clinical trial, 31 healthy subjects were included to suck a commercially available iota-carrageenan containing lozenge. Saliva samples from 27 subjects were used for ex vivo efficacy analysis. The studys primary objective was to assess if the mean iota-carrageenan concentration of the saliva samples exceeded 5 g/mL, which is the concentration known to reduce replication of human rhinovirus (hRV) 1a and 8 by 90%. The iota-carrageenan concentration of the saliva samples was analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The antiviral effectiveness of the individual saliva samples was determined in vitro against a panel of respiratory viruses including hRV1a, hRV8, human coronavirus OC43, influenza virus A H1N1pdm09, coxsackievirus A10, parainfluenza virus 3 and SARS-CoV-2 using standard virological assays. RESULTS: The mean iota-carrageenan concentration detected in the saliva exceeds the concentration needed to inhibit 90% of hRV1a and hRV8 replication by 134-fold (95% CI 116.3C160.8-fold; p < 0.001). Thus, the study met the primary endpoint. Furthermore, the iota-carrageenan saliva concentration was 60 to 30,351-fold higher than needed to reduce viral replication/binding of all tested viruses by at least 90% (p < 0.001). The effect was most pronounced in hCoV OC43; in case of SARS-CoV-2, the IC(90) was exceeded by 121-fold (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sucking an iota-carrageenan containing lozenge releases sufficient iota-carrageenan to neutralize and inactivate the most abundant respiratory viruses as well as pandemic SARS-CoV-2. The lozenges are therefore an appropriate measure to reduce the viral load at the site of infection, hereby presumably limiting transmission within a population as well as translocation to the lower respiratory tract.

The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. METHODS As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. RESULTS We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. CONCLUSION This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.","output":"Identification and Analysis of Shared Risk Factors in Sepsis and High Mortality Risk COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, all of us are experiencing emotions, thoughts, and situations we have never experienced before.

To characterize the outbreak and the viral population underlying it, we combined genomic and epidemiological data from 467 individuals, including 40% of known outbreak-associated cases. The Delta variant accounted for 99% of sequenced outbreak-associated cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests over 40 sources of Delta in the dataset, with one responsible for a single cluster containing 83% of outbreak-associated genomes.

Using data from the 2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2019), we evaluated national and provincial health trends and progress towards important Sustainable Development Goal targets from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: We analysed GBD 2019 estimates of mortality, non-fatal health loss, summary health measures and risk factor burden, comparing trends over 1990C2007 and 2007C2019. Additionally, we decomposed changes in life expectancy by cause of death and assessed healthcare system performance. RESULTS: Across the nine provinces, inequalities in mortality and life expectancy increased over 1990C2007, largely due to differences in HIV/AIDS, then decreased over 2007C2019. Demographic change and increases in non-communicable diseases nearly doubled the number of years lived with disability between 1990 and 2019. From 1990 to 2019, risk factor burdens generally shifted from communicable and nutritional disease risks to non-communicable disease and injury risks; unsafe sex remained the top risk factor. Despite widespread improvements in healthcare system performance, the greatest gains were generally in economically advantaged provinces. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in HIV/AIDS and related conditions have led to improved health since 2007, though most provinces still lag in key areas. To achieve health targets, provincial governments should enhance health investments and exchange of knowledge, resources and best practices alongside populations that have been left behind, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Health trends, inequalities and opportunities in South Africas provinces, 1990C2019: findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"View is a key factor that influences property price. Previous studies represent view either by simple pictorial description of a scene, or by rather sophisticated mathematical methods. Both hinder proper allocation of a premium for different view obstruction levels for high-rise high-density urban environments. View obstruction level and the applicable premium are useful information for stakeholders of the property market for making optimum decisions. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a simple parameter for assessing view obstruction level. While view is difficult to define, reference is made to law cases which often settle view disputes by the extent of daylight obstruction. Shading mask is typically used to assess availability of daylight outside a residential unit and hence is an ideal parameter for assessing view obstruction. Computation of shading mask values (SMK) is a very complex task that needs meticulous site surveys, 3D drafting skills, and computer simulations. They are too effort intensive for stakeholders. This paper summarizes the relevant considerations and the case studies conducted to establish the average angle of unobstructed sky () as a simple parameter to represent mean SMK for assessing view obstruction. Correlation analysis of mean SMK of 708 case study residential units determined by the detailed computer simulation method and the corresponding angle of unobstructed sky showed that the latter can be used to assess view obstruction adequately close to simulation predictions. Given average angle of unobstructed sky can easily be determined based on the geometrical primitives of a residential unit, this can enable future allocation of a premium for different view obstruction levels for stakeholders.","output":"Developing a simplified parameter for assessing view obstruction in high-rise high-density urban environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to share the online collaborative experience of interprofessional teamwork among healthcare undergraduate students based on community learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Chile.

A recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) was expressed from plants and Escherichia coli for the detection of serum total Ab. We prospectively collected 141 serum samples from 32 patients with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 and determined the sensitivity and dynamics of their total Ab response. Specificity was evaluated using 158 prepandemic samples. To validate the assays, we evaluated the performance using two different cutoff values. The sensitivity and specificity for each assay were as follows: 92.91% and 94.30% (plant-rNP), 83.69% and 98.73% (SD Biosensor), 75.89% and 98.10% (E. coli-rNP), 76.47% and 100% (EDI-IgG), and 80.39% and 80% (EDI-IgM). The plant-based rNP showed the highest sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.980) among all the assays (P < 0.05). The seroconversion rate for total Ab increased sequentially with disease progression, with a sensitivity of 100% after 10 to 12 days of post-symptom onset (PSO) for both rNP-plant-based and SD Biosensor ELISAs. After 2 weeks of PSO, the seroconversion rates were >80% and 100% for EDI-IgM and EDI-IgG ELISA, respectively. Seroconversion occurred earlier with rNP plant-based ELISA (5 days PSO) compared with E. coli-based (7 days PSO) and SD Biosensor (8 days PSO) ELISA. We determined that rNP produced in plants enables the robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 total Abs. The assay can be used for serosurvey and complementary diagnosis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE At present, the principal diagnostic methods for COVID-19 comprise the identification of viral nucleic acid by genetic approaches, including PCR-based techniques or next-generation sequencing. However, there is an urgent need for validated serological assays which are crucial for the understanding of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific serological antibody assay was developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with an overall accuracy of 93.56% using a recombinant nucleoprotein expressed from plants.","output":"Usefulness of ELISA Using Total Antibody against Plant-Expressed Recombinant Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyze the association between diet quality assessed with the Diet Quality Scale (ESQUADA) and the nutritional status and metabolic risk in adults. METHODS The data included 1,147 adults aged 20 to 59, from the population-based study with complex sampling. Weight, height, tricipital (TSF) and subscapular (SSF) skinfolds, and waist (WC) and mid-arm (MAC) circumferences were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) were calculated. Nutritional status and metabolic risk were classified considering BMI and WC values, respectively. Diet quality was assessed with ESQUADA. Data were collected at household using the Epicollect5 application. Diet quality (in scores) was analyzed as continuous data and later categorized. The confidence interval was used for comparison between groups, Fisher's exact test for an association study. Adjusted multiple linear regression models were also estimated. P < 0.05 was adopted for statistical significance. RESULTS Overweight prevailed in 60.33% of individuals, especially among women (60.73%). High or very high metabolic risk was more frequent among women with \\"very good or excellent\\" diet quality. Higher diet quality score was associated with a reduction in TSF ( = -0.07; 95%CI -0.13 - -0.01) and an increase in MAMC ( = 0.09; 95%CI 0.00 - 0,18) in men and the reduction in weight ( = -0.04; 95%CI -0.07 - -0.01), SSF ( = -0.07; 95%CI -0.13 - -0,00) and WC in women ( = -0.06; 95%CI -0.09 - -0.02).

We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities, and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress altogether with a larger fraction of users. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draws attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.","output":"Simulating SARS-CoV-2 epidemics by region-specific variables and modeling contact tracing app containment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The operationalization of One Health (OH) through digitalization is a means to deploy digital technologies (including Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data and related digital technologies) to better capacitate us to deal with growing climate exigency and related threats to human, animal and plant health.

However, the data landscape is fragmented and access to certain types of data is increasingly restrictive as individuals, communities and countries seek to assert greater control over data taken from them. This paper proposes for a dedicated global ODH frameworkcentered on fairness and equityto be established to promote data-sharing across all the key knowledge domains of OH and to devise data-driven solutions to challenges in the human-animal-ecosystems interface. It first considers the data landscape in relation to: (1) Human and population health; (2) Pathogens; (3) Animal and plant health; and (4) Ecosystems and biodiversity. The complexification from the application of advance genetic sequencing technology is then considered, with focus on current debates over whether certain types of data like digital (genetic) sequencing information (DSI) should remain openly and freely accessible. The proposed ODH framework must augment the existing access and benefit sharing (ABS) framework currently prescribed under the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in at least three different ways. First, the ODH framework should apply to all genetic resources and data, including DSI, whether from humans or non-humans. Second, the FAIRER principles should be implemented, with focus on fair and equitable benefit-sharing. Third, the ODH framework should adopt multilateral approaches to data sharing (such as through federated data systems) and to ABS.

In Europe, an intense activity of revising and updating European rules applicable to financial markets and company law has started. In Italy, such debate became more intense after the legal transplant of the US benefit corporation model in late 2015. The Italian societ benefit allows, through a voluntary choice of the founding members or the shareholders meeting, to internalise values typical of corporate social responsibility in the articles of association, making them legally binding on the company and the directors. Considering the traditional dichotomy between for-profit entities and non-profit entities, hybrid models such as the benefit corporation appear to struggle in finding an adequate space within capitalist systems and corporate governance theories. This study attempts to offer an interpretative key for understanding these hybrid models, abandoning the classical homo economicus paradigm to embrace a reading based on behavioural law and economics and the Yale approach to economic analysis of law, according to which altruism and beneficence should be considered as ends in themselves, as goods desired by people and for which they are willing to pay a price. In this line of reasoning, benefit corporations and other hybrid models, because of their ability to bring altruistic values into the corporate purpose, departing from shareholder value maximisation as the raison d'tre of the corporate form, can be considered as a further manifestation of firm altruism, given that they are characterised by a deep and lasting impact on the environment and civil society.","output":"Philanthropy and the For-profit Corporation: The Benefit Corporation as the New Form of Firm Altruism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThis survey aimed toEstablish the extent to which trainees feel the pandemic to date has disrupted their training Identify what training and research opportunities have been available to traineesIdentify if and how teaching has continued in anaesthesiology departmentsMethodsA link to an online survey was sent out to anaesthetic trainees in the Republic of Ireland 64 responses were received from a range of sites (Dublin based 59%) and with a range of experience (SHO-42%, Registrar- 58%) This represented a 19% response rate among those enrolled in Specialist Anaesthesiology Training (SAT) Results85% of respondents felt that they lost out on important training opportunities because of the pandemic, with 28% strongly agreeing These opportunities included anaesthesiology exams (30%), other exams (17%), attending meetings (65%), presenting at meetings (33%), research (17%), attending mandatory courses (43%), and recommended courses (28%) 75% felt that they had the opportunity to take part in other training opportunities, with 37 5% somewhat agreeing that this was the case These included participating in simulation (44%), designing and implementing simulation (21%), taking on mentorship roles (25%), protocol and guideline design (25%), and clinical research (19%) 58% of simulation training was in donning and doffing PPE, 50% was in airway management in ICU and 23% was in cardiac arrest management The most helpful factors that trainees felt helped them in pursuing training were their relationships with consultants (79%), and other trainees (80%) 84% respondents said that the amount of teaching in their departments decreased during the pandemic, and that where it did departmental teaching took place via videoconferencing (70%), as did ICU teaching (30%), and simulation (33%) DiscussionWhile negative effects of the pandemic on training opportunites is clear,1 2 trainees also felt they had training opportunities that they would not otherwise have This is important because of the significant pressure we know that trainees feel to pursue non clinical activities 3 It is noteworthy that 44% respondents had access to on site simulation training The importance of mentorship and relationships with colleagues and both consultant and trainee level is also clear ReferencesRose S Medical Student Education in the Time of COVID-19 JAMA 2020 Jun 2;323(21):2131 Daodu O COVID-19 C Considerations and Implications for Surgical Learners Ann Surg 2020 Jul;272(1):e22C3 Introduction to CAT & CAI Training & Wellness Survey [Internet] [cited 2020 Jun 28] Available from: https://dv4 mediasite com/mediasite/Play/264cae73b65742ad89b49577b79603a51d","output":"PG102 Anaesthesiology trainee learning opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Old World camels have served humans in cross\\\\continental caravans, transporting people and goods, connecting different cultures and providing milk, meat, wool and draught since their domestication around 3000C6000 years ago.

As several pertussis cases seek care earlier, a clinical tool independent of cough duration may support earlier recognition. We developed a data-driven algorithm aimed at predicting a laboratory confirmed pertussis. METHODS: We enrolled children <12 months of age presenting with apnoea, paroxistic cough, whooping, or post-tussive vomiting, irrespective of the duration of cough. Patients underwent a RT-PCR test for pertussis and other viruses. Through a logistic regression model, we identified symptoms associated with laboratory confirmed pertussis. We then developed a predictive decision tree through Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm to predict laboratory confirmed pertussis. RESULTS: We enrolled 543 children, of which 160 had a positive RT-PCR for pertussis. A suspicion of pertussis by a physician (aOR 5.44) or a blood count showing leukocytosis and lymphocytosis (aOR 4.48) were highly predictive of lab confirmed pertussis. An algorithm including a suspicion of pertussis by a physician, whooping, cyanosis and absence of fever was accurate (79.9%) and specific (94.0%) and had high positive and negative predictive values (PPV 76.3% NPV 80.7%).

Alternatively, sutureless anastomosis can be achieved using endoscopically delivered magnetic rings. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of an endo-laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy technique, using a pair of magnets coated with a near-infrared fluorescent biocompatible polymeric material. METHODS Five pigs (3 acute and 2 survival models) and one human anatomical specimen were included. In the survival models, the distal ring was inserted into the duodenum endoscopically, and it was fixed to a thread clipped to the gastric mucosa. Twenty-four hours later, a two-port laparoscopy was performed using a near-infrared (NIR) laparoscope. The magnet position in the jejunum was detected with the transluminal fluorescence of the dye. Magnetic interaction with the metallic tip of the laparoscopic grasper allowed to capture the ring and bring the bowel loop to the future anastomotic site on the gastric wall. The proximal magnet was inserted into the stomach endoscopically and released when magnetic interaction started, allowing for a precise connection with the distal ring. The animals were followed up for 12 days and underwent control endoscopies and radiograms. In the acute animals, the anastomotic procedure was repeated 24 times. Finally, the procedure was performed in the human anatomical specimen. RESULTS There were no technical problems, and magnetic connection could be precisely directed at both the anterior and posterior gastric walls. No complications occurred during the survival period and the anastomoses were patent on day 5. Transluminal fluorescence enabled a rapid detection of the magnet.

A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin D (25) HD mean and the number of COVID 19 deaths for each 14 day period during the COVID 19 pandemic time period. Conclusions: The observation of the significantly lower COVID 19 mortality rates in countries with the lowest annual sun exposure but the highest mean Vitamin D (25) HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to the emergence of a large number of COVID 19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.","output":"Mean Vitamin D levels in 19 European Countries & COVID-19 Mortality over 10 months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mathematical model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission of a respiratory infection such as COVID-19, is presented. The model employs basic concepts from fluid dynamics and incorporates the known scope of factors involved in the airborne transmission of such diseases. Simplicity in the mathematical form of the model is by design, so that it can serve not only as a common basis for scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries, but also be understandable by a broad audience outside science and academia. The caveats and limitations of the model are discussed in detail. The model is used to assess the protection from transmission afforded by face coverings made from a variety of fabrics. The reduction in transmission risk associated with increased physical distance between the host and susceptible is also quantified by coupling the model with available data on scalar dispersion in canonical flows. Finally, the effect of the level of physical activity (or exercise intensity) of the host and the susceptible in enhancing transmission risk, is also assessed.","output":"A Mathematical Framework for Estimating Risk of Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 with Application to Face Mask Use and Social Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HFNC seems to increase droplet spread, so caution should be taken if its applied for COVID-19 and adequate protective measures should be provided.

The voices of Orthodox Jews are situated alongside printed broadsides that circulated anonymous truth-claims in Jerusalem neighborhoods. These broadsides cast state intervention against historical narratives of deception and ethical failures. Borderland tensions, like a virus, mutate and influence responses to authority and biosecurity, and they reconfigure vernacular entanglements of religion, state, and health.

The identification and sequencing of the Spanish flu agent allowed following the H1N1 influenza virus after the acute pandemic phase. During the 1920s H1N1 influenza virus epidemics with substantial mortality were still observed. As late as 1951, H1N1 strains of high virulence evolved but remained geographically limited. Until 1957, the H1N1 virus evolved by accumulation of mutations (antigenic drift) and some intratypic reassortment. H1N1 viruses were then replaced by the pandemic H2N2 influenza virus from 1957, which was in 1968 replaced by the pandemic H3N2 influenza virus; both viruses were descendants from the Spanish flu agent but showed the exchange of entire gene segments (antigenic shift). In 1977, H1N1 reappeared from an unknown source but caused only mild disease.

We identified seven studies for the qualitative synthesis per the PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, PubMed, PubMed Central, and PsychInfo databases until July 2020.ResultsThe pandemic has negatively impacted athletes mental wellbeing due to decreased physical activities, limited resources, fears, and delays or cancellations of the sporting event. The negative psychological impact on athletes is due to self-isolation measures leading to worries of less preparedness for the lockdown, reduced physical activity, loss of competitive advantages, fear of being infected, social isolation, and loneliness. During this period, athletes struggled to maintain baseline routine and engaged in excessive calorie intake, eating low-quality food, substance use, and sleep disruption.

Since structural models from experiments are still lacking, computational methods can be challenged to generate such models. In this study, a sequential approach for the assembly is proposed in which the individual TMDs are assembled one by one. This protocol is compared with a concerted protocol in which all TMDs are assembled simultaneously. The role of the loops between the TMDs during assembly of the monomers into a bundle is investigated. Molecular dynamics simulations for 20 ns are performed as a short equilibration to assess the bundle stability in a lipid environment. The results suggest that bundles are likely with the second TMD facing the putative pore. All the putative bundles show water molecules trapped within the lumen of the pore with only occasional events of complete crossing.

We present a computational model to predict the filtering efficiency of an N95-facemask, consisting of three non-woven fiber layers with different particle capturing mechanisms. Parameters such as fiber layer thickness, diameter distribution, and packing density are used to construct two-dimensional cross-sectional geometries. An essential and novel element is that the polydisperse fibers are positioned randomly within a simulation domain, and that the simulation is repeated with different random configurations. This strategy is thought to give a more realistic view of practical facemasks compared to existing analytical models that mostly assume homogeneous fiber beds of monodisperse fibers. The incompressible Navier-Stokes and continuity equations are used to solve the velocity field for various droplet-laden air inflow velocities. Droplet diameters are ranging from 10 nm to 1.0 m, which covers the size range from the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the large virus-laden airborne droplets. Air inflow velocities varying between 0.1 ms(-1) to 10 ms(-1) are considered, which are typically encountered during expiratory events like breathing, talking, and coughing. The presented model elucidates the different capturing efficiencies (i.e., mechanical and electrostatic filtering) of droplets as a function of their diameter and air inflow velocity. Simulation results are compared to analytical models and particularly compare well with experimental results from literature. Our numerical approach will be helpful in finding new directions for anti-viral facemask optimization.","output":"Filtering efficiency model that includes the statistical randomness of non-woven fiber layers in facemasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that infects the intestinal tract and causes diarrhea and vomiting in older pigs or extreme dehydration and death that could reach 100% mortality in neonatal piglets. In the US, the first PEDV outbreaks occurred in 2013 and since then US PEDV strains have quickly spread throughout the US and worldwide, causing significant economic and public health concerns. Currently two conditionally approved vaccines exist in the US, but there is no live attenuated vaccine, which is considered the best option in controlling PEDV by inducing transferrable mucosal immunity to susceptible neonatal piglets. In this study, we passaged an US PEDV isolate under various conditions to generate three strains and characterized their growth and antigenicity in cell culture using various assays including Western blot analysis, serum neutralization assay, sequencing analysis and confocal microscopy. Finally, these strains were evaluated for pathogenicity in nursing piglets (1C4 days old). RESULTS: One of the PEDV strains generated in this study (designated as PEDV 8aa) is able to replicate in cells without any protease and grows to a high titer of >8 log(10) TCID(50)/ml in cell culture. Interestingly, replication of PEDV 8aa was severely reduced by trypsin and this correlated with the inhibition of virus attachment and entry into the cells. In neonatal nursing piglets, PEDV 8aa (passage number 70 or 105) was found to be fully attenuated with limited virus shedding. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that applying selective pressure during viral passages can facilitate attainment of viral attenuation and that PEDV 8aa warrants further investigation as an attenuated vaccine.","output":"Trypsin-independent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus US strain with altered virus entry mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently encountered in the emergency department.

While this has directed the response and care of patients with suspected COVID-19, there have been false-negative results depending on when the test was administered in relation to time of exposure and symptom onset. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department in July 2020 with a persistent fever of 100 -103F for 10 days. He returned from Texas 9 days prior with onset of fever one day before depature. He had a mild, non-productive cough, body aches, and poor oral intake. He also had diffuse abdominal pain with diarrhea and bilious, non-bloody vomiting - up to three times a day. He had elevated WBC, ESR, CRP and LDH with Lymphopenia. Blood cultures and HIV, Syphilis, EBV and Mycoplasma screening were negative as was a COVID-19 test. CT scan of his chest and abdomen revealed peripheral ground glass opacities suspicious of COVID 19. A repeat COVID test on hospital day 2 was again negative. He was treated with Azithromycin and Doxycycline and discharged home on Azithromycin on hospital day 4. He was readmitted 6 days later because of persistent fever to 103F, joint pains, malaise and weight loss of about 10 pounds. ESR, CRP, Ferritin and LDH were again elevated. A repeat CT scan showed resolution of previously seen ground glass opacities in the anterior lung fields and new confluent areas of ground glass attenuation and interlobular septal thickening posteriorly. A 3rd, 4th and 5th COVID-19 tests performed were negative. He was treated with Acetaminophen alternating with Ketorolac. A TTE showed a hyperlucency concerning for a right atrial thrombus or vegetation. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 50%. An MRI of the heart showed an inflammatory picture consistent with myocarditis. Further testing was done to reveal the etiology of his myocarditis to be Coxsackie A7,9, and 16. Clinically, there was significant improvement with resolution of fever and malaise and return of WBC count to normal. DISCUSSION: This patient's diagnosis of Coxsackie A myocarditis was clouded by the medical team's strong suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia because of his clinical presentation and history of travel during the month of June to a part of the US with rising rates of COVID-19 cases. The unknown precise false-negative rate of the COVID-19 test, which can be anywhere from 2-27% depending on the time of testing from initial exposure meant that the diagnosis was never deemed impossible even with consecutive negative test results. CONCLUSIONS: While the attention COVID-19 is receiving is well deserved, anecdotal accumulation of evidence along with the scientific community's first wave of research has produced heuristics that need to be overcome to optimize patient care and outcomes.

RESULTS: This case series includes 19 renal transplant recipients with a mean age of 38.4 + 11.6 years and a mean duration of 55.9 + 36.1 months post-transplant. They were maintained on triple therapy with a calcineurine inhibitor, antiproliferative therapy and steroids. The laboratory data at weeks 1,2, and 3 showed that at weeks 2 all markers of inflammation increased especially serum ferritin (1718 + 315 ng/ml). Serum creatinine increased by < 30% with urine protein creatinine of < 500 mg/g. The mean time to recovery was 13 + 3.1 days. The patient who was on mTOR inhibitor showed the highest inflammatory response and the longest time to recovery, 18 days. All patients showed complete recovery with stable graft function and no patient warranted dialysis, nor ICU care. CONCLUSION: In the settings of limited resources, unavailability of costly immunomodulatory therapies and limited hospital capacity, early case definition, judicious management of immune suppression, and affordable antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs will improve outcome in early cases of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients.","output":"MO996 COVID-19 IN RENAL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS; A CASE SERIES FROM IRAQ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clerodendrum volubile is an underutilized leafy vegetable consumed in some parts of Nigeria.

The present study utilized the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) methods, while the gradual shift and wavelet coherence techniques are utilized to determine the direction of the causality. The ARDL bounds test reveals a long-run linkage between the variables of interest. Empirical evidence shows that CO(2) emissions trigger economic growth. Thus, based on increasing environmental awareness across the globe, it is necessary to change the energy mix in South Korea to renewables to enable the use of sustainable energy sources and establish an environmentally sustainable ecosystem. Moreover, the energy-induced growth hypothesis is validated. This result is supported by the causality analysis, which shows a one-way causality running from energy consumption to GDP in South Korea. This suggests that South Korea cannot embark on conservative energy policies, as such actions will damage economic progress. Additionally, a unidirectional causality is seen from CO(2) emissions and energy consumption to economic growth. These findings have far-reaching consequences for GDP growth and macroeconomic indicators in South Korea.","output":"Can CO(2) emissiovns and energy consumption determine the economic performance of South Korea?

However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets. METHODS: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccineCrelated tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis. RESULTS: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Leveraging Transfer Learning to Analyze Opinions, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: Social Media Content and Temporal Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, is unarguably the leading cause of honeybee (Apis mellifera) mortality worldwide through its role as a vector for lethal viruses, in particular, strains of the Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) complexes. Several honeybee populations across Europe have well-documented adaptations of mite-resistant traits but little is known about host adaptations towards the virus infections vectored by the mite. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the possible contribution of adapted virus tolerance and/or resistance to the enhanced survival of four well-documented mite-resistant honeybee populations from Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and France, in relation to unselected mite-susceptible honeybees. Caged adult bees and laboratory reared larvae, from colonies of these four populations, were inoculated with DWV and ABPV in a series of feeding infection experiments, while control groups received virus-free food. Virus infections were monitored using RT-qPCR assays in individuals sampled over a time course. In both adults and larvae the DWV and ABPV infection dynamics were nearly identical in all groups, but all mite-resistant honeybee populations had significantly higher survival rates compared to the mite-susceptible honeybees.

This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of PCR-positive M. pneumoniae infections in a hospital setting. We reviewed 103 PCR-positive patients cared for in a university hospital during a 3-year period. Data on age, sex, health condition, acute symptoms, other pathogens found, laboratory and X-ray results and treatments were collected. Over 85% of the patients had a triad of typical symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract were rare. In 91% of the cases, M. pneumoniae was the only pathogen found. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 30C40 years, and 68% of the patients did not have any underlying diseases. Most patients were initially empirically treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and needed 2C4 changes in their treatment. Only 6% were discharged without an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae. This study shows that M. pneumoniae often led to hospitalisation and that patients needed appropriate antimicrobial treatment to recover.

Here, we report the structure of the human USP2 catalytic domain in complex with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin uses two major sites for the interaction with the protease. Both sites are required simultaneously, as shown by USP2 inhibition assays with peptides and ubiquitin mutants. In addition, a layer of ordered water molecules mediates key interactions between ubiquitin and USP2. As several of those molecules are found at identical positions in the previously solved USP7/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex structure, we suggest a general mechanism of water-mediated ubiquitin recognition by USPs.","output":"Structural Basis of Ubiquitin Recognition by the Deubiquitinating Protease USP2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The differentiation of oligodendroglia from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complex and extensive myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a multistep process that involves largescale morphological changes with significant strain on the cytoskeleton. While key chromatin and transcriptional regulators of differentiation have been identified, their target genes responsible for the morphological changes occurring during OL myelination are still largely unknown. Here, we show that the regulator of focal adhesion, Tensin3 (Tns3), is a direct target gene of Olig2, Chd7, and Chd8, transcriptional regulators of OL differentiation. Tns3 is transiently upregulated and localized to cell processes of immature OLs, together with integrin-1, a key mediator of survival at this transient stage. Constitutive Tns3 loss-of-function leads to reduced viability in mouse and humans, with surviving knockout mice still expressing Tns3 in oligodendroglia. Acute deletion of Tns3 in vivo, either in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) or in OPCs, leads to a two-fold reduction in OL numbers. We find that the transient upregulation of Tns3 is required to protect differentiating OPCs and immature OLs from cell death by preventing the upregulation of p53, a key regulator of apoptosis. Altogether, our findings reveal a specific time window during which transcriptional upregulation of Tns3 in immature OLs is required for OL differentiation likely by mediating integrin-1 survival signaling to the actin cytoskeleton as OL undergo the large morphological changes required for their terminal differentiation.","output":"Transient regulation of focal adhesion via Tensin3 is required for nascent oligodendrocyte differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most recently discovered interferon (IFN) family, type III IFNs or lambda IFNs (IFN-s) are caused by viral infection and act in mucosal barriers, such as the respiratory tract.

To date, there has been no published data supporting the use of capnographic monitoring in adult patients undergoing routine endoscopic procedures with moderate sedation. The aim of this randomized, parallel group assignment trial was to determine whether intervention based on capnographic monitoring improves detection of hypoxemia in patients undergoing routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or colonoscopy with moderate sedation. METHODS Healthy patients (ASA Physical Classification (ASAPS) I and II)) scheduled for routine outpatient EGD or colonoscopy under moderate sedation utilizing opioid and benzodiazepine combinations were randomly assigned to a blinded capnography alarm or open capnography alarm group. In both study arms, standard cardiopulmonary monitoring devices were utilized with additional capnographic monitoring. The primary end point was the incidence of hypoxemia defined as a fall in oxygen saturation (SaO2) to <90% for 10 s. Secondary outcomes included severe hypoxemia, apnea, disordered respirations, hypotension, bradycardia, and early procedure termination for any cause. RESULTS A total of 452 patients were randomized; 218 in the EGD and 234 in the colonoscopy groups; 75 subjects in the EGD group (35.9%) and 114 patients (49.4%) in the colonoscopy group were male, and average body mass index was 27.9 and 29.1 (kg/m(2)), respectively. The blinded and open alarm groups in each study arm were similar in regards to use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines and ASAPS classification.

In vivo studies indicated that lack of CD13 significantly enhanced T cell responses to soluble OVA Ag, although development, maturation, and Ag processing and presentation of DCs are normal in CD13KO mice. In vitro studies showed that CD13 regulates receptor-mediated, dynamin-dependent endocytosis of Ags such as OVA and transferrin but not fluid-phase or phagocytic Ag uptake. CD13 and Ag are cointernalized in DCs, but CD13 did not coimmunoprecipitate with Ag receptors, suggesting that CD13 does not control internalization of specific receptors but regulates endocytosis at a more universal level. Mechanistically, we found that phosphorylation of the endocytic regulators p38MAPK and Akt was dysregulated in CD13KO DCs, and blocking of these kinases perturbed CD13-dependent endocytic uptake.

In this report, we illustrate an extraordinary case of severe cardioinhibitory reflex syncope with prolonged asystole associated with COVID-19. Case summary A 35-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of postural syncope and fever. Electrocardiogram monitoring during positional change revealed reflex syncope with cardioinhibitory response, exhibiting sinus bradycardia, subsequent asystole, and syncope. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was admitted to the intensive care unit where temporary transvenous pacing was necessary because of prolonged episodes of asystole. Work-up included extensive cardiac and neurological diagnostic testing, but did not yield any structural abnormalities. Although temporary pacing was able to abort syncope, a decision was made to hold off on permanent pacing as the most likely aetiology was felt to be temporary cardioinhibitory reflex syncope associated with COVID-19. The patient was discharged with mild symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and responded well to education and lifestyle modification. Outpatient follow-up with repeat tilt testing after 3 and 6 months initially showed residual inducible syncope but was eventually normal and the patient remained asymptomatic. Discussion We believe that autonomic imbalance with a strong vagal activation due to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection played a pivotal role in the occurrence of transient syncope in this patients condition.

The bottom half of the stem is more stable than the top half of the stem. The function of the stem-loop was further investigated by mutagenic analysis. Reducing the stability of the bottom half of the stem strongly effects frameshifting levels, whereas similar changes in the top half are not as effective.

Prior studies, with limited numbers, have included men in various stages of infection with most in the recovery phase of the illness. The timing of test results and severity of illness has made recruiting study participants a significant challenge. Our pilot study will examine semen from men with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as those in the convalescent phase to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected and its relationship, if any, with the severity of the disease. METHODS: Eighteen men with a median age of 32 (range, 24-57) who tested positive for COVID-19 by rt-PCR analysis were enrolled and provided a semen sample. The study group demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 ranging from asymptomatic to moderate and none required hospitalization. Samples were subjected to viral RNA extraction and then processed by real-time RT-PCR using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) panel of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) primers and probes to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Length of time from diagnosis to providing a specimen ranged from 1 to 28 days (median, 6 days). Fifteen participants were symptomatic and three were asymptomatic, including recovering men, at the time of semen collection. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the semen samples.

Sufficient evidence shows that temperature has an essential link with respiratory infectious diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe the exposure-response relationship between ambient temperature, including extreme temperatures, and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: The Poisson distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was constructed to evaluate the non-linear delayed effects of ambient temperature on death, by using the daily new death of COVID-19 and ambient temperature data from January 10 to March 31, 2020, in Wuhan, China. RESULTS: During the period mentioned above, the average daily number of COVID-19 deaths was approximately 45.2. Poisson distributed lag non-linear model showed that there was a non-linear relationship (U-shape) between the effect of ambient temperature and mortality. With confounding factors controlled, the daily cumulative relative death risk decreased by 12.3% (95% CI [3.4, 20.4%]) for every 1.0 C increase in temperature. Moreover, the delayed effects of the low temperature are acute and short-term, with the most considerable risk occurring in 5C7 days of exposure. The delayed effects of the high temperature appeared quickly, then decrease rapidly, and increased sharply 15 days of exposure, mainly manifested as acute and long-term effects. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated that the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 mortality was non-linear. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative relative risk of death and temperature. Additionally, exposure to high and low temperatures had divergent impacts on mortality.","output":"The association between ambient temperature and mortality of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China: a time-series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The optimal timing of intubation for critically ill patients with severe respiratory illness remains controversial among healthcare providers. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised even more questions about when to implement this life-saving therapy. While one group of providers prefers early intubation for patients with respiratory distress because these patients may deteriorate rapidly without it, other providers believe that intubation should be delayed or avoided because of its associated risks including worse outcomes. Research question Our objective was to assess whether the timing of intubation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with differences in mortality or other outcomes. Study design and methods This was a single-center retrospective observational cohort study. We analyzed outcomes of patients who were intubated secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia between March 13, 2020, and December 12, 2020, at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. Patients were categorized into two groups: early intubated (intubated within 24 hours of the onset of severe respiratory distress) and late intubated (intubated after 24 hours of the onset of severe respiratory distress). Demographics, comorbidities, respiratory rate oxygenation (ROX) index, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and treatment received were compared between groups. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were ventilation time, intensive care unit stay, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition. Post hoc and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Results A total of 110 patients were included: 55 early intubated and 55 late intubated. We did not observe a significant difference in overall mortality between the early intubated (43%) and the late intubated groups (53%) (p = 0.34). There was no statistically significant difference in patients' baseline characteristics including SOFA scores (the early intubation group had a mean score of 7.5 compared to 6.7 in the late intubation group). Based on the ROX index, the early intubation group had significantly more patients with a reduced risk of intubation (45%) than the late group (27%) (p = 0.029). The early intubation group was treated with a high-flow nasal cannula at a significantly lower rate (47%) than the late intubation group (83%) (p < 0.001). Significant differences in patient baseline characteristics, treatment received, and other outcomes were not observed. Post hoc analysis adjusting for SOFA score between 0 and 9 revealed significantly higher mortality in the late intubation group (49%) than in the early intubation group (26%) (p = 0.03). Patients in the 0 to 9 SOFA group who were intubated later had 2.7 times the odds of dying during hospital admission compared to patients who were intubated early (CI, 1.09-6.67). Interpretation The timing of intubation for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was not significantly associated with overall mortality or other patient outcomes. However, within the subgroup of patients with SOFA scores of 9 or lower at the time of intubation, patients intubated after 24 hours of the onset of respiratory distress had a higher risk of death than those who were intubated within 24 hours of respiratory distress. Thus, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are not at a high level of organ dysfunction may benefit from early mechanical ventilation.","output":"Effect of Intubation Timing on the Outcome of Patients With Severe Respiratory Distress Secondary to COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID19 pandemic, an unprecedented global public health event, is a potential precipitating factor of psychological distress especially among Health Care Workers (HCWs) already operating under existing socioeconomic stress.

Twenty-seven novel signature variation residues (SNVs) were identified on the spike gene and were analyzed for their phylogenetic relationships, based on 17 sequences obtained from animals in our study and from other published studies. Analysis indicated that the virus in palm civets at the live-animal market had evolved to infect humans.

Formal teaching of the anatomical considerations in TAB was not reported by any trainee, with informal teaching being standard practice. Whilst 61% of respondents reported having learnt about the anatomical danger zone for facial nerve damage, 97% of trainees chose an incision that fell within this zone when given a choice between potential incision sites. CONCLUSION: TAB remains a largely trainee-taught, trainee-performed procedure. Most trainees are not aware of how to avoid the risk of damage to the temporal branch of the facial nerve.

The focus of the interviews was patient experiences of education and instructional delivery during the COVID19 school closures in Spring of 2020 and the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year;interviews were conducted via videoconference and transcripts were analyzed using a phenomenological approach. Results: Three emergent themes were found regarding the shared experiences of distance schooling for children with cancer during the COVID19 school closures: 1) attention, 2) mental health, and 3) access to instruction. This study describes and explores each theme and offers suggestions for changes to provider service delivery as a result of new pandemic-related schooling needs.","output":"Childhood Cancer Survivors and Distance Education Challenges: Lessons Learned from the COVID19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the discussion on rich countries ordering billions of doses more than needed for the populations Topics include World Health Organization (WHO) and other groups creating the COVID-19 Vaccines;and working with regulators showing indemnification and liability on the contracts between manufacturers and countries","output":"As vaccine surpluses loom, donation plans urged"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal and infant immunity differs from that of adults in both the innate and adaptive arms, which are critical contributors to immune-mediated clearance of infection and memory responses elicited during vaccination. The tuberculosis (TB) research community has openly admitted to a vacuum of knowledge about neonatal and infant immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, especially in the functional and phenotypic attributes of memory T cell responses elicited by the only available vaccine for TB, the Bacillus CalmetteCGurin (BCG) vaccine. Although BCG vaccination has variable efficacy in preventing pulmonary TB during adolescence and adulthood, 80% of endemic TB countries still administer BCG at birth because it has a good safety profile and protects children from severe forms of TB. As such, new vaccines must work in conjunction with BCG at birth and, thus, it is essential to understand how BCG shapes the immune system during the first months of life. However, many aspects of the neonatal and infant immune response elicited by vaccination with BCG remain unknown, as only a handful of studies have followed BCG responses in infants. Furthermore, most animal models currently used to study TB vaccine candidates rely on adult-aged animals. This presents unique challenges when transitioning to human trials in neonates or infants. In this Review, we focus on vaccine development in the field of TB and compare the relative utility of animal models used thus far to study neonatal and infant immunity.

Studies focusing on infiltrate localization often entail small cohorts, a mixture of HNSCC subsites, or focus on a single immune marker rather than the interaction between cells within the TME. Conclusions on the prognostic impact of specific immune cells in HNSCC are hampered by the use of heterogeneous or small cohorts.

The objective of this study was to analyze whether there is an association between the use of azithromycin and the evolution of the pulmonary disease or the time to discharge, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This was an observational study on a cohort of 418 patients admitted to three regional hospitals in Catalonia, Spain. As primary outcomes, we studied the evolution of SAFI ratio (oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen) in the first 48 hours of treatment and the time to discharge. The results were compared between patients treated and untreated with the study drug through subcohort analyses matched for multiple clinical and prognostic factors, as well as through analysis of non-matched subcohorts, using Cox multivariate models adjusted for prognostic factors. RESULTS: There were 239 patients treated with azithromycin. Of these, 29 patients treated with azithromycin could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. In the analysis of these matched subcohorts, SAFI at 48h had no significant changes associated to the use of azithromycin, though azithromycin treatment was associated with a longer time to discharge (10.0 days vs 6.7 days; log rank: p = 0.039). However, in the unmatched cohorts, the increased hospital stay associated to azithromycin use, was no significant after adjustment using Multivariate Cox regression models: hazard ratio 1.45 (IC95%: 0.88C2.41; p = 0.150). This study is limited by its small sample size and its observational nature; despite the strong pairing of the matched subcohorts and the adjustment of the Cox regression for multiple factors, the results may be affected by residual confusion.

Not all were equally affected. Mortality rates were particularly high in districts with a large share of black and coloured residents. To investigate why this happened, we transcribed 39,482 death certificates from the Cape Province. Using a novel indicator - whether a doctor's name appears on the death certificate - we argue that the unequal health outcomes were a consequence of unequal access to healthcare. Our results show that the racial inequalities in health outcomes that existed before October 1918 were exacerbated during the pandemic. Access to healthcare, as we expected, worsened for black and coloured residents of the Cape Province. Unexpectedly, however, we found that other inequalities were unchanged, or even reversed, notably age, occupation and location. Living in the city, for instance, became a health hazard rather than a benefit during the pandemic. These surprising results contradict the general assumption that all forms of inequality are exacerbated during a crisis. Our analyses suggest explanations for the widening racial gap in healthcare access during the 1918 pandemic, from both the demand and the supply side. We could find, however, no evidence of racial prejudice.

Chronic Plasmodium falciparum exposure affects the B cell compartment, leading to the accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs). IgM-positive (IgM(+)) and IgG(+) atMBCs have not been compared in-depth in the context of malaria, nor is it known if atMBCs in malaria-experienced individuals are different from phenotypically similar B cells in individuals with no known history of Plasmodium exposure. To address these questions, we characterized the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire of naive B cells (NBCs), IgM(+) and IgG(+) classical MBCs (cMBCs), and IgM(+) and IgG(+) atMBCs from 13 malaria-naive American adults and 7 malaria-experienced Ugandan adults. Our results demonstrate that P. falciparum exposure mainly drives changes in atMBCs. In comparison to malaria-naive adults, the BCR repertoire of Plasmodium-exposed adults showed increased levels of somatic hypermutation in the heavy chain V region in IgM(+) and IgG(+) atMBCs, shorter heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) in IgG(+) atMBCs, and increased usage of IGHV3-73 in IgG(+) cMBCs and both IgM(+) and IgG(+) atMBCs. Irrespective of Plasmodium exposure, IgM(+) atMBCs closely resembled NBCs, while IgG(+) atMBCs resembled IgG(+) cMBCs. Physicochemical properties of the HCDR3 seemed to be intrinsic to cell type and independent of malaria experience. The resemblance between atMBCs from Plasmodium-exposed and naive adults suggests similar differentiation pathways regardless of chronic antigen exposure. Moreover, these data demonstrate that IgM(+) and IgG(+) atMBCs are distinct populations that should be considered separately in future analyses. IMPORTANCE Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, still contributes to a high global burden of disease, mainly in children under 5 years of age. Chronic and recurrent Plasmodium infections affect the development of B cell memory against the parasite and promote the accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs), which have an unclear function in the immune response. Understanding where these cells originate from and whether they are beneficial in the immune response to Plasmodium will help inform vaccination development efforts. We found differences in B cell receptor (BCR) properties of atMBCs between malaria-naive and malaria-experienced adults that are suggestive of divergent selection processes, resulting in more somatic hypermutation and differential immunoglobulin heavy chain V (IGHV) gene usage. Despite these differences, atMBCs from malaria-naive and malaria-experienced adults also showed many similarities in BCR characteristics, such as physicochemical properties of the HCDR3 region, suggesting that atMBCs undergo similar differentiation pathways in response to different pathogens. Our study provides new insights into the effects of malaria experience on the B cell compartment and the relationships between atMBCs and other B cell populations.","output":"B Cell Receptor Repertoire Analysis in Malaria-Naive and Malaria-Experienced Individuals Reveals Unique Characteristics of Atypical Memory B Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the utilization of healthcare services; however, the impact on population-level emergency department (ED) utilization patterns for the treatment of acute injuries has not been fully characterized. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the frequency of North Carolina (NC) EDs visits for selected injury mechanisms during the first eleven months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January C November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. RESULTS: In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits. Visits related to assault (15%) and self-harm (10%) declined by smaller percentages. Medication/drug overdose visits increased (10%), the only injury mechanism studied to increase during this period. CONCLUSION: Both ED avoidance and decreased exposures may have contributed to these declines, creating implications for injury morbidity and mortality.

The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise the evidence comparing CRP serum levels (standard and high-sensitivity [hs]) of otherwise healthy patients suffering from periodontitis when compared to controls. The impact of intensive and non-intensive nonsurgical periodontal treatment (NSPT) on hs-CRP was also investigated. Four electronic databases (Pubmed, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], EMBASE and Web of Science) were searched up to February 2021 and the review was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO No. CRD42020167454). Observational and intervention studies that: 1) evaluated CRP and hs-CRP serum levels in patients with and without periodontitis, and; 2) hs- CRP levels after NSPT were included. Following risk of bias appraisal, both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Pooled estimates were rendered through ratio of means (RoM) random-effects meta-analyses. After screening 485 studies, 77 case-control studies and 67 intervention trials were included. Chronic and aggressive periodontitis diagnoses were consistently associated with higher levels of CRP and hs-CRP (p<0.001). Patients with aggressive periodontitis exhibited on average more than 50% higher levels of CRP (RoM [95% confidence interval [CI]]: 1.56 [1.15; 2.12], p=0.0039) than patients with chronic periodontitis. Intensive NSPT induced an immediate increase of hs-CRP followed by a progressive decrease whilst non-intensive NSPT consistently decreased hs-CRP after treatment up to 180 days (p<0.001). These findings provide robust evidence that periodontitis is associated with systemic inflammation as measured by serum CRP levels. Periodontitis treatment induces a short-term acute inflammatory increase when performed in an intensive session, whilst a progressive reduction up to 6 months was demonstrated when performed in multiple visits.","output":"Serum C-Reactive Protein and Periodontitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by acute and chronic condition as well as varying duration and severity.

METHODS: We conducted a two-phase controlled clinical study on healthy pregnant women between 27 to 32 weeks gestation. In phase I, energy expenditure corresponding to the workload of routine nursing tasks was determined. In phase II, pulmonary function of 20 subjects was measured whilst at rest and exercising to the predetermined workload while breathing ambient air first, then breathing through N95-mask materials. RESULTS: Exercising at 3 MET while breathing through N95-mask materials reduced mean tidal volume (TV) by 23.0 % (95 % CI ?33.5 % to ?10.5 %, p < 0.001) and lowered minute ventilation (VE) by 25.8 % (95 % CI ?34.2 % to ?15.8 %, p < 0.001), with no significant change in breathing frequency compared to breathing ambient air. Volumes of oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and carbon dioxide expired (VCO(2)) were also significantly reduced; VO(2) by 13.8 % (95 % CI ?24.2 % to ?3 %, p = 0.013) and VCO(2) by 17.7 %, (95 % CI ?28.1 % to ?8.6 %, p = 0.001). Although no changes in the inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were demonstrated, breathing through N95-mask materials during low intensity work (3 MET) reduced expired oxygen concentration by 3.2 % (95 % CI: ?4.1 % to ?2.2 %, p < 0.001), and increased expired carbon dioxide by 8.9 % (95 % CI: 6.9 % to 13.1 %; p <0.001) suggesting an increase in metabolism.

Our objective is to highlight shifts in ethics recommendations from the earlier 2012 UNAIDS guidance. DISCUSSION: We review recommendations related to four key issues, namely standard of prevention, post\\\\trial access to safe and effective vaccines, enrolment of adolescents and enrolment of pregnant women. We outline implications and make recommendations for the ethics review process, including suggested lines of inquiry by RECs and responses by applicants. CONCLUSIONS: There have been several shifts in the UNAIDS ethics guidance with implications for HIV vaccine researchers submitting applications for initial ethics review or re\\\\certification, and for RECs conducting such reviews. This review may assist RECs in a more efficient and consistent application of ethics recommendations.

This paper provides insight from pediatric educators about the current status and recommendations for pediatric-specific fourth-year leaders. Objective: To identify the prevalence of pediatric fourth-year medical student directors across the US and Canada and to compare current and ideal responsibilities for this role. Methods: Five multi-part questions were written and submitted for the 2019 Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics (COMSEP) Annual Survey and subsequently disseminated to all COMSEP member physicians. Anonymous responses were collected and results analyzed. The study was IRB exempt. Results: The program-level survey response rate was 79%. Of 115 respondent medical schools, 37% reported having a pediatric fourth-year director separate from the clerkship director, with an average of 9.8% full-time equivalent (FTE) protected time for the role. In contrast, individuals indicated 20% FTE would be ideal for fourth-year director responsibilities. The most common role identified for pediatric fourth-year directors was directing sub-internships. Respondents indicated it would be ideal for pediatric fourth-year directors to have an increased level of involvement in all areas queried in the survey, especially directing a pediatric residency preparatory course/boot camp, faculty development for educators of fourth-year students, and remediating fourth-year students. Conclusions: As specialty-specific experiences have grown in the fourth year of medical school, there is an increasing demand for faculty leadership separate from direction of the pediatric clerkship. In this national survey, pediatric educators expressed a need for additional protected time to lead fourth-year specific activities. Similar findings in other disciplines would support advocating for more protected time and expanded roles for specialty-specific fourth-year directors nationally.","output":"Essential yet Ill-defined: leadership roles to support fourth-year medical students in pediatrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (from Coronavirus Disease 2019) is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have rapidly adapted how they deliver patient care. PPE Portraits are a form of adaptation, whereby health workers affix a postcard size portrait of themselves to the front of their personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to foster human connection during COVID-19. Methods: We used the expanded framework for reporting adaptations and modifications to evidence-based interventions (FRAME) method to better understand the reasoning behind and results of each adaptation. Throughout multiple implementations across 25 institutions, we piloted, tracked and analyzed adaptations using FRAME and design thinking. For each adaptation, we assessed the stage of implementation, whether the change was planned, decision makers involved, level of delivery impacted, fidelity to original intervention, and the goal and reasoning for adaptation. We added three crucial components to the FRAME: original purpose of the adaptation, unintended consequences, and alternative adaptations. Results: When implementing PPE Portraits across settings, from a local assisted living centers memory unit to a pediatric emergency department, several requests for adaptations arose during early development stages before implementation. Adaptations primarily related to 1) provider convenience and comfort, 2) patient populations, and 3) scale. Providers preferred smaller portraits and rounded (rather than square) laminated edges that could potentially injure a patient. Affixing the portrait with a magnet was rejected given the potential choking hazard the magnetic strip presented for children. Other adaptations related to ease of dissemination included slowing the process down during early development and providing buttons, which could be produced easily at scale. Conclusion: The FRAME was used to curate the reasoning for each adaptation and to inform future dissemination.

Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they can be expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, in the absence of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be significantly higher than that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be incorporated in the mechanism for estimating the key epidemiological parameters, like rate of transmission, rate of recovery, reproduction rate, etc., and hence, for forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a new dynamic version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to assimilate the impact of the time-varying proportion of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As a demonstration, the proposed methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida.

Further, posterior estimates obtained from the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model show that average reproduction numbers associated with undetected infectives [California: 1.464; Florida: 1.612] are substantially higher than those associated with quarantined infectives [California: 0.497; Florida: 0.359].

We aimed to investigate the combined effect of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB: losartan) on an ongoing hepatic fibrosis in a NASH rat model. METHODS Fischer 344 rats were fed with choline-deficient L-amino-acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 16 weeks. After 8-week administration of CDAA diet, OCA, losartan, or a combination of these drugs was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks by oral gavage. The in vivo and in vitro effects of OCA + losartan and liver fibrosis progression, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade, and gut barrier function were evaluated. RESULTS OCA + losartan alleviated hepatic fibrosis progression by suppressing -SMA expression. It inhibited the proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cell (Ac-HSC) and mRNA expression of hepatic transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), TLR4, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and decreased the hydroxyproline levels. OCA increased the hepatic matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) mRNA expression. OCA decreased the mRNA expression of hepatic LPS-binding protein and intestinal permeability by ameliorating the disruption of CDAA diet-induced zonula occludens-1. Losartan directly inhibited the proliferation of Ac-HSC. The in vitro suppressive effects of OCA + losartan on the mRNA expressions of TGF-1 and 1(I)-procollagen, TLR4, and TIMP-1 in Ac-HSCs were almost in parallel. CONCLUSIONS OCA + losartan suppressed the ongoing hepatic fibrosis by attenuating gut barrier dysfunction and suppressing Ac-HSC proliferation. Combined therapy may be a promising novel approach for NASH with fibrosis.","output":"Effect of combined farnesoid X receptor agonist and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker on ongoing hepatic fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.recesp.2020.04.002.].","output":"Correccin en el artculo de Rodrguez et al. ?Ejercitarse en tiempos de la COVID-19: ?qu recomiendan hacer los expertos entre cuatro paredes??, Rev Esp Cardiol. 2020;73:527-529"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper attempts to research in two parts, the first part aims to study the Herding Behavior in the sectors of the Egyptian Stock Exchange, when the second part aims to study the factors that affect the Herding Behavior according to the identification of those factors.

However, e-payment has not been able to achieve a trustworthy level in e-commerce transactions. Thus, cash payment methods with Cash On Delivery (COD) services still dominate C2C e-commerce payment transactions in Indonesia. This study aims to investigate factors that affect users' switching intentions from COD to e-payment services. The research model was adopted by using the Push-Pull-Mooring framework, integrating perceived COVID-19 risk, technology acceptance, and transaction effort. Empirical research was conducted using data from 546 COD and e-payment users in Indonesia, with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) being used to validate the model and analyze the hypotheses. The results indicate that switching intention from COD to e-payment is significantly influenced by pull factors in e-payment, which are economic benefits, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and critical mass. There are also two mooring factors that significantly influence the switching intention from COD to e-payment, which are trust and perceived security and privacy. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature in terms of validating a theoretical framework that emphasizes factors that influence user switching intentions from COD to e-payment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This research can be a reference for Indonesian payment system regulators and e-payment service providers in formulating regulations and strategies to accelerate the spread of digital transactions in Indonesia. ? 2022 by the authors.

Genomic RNA from cell-cultured PRCV (French isolate RM4) was used to produce cDNA clones covering the genomic 3' end to the start of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene (7519 nucleotides). Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified that allowed the translation of three coronavirus structural proteins and three putative non-structural (NS) polypeptides, homologous to TGEV ORFs designated NS3-1, NS4 and NS7. Pairwise alignment of PRCV nucleotide and amino acid sequences with sequence data available for three TGEV strains revealed a 96% overall homology. However, the genome of PRCV exhibited two important distinctive features. The first was that the S gene lacked 672 nucleotides in the 5' region and encoded a truncated form of the S polypeptide, and secondly, the first NS ORF downstream of the S gene was predicted to be non-functional as a consequence of a double deletion.

A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in military hospitals in France among adult outpatients attending COVID-19 diagnosis centers or hospitalized patients. For each patient, all samples were obtained and analyzed simultaneously with RT-PCR or transcription-mediated amplification method. Clinical signs, feasibility, and acceptability for each type of sample were collected. A total of 1220 patients were included, corresponding to 1205 NPS and saliva and 771 OS. Compared to NPS, the sensitivity, specificity, and kappa coefficient for tests performed on saliva were 87.8% (95% CI 83.3C92.3), 97.1% (95% CI 96.1C98.1), and 0.84 (95% CI 0.80C0.88). Analytical performances were better in symptomatic patients. Ct values were significantly lower in NPS than saliva. For OS, sensitivity was estimated to be 61.1% (95% CI 52.7C69.4) and Kappa coefficient to be 0.69 (95% CI 0.62C0.76).

T2*-weighted MRI images can be processed to produce quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) and R2* maps. These reflect iron and myelin concentrations, which are altered in many pathophysiological processes. The relaxation parameters of human brain tissue are such that R2* mapping and QSM show particularly strong gains in contrast-to-noise ratio at ultra-high field (7T) vs clinical field strengths (1.5 - 3T). We aimed to determine the inter-subject and inter-site reproducibility of QSM and R2* mapping at 7T, in readiness for future multi-site clinical studies. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were scanned with harmonised single- and multi-echo T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences. Participants were scanned five times at each home site and once at each of four other sites. The five sites had 1x Philips, 2x Siemens Magnetom, and 2x Siemens Terra scanners. QSM and R2* maps were computed with the Multi-Scale Dipole Inversion (MSDI) algorithm (https://github.com/fil-physics/Publication-Code). Results were assessed in relevant subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) defined manually or by the MNI152 standard space. Results and Discussion Mean susceptibility () and R2* values agreed broadly with literature values in all ROIs. The inter-site within-subject standard deviation was 0.001 C 0.005 ppm () and 0.0005 C 0.001 ms-1 (R2*). For  this is 2.1-4.8 fold better than 3T reports, and 1.1-3.4 fold better for R2*. The median ICC from within- and cross-site R2* data was 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Multi-echo QSM had greater variability vs single-echo QSM especially in areas with large B0 inhomogeneity such as the inferior frontal cortex. Across sites, R2* values were more consistent than QSM in subcortical structures due to differences in B0-shimming. On a between-subject level, our measured  and R2* cross-site variance is comparable to within-site variance in the literature, suggesting that it is reasonable to pool data across sites using our harmonised protocol. Conclusion The harmonized UK7T protocol and pipeline delivers on average a 3-fold improvement in the coefficient of reproducibility for QSM and R2* at 7T compared to previous reports of multi-site reproducibility at 3T.

It is a significant societal and public health problem with potential psychological, social, and economic consequences. Furthermore, infertility has been linked to adverse long-term health outcomes. Despite the advanced diagnostic and therapeutic techniques available, approximately 30% of infertile couples do not obtain a live birth after fertility treatment. For these couples, there are no further options to increase their chances of a successful pregnancy and live birth. OBJECTIVES Three overall questions will be studied: 1) What are the risk factors and natural life courses of infertility, early embryonic loss, and adverse pregnancy outcomes? 2) Can we develop new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for fecundity and treatment success? And 3) what are the health characteristics of women and men in infertile couples at the time of fertility treatment and during long-term follow-up? MATERIAL AND METHODS ReproUnion Biobank and Infertility Cohort (RUBIC) is established as an add-on to the routine fertility management at Copenhagen University Hospital Departments in the Capital Region of Denmark and Reproductive Medicine Centre at Sk?ne University Hospital in Sweden. The aim is to include a total of 5000 couples equally distributed between Denmark and Sweden. The first patients were enrolled in June 2020. All eligible infertile couples are prospectively asked to participate in the project. Participants complete an extensive questionnaire and undergo a physical examination and collection of bio-specimens (blood, urine, hair, saliva, rectal swabs, feces, semen, endometrial biopsies, and vaginal swabs). After the cohort is established, the couples will be linked to the Danish and Swedish national registers to obtain information on parental, perinatal, childhood, and adult life histories, including disease and medication history.

Methods: Patients with confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia discharged from Wuhan Third Hospital Guanggu Campus, Shouyi Campus, and Lei Shen Shan Hospital from January 31, 2020, to March 4, 2020, were included. The patients were divided into treatment and control groups according to whether methylprednisolone was used during hospitalization. Propensity score (PS) matching analysis was used to assess in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome and trends in the changes in lymphocytes and the C-reactive protein, creatinine and transaminase levels 7 days after admission (secondary outcomes). Results: A total of 2,062 patients with confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study. Univariate Cox regression analysis suggested that methylprednisolone treatment was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 3.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62-5.23, P<0.01). A total of 624 patients were included after PS matching. The patients were further subdivided into a low lymphocyte count group and a normal lymphocyte count group according to a lymphocyte count cutoff value of 0.9*10 9 /L. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that methylprednisolone treatment reduced the risk of in-hospital death in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.910 9 /L (P=0.022).

These receptors trigger inflammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1]. TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during inflammation (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten different TLR have been identified in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of effector functions, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1). In this chapter, the role of CD14 as an accessory receptor for TLR in lung inflammation and infection is discussed.

Phylogenetic groups of gut bacteria involved in the metabolism of short chain fatty acids were depleted in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We aimed to characterize functional profile of gut microbiome in patients with COVID-19 before and after disease resolution. Methods We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples from 66 antibiotics-na?ve patients with COVID-19 and 70 non-COVID-19 controls. Serial fecal samples were collected (up to 6 times points) during hospitalization and beyond one month after discharge. We assessed gut microbial pathways in association with disease severity and blood inflammatory markers. We also determined changes of microbial functions in fecal samples before and after disease resolution and validated these functions using targeted analysis of fecal metabolites. Results Compared with non-COVID-19 controls, COVID-19 patients with severe/critical illness showed significant alterations in gut microbiome functionality (P < .001), characterized by impaired capacity of gut microbiome for short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and L-isoleucine biosynthesis and enhanced capacity for urea production. Impaired SCFA and L-isoleucine biosynthesis in gut microbiome persisted beyond 30 days after recovery in COVID-19 patients. Targeted analysis of fecal metabolites showed significantly lower fecal concentrations of SCFAs and L-isoleucine in COVID-19 patients before and after disease resolution. Lack of SCFA and L-isoleucine biosynthesis significantly correlated with disease severity and increased plasma concentrations of CXCL-10, NT-proBNP, C-reactive protein (CRP) (all P < .05).

The Italian Society for Rheumatology promptly launched a retrospective and anonymised data collection to monitor COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), the CONTROL-19 surveillance database, which is part of the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance. METHODS CONTROL-19 includes patients with RMDs and proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) updated until May 3rd 2020. In this analysis, only molecular diagnoses were included. The data collection covered demographic data, medical history (general and RMD-related), treatments and COVID-19 related features, treatments, and outcome. In this paper, we report the first descriptive data from the CONTROL-19 registry. RESULTS The population of the first 232 patients (36% males) consisted mainly of elderly patients (mean age 62.2 years), who used corticosteroids (51.7%), and suffered from multi-morbidity (median comorbidities 2). Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent disease (34.1%), followed by spondyloarthritis (26.3%), connective tissue disease (21.1%) and vasculitis (11.2%). Most cases had an active disease (69.4%). Clinical presentation of COVID-19 was typical, with systemic symptoms (fever and asthenia) and respiratory symptoms. The overall outcome was severe, with high frequencies of hospitalisation (69.8%), respiratory support oxygen (55.7%), non-invasive ventilation (20.9%) or mechanical ventilation (7.5%), and 19% of deaths. Male patients typically manifested a worse prognosis. Immunomodulatory treatments were not significantly associated with an increased risk of intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation/death. CONCLUSIONS Although the report mainly includes the most severe cases, its temporal and spatial trend supports the validity of the national surveillance system. More complete data are being acquired in order to both test the hypothesis that RMD patients may have a different outcome from that of the general population and determine the safety of immunomodulatory treatments.","output":"COVID-19 in rheumatic diseases in Italy: first results from the Italian registry of the Italian Society for Rheumatology (CONTROL-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"֧. ѧ ާӧѧߧ ߧ ٧ҧܧ ާ֧էݧԧ ӧڧҧ ߧѧۧܧѧ! էߧ!' ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ էݧ էѧӧܧ ߧѧڧߧڧ ӧѧߧѧا. ֧էڧܧ. ڧ֧ާߧڧ  ӧڧܧڧӧ֧ էݧ ާѧݧԧѧ ٧ѧէѧ1 ӧڧҧ ڧާѧݧߧ! ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ: ٧ ާѧߧڧާ ӧڧѧѧާ ӧڧ٧ߧѧѧ֧ ӧ ߧܧ, ѧݧ֧ߧѧڧӧ ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ  ڧ֧ݧ ѧѧާ֧ ܧ ٧ѧӧ (ӧѧߧ էѧӧܧ  ӧѧԧ ѧ ӧѧߧѧا) ӧڧ٧ߧѧ֧  ܧ֧1 ٧ާ,  ӧڧѧէܧ1 ٧ާ,  ֧էѧӧݧ ֧ߧݧ ѧѧާ֧ ֧ ҧݧԧӧӧѧߧߧ, ӧڧܧڧӧ էݧ ӧѧӧѧߧߧ ӧݧڧӧ ߧѧӧܧݧڧߧԧ ֧֧էӧڧ ߧ ݧڧߧڧ ݧѧߧ. ѧ֧ާѧڧߧ ާէ֧ݧ ӧڧ٧ߧѧѧ ߧܧߧѧݧߧ ٧ѧݧ֧ا1 ާѧߧڧ ӧڧѧ '֧ܧ  ݧѧߧԧ էѧӧܧ 1 ѧѧާ֧ ܧ ٧ѧӧ էݧ էӧ ѧݧ֧ߧѧڧӧߧڧ ܧ: էѧӧܧ  ֧֧ӧѧݧܧ  էߧާ ӧѧߧѧاߧާ ֧ާѧ1  էѧӧܧ ٧ ѧ էӧ ֧1ߧѧ1.  էѧ1 ߧܧ1ߧѧݧߧԧ ѧߧѧ1٧ ާ ӧڧ٧ߧѧѧ֧ާ 1ѧѧ٧ߧ ѧѧާ֧1 ܧ ٧ѧӧ, էݧ ܧڧ ӧڧܧڧѧߧߧ ܧߧܧ֧ߧ! ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧ٧֧ ާѧݧߧڧާ ާѧߧڧާ ӧڧѧѧާ. ֧٧ݧѧ. ܧ֧ڧާ֧ߧѧݧ էݧا֧ߧߧ, ӧ֧է֧!  ѧӧѧߧߧ էӧ ѧݧ֧ߧѧڧӧߧڧ ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ, ܧѧ٧ѧݧ,  ڧާѧݧߧ ֧ߧߧ ӧѧ1֧  ٧ѧݧ֧اߧ ! ٧ߧѧ֧ߧ ѧѧާ֧1 ٧ѧӧ. ڧާѧ ֧٧ݧѧ է٧ӧݧ ӧ֧էاӧѧ,  1ѧѧ٧ߧ ѧ٧ߧ ڧݧӧڧ ѧѧާ֧ ܧ ٧ѧӧ ާا ҧ ӧڧ٧ߧѧ֧ էݧ ҧԧߧӧѧߧߧ ڧާѧݧߧ! ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ էѧӧܧ ڧڧ ӧѧߧѧا. ѧܧӧ ߧӧڧ٧ߧ.  ҧ ӧ֧ ӧѧߧӧݧ֧ ٧ѧݧ֧اߧ ٧ѧԧѧݧߧڧ ݧ1ڧߧڧ ӧڧѧ ! էѧݧߧ էѧӧܧ  ӧѧԧ ѧ!  ѧѧާ֧ ܧ ٧ѧӧ ߧ ֧֧ӧ֧٧֧ߧߧ ߧѧڧߧڧ ӧѧߧѧا. ѧܧڧߧ ٧ߧѧڧާ. ѧߧӧѧߧڧ ާ֧էڧߧڧ 1է1 ާا ҧ ӧڧܧڧѧߧڧ ֧ܧ֧էڧѧާ էݧ ҧԧߧӧѧߧߧ ڧާѧݧߧԧ ӧѧߧ ֧֧ ߧѧӧߧڧ ѧݧ֧ߧѧڧӧߧڧ ܧ ݧڧߧԧ ݧѧߧԧ էݧ էѧӧܧ ӧѧߧѧا  ٧ѧէѧߧڧާ ӧѧߧߧ էѧӧܧ  ӧѧԧ ѧ! ӧѧߧѧا.Alternate abstract:Purpose. The paper aims to develop the methodology for choosing the best available structure of a logistics chain for deliveries of bulk cargoes. Methodology. The systematic approach is used to formalize the problem of choosing the optimal structure of a logistics chain: the total expenses are used to define the goal function, alternative logistics chain structures and numeric parameters of the request flow (the delivery distance and the consignment weight) are defined as control variables, and the random variables representing technological paramete s of servicing processes are used to consider the influence of the environment on the logistics chain. The mathematical model defines the functional dependence of the total expenses on the entities within the delivery chain on the request flow parameters for two alternative structures: the delivery with transshipment in one freight terminal and the delivery through two terminals. By using functional analysis, we define the ranges of the request flow parameters where the use of a given logistics chain structure is characterized by minimal total expenses. Findings. The experimental studies conducted considering two alternative logistics chain structures have shown that the better solution varies depending on the values of the request parameters. It allowed us to state that the ranges of the numeric parameters of the request flow may be defined to substantiate the optimal logistics chain structure for deliveries of bulk loads. Originality. The dependencies of the total logistics expenses on the delivery distance and the consignment weight as the parameters of the flow of requests for bulk cargo transportation have been defined in the paper for the first time.

The role of household transmission in the population spread of SARS-CoV-2, and of host immunity in limiting transmission, is poorly understood. This paper describes a protocol for a prospective observational study of a cohort of households in Liverpool City Region, UK, which addresses the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between household members and how immunological response to the infection changes over time. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Households in the Liverpool City Region, in which members have not previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a nucleic acid amplification test, are followed up for an initial period of 12 weeks. Participants are asked to provide weekly self-throat and nasal swabs and record their activity and presence of symptoms. Incidence of infection and household secondary attack rates of COVID-19 are measured. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be investigated against a range of demographic and behavioural variables. Blood and faecal samples are collected at several time points to evaluate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence and risk factors for faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee; REC Reference: 20/HRA/2297, IRAS Number: 283 464. Results will be disseminated through scientific conferences and peer-reviewed open access publications. A report of the findings will also be shared with participants. The study will quantify the scale and determinants of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, immunological responses before and during the different stages of infection will be analysed, adding to the understanding of the range of immunological response by infection severity.","output":"Prospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission and immunity in a cohort of households in Liverpool City Region, UK (COVID-LIV): a study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse syndrome is associated with a high risk of death.

In the present study, we evaluated if AAV manipulates the UPR pathways during its infection. We first examined the role of the three major UPR axes, namely, endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in AAV infected cells. Total RNA from mock or AAV infected HeLa cells were used to determine the levels of 8 different ER-stress responsive transcripts from these pathways. We observed a significant up-regulation of IRE1 (up to 11 fold) and PERK (up to 8 fold) genes 12C48 hours after infection with self-complementary (sc)AAV2 but less prominent with single-stranded (ss)AAV2 vectors. Further studies demonstrated that scAAV1 and scAAV6 also induce cellular UPR in vitro, with AAV1 vectors activating the PERK pathway (3 fold) while AAV6 vectors induced a significant increase on all the three major UPR pathways [6C16 fold]. These data suggest that the type and strength of UPR activation is dependent on the viral capsid. We then examined if transient inhibition of UPR pathways by RNA interference has an effect on AAV transduction. siRNA mediated silencing of PERK and IRE1 had a modest effect on AAV2 and AAV6 mediated gene expression (1.5C2 fold) in vitro. Furthermore, hepatic gene transfer of scAAV2 vectors in vivo, strongly elevated IRE1 and PERK pathways (2 and 3.5 fold, respectively). However, when animals were pre-treated with a pharmacological UPR inhibitor (metformin) during scAAV2 gene transfer, the UPR signalling and its subsequent inflammatory response was attenuated concomitant to a modest 2.8 fold increase in transgene expression.

Reverse logistics is a waste management strategy whose application to public pharmaceutical care processes faces legal restrictions and incertitude. Nevertheless, reverse logistics of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines may be both a saving and an environmental strategy in developing countries that manage health under limited resources. How to overcome restrictions to reverse logistics mainly in the context of primary health level? This study aims to investigate the most relevant critical factors for implementing medicine waste management in pharmaceutical care process. The unit analysis is the primary health level process in a developing country capital. Considering the characteristics of the issue at hand, it was designed a qualitative study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were key individuals who work directly with the processfrom administering medicine to patients to managing waste at the end of the medicines lifespan or after its use. Results indicated that despite reverse logistics arising from end users is legally forbidden, another type of reverse flow emerged from process analysis. The reverse flow, named reassignment flow, consists of still useful end-of-use medicines exchanged among the 10 government-ran pharmacies and over 140 health centers, where healthcare professionals administer and offer guidance on how to use them correctly. Another result was the identification of the most critical factors in implementing reverse logistics strategies in the public management context. The factors mentioned included aspects pertaining to management, information technology, infrastructure, and government, but they differ from the private context management, in which decision-makers has more freedom. Due to the barriers named by interviewees, the political barriers and complexity of primary health system, results of this investigation point to (i) reinforcing the reassignment flows inside pharmaceutical care logistics cycle, for saving purposes, and (ii) further development of a specific management unit to perform reverse logistics of end-of-use medicines arising from consumers, for environmental purposes. In times of shortage or resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to know the critical factors is a step necessary in overcoming the current restrictions in direction of a well-succeeded medicines reverse logistics, either of reassignment or from final consumers. These results clarify the literature on end-of-use and end-of-life medicines reverse logistics. It also provides managers of 5000 municipalities in the country a perspective on the most relevant critical factors involved in their decision-making process, concerning the reuse of end-of-use medicines or the adequate disposal of end-of-life medicines in the environment.

The objective of this study was to determine the mortality and recovery rates at 30 days from the first unlock phase after five phases of lockdown. The the number of infected people has continually increased, and currently, this pandemic continues to present challenges to public health. Subject and methods: Statistical analysis was used to calculate the mortality rate, ratio between active and death cases, active cases and recovered cases, recovered and death cases in India during the first 30 days of the unlock phase. Results: The relationship between the new cases, deaths and recovered cases, shows that the new and recovered cases increased progressively. From the scatter plot of daily deaths and new cases, the R2 value is 0.0047. That means the death ratio is low against the new cases. Also, if we look at another scatter plot, the ratio between new cases and recovery rate shows the R2 value is 0.8015. That means the recovery rate was very high during the study period in India. The R2 value of daily recovery and death is 0.0072. India faced a huge number of new coronavirus cases and increased death rate every day during the first unlock phase.

METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed COVID-19 patients who underwent multiple chest CT scans during their disease course. Quantitative lung CT was used to determine the nature and volume of lung involvement. A semi-quantitative scoring system was also used to evaluate lung lesions. RESULTS: This study included eighteen cases (4 cases in mild type, 10 cases in moderate type, 4 cases in severe type, and without critical type cases) with confirmed COVID-19. Patients had a mean hospitalized period of 24.1  7.1 days (range: 14C38 days) and underwent an average CT scans of 3.9  1.6 (range: 2C8). The total volumes of lung abnormalities reached a peak of 8.8  4.1 days (range: 2C14 days). The ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume percentage was higher than the consolidative opacity (CO) volume percentage on the first CT examination (Z = 2.229, P = 0.026), and there was no significant difference between the GGO volume percentage and that of CO at the peak stage (Z = - 0.628, P = 0.53). The volume percentage of lung involvement identified by AI demonstrated a strong correlation with the total CT scores at each stage (r = 0.873, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative lung CT can automatically identify the nature of lung involvement and quantify the dynamic changes of lung lesions on CT during COVID-19.

In total 71.5% (108) had antibodies titer level of >250, which were mostly found in participants of younger age and who had previous COVID-19 infection. However, antibodies titer level of >250 were observed in 84% (21/25) at 61 to 90 days of vaccination, which declined to 80% (20/25) after 91 to 120 days and to 57.1% (32/56) after >120 days of vaccination. Conclusions Good antibodies titer levels were observed in vaccinated healthcare workers, especially in those who were younger and had previous COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 Antibodies in Vaccinated Healthcare Workers: The Security Currency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backgound Novel corona virus(SARS-CoV-2) which emerged from Wuhan, China, has spread to whole worlds very rapidly causing enormous health effect and death Current publications worldwide showed that COVID-19 is a disease involving multiple system of the body with many unusual presentations So physicians face the challenges to manage it in the hospital Case report The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti diuretic hormone (SIADH) is one of the most common causes of hyponatremia accounts for approximately one-third of all cases In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extra cellular fluid volume, both clinically and laboratory measurement Several infections associated with SIADH have been reported Howover, Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) associated with SIADH were only few cases reported We are presenting a case of 70 year old female admitted with unconsciousness later diagnosed as severe hyponatremia along with COVID-19 complicated with severe pneumonia","output":"COVID-19 presented with syndrome of inappropriate ADH SECRETION(SIADH):a case report from Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The objective is to assess the role of functional, clinical, and analytic parameters in predicting mortality in older patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. DESIGN: Cohort study with a mean follow-up of 12.8 days. SETTING: Public university hospital (Madrid, Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 499 patients 80 and above consecutively admitted to a Spanish public university hospital between 4 March 2020 and 16 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Mortality was the main outcome. Data of sociodemographic variables (age, sex, living), comorbidities, polypharmacy, functional status, date of hospital admission and length of stay was recorded. Clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings were collected at time of admission. For multivariant analysis, logistic regressions were performed to identify risk factors for death. RESULTS: Mean age was 86.74.4 with 37% of death. Mortality was associated with male gender [odds ratio (OR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01C2.24], with a 5-points increase on Barthel Index [OR 1.01 (95%CI 1.00C1.02)], higher Charlson Index score [OR 1.13 (95%CI 1.02C1.26)] and comorbidities [OR 1.28 (95%CI 1.06C1.53)], hyperpolipharmacy [OR 2.00 (95%CI 1.04C3.82)], unilateral pneumonia [OR 1.83 (95%CI 1.01C3.30)], higher levels of C-reactive protein [OR 1.09 (95%CI 1.06C1.12)] and creatine [OR 1.48 (95%CI 1.15C1.89)]. Higher oxygen levels were a protective factor [OR 0.92 (95%CI 0.89C0.95)]. CONCLUSIONS: Functional status, being male, a higher burden of comorbidities, hyperpolipharmacy, unilateral pneumonia and some laboratory parameters predict in-hospital mortality in this older population. The knowledge of these mortality risk factors should be used to improve the survival of older hospitalized patients.","output":"Functional, Clinical, and Sociodemographic Variables Associated with Risk of In-Hospital Mortality by COVID-19 in People over 80 Years Old"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the media has often mentioned the presence of quinine in tonic water. Media accounts of quinine's antiviral effect in vitro, as well as press reports about quinine-based compounds, such as hydroxychloroquine, have sparked renewed public interest in drinking tonic water, which could perhaps result in an increase in allergic phenomena. On the 200th anniversary of the discovery of quinine, our main objective was to analyze hypersensitivity reactions, related to the consumption of beverages containing quinine, described in the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed case reports indexed on Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. A quinine causality score was calculated for each of the observations. A quinine assay was performed on several beverages for which the quinine content had not been published. RESULTS: In parallel with related pharmacokinetic studies, these case reports consist of 26 observations. The case reports mainly related to young men, with symptoms of varying severity, mainly dermatological, with fixed drug eruption, generalized rashes, hives; hematological, with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy; more rarely ocular, cardiac or auditory. The level of causality of quinine is certain for three cases, probable for twenty-two, possible for two. The levels of quinine, all conforming to the standards, were lower in the spirits and the cooked wine than those of tonic water. DISCUSSION: Possibly under-diagnosed, the main mechanism of these reactions is immuno-allergic, without any cross-reaction with other quinolines having been shown. In these patients and breastfeeding women of G6PD deficient newborns, any medicines, phytotherapy, homeopathy, or even cosmetics containing quinine, on the basis of a proposed list, should be avoided.","output":"Eau tonique et quinine C un cocktail de bicentenaire servi en pleine effervescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been deemed a global health pandemic. The early detection of COVID-19 is key to combating its outbreak and could help bring this pandemic to an end. One of the biggest challenges in combating COVID-19 is accurate testing for the disease. Utilizing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images can help radiologists compare and validate their results with an automated system. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed network, dubbed CORONA-Net, that can accurately detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. CORONA-Net is divided into two phases: (1) The reinitialization phase and (2) the classification phase. In the reinitialization phase, the network consists of encoder and decoder networks. The objective of this phase is to train and initialize the encoder and decoder networks by a distribution that comes out of medical images. In the classification phase, the decoder network is removed from CORONA-Net, and the encoder network acts as a backbone network to fine-tune the classification phase based on the learned weights from the reinitialization phase. Extensive experiments were performed on a publicly available dataset, COVIDx, and the results show that CORONA-Net significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art networks with an overall accuracy of 95.84%.","output":"CORONA-Net: Diagnosing COVID-19 from X-ray Images Using Re-Initialization and Classification Networks"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/51.md","filePath":"drive/51.md"}'),V={name:"drive/51.md"},E=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
