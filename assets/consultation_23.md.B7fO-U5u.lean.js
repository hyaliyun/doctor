In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from January 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020. Case reports and case series of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers screened 366 studies and 14 studies were included. Four reviewers independently extracted the features from the studies. We used a random-effects model to analyse the incidence (P) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 236 pregnant women with COVID-19. The results were as follows: positive CT findings (71%; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93), caesarean section (65%; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), fever (51%; 95% CI, 0.35-0.67), lymphopenia (49%; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), coexisting disorders (33%; 95% CI, 0.21-0.44), cough (31%; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39), fetal distress (29%; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), preterm labor (23%; 95% CI, 0.14-0.32), and severe case or death (12%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.20). The subgroup analysis showed that compared with non-pregnant patients, pregnant women with COVID-19 had significantly lower incidences of fever (pregnant women, 51%; non-pregnant patients, 91%; P < 0.00001) and cough (pregnant women, 31%; non-pregnant patients, 67%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of fever, cough and positive CT findings in pregnant women with COVID-19 are less than those in the normal population with COVID-19, but the rate of preterm labor is higher among pregnant with COVID-19 than among normal pregnant women. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through vertical transmission.","output":"Clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in workers of radio and television (TV) in Sergipe state, Northeast Brazil.

The prevalence is not known because infected individuals may be asymptomatic. In addition, the use of specific diagnostic tests is not always conclusive, raising doubts about the etiology of the disease. The best diagnostic method and the ideal time of collection remains the subject of study. The gold standard for diagnosing COVID 19 is the RT PCR molecular test, usually using an oropharynx and nasopharynx swab. Its sensitivity is 70% and drops significantly after the second week of symptoms. Serological tests, in turn, have increased sensitivity after 14 days, and can contribute to the diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected, even with negative RT PCR. Our study showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% of the serological test (ELISA method) for cases of viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, suggesting that this test could assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial changes that have not yet been etiologically clarified. We found a greater immune response in men, regardless of the severity of symptoms. The greater the severity, the higher the levels of IgA and IgG, mainly found in patients with multilobar impairment and in need for oxygen.

Artificial intelligence methods for automated classification of COVID-19 on CT scans have been found to be very promising. However, current investigation of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT data is limited. This study presents an investigation on 16 pretrained CNNs for classification of COVID-19 using a large public database of CT scans collected from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 subjects. The results show that, using only 6 epochs for training, the CNNs achieved very high performance on the classification task. Among the 16 CNNs, DenseNet-201, which is the deepest net, is the best in terms of accuracy, balance between sensitivity and specificity, [Formula: see text] score, and area under curve. Furthermore, the implementation of transfer learning with the direct input of whole image slices and without the use of data augmentation provided better classification rates than the use of data augmentation.

However, there remains a lack of clarity for clinicians during the consent process. This study quantifies additional perioperative risks for Covid-19 positive patients undergoing neck of femur fracture surgery and establishes an evidence-based framework for facilitating informed consent during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: 259 patients undergoing neck of femur fracture surgery in four hospitals at the epicentre of the United Kingdoms first wave of Covid-19 were recruited. 51 patients were positive for Covid-19. Predefined outcomes were recorded in a 30-day postoperative period. RESULTS: Odds of intensive care admission were 4.64 times higher (95% CI 1.59-13.50, p = 0.005) and odds of 30-day mortality were 3 times higher (95% CI 1.22-7.40, p = 0.02) in Covid-19 positive patients. 74.5% of Covid-19 positive patients suffered post-operative complications. 35.3% of Covid-19 positive patients developed lower respiratory tract infection with 13.7% progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 9.8% of Covid-19 positive patients experienced symptomatic thromboembolic events with a 3.9% incidence of pulmonary emboli. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of Covid-19 on the informed consent process for neck of femur fracture surgery are profound.

We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anti-cancer therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between March 17-November 18, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anti-cancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients). RESULTS: 4,966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2,872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse ECOG performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count, high absolute neutrophil count, low platelet count, abnormal creatinine, troponin, LDH, and CRP were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anti-cancer therapies (e.g. R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality.

Efforts have concentrated on managing this crisis, with impact on cancer care unclear. We investigated the impact on endoscopy services and gastrointestinal (GI) cancer diagnosis in the UK. DESIGN: Analysis of endoscopy procedures and cancer diagnosis at a UK Major General Hospital. Procedure rates and diagnosis of GI malignancy were examined over 8-week periods in spring, summer and autumn 2019 before the start of the crisis and were compared with rates since onset of national lockdown and restrictions on elective endoscopy. The number of CT scans performed and malignancies diagnosed in the two corresponding periods in 2019 and 2020 were also evaluated. RESULTS: 2 698 2516 and 3074 endoscopic procedures were performed in 2019, diagnosing 64, 73 and 78 cancers, respectively, the majority being in patients with alarm symptoms and fecal immunochemical test+ve bowel cancer screening population. Following initiation of new guidelines for management of endoscopy services 245 procedures were performed in a 6 week duration, diagnosing 18 cancers. This equates to potentially delayed diagnosis of 37 cancers per million population per month. Clinician triage improved, resulting in 13.6 procedures performed to diagnose one cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate an 88% reduction in procedures during the first 6 weeks of COVID-19 crisis, resulting in 66% fewer GI cancer diagnoses.

The FISI scores reduced between preoperative status and 1 year after surgery [32 (13-61) vs 11 (0-33), P < 0.0001]. The CSS scores also reduced [preoperative 12 (5-18) vs 1 year 5 (1-12), P < 0.0001]. Compared with the preoperative scores, almost all of the scale scores on the three kinds of QOL instruments significantly improved over time. The presence of new-onset or persistent RAI did not have an adverse effect on the improvement of QOL.

Recent isotopic tracer studies and modelling approaches may help quantify the effects of bio-fortification, fortification, and food-based approaches for increasing vitamin A depots. A systematic review and several trials identified adverse events associated with higher vitamin A intakes, which should be useful for setting upper limits.

BACKGROUND: During the pandemic, exposure to allergens and infectious agents has decreased during the pandemic due to heightened hygiene measures and primarily virtual visits. We examined the effect of the pandemic on pediatric asthma control. DESIGN/METHODS: Our study included 104 asthmatic children, 3-18 years of age. The mean age of patients was 9.7  3.8. Subjects were assessed during the time period of March-August 2019 and 2020. Outcome variables included: rescue albuterol and systemic steroid use, physician visits (PMDv), emergency department visits (EDv), hospitalizations (H) for asthma exacerbation, pulmonology clinic visits, change in and adherence to controller therapy, spacer technique and BMI. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the majority of pulmonology clinic visits were via telemedicine. There was a significant difference in appropriate spacer technique and change in controller regimen, with improved technique and decreased requirement for step up controller therapy, during the pandemic There was no significant difference in BMI, adherence to controller therapy or the number of pulmonology visits. Additionally, there was an improvement in asthma control during the pandemic with less use of rescue albuterol, systemic steroids, H, EDv or PMDv for acute exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that asthma control has improved during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in terms of: reduced albuterol and systemic steroid use and decreased asthma exacerbations. The recent addition of telemedicine to patient care has not negatively affected asthma control in children.","output":"Comparison of asthma control before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in children 3-18 years of age presenting to the pediatric pulmonary clinic at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How do attitudes toward vaccination change over the course of a public health crisis? We report results from a longitudinal survey of United States residents during six months (March 16 -August 16, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening.

Data for this study came from a sample of African Americans (N = 304) who responded to an online survey. Perceptions of mental health were assessed using a single item developed by the research team. Exposure to police brutality and protests was measured by asking how often they had seen or heard about African Americans being victims of police brutality and seen or heard about protests on television, social media, or other outlets. Participants were also asked about the extent to which these events caused them emotional distress. Social activism was assessed by asking participants if they had ever participated in political activities, such as calling their representative. Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted using linear regression. Moderation analyses showed that greater emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and protests was associated with worse perceptions of mental health only when engagement in social activism was low. In contrast, mediation analyses indicated that greater frequency of and emotional distress from exposure to media coverage was indirectly associated with worse perceptions of mental health through increased engagement in social activism. Social activism may be an important method for coping with emotional distress from watching media coverage of police brutality and protests, but more research is needed to understand how African Americans might engage in social activism without adversely impacting mental health.","output":"Perceptions of Mental Health and Exploring the Role of Social Activism Among African Americans Exposed to Media Coverage of Police Brutality and Protests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and its high virulence along with its variable presentation have generated a significant amount of interest within the medical community.

METHODS A cohort of patients who underwent cystectomy for infection, fistula, bleeding, incontinence, neurogenic bladder or pain between January 2004 and June 2012 was established. Data included baseline demographics, indications for cystectomy and prior treatments, and complications at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures were 30-day and 30 to 90-day complications. RESULTS The study group comprised eight males and 18 females. The mean age was 57.8 years (95% CI 50.8-64.7). A total of 19 patients (73%) had resolution of their underlying urological pathology at 90 days. A total of 19 patients (73%) experienced a complication in the first 30 days, of which nine (47%) were Clavien grade III or higher. The most common 30-day complications were urinary tract infection (n = 6, 23%) and wound infection (n = 6, 23%). A total of 44% (4/9) of patients with neurogenic bladder experienced a complication within the first 30 days of cystectomy compared with 100% (8/8) of patients with radiation-induced fistula (P = 0.03) and 78% (7/9) of non-neurogenic, non-radiation-induced fistula patients (P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS Cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign disease might be successful, but is associated with a high rate of perioperative complications. Those with radiation-induced fistula are more likely to experience complications, whereas those with neurogenic bladder carry a lower risk. Patients should be counseled appropriately regarding expected postoperative outcomes.","output":"Cystectomy and urinary diversion as management of treatment-refractory benign disease: the impact of preoperative urological conditions on perioperative outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) are benign masses deemed to originate from pluripotent testicular steroidogenic cells that grow under chronic ACTH stimulation. These lesions, occasionally misdiagnosed as Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), are typically described in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder of beta-oxidation with accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in various tissues, and a rare cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). TARTs have never been associated with X-ALD. CASE 1 DESCRIPTION: A 19-year old male, who had previously undergone bilateral enucleation of presumed LCTs, was referred to our unit. Follow-up scans showed persistent bilateral lesions compatible with TARTs. Biochemical exams revealed PAI but excluded CAH. A serum VLCFAs panel was consistent with X-ALD, with gene testing confirming the diagnosis. Histological revision of the previously resected testicular lesions was compatible with TARTs. Start of glucocorticoid replacement therapy was associated with a reduction of testicular masses. CASE 2 DESCRIPTION: A 26-year old X-ALD male was diagnosed with bilateral testicular lesions compatible with TARTs. These lesions increased after ACTH elevation following switch to modified-release hydrocortisone. Clinical and sonographic findings allowed for a \\"watchful-waiting\\" approach, avoiding unnecessary surgery. CONCLUSION These are the first cases reported of TARTs in patients with X-ALD-associated PAI. Testicular lesions in patients with an early onset of ACTH elevation, regardless of the cause, should always be thoughtfully investigated, as they may reveal themselves as TARTs. We suggest that all patients affected from chronic ACTH elevation of a young age of onset should undergo testicular ultrasound in order to evaluate the presence of these lesions. GRT in these patients might also help preserving fertility.","output":"Bilateral testicular masses and adrenal insufficiency: is congenital adrenal hyperplasia the only possible diagnosis?

Most critically ill patients have organ injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, or liver dysfunction. However, few studies on acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) have been reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. AIM: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of AGI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-d mortality. RESULTS: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients out of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of these patients, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. Forty (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, and septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, a higher incidence of septic shock and 28-d mortality.

Teleconsultation is a safe way to receive medical advice without a risk of infection, and was implemented urgently in our academic centres. Our purpose was to evaluate patient and physician satisfaction with teleconsultation set up during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From March 16th 2020, all face-to-face consultations were cancelled in France, except for emergencies. Teleconsultation was started immediately by five senior urologists in two academic hospitals. All patients received an email survey including the validated Teleconsultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) and demographic questions. Data were collected prospectively. Physicians also responded to the TSQ. Patient satisfaction was measured objectively with the validated 14-item TSQ. Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Factors associated with positive satisfaction with teleconsultation were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 105 patients replied to the survey (91.3%). Median age was 66 years (IQR: 55?71) and 95 were men (90.5%). Median overall TSQ score was 67 (IQR: 60?69); teleconsultation was judged to be a good experience by 88 patients (83.8%) and four physicians (80%).

To address this question, we develop a contingency-based model of perceived funding fit that delineates several factors that influence strategic fund-seeking decisions by entrepreneurs. In prior research, entrepreneur fund-seeking has largely been explained using models that rely on rule-based approaches (e.g., the pecking order assumption) or value capture considerations. In contrast, we propose a dynamic contingency-based model that delineates several factors that influence entrepreneur perceptions of funding fit over and above transactional efficiency, including atypical value creation from the fundraising process itself and external stakeholder values. We inductively assess our model in the context of equity crowdfunding (ECF) and find that perceived funding fit can motivate some strategic fund-seekers to opt to pursue ECF, even when they have a reasonable opportunity to obtain other more established sources of funding such as angel or seed-stage venture capital. This indicates that ECF in several cases is not a funding mode of last resort as proposed in prior literature. Plain English Summary Raising capital is a complex and dynamic process. Strategic entrepreneurs seek funding fit for their particular ventures leading some to opt for less established forms of funding such as equity crowdfunding for a variety of reasons beyond efficiency. Prior venture funding research has largely taken the view of the investor, emphasizing what entrepreneurs must do to win the favor of angel investors and other seed funders, and deeming equity crowdfunding (ECF) a funding mode of last resort for discouraged entrepreneurs. Inductively analyzing hundreds of regulatory filings, entrepreneur interviews, public information, and media pieces about ECF-funded firms, we find evidence that in several cases, strategic entrepreneurs may prefer to opt for ECF if they perceive it to be a better fit due to novel forms of nonfinancial value. We explain our findings by proposing an emergent contingency-based model of funding fit.","output":"Entrepreneur fund-seeking: toward a theory of funding fit in the era of equity crowdfunding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Only studies in the UK on individuals dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospital have been published, to date.

Methods: : We searched Pubmed and Embase with terms COVID and SARS-COV-2 from December 1, 2019 till April 5, 2020. We estimated overall prevalence, stratified prevalence based on severity, estimated risk ratio (RR) and estimated standardized mean difference (SMD) of liver function parameters in severe as compared to nonsevere COVID. Random effect method utilizing inverse variance approach was used for pooling the data. Results: : In all, 128 studies were included. The most frequent abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia [61.27% (48.24 - 72.87)], elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) [27.94%(18.22 -40.27)], alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [23.28%(19.92 - 27.01)] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [23.41%(18.84 - 28.70)]. Further the relative risk of these abnormalities was higher in the patients with severe COVID-19 when compared to non-severe disease [Hypoalbuminemia - 2.65(1.38 - 5.07);GGT - 2.31(1.6 - 3.33);ALT - 1.76(1.44 - 2.15);AST 2.30(1.82 - 2.90)].

Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013C2015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2C3 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83% tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71% tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. However, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.","output":"Laboratory-based respiratory virus surveillance pilot project on select cruise ships in Alaska, 2013C15()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionSevere SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a dysregulated immune response.

Life-threatening complications emerging against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which causes COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019), explain the need to study the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 in order to offer rational medical care to patients belonging to various age categories. This article presents a comprehensive assessment of changes affecting the main hemostasis parameters in patients with acute cerebral circulatory disorders against the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. There is special attention paid to the pathophysiological features occurring against the infectious process involving the hemostasis system. Our data shows that the differences in the main hemostatic parameters in patients with acute cerebral circulatory disorders occurring against the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are due to the degree of the body responsiveness and the severity of the comorbid pathology. Reducing the risk of adverse conditions developing in this category of patients is possible in case of responsible monitoring focusing on the main indicators of the cardiovascular system status, as well as provided there are advanced approaches introduced in order to prevent and treat thrombotic/thromboembolic complications.","output":"Effect of Coronavirus Disease (covid-19) on Hemostasis System in Patients with Acute Cerebrovascular Accidents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Im Laufe der Entwicklung der Lebewesen traten die Organismen gegeneinander in Konkurrenz und entdeckten andere Spezies als eigene Lebensgrundlage oder Nahrung.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Patients with a history of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR test who underwent SPECT-MPI for the evaluation of ischemia with the complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath were screened for this study. Patients who underwent thorax CT during the acute period of the COVID-19 were included. Patients with and without pneumonia were determined based on computed tomographic criteria. The patients with a summed stress score of at least 4 on SPECT-MPI were considered to have abnormal MPI in terms of ischemia. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients were included in the study. Sixty-five (24%) patients had ischemia findings on SPECT-MPI. Thorax CT showed pneumonia in 152 (57%) patients, and the patients were divided into two groups as pneumonia and nonpneumonia. Abnormal SPECT-MPI scores, which represented myocardial ischemia, were higher in the pneumonia group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the presence of hyperlipidemia and pneumonia on CT increased the risk of ischemia on SPECT-MPI (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.08-3.99; P-value = 0.029; and OR, 2.90; 95% Cl, 1.52-5.54; P-value = 0.001, respectively).

Global markets and global flows are not as self-evident as they were a few years ago and new modes of governance for managing national food security during crisis are required. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have further showed that global production systems and communications are fragile to a range of different disturbances. This article examines the possibility of managing national food security through collaborative arrangements between public authorities and private food companies through a case study of the Swedish approach to food security. The analysis is based on a theoretical framework that highlights the importance of motivation, leadership, shared understanding, and trust as four dimensions that evaluate collaborative governance in precrisis situations. We conclude that although a broader understnding of the importance of food security has emerged, collaborative governance arrangements run the risk of creating only an illusion of readiness, due to unclear mandates and clear leadership not able to advance trust, legal structures, or concrete agreements for ensuring national food security. ? 2021 The Authors.

This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the spatial patterns of electricity consumption in six socioeconomic sectors (residential (villa and flat), industrial, commercial, government, and productive farms) in the State of Qatar. The spatiotemporal patterns of electricity consumption have been assessed using various Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial statistical modeling prior and during the pandemic. The results demonstrate variations in electricity consumption within and between the six sectors. The main changes in the electricity consumption within sectors during the pandemic year is during the lockdown phase. Spatially, some sectors are affected by the pandemic, and hence the pattern and the spatial and temporal distribution of electricity consumption has changed during the pandemic year compared to pre-pandemic years. The results also show that there were variations of spatial clustering of electricity consumption among these sectors. Most of the high-high clustering patterns are located in the mid-eastern and northeastern parts of Qatar. The highest variation in electricity consumption between sectors occurred in the productive farms due to its massive development during the pre-pandemic period and were not affected by the pandemic. There is a sharp decline in electricity consumption in both the industrial and commercial sectors during the pandemic year. Other sectors witnessed an increase in electricity consumption during the summer months, which was mainly due to travel restrictions imposed by many countries around the world.

This has been coined trained immunity and diverges with the perception that the innate immune system is primitive, non-specific, and reacts to novel and recurrent antigen exposures similarly. The exposome is the cumulative exposures (diet, exercise, environmental exposure, vaccination, genetics, etc.) an individual has experienced and provides a mechanism for the establishment of immune training or immunotolerance. It is becoming increasingly clear that trained immunity constitutes a delicate balance between the dose, duration, and order of exposures. Upon innate stimuli, trained immunity or tolerance is shaped by epigenetic and metabolic changes that alter hematopoietic stem cell lineage commitment and responses to infection. Due to the immunomodulatory role of the exposome, understanding innate immune training is critical for understanding why some individuals exhibit protective phenotypes while closely related individuals may experience immunotolerant effects (e.g., the order of exposure can result in completely divergent immune responses). Research on the exposome and trained immunity may be leveraged to identify key factors for improving vaccination development, altering inflammatory disease development, and introducing potential new prophylactic treatments, especially for diseases such as COVID-19, which is currently a major health issue for the world. Furthermore, continued exposome research may prevent many deleterious effects caused by immunotolerance that frequently result in host morbidity or mortality.","output":"Exposome and Immunity Training: How Pathogen Exposure Order Influences Innate Immune Cell Lineage Commitment and Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vital signs monitoring (VSM) is routine for inpatients, but monitoring during free-living conditions is largely untested in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the usability and acceptability of continuous VSM for people with COPD using wearable multiparameter technology. METHODS: In total, 50 people following hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and 50 people with stable COPD symptoms were asked to wear an Equivital LifeMonitor during waking hours for 6 weeks (42 days). The device recorded heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin temperature, and physical activity. Adherence was defined by the number of days the vest was worn and daily wear time. Signal quality was examined, with thresholds of 85% for HR and 80% for RR, based on the device's proprietary confidence algorithm. Data quality was calculated as the percentage of wear time with acceptable signal quality. Participant feedback was assessed during follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: In total, 84% of participants provided data, with average daily wear time of 11.8 (SD 2.2) hours for 32 (SD 11) days (average of study duration 76%, SD 26%). There was greater adherence in the stable group than in the post-AECOPD group (5 weeks wear: 71.4% vs 45.7%; P=.02). For all 84 participants, the median HR signal quality was 90% (IQR 80%-94%) and the median RR signal quality was 93% (IQR 92%-95%). The median HR data quality was 81% (IQR 58%-91%), and the median RR data quality was 85% (IQR 77%-91%). Stable group BMI was associated with HR signal quality (rs=0.45, P=.008) and HR data quality (rs=0.44, P=.008). For the AECOPD group, RR data quality was associated with waist circumference and BMI (rs=-0.49, P=.009; rs=-0.44, P=.02). In total, 36 (74%) participants in the Stable group and 21 (60%) participants in the AECOPD group accepted the technology, but 10 participants (12%) expressed concerns with wearing a device around their chest. CONCLUSIONS: This wearable multiparametric technology showed good user acceptance and was able to measure vital signs in a COPD population.

Eye Monitoring System for Drowsiness and Attentiveness Detection is developed for monitoring the drowsiness and attentiveness of any individual. A lot of drivers suffer from drowsiness while driving the cars, trucks and auto rickshaws. The reason for drowsiness can differ from person to person but feeling drowsy while driving can lead to various safety issues for the driver and other people on the road. A driver feels drowsiness during driving due to lack of sleep, tiredness and due to long travel driving. Drowsiness can also be felt by students in online classes and students tend not to be interested in online classes as there is no faculty keeping an eye on them since they are not in the classrooms physically. As covid-19 impacted education institutions the only way to fill the gap between the students and faculty is online classes, hence online classes are the only solution left.

Understanding the dynamics of such an infectious disease transmission is critical for devising strategies to control its spread. In particular, Rwanda was one of the African countries that started COVID-19 preparedness early in January 2020, and a total lockdown was imposed when the country had only 18 COVID-19 confirmed cases known. Using intensive contact tracing, several infections were identified, with the majority of them being returning travellers and their close contacts. We used the contact tracing data in Rwanda for understanding the geographic patterns of COVID-19 to inform targeted interventions. METHODS: We estimated the attack rates and identified risk factors associated to COVID-19 spread. We used Bayesian disease mapping models to assess the spatial pattern of COVID-19 and to identify areas characterised by unusually high or low relative risk. In addition, we used multiple variable conditional logistic regression to assess the impact of the risk factors. RESULTS: The results showed that COVID-19 cases in Rwanda are localised mainly in the central regions and in the southwest of Rwanda and that some clusters occurred in the northeast of Rwanda. Relationship to the index case, being male and coworkers are the important risk factors for COVID-19 transmission in Rwanda. CONCLUSION: The analysis of contact tracing data using spatial modelling allowed us to identify high-risk areas at subnational level in Rwanda. Estimating risk factors for infection with SARS-CoV-2 is vital in identifying the clusters in low spread of SARS-CoV-2 subnational level. It is imperative to understand the interactions between the index case and contacts to identify superspreaders, risk factors and high-risk places.

The proposed study reviews the three most recent paradigms for CVD risk assessment, namely multiclass, multi-label, and ensemble-based methods in (i) office-based and (ii) stress-test laboratories. Methods: A total of 265 CVD-based studies were selected using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model. Due to its popularity and recent development, the study analyzed the above three paradigms using machine learning (ML) frameworks. We review comprehensively these three methods using attributes, such as architecture, applications, pro-and-cons, scientific validation, clinical evaluation, and AI risk-of-bias (RoB) in the CVD framework. These ML techniques were then extended under mobile and cloud-based infrastructure. Findings: Most popular biomarkers used were office-based, laboratory-based, image-based phenotypes, and medication usage. Surrogate carotid scanning for coronary artery risk prediction had shown promising results. Ground truth (GT) selection for AI-based training along with scientific and clinical validation is very important for CVD stratification to avoid RoB.

STUDY DESIGNS 554 women respondents age 18 to 49 and reside in the United States were recruited using social media between May 16, 2020 and June 16, 2020. Logistic regression models assessed predictors of reporting pandemic-related changes in economic conditions, desire for pregnancy, and contraceptive access. RESULTS Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Hispanics/Latinx and Black/African Americans were four times more likely to experience inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing (p<0.01) during the pandemic; Hispanics/Latinx were twice as likely to experience food insecurity (p<0.05). Inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing was associated with drop in desire to be pregnant (p<0.01). Despite the 25% of participants who reported a drop in desire for pregnancy, one in six reported difficulty accessing contraceptives, particularly those who experienced reduced income (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS In our sample, the pandemic unevenly affected people from different socioeconomic groups. Many simultaneously experienced reduced income, difficulties in accessing contraception, and a greater desire to avoid a pregnancy. This combination of factors increases the chance that people will experience unintended pregnancies. IMPLICATIONS The pandemic caused economic hardship and an increased desire to postpone or prevent pregnancy at the same time that it created new barriers to contraceptive services.

We consider the role of instructional modality (in-person, hybrid, or remote instruction) in disease spread among the wider community. Using a variety of regression modeling strategies , we find that simple correlations show in-person modalities are correlated with increased COVID cases, but accounting for both pre-existing cases and a richer set of covariates brings estimates close to zero on average. In Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) specifications, in-person modality options are not associated with increased spread of COVID at low levels of pre-existing COVID cases but cases do increase at moderate to high pre-existing COVID rates. A bounding exercise suggests that the OLS findings for in-person modality are likely to represent an upper bound on the true relationship. These findings are robust to the inclusion of county and district fixed effects in terms of the insignificance of the findings, but the models with fixed effects are also somewhat imprecisely estimated.","output":"To What Extent Does In-Person Schooling Contribute to the Spread of COVID-19?

Nearly half the British workforce (47%) reported to be working at home under lockdown in April 2020. This study investigated the impact of enforced home-working under lockdown on employee wellbeing via markers of stress, burnout, depressive symptoms, and sleep. Moderating effects of factors including age, gender, number of dependants, mental health status and work status were examined alongside work-related factors including work-life conflict and leadership quality. METHOD: Cross-sectional data were collected over a 12-week period from May to August 2020 using an online survey. Job-related and wellbeing factors were measured using items from the COPSOQIII. Stress, burnout, somatic stress, cognitive stress, and sleep trouble were tested together using MANOVA and MANCOVA to identify mediating effects. T-tests and one-way ANOVA identified differences in overall stress. Regression trees identified groups with highest and lowest levels of stress and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: 81% of respondents were working at home either full or part-time (n = 623, 62% female). Detrimental health impacts of home-working during lockdown were most acutely experienced by those with existing mental health conditions regardless of age, gender, or work status, and were exacerbated by working regular overtime. In those without mental health conditions, predictors of stress and depressive symptoms were being female, under 45 years, home-working part-time and two dependants, though men reported greater levels of work-life conflict. Place and pattern of work had a greater impact on women. Lower leadership quality was a significant predictor of stress and burnout for both men and women, and, for employees aged > 45 years, had significant impact on level of depressive symptoms experienced. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of home-working under lockdown varies amongst groups. Knowledge of these differences provide employers with tools to better manage employee wellbeing during periods of crisis. While personal factors are not controllable, the quality of leadership provided to employees, and the place and pattern of work, can be actively managed to positive effect. Innovative flexible working practices will help to build greater workforce resilience.","output":"Enforced home-working under lockdown and its impact on employee wellbeing: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Within the last two decades several members of the Coronaviridae family namely Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated epidemic potential. In late, 2019 an unnamed genetic relative, later named SARS-CoV-2 realized its potential in the highly populous neighborhoods of Wuhan, China. Unchecked, the virus rapidly spread among interconnected communities and related households before containment measures could be in acted. Appropriate diagnostic testing in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak should be urgently considered. This perspective review gives particular attention to the potential diagnostic testing of the virus in semen and seminal fluids due to its high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) precursor. RECENT FINDINGS: As many infectious viruses are stable in semen and have transmitted the respective diseases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 should be tested in semen to assess their stabilities and half-life. As in case of Ebola virus, it was present in semen for longer period in a carrier man without any symptom. Additional hypothesis is that since ACE2 could serve as a mediator for the endocytosis of the previously SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cells through similar mechanism. From the protein expression atlas, high levels of ACE2 precursor were found in intestines and testis. Hence, the testis and seminal fluids could be the host cell and/or reservoir.

The need for alternative therapies for this group of patients is imperative. This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) compared with human immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients requiring the administration of high oxygen levels or mechanical ventilation. Methods This is a controlled, randomized, open clinical trial of patients with pneumonia secondary to SARS CoV 2 infection, that fulfilled criteria for severe or critical disease. They were randomized in a 1:2 ratio; group 1 was administered IVIg at a dose of 0.3 grams per kilogram of ideal weight, in an 8 hour infusion every 24 hours, for 5 days. Group 2 was administered 200 ml of CP infused in 2 hours, for 2 days. The primary outcomes were duration of hospitalization and mortality at 28 days. Results: One hundred and ninety (190) patients were randomized; 130 to the CP group, and 60 to the IVIg group. Their average age was 58 years (IQR 47 to 72), and most were male (n= 119, 62.6 %). On inclusion, 85.2 % of patients (n=162) were on invasive mechanical ventilation therapy. Overall mortality in all included patients was 53 % (n= 102), with a median follow-up of 14 days (IQI 8 to 26). Mortality at 28 days was 45.2 % (n=86). In the intention to treat analysis, there was no difference between groups neither in mortality on follow up (53.8 vs. 53.3, p =1.0) nor at 28 days (46.2 vs 43 %, p=0.75, Log Rank p = 0.83). Per protocol analysis between treatment groups revealed no difference in mortality throughout hospitalization (51.5 vs 51.4 %, p=1.0) nor after 28 days (42.1 vs 42.87 %, p=0.92 Log Rank p = 0.54). Only 23 patients in the CP group received plasma with detectable anti SARS CoV 2 antibodies. Conclusions: In critically ill patients or on invasive mechanical ventilation for treatment of COVID19, the use of CP is not superior to IVIg in terms of hospitalization duration or mortality. The use of CP is based on complex logistics and requires an assured level of antibodies if used therapeutically.

RESULTS: PointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. CONCLUSION: The PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources.","output":"AI-driven quantification of ground glass opacities in lungs of COVID-19 patients using 3D computed tomography imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the computerisation and online delivery of postgraduate examinations.

AIM: To determine whether colchicine reduces time to recovery and COVID-19-related admissions to hospital and/or deaths among people in the community. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial (PRINCIPLE). METHOD: Adults aged 65 years or 18 years with comorbidities or shortness of breath, and unwell for 14 days with suspected COVID-19 in the community, were randomised to usual care, usual care plus colchicine (500 g daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions. The co-primary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery and admission to hospital/death related to COVID-19, within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. RESULTS: The trial opened on 2 April 2020. Randomisation to colchicine started on 4 March 2021 and stopped on 26 May 2021 because the prespecified time to recovery futility criterion was met. The primary analysis model included 2755 participants who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, randomised to colchicine (n = 156), usual care (n = 1145), and other treatments (n = 1454). Time to first self-reported recovery was similar in the colchicine group compared with usual care with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.72 to 1.16) and an estimated increase of 1.4 days in median time to self-reported recovery for colchicine versus usual care. The probability of meaningful benefit in time to recovery was very low at 1.8%. COVID-19-related admissions to hospital/deaths were similar in the colchicine group versus usual care, with an estimated odds ratio of 0.76 (95% CrI = 0.28 to 1.89) and an estimated difference of ?0.4% (95% CrI = ?2.7 to 2.4).

People with underlying diseases are prone to severe infection. The nature of NMOSD disease and its treatment by immunosuppressants predisposes patients to infection. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical course of NMOSD and the characteristics of COVID-19 infection in NMOSD patients. Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was performed in Isfahan City, Iran, Iran, from March 2020 to March 2021. We considered relapses during the epidemic and the year before and the presentation of COVID-19 infection in the patients of NMOSD Clinic of Isfahan Kashani hospital. Results: The study included 120 patients. Their MeanSD age was 36.379.69 years, and the mean duration of disease was 8.495.35 years. Overall, they experienced 36 relapses during the year before the epidemic (ARR:0.3) and 29 during the COVID-19 epidemic (ARR:0.24). The maintenance therapy of NMOSD was rituximab in 96 cases, azathioprine in 22, and methotrexate in 2 ones. 35 patients infected by COVID-19 (based on RT-PCR test). 6 were admitted to the hospital, and two patients received ICU care. There was one death due to respiratory failure. Conclusion: Despite the suppression of the immune system, neither incidence nor the number of severe complications of COVID-19 infection was high. Therefore, regarding the disabling nature of NMOSD and the prolonged epidemic period, it may be reasonable to continue the routine treatment of these patients and train them to stick to health protection instructions. ? 2022.

Nursing students are often a heterogenous group that traverses generational boundaries. Exploring generational differences may assist in developing support systems for specific groups. This study sought to examine psychological wellbeing and preventative behaviours among nursing students from the iGeneration in comparison to older generations. METHOD: A prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken using a convenience sample of pre-registration nursing students studying at two Australian Universities, one regional and one metropolitan. About 631 pre-registration nursing students completed an online survey. RESULTS: An independent samples t-test revealed that students from the iGeneration possess higher anxiety compared to nursing students from older generations (p = .000). Compared to iGeneration participants, older generation participants had significantly higher scores for knowledge of COVID-19 (p = .015). iGeneration participants utilised social media to source information about COVID-19 far more than older generations (p = .008). iGeneration participants were significantly more concerned than older generations about the impact of COVID-19 on completing their clinical placement (p = .014). Older generations tended to have higher academic preventative behaviours, with significant mean scores for not attending university if they or others they knew had symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Given the differences between generation groups with regard to psychological wellbeing, knowledge about COVID-19, and concerns about studying in an altered study environment, strategies should be targeted to generational groups. Anxiety negatively impacts the quality of life, educational performance and clinical practice and is experienced more frequently in the iGeneration. Therefore it is crucial for nursing educators to reflect on how they engage this generation in the online space to provide support, stability and a sense of connection. This will contribute towards ensuring a well-prepared future nursing workforce who may encounter other pandemics and isolating events. IMPACT STATEMENT: Compared with other generations, iGeneration students have a greater likelihood to experience mental health issues, isolation and insecurity. Nursing leaders and educators must be sensitive to such intergenerational differences, to ensure they are developing a skilled and productive workforce.","output":"Generational differences in psychological wellbeing and preventative behaviours among nursing students during COVID-19: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HLA haplotypes were found to be associated with increased risk for viral infections or disease severity in various diseases, including SARS. Several genetic variants are associated with COVID-19 severity. Studies have proposed associations, based on a very small sample and a large number of tested HLA alleles, but no clear association between HLA and COVID-19 incidence or severity has been reported. We conducted a large-scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. A total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups: A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization in the general Israeli population. Similarly, no association was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization. We conclude that HLA haplotypes are not a major risk/protecting factor among the Israeli population for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity.

However, prior analyses reveal that a significant fraction of excess deaths associated with the pandemic were not directly assigned to COVID-19 on the death certificate. The percent of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 is also known to vary across US states. However, few studies to date provide information on patterns of excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 for US counties, despite the importance of this information for health policy and planning. In the present study, we develop and validate a generalized linear model of expected mortality in 2020 based on historical trends in deaths by county of residence between 2011 and 2019. We use the results of the model to generate county estimates of excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 for each county in the US along with bootstrapped prediction intervals. Overall, the proportion of excess deaths assigned to COVID-19 was 81%, meaning that 19% of excess deaths were not assigned to COVID-19. The proportion assigned to COVID-19 was lower in the South (76%) and West (75%) as compared to counties in the Midwest (81%) and Northeast (94%). Across US Census Divisions, the proportion was especially low in the East South Central Division (67%). Rural counties across all divisions (67%) reported lower proportions of excess deaths assigned to COVID-19 than urban areas (83%). For instance, in the Middle Atlantic and Pacific Divisions respectively, only 47% and 39% of excess deaths were assigned to COVID-19 in nonmetro areas. In contrast, the New England Census Division stood out as the only division where directly assigned COVID-19 deaths actually exceeded excess deaths, meaning there were 1.23 directly assigned COVID-19 deaths for every 1 excess death. However, this finding did not extend to nonmetro areas within New England where only 64% of excess deaths were assigned to COVID-19. The finding that metro areas in New England reported higher direct COVID-19 mortality than excess mortality suggests that reductions in mortality from other causes of death may have occurred in these areas, at least among some populations. Across individual counties, the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 varied substantially, with some counties' direct COVID-19 tallies capturing only a small fraction of total excess deaths, whereas in other counties the direct COVID-19 death rate far exceeded the number of estimated excess deaths. Taken together, our results suggest that regional inequalities in the mortality burden associated with COVID-19 are not fully revealed by data at the state level and that consideration of excess deaths across US counties is critical for a full accounting of the disparate regional effects of the pandemic on US mortality.","output":"County-Level Estimates of Excess Mortality associated with COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A deterministic model is designed and used to analyze the transmission dynamics and the impact of antiviral drugs in controlling the spread of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.

On the basis of 6,625 complete blood count (CBC) tests from 1,004 patients, of which 18% were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), we created four ML models, by adopting a robust development procedure which was designed to minimize risks of bias and over-fitting, according to reference guidelines. The best model, a support vector machine, had an AUC of .85, a Brier score of .14, and a standardized net benefit of .69: these scores indicate that the model performed well over a variety of prediction criteria. We also conducted an interpretability study to back up our findings, showing that the data on which the developed model is based is consistent with the current medical literature. This also demonstrates that CBC data and ML methods can be used to predict COVID-19 patients ICU admission at a relatively low cost: in particular, since CBC data can be quickly obtained by means of routine blood exams, our models could be used in resource-constrained settings and provide health practitioners with rapid and reliable indications.

The studies of MERS patients with severe disease and experimentally infected animals showed that robust viral replication and intensive proinflammatory response in lung tissues contribute to high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV. We sought to identify pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathway(s) that mediates the inflammatory cascade in human macrophages upon MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: The potential signaling pathways were manipulated individually by pharmacological inhibition, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) depletion, and antibody blocking. The MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory response was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of key cytokines and/or chemokines. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting were applied to evaluate the activation of related PRRs and engagement of adaptors. RESULTS: MERS-CoV replication significantly upregulated C-type lectin receptor (CLR) macrophage-inducible Ca(2+)-dependent lectin receptor (Mincle). The role of Mincle for MERS-CoV-triggered cytokine/chemokine induction was established based on the results of antibody blockage, siRNA depletion of Mincle and its adaptor spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), and Syk pharmacological inhibition. The cytokine and/or chemokine induction was significantly attenuated by siRNA depletion of retinoic acid-inducible-I-like receptors (RLR) or adaptor, indicating that RLR signaling also contributed to MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The CLR and RLR pathways are activated and contribute to the proinflammatory response in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages.","output":"Activation of C-Type Lectin Receptor and (RIG)-I-Like Receptors Contributes to Proinflammatory Response in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-Infected Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The New Zealand economy is in a parlous state and not simply because of the economic fall-out associated with the pandemic For decades now, New Zealand has been falling further and further behind its OECD partners, with institutional inefficiencies, poor policy making and the almost willful refusal of successive governments to admit to (let alone confront) mounting economic problems, all combining to place us on the edge of a deep, and lasting, economic downturn Across a broad plethora of areas and key economic indicators, New Zealand lags behind almost every other advanced country against which it has traditionally measured itself These areas include the three pillars of social wellbeing (education, health, and social welfare), housing, tax, productivity and debt In every case, we are either falling behind outcomes achieved in other countries (education, health, productivity), entrenching inequality through our failure to cater for the needs of our most vulnerable (housing, health, education, social welfare, tax), or failing to prepare adequately for looming economic and social costs - including those incurred by a rapidly aging population If ignored, these problems will precipitate a crisis that may make the burden of recovering from Covid-19 pale by comparison (superannuation, health, debt) In its much anticipated post-Covid budget, the Labour Government needs to not only provide a clear blueprint for helping those who have been adversely affected by the pandemic and New Zealands subsequent lockdown, but also signal its intention to tackle the systemic weaknesses which have placed our economy at such risk, and which threaten to consign our future generations to unwelcome, and unnecessary, economic and social hardship","output":"The March Towards Poverty: Why the Labour Government has much more to deal with than the economic consequences of Covid-19 in its upcoming budget"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer programming e-learners faced stressful life circumstances and educational changes that affected the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This paper outlines the 2020 Food-EPI process and compares policy implementation and recommendations with the 2014 and 2017 Food-EPI. Methods: : In March-April 2020, a national panel of over 50 public health experts participated in Food-EPI. Experts rated the extent of implementation of 47 good practice policy and infrastructure support indicators compared to international best practice, using an extensive evidence document verified by government officials. Experts then proposed and prioritised concrete actions needed to address the critical implementation gaps identified. Progress on policy implementation and recommendations made over the three Food-EPIs was compared. Results: : In 2020, 60% of the indicators were rated as having low or very little if any implementation compared to international benchmarks;less progress than 2017 (47%) and similar to 2014 (61%). Of the nine priority actions proposed in 2014, there was only noticeable action on one (Health Star Ratings). The majority of actions were therefore proposed again in 2017 and 2020. In 2020 the proposed actions were broader, reflecting the need for multi-sectoral action to improve the food environment, and the need for a mandatory approach in all policy areas. Conclusions: : There has been little to no progress in the past three terms of government (nine years) on the implementation of policies and infrastructure support for healthy food environments, with implementation overall regressing between 2017 and 2020. The proposed actions in 2020 have reflected a growing movement to locate nutrition within the wider context of planetary health and with recognition of the social determinants of health and nutrition, resulting in recommendations that will require the involvement of many Government entities to overcome the existing policy inertia.

Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA.

Recombinant G protein, comprising the extracellular domain of G, bound to heparin-agarose columns and also to HEp-2 cells. hMPV infection and G protein binding to HEp-2 cells was inhibited by other soluble GAGs, including chondroitin sulfates, by the enzymatic removal of cell surface GAGs with GAG lyases or by the pretreatment of cells with basic fibroblast growth factor. The role of cellular GAGs was confirmed by the binding of G protein to wild-type CHO cells but not to GAG-deficient CHO-pgsA745 cells. An analysis of the G protein sequence revealed two adjacent clusters of positively charged amino acids ((149)EKKKTRA(155) and (159)QRRGKGKE(166)). Truncated G fragments were expressed, and only the fragment containing these putative heparin binding domains retained heparin binding. The alanine mutagenesis of charged residues in either of these regions resulted in the loss of binding to heparin and to HEp-2 cells, suggesting that both sites are likely to be required for hMPV attachment.

For example, in one scenario based on UKB, we observed an expected odds ratio of 2.56 compared to a simulated true odds ratio of 3, per standard deviation higher BMI. Conclusion Analyses using COVID-19 self-reported or national registry data may be biased due to selection. The magnitude and direction of this bias depends on the outcome definition, the true effect of the risk factor, and the assumed selection mechanism.","output":"Exploring selection bias in COVID-19 research: Simulations and prospective analyses of two UK cohort studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruptive innovation of e-commerce on incoming and outgoing flows has led to a marked increase in traffic volumes over the so-called last mile. This increase has inevitably impacted urban infrastructures ill prepared for such higher flows and related negative externalities. Moreover, fierce competition and ever more complex customer demand weigh on firms' logistic chains in the form of increased delivery charges and operational inefficiencies simply to preserve market share. This situation is likely to worsen as e-commerce continues to expand and uncertainty over Covid 19 persists. The last mile is a rapidly changing yet problematic link in the logistic chain since: - customers expect free and fast delivery;- logistic companies need to satisfy increasingly demanding customer delivery needs;- urban roads, already overloaded with flows of people and traditional goods, face significant increases in the size of these flows together with the rapid speed of change;- these complex changes are not a priority on policy makers' agenda. All these changes will transform the concept of the city. The purpose of this paper is to provide an updated overview of the current condition for urban deliveries as well as to analyse challenges and identify opportunities for future improvements. This paper reviews recent developments in e-commerce and the urban freight transport solutions used. Specifically, the work provides a complete overview of the critical factors affecting e-Commerce's last mile (failed deliveries, returns, packaging, role of customer satisfaction). The paper also highlights gaps in current research on the topic (i.e. data collection on load factors, externalities, warehousing space and related impacts) as well as within the political agenda (i.e. regulation for efficiency in delivery, planning of collection points and their accessibility, green urban policies, consumer environmental awareness).","output":"E-commerce and the Last Mile in Urban Goods Distribution : Criticalities and the Need for Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferons (IFNs) are key players in the antiviral response. IFN sensing by the cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not with IFN2 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels of several well-characterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8, and 12 expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1, and IL6, respectively, all related to the IFN response. These genes are induced in response to different doses of IFN2 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8) or later (ISR12) time points. IFN also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN response but not by other wild-type lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV. This is relevant as genome-wide guilt-by-association studies predict that ISR2, 8, and 12 may function in viral processes, in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. Therefore, we propose that these lncRNAs could be induced by IFN to function as positive or negative regulators of the antiviral response.","output":"Type I Interferon Regulates the Expression of Long Non-Coding RNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Series paper, we review the current evidence for the use of high-flow oxygen therapy, inhaled gases, and aerosols in the care of critically ill patients.

Additionally, it might improve the delivery of aerosolised bronchodilators in obstructive lung disease in general. Inhaled nitric oxide might improve outcomes in a subset of patients with postoperative pulmonary hypertension who had cardiac surgery; however, it has not been shown to provide long-term benefit in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhaled prostacyclins, similar to inhaled nitric oxide, are not recommended for routine use in patients with ARDS, but can be used to improve oxygenation in patients who are not adequately stabilised with traditional therapies. Aerosolised bronchodilators are useful in mechanically ventilated patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but are not recommended for those with ARDS.

Obstetric fistula is an abnormal connection between the vagina and the bladder or the rectum resulting from obstetric causes, mainly prolonged obstructed labour. Zimbabwe has two obstetric fistula repair centers. Because the program uses specialist surgeons from outside the country, the repairs are organized in quarterly camps with a target to repair 90 women per quarter. This study aimed at assessing the impact of restrictions on movement and gathering of people brought about by the Cocid-19 pandemic and to characterize participants of the camp which was held in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic at Mashoko Hospital. Specifically it looked at how Covid-19 pandemic affected programming for obstetric fistula repair and characterized participants of the fistula camp held in November to December 2020 at one of the repair centers. A review of the dataset and surgical log sheets for the camp and national obstetric fistula dataset was conducted. Variables of interest were extracted onto an excel spreadsheet and analyzed for frequencies and proportions. Data were presented in charts, tables and narratives. The study noted that Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected performance of fistula repairs greatly with only 25 women repaired in 2020 as compared to 313 in 2019. Ninety women were called to come for repairs but 52 did not manage to attend due to reasons related to the restriction of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Two thirds of those women suffered from urinary incontinence while the other third had fecal incontinence. The successful repair rate was 92%.

Abstract Acute viral respiratory infections represent a large part of the morbidity and mortality. The influenza, which occurs in epidemics waves during the winter, continues to cause hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. The emerging pandemic of new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reports an huge health crisis, increasing morbidity and mortality, with a strong socio-economic impact. The data around vitamin D has greatly increased in recent years. Knowledge of its role has advanced considerably, from a vitamin with a phosphocalcic and bone metabolism role to a hormone with an implication for integral health. Vitamin D appears to stimulate the activation of the immune response and limit the destructive consequences of immunopathology induced by pathogens. In the literature, there is evidence linking vitamin D deficiency, on the one hand to susceptibility to acute viral infections and, on the other hand, to the more unfavorable evolution of chronic infections. This review examines current knowledge of vitamin D and its influence on the risk of respiratory infections (influenza epidemics and COVID-19 pandemic).","output":"Vitamine D et risque des infections respiratoires aigu?s : grippe et COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyzes Germany's policy-making in response to the Corona crisis between January 2020 and March 2021.

The first concerns how the government's imposition of a 'state of emergency' affects liberal democratic policy-making resulting in the closure of deliberation in favor of top-down imposition. The second perspective looks at different types of policy learning under crisis conditions. The central thesis is that Germany's emergency regime failed to facilitate effective policy-making since it closed down venues in which policy learning could occur. Thus, the state of emergency combined authoritarianism and inefficiency.

This leads to some confusion among clinicians as to which test to order and when each is appropriate. While SARS-CoV-2 assays can suffer from poor sensitivity, all FDA authorized assays to date are intended to be qualitative. Serological tests have multiple assay formats, detect various classes of immunoglobulins, and have a distinct role in seroprevalence studies; however, the association with long-term protection remains unclear.

In other words, the phenotypic tree of life often appears highly tangled. Various explanations are given for this, such as differential degrees of developmental constraint, adaptation, or lack of adaptation. However, null expectations for the magnitude of disorder or tangling have never been established, so it is unclear which or even whether various evolutionary factors are required to explain messy patterns of evolution. I simulated evolution along phylogenies under a number of varying parameters (number of taxa and number of traits) and models (Brownian motion, OrnsteinCUhlenbeck (OU)-based, early burst, and character displacement (CD)] and quantified disorder using 2 measures. All models produce substantial amounts of disorder. Disorder increases with tree size and the number of phenotypic traits. OU models produced the largest amounts of disorderadaptive peaks influence lineages to evolve within restricted areas, with concomitant increases in crossing of branches and density of evolution. Large early changes in trait values can be important in minimizing disorder. CD consistently produced trees with low (but not absent) disorder.

This study aimed to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of laparoscopic versus laparotomic DSP in pancreatic body-tail cancer (PBTC) patients. METHODS Thirty-four PBTC patients were consecutively and retrospectively hospitalized for elective laparoscopic DSP (n = 11) or laparotomy (n = 23) between January 2007 and December 2011. The primary outcome measure was mean overall survival (OS). RESULTS All patients underwent DSP via laparoscopy or laparotomy as scheduled and were followed-up for 12-72 months. The two groups showed statistically similar mean operative time (laparoscopy vs. laparotomy, 150  54 vs. 160  48 min), median volume of intraoperative bleeding (100 [50-400] vs. 150 [50-350] ml), and rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (18.2 vs. 21.7 %). The laparoscopy group had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization (5 [3-12] vs. 8 [7-22] d, P < 0.05). All patients had a clear resection margin and showed statistically similar tumor size (2.8  1.5 vs. 3.1  1.7 cm), number of lymph nodes dissected (14.8  4.5 vs. 16.1  5.7), and mean OS (42.0  8.6 vs. 54.0  5.8 mo, P > 0.05).

While little is known about the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, it is well-established that the above-mentioned pathologies are associated with hyper-inflammation, tissue damage, and the perturbation of target organ metabolism. Mounting evidence has shown that these processes are regulated by endoproteinases (particularly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)). Here, we review what is known about the roles played by MMPs in the development of COVID-19 and postulate a mechanism by which MMPs could influence energy metabolism in target organs, such as the lung.

FINDINGS: Both human H7N9 viruses replicated efficiently in human bronchus and lung ex-vivo cultures, whereas duck/H7N9 virus failed to replicate in either. Both human A H7N9 viruses infected both ciliated and non-ciliated human bronchial epithelial cells and replicated to higher titres than did H5N1 (p<00001 to 00046) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did H7N7 (p=00002C001). Both human A H7N9 viruses predominantly infected type II alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in the human lung and replicated to higher titres than did H5N1 (p<00001 to 00078); A/Shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did H1N1 (p=00052C005) and H7N7 (p=00031C00151). Human H7N9 viruses were less potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines compared with H5N1 virus. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, the results suggest that the novel H7N9 viruses are better adapted to infect and replicate in the human conducting and lower airways than are other avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, and pose an important pandemic threat.

Capturing important lessons learnt, both positive and negative, is vital. We aimed to document the perceived positive changes (silver linings) in cancer care that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify challenges that may limit their long-term adoption. METHODS: This study employed a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) were conducted with key opinion leaders from 14 countries. The participants were predominantly members of the International COVID-19 and Cancer Taskforce, who convened in March 2020 to address delivery of cancer care in the context of the pandemic. The Framework Method was employed to analyse the positive changes of the pandemic with corresponding challenges to their maintenance post-pandemic. RESULTS: Ten themes of positive changes were identified which included: value in cancer care, digital communication, convenience, inclusivity and cooperation, decentralisation of cancer care, acceleration of policy change, human interactions, hygiene practices, health awareness and promotion and systems improvement. Impediments to the scale-up of these positive changes included resource disparities and variation in legal frameworks across regions. Barriers were largely attributed to behaviours and attitudes of stakeholders. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to important value-based innovations and changes for better cancer care across different health systems. The challenges to maintaining/implementing these changes vary by setting. Efforts are needed to implement improved elements of care that evolved during the pandemic.","output":"Silver linings: a qualitative study of desirable changes to cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As people all over the world continue to adjust to the new normal presented to them by COVID-19, they must adjust to the social restrictions that have been enforced.

The main feature of SARS-CoV-2 that distinguishes it from other viruses is the speed of transmission combined with higher risk of mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with diabetes mellitus (DM), severe obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension are more likely to get infected and are at a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Among elderly patients who are at higher risk of death from COVID-19, 26.8% have DM. Although the reasons for this increased risk are yet to be determined, several factors may contribute to type-2 DM patients increased susceptibility to infections. A possible factor that may play a role in increasing the risk in people affected by diabetes and/or obesity is the impaired innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by a state of chronic and low-grade inflammation that can lead to abrupt systemic metabolic alteration. SARS patients previously diagnosed with diabetes or hyperglycemia had higher mortality and morbidity rates when compared with patients who were under metabolic control. Similarly, obese individuals are at higher risk of developing complications from SARS-CoV-2.

We couple PHOEBE light curve models with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analyses to compute Bayesian probabilities on inclinations, fillout factors, mass ratios, third-light fractions, and component temperature ratios. Mass ratios and third-light contributions measured from spectra agree well with those inferred from the light curves. Most binaries in the pilot study have extreme mass ratios q<0.32. At least eight are probable triples. A Bayesian analysis of all 783 Kepler 0.15 d<P<2 d (near-)contact binaries forming an unbiased sample of unprecedented size and photometric precision results in 178 probable contact systems, 114 probable detached systems, and 491 ambiguous systems.

Interventions consisted of (1) WaSH policy reinforcement; (2) low-, medium-, or high-volume health education; (3) hygiene supplies; and (4) WaSH facilities (e.g., toilets, urinals, handwashing basins) improvements. We randomly allocated school clusters from the intervention arm to one of four groups to compare with schools from the control arm. Primary outcomes were: childrens health literacy, physical growth, nutrition status, and handwashing prevalence. Secondary outcomes were: childrens self-reported health status and history of extreme hunger, satisfaction with WaSH facilities, and school restrooms WaSH adequacy. We will measure differences in pre- and post-intervention outcomes and compare these differences between control and intervention arms.

In assessing a countrys water abundance or scarcity when entering the international VW trade, scholars consider only physical water availability, neglecting economic water scarcity, which indicates situations in which socio-economic obstacles impede the productive use of water. We weight the global VW trade associated to primary crops with a newly proposed composite water scarcity index (CWSI) that combines physical and economic water scarcity. 39% of VW volumes is exported from countries with a higher CWSI than the one of the destination country. Such unfair routes occur both from low- to high-income countries and among low- and middle-income countries themselves. High-income countries have a predominant role in import of CWSI-weighted VW, while low- and middle-income countries dominate among the largest CWSI-weighted VW exporters. For many of them economic water scarcity dominates over physical scarcity. The application of the CWSI elicits also a status change from net exporter to net importer for some wealthy countries and viceversa for some low- and middle-income countries. The application of CWSI allows one to quantify to what extent VW exchanges flow along environmentally and economically unfair routes, and it can inform the design of compensation policies.","output":"Trade of economically and physically scarce virtual water in the global food network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: we estimated the epidemiological and budget impact of lowering the recommended age for influenza immunization with quadrivalent vaccine actively offered and administered free of charge to persons over 50 years old by public immunization services. METHODS: a multi-cohort, deterministic, static Markov model was populated by real-world data on the clinical and economic impact of Influenza-Like Illness and Lower Respiratory Tract Infection over 1 year. Four scenarios featuring different vaccine coverage rates were compared with the base case; coverage rates in subjects with and without risk factors were considered separately. RESULTS: compared with the base case, adopting scenarios 1-4 would reduce the annual number of influenza cases by 6.5%, 10.8%, 13.8% and 3.4%, Emergency Department accesses by 10.7%, 9.1%, 15.4% and 4.6%, complications by 8.9%, 9.9%, 14.7% and 4.1%, and the hospitalization of complicated cases by 11%, 9.1%, 15.4% and 4.5%, respectively.

Currently available antiviral drugs have found to be unsuccessful in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The demand for efficient antiviral drugs has created a huge burden on physicians and health workers. Plasma therapy seems to be less accomplishable due to insufficient donors to donate plasma and low recovery rate from viral infection. Repurposing of antivirals has been evolved as a suitable strategy in the current treatment and preventive measures. The concept of drug repurposing represents new experimental approaches for effective therapeutic benefits. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits several complications such as lung damage, blood clot formation, respiratory illness and organ failures in most of the patients. Based on the accumulation of data, sulfated marine polysaccharides have exerted successful inhibition of virus entry, attachment and replication with known or unknown possible mechanisms against deadly animal and human viruses so far. Since the virus entry into the host cells is the key process, the prevention of such entry mechanism makes any antiviral strategy effective. Enveloped viruses are more sensitive to polyanions than non-enveloped viruses. Besides, the viral infection caused by RNA virus types embarks severe oxidative stress in the human body that leads to malfunction of tissues and organs. In this context, polysaccharides play a very significant role in providing shielding effect against the virus due to their polyanionic rich features and a molecular weight that hinders their reactive surface glycoproteins. Significantly the functional groups especially sulfate, sulfate pattern and addition, uronic acids, monosaccharides, glycosidic linkage and high molecular weight have greater influence in the antiviral activity. Moreover, they are very good antioxidants that can reduce the free radical generation and provokes intracellular antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, polysaccharides enable a host-virus immune response, activate phagocytosis and stimulate interferon systems. Therefore, polysaccharides can be used as candidate drugs, adjuvants in vaccines or combination with other antivirals, antioxidants and immune-activating nutritional supplements and antiviral materials in healthcare products to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Marine Sulfated Polysaccharides as potential antiviral drug candidates to treat Corona Virus disease (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to examine the implications for the Irish housing market of the economic slowdown due to the Covid-19 virus Design/methodology/approach In this paper, an inverted demand function for housing is augmented to include a residential market activity variable and estimate the impact on house prices of the decline in economic activity due to the virus-related measures The likely future path of house prices based on two different recovery scenarios is also examined Under both scenarios house prices are forecast to decline in the near term Findings The scenario analysis presented here indicates that Irish house prices are set to fall over the next 18 months as a result of the Covid-19 downturn This contraction in prices is due to the decline in household disposable income and the sharp fall-off in mortgage market activity, which will inevitably result from the administrative closedown implemented by the Irish authorities Originality/value As such the approach builds on several studies which have examined both house price movements in general and the relationship between house prices and mortgage credit availability The paper also draws on the latest analysis of the implications for the Irish economy of Covid-19 and the related administrative closure methods introduced by the public authorities","output":"The potential impact of Covid-19 on the Irish housing sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immense patient number caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic brings the urge for more knowledge about its immunological features, including the profile of basic immune parameters.

Among them is a sizeable and reliable source of fully functional and microbiologically safe islets. The inherent variability among porcine pancreases, with respect to islet yield, prompted us to develop a Biopsy Score technique to determine the suitability of each pancreas for islet isolation processing. The Biopsy Score consists of an assessment of five variables: warm ischemia time, pancreas color, fat content, islet size, and islet demarcation, each of which is assigned a value of -1 or +1, depending on whether or not the established criteria is met. For determination of islet size and demarcation, fresh biopsies of porcine pancreases are stained with dithizone (DTZ) solution and examined under a dissecting microscope. Based on the scoring of such biopsies in pancreases from 26-56-month-old sows, we report here that the presence of large (>100 microm diameter), well-demarcated islets in the pancreas biopsy is a reliable predictor of isolation success.

In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Observations are carried out in a site with strong tidal currents and well mixed water. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that salmon prefer to use the entire water column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, salmon show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to disperse from the exposed side of the cage to the more sheltered side. Even when strong currents decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage. This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high density caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that ensuring enough vertical space, even in strong currents, would be beneficial to salmon welfare.","output":"Waves and currents decrease the available space in a salmon cage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This study aims to assess the utility of Boosting ensemble classification methods for increasing the diagnostic performance of multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) radiomic models, in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions.

Tumor masks were manually defined in all consecutive slices of the respective MRI volumes and 3D radiomic features were extracted with the Pyradiomics package. Feature dimensionality reduction was based on statistical tests and the Boruta wrapper. Hierarchical Clustering on Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between features and Random Forest classification for obtaining feature importance, were implemented for selecting the final feature subset. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifiers, were trained and tested with bootstrap validation in differentiating breast lesions. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was also exploited for comparison. The Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and DeLong's test were utilized to evaluate the classification performances. Results: The final feature subset consisted of 5 features derived from the lesion shape and the first order histogram of DCE and ADC images volumes.

In the industrialized world, stroke is the third most common cause of death, the second most common cause of dementia, and the most common reason for acquired disability in adulthood. Overall, 20%-30% of ischemic strokes are related to extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Revascularization with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold-standard treatment for patients with significant carotid stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become an accepted alternative to CEA over the past decade for patients at high surgical risk, and has progressively evolved into an elegant procedure over the past 3 decades, with dedicated equipment including proximal embolic occlusion devices that have minimized procedural strokes. High-surgical-risk CAS registries have established this procedure as an alternative to CEA for high-risk patients. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) has shown similar outcomes with CAS and CEA for patients at standard risk, although CAS is associated with higher minor stroke events and CEA is associated with higher myocardial infarction (MI) events. However, CAS is technically challenging and requires a meticulous approach, with a protracted learning curve that should involve experience with > 70 cases. Careful patient selection is instrumental in avoiding procedural complications, and the procedure should be avoided in patients with prohibitive anatomy.

The aim of this review was to detail the prevalence of clinical features and identify potential predictors for acute and chronic post-COVID syndrome. Methods A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies detailing characteristics and outcomes related to survivorship of post-COVID syndrome. The last search was performed on 6 March 2021 and all pre-dating published articles included.

METHODS: this study was conducted with 1716 confirmed patients and quarantined persons in Daegu and Busan, regions where a high number of cases were confirmed during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. We collected online survey data from 23 April to 20 May 2020, in Daegu, and 28 April to 27 May 2020, in Busan, in cooperation with Daegu and Busan Infectious Disease Control Centers and public health centers in the regions. COVID-19 symptoms, pre-cautionary behavior practices, psychological states, and the need for improvement in isolation/quarantine environments were examined using an online survey. RESULTS: compared to patients infected with coronavirus, quarantined persons engaged in more hygiene-related behaviors (e.g., hand washing, cough etiquette, and proper mask-wearing) and social distancing. COVID-19 patients had a strong fear of stigma, while quarantined persons had a strong fear of contracting COVID-19.

Due to their universal involvements, understanding the nature and also the potential therapeutic uses of these nanovesicles requires innovative experimental approaches in virtually every field. Of the EV group, exosome nanovesicles and larger companion micro vesicles can mediate completely new biologic and clinical processes dependent on the intercellular transfer of proteins and most importantly selected RNAs, particularly miRNAs between donor and targeted cells to elicit epigenetic alterations inducing functional cellular changes. These recipient acceptor cells are nearby (paracrine transfers) or far away after distribution via the circulation (endocrine transfers). The major properties of such vesicles seem to have been conserved over eons, suggesting that they may have ancient evolutionary origins arising perhaps even before cells in the primordial soup from which life evolved. Their potential ancient evolutionary attributes may be responsible for the ability of some modern-day exosomes to withstand unusually harsh conditions, perhaps due to unique membrane lipid compositions. This is exemplified by ability of the maternal milk exosomes to survive passing the neonatal acid/enzyme rich stomach. It is postulated that this resistance also applies to their durable presence in phagolysosomes, thus suggesting a unique intracellular release of their contained miRNAs. A major discussed issue is the generally poorly realized superiority of these naturally evolved nanovesicles for therapies when compared to human-engineered artificial nanoparticles, e.g., for the treatment of diseases like cancers.","output":"Ancient Evolutionary Origin and Properties of Universally Produced Natural Exosomes Contribute to Their Therapeutic Superiority Compared to Artificial Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the challenges of the pandemic, there has been substantial progress with COVID-19 therapies.

Despite their different structural organizations, all seem to have a common mechanism of action that generates the same lipid organizations during the fusion pathway. The entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires binding of the virus to one or more receptors present at the cell surface, followed by fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. These steps are mediated by virally encoded glycoproteins that promote both receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The first crystal structure of a viral fusion protein ectodomain that has been determined is that of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) in its prefusion conformation.

PARTICIPANTS: 7,141 children (aged 28 days to 14 years) admitted with severe pneumonia, severe malaria or diarrhoea with severe dehydration between January 2014 and October 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Phase 1 (pulse oximetry) introduced pulse oximetry for all admitted children. Phase 2 (full oxygen system) (i) standardised oxygen equipment package, (ii) clinical education and support, (iii) technical training and support, and (iv) infrastructure and systems support. OUTCOME MEASURES: We used quantitative QOC scores evaluating assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring practices against World Health Organization and Nigerian standards. We evaluated mean differences in QOC scores between study periods (baseline, oximetry, full oxygen system), using mixed-effects linear regression. RESULTS: 7,141 eligible participants; 6,893 (96.5%) had adequate data for analysis. Mean paediatric QOC score (maximum 6) increased from 1.64 to 3.00 (adjusted mean difference 1.39; 95% CI 1.08C1.69, p<0.001) for severe pneumonia and 2.81 to 4.04 (aMD 1.53; 95% CI 1.23C1.83, p<0.001) for severe malaria, comparing the full intervention to baseline, but did not change for diarrhoea with severe dehydration (aMD -0.12; 95% CI -0.46C0.23, p = 0.501). After excluding practices directly related to pulse oximetry and oxygen, we found aMD 0.23 for severe pneumonia (95% CI -0.02C0.48, p = 0.072) and 0.65 for severe malaria (95% CI 0.41C0.89, p<0.001) comparing full intervention to baseline.

We applied this framework to digital droplet RT-PCR measurements of SARS-CoV-2 and Pepper Mild Mottle Virus genes made using 10 replicate wells, and determined how using fewer wells affected assay sensitivity and its performance for wastewater-based epidemiology applications. We used a computational, downsampling approach. When percent of positive droplets was between 0.024% and 0.5% (as was the case for SARS-CoV-2 genes during the Delta surge), measurements obtained with 3 or more wells were similar to those obtained using 10. When percent of positive droplets was less than 0.024%, then 6 or more wells were needed to obtain similar results as those obtained using 10 wells. When COVID-19 incidence is low, as it was before the Delta surge and SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations are <104 cp/g, using 6 wells will yield a detectable concentration 90% of the time. Overall, results support an adaptive approach where assay sensitivity is increased by running 6 or more wells during periods of low SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations, and 3 or more wells during periods of high SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations.","output":"Effect of SARS-CoV-2 digital droplet RT-PCR assay sensitivity on COVID-19 wastewater based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemostatic derangement is a hallmark in severe COVID-19.

Setting: The selection of these two specific universities provided a unique opportunity to engage with comprehensive, massified and post-merger former Technikon-university institutions that mainly cater for working-class students. Methods: The social justice theory was utilised to frame the study, whilst critical narrative analysis was the methodology. Results: This research reveals that South African comprehensive universities possess capacity to adapt and innovate in the middle of an institutional crisis using their flexible systems and agile personnel to drive the academy under such circumstances. The study also reveals that the process of social justice is full of contradictions. As the universities created equitable measures to assist underprivileged students, these measures also generated injustices for others.

Binding of phosphorylated SARS-CoV N to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm was reported to regulate nucleocytoplasmic N shuttling. All seven isoforms of the human 14-3-3 are abundantly present in tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, where N can constitute up to ~1% of expressed proteins during infection. Although the association between 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent one of the key host-pathogen interactions, its molecular mechanism and the specific critical phosphosites are unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via bacterial co-expression with protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein, but not with its monomeric mutant. We demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with various efficiencies and deduce the apparent KD to selected isoforms, showing that these are in a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a critical phosphorylation site to Ser197, which is conserved among related zoonotic coronaviruses and located within the functionally important, SR-rich region of N. The relatively tight 14-3-3/pN association could regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and other functions of N via occlusion of the SR-rich region, and could also hijack cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration.

The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) improve CVD outcomes; however, there is concern that they may worsen the prognosis of CVD patients that become infected with SARS-CoV-2 because the virus uses the ACE2 receptor to bind to and subsequently infect host cells.

Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated to play a role with severity of coronavirus infection in adult patients and other viral respiratory infections. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate if severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased disease severity and cardiac involvement in MIS-C. METHODS: This is a retrospective and single center study. We included hospitalized patients less than 18 years of age with diagnosis of MIS-C between March and July 2020. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-OH vitamin D level < 10 ng/ml within 48 h of admission. The composite outcome severe disease included patients requiring inotropes, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients with MIS-C, 45% were male and 58% were African American. The median age was 8 (1C13) years. Ten patients had severe vitamin D deficiency with a mean level of 7.2 ng/ml. Ninety percent of patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had severe disease (P < 0.001). Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had an increased risk of cardiac involvement (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We describe a potential association between severe vitamin D deficiency and severe disease in children presenting with MIS-C. Severe vitamin D deficiency predisposes patients for cardiovascular involvement and, may play a critical role in the host immune response to COVID-19 infection.

In the earlier time, our experiment with base GPT2 was quite good at generating the poem in the proper template. Though it can learn the patterns, including rhyme and tone rules, from the training data, like almost all other text generation approaches, the poems generated still has a topic drift and semantic inconsistency. To improve the cohesion within the poems, we proposed a new model SP-GPT2 (semantic poem GPT2) which was built on the top GPT2 model and an additional loss to constrain context throughout the entire poem. For better evaluation, we examined the methods by both automatic quantitative evaluation and human evaluation. Both automatic and human evaluation demonstrated that our approach can generate poems that have better cohesion without losing the quality due to additional loss.

In this report, we describe our unique efforts in identifying potential drugs that could be repurposed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). To achieve this goal, we have primarily exploited the principles of 'neighbourhood behaviour' in the protein 3D (workflow-I) and chemical 2D structural space (workflow-II) coupled with docking simulations and insights into the possible modes of action of the selected candidates from the available literature. This integrative approach culminated in prioritizing 29 potential repurpose-able agents (20 approved drugs and 9 investigational molecules) against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Apart from the approved/investigational anti-viral drugs, other notable hits include anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-coagulant drugs.

Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study to understand the caregivers perspectives about the risk as well as the behavioural and social risk factors promoting malaria-helminth co-infection among pre-school and school-aged children living in endemic rural and urban communities in Senegal. In June and December 2021, we conducted individual and group interviews, and participant observations, among 100 primary caregivers of children recruited from Saraya villages in southeast Senegal and among leaders and teachers of Koranic schools in Diourbel, western Senegal. Our findings showed that a majority of the study participants in the two settings demonstrated a high level of perception of risk for malaria and acceptable awareness about handwashing practices, but had misconceptions that malaria-helminth co-infection was due to a combination of excessive consumption of sugary food and mosquito bites. Our observations revealed many factors in the house structures, toilet practices and handwashing with ashes and sands, which the caregivers did not consider as risks for malaria-helminth co-infections. These findings underscore the need to promote caregivers awareness about the existence and risk of malaria-helminth co-infection in children.

Here, we explored the roles of apoptosis and autophagy in ASK-induced cell death and the potential molecular mechanisms in human AML HL-60 cells. The results demonstrated that ASK remarkably inhibited the cell proliferation, viability and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through the mitochondrial pathway, and ASK promoted cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. In addition, the increased formation of autophagosomes, the turnover from light chain 3B (LC3B) I to LC3B II and decrease of P62 suggested the induction of autophagy by ASK. Furthermore, ASK significantly decreased PI3K, phospho-Akt and p-p70S6K expression, while enhanced phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phospho-liver kinase B1(LKB1) expression. The suppression of ASK-induced the conversion from LC3B I to LC3B II caused by the application of inhibitors of AMPK (compound C) demonstrated that ASK-induced autophagy depends on the LKB1/AMPK pathway. These data suggested that the autophagy induced by ASK were dependent on the activation of LKB1/AMPK signalling and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways.

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and angiographic results with an emphasis on visual outcomes following the endovascular treatment of ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 1254 patients who presented for endovascular treatment of a cerebral aneurysm were retrospectively reviewed to identify 65 consecutive patients who underwent coil embolization of an ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysm. The clinical records, treatment reports, and imaging were reviewed with a focus on visual outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-two of the 65 patients (34%) who presented for treatment of an ophthalmic aneurysm reported a visual disturbance at presentation. Fifteen of the 22 patients (68%) experienced an improvement in their symptoms after treatment. Overall, patients with visual symptoms were significantly more likely to benefit from treatment than to have a decline in vision (P = .03). The overall morbidity was 4%, and mortality was 0%. The retreatment rate was high at 30%, though this was disproportionately weighted by an 86% retreatment rate in patients with ruptured aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with visual symptoms attributable to ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms undergoing endovascular coil embolization were statistically more likely to experience an improvement in their vision than to have worsening or unchanged vision.

Among the 34 patients with acute abdomen, a total of six cases were found with COVID-19 pneumonia (clinical classification for COVID-19 pneumonia: all were the common type). On the premise of similar demographics between both groups, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had worse indicators of liver and coagulation function.

First and foremost, the spread of cross-border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest, just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes. At the same time, Global Health has become a major area of philanthropic action. Despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades, the complex collective term \\"Global Health\\" still lacks a uniform use today. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of Global Health, and analyse their meaning and implications. The paper emphasises that the term \\"Global Health\\" goes beyond the territorial meaning of \\"global\\", connects local and global, and refers to an explicitly political concept. Global Health regards health as a rights-based, universal good; it takes into account social inequalities, power asymmetries, the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges. Thus, it represents the necessary continuance of Public Health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges. A growing number of international players, however, focus on public-private partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions. Moreover, the predominant Global Health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the Global North. It takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease, which is mainly characterised by non-communicable conditions, and the underlying social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross-border disease threats, Global Health must focus on the social, economic and political determinants of health. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care. Consistent health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony.","output":"Global Health - emergence, hegemonic trends and biomedical reductionism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic created worldwide havoc by infecting more than 100 million populations all over the world Many industrial sectors were shut by the complete lockdown phase but to the contrary, food sector remained as one of the prime areas to be operational even in this pandemic period The panic and fear of the disease generated various myths and rumors about the effects of the corona virus on raw as well as processed food materials;the associated industries like food processing and packaging severely suffered and faced huge threats due to this pandemic, affecting food safety This article reviews the possible modes of transmission via food and attempts to highlight the innovations in food packaging that may be implemented for the safety and the quality of the food products during this COVID-19 period and future viral pandemics This work details the precautions and safety measures employed in the food industries during this pandemic situation to create awareness and preparedness for such situations of pandemics in the future","output":"Impact of COVID-19 in food industries and potential innovations in food packaging to combat the pandemic - a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism is a crucial economic sector in the Balearic Islands (Spain). COVID-19 pandemic might severely impact hotel housekeepers (HHs) due to their already precarious employment situation. The purpose is to assess the evolution of the concern about employment status, anxiety, and depression of HHs. This is a longitudinal study conducted with a subset of participants from a primary care, health promotion intervention study. Two additional visits were added (MarchCApril and OctoberCDecember 2020) for the purpose of this study. We recruited 290 HHs in MarchCApril 2020; 237 were again interviewed during OctoberCDecember 2020. In the first visit, high level of concern about employment was associated with age under 50, temporary contracts and external locus of control (LOC). ModerateCsevere anxiety was associated with low social support and external LOC; moderateCsevere depression was associated with low social support. Regarding the second visit, age, years working as HH, type of contract, social support, and LOC were not associated with concern about employment status, anxiety, and depression. There was a larger proportion of HHs with moderateCsevere anxiety and depression among HHs with high degree of concern. Concern increased significantly among HHs: over 50 years of age; with more than 15 years in the job, a recurring seasonal contract and normal social support. After adjusting by age, type of contract, LOC, and social support, we found a statistically significant increase (12.0%) of HHs highly concerned about their job situation: compared to the first visit, HHs were 2.3 more likely to have a high degree of concern in December 2020. In contrast, increases in moderateCsevere anxiety (0.3%) and depression (4.3%) between the two periods were not significant. In HHs, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant concern about employment status and symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the uncertain times of the pandemic, mental wellbeing benefits from variables that confer stability, such as internal LOC, perception of social support, and a stable job.

METHOD: Participants included 295 young adults (70.8% female; ages 18-21 at baseline), drawn from an ongoing study of daily behaviors and health in college life that oversampled for recent substance behaviors, who completed both the baseline and COVID-19 assessments. Hypotheses were tested using analyses of repeated-measures data that included covariates of length of time between assessments and sampling group status. RESULTS: Direct tests in support of hypotheses indicated an increase in negative affect (d = .67, p < .001), and greater alcohol use (d = .75, p < .001) and marijuana use (d = .58, p < .001), in daily life across time.

METHODS The numbers of interventions of participating clinics, which were recorded as part of module D (oncological procedures including TACE or other tumor-specific embolization, ablation, percutaneous tumor therapy) and identified by the DeGIR registry between 2018 and 2019, were analyzed retrospectively. The collected intervention data were evaluated regarding federal states and 40 smaller regions (administrative districts and former administrative districts). RESULTS In 2018, 11 653 oncological interventions in 187 clinics were recorded by the DeGIR registry. In 2019, the number of participating clinics rose to 216 and the number of oncological interventions increased by 6 % to 12 323. The average number of oncological interventions per clinic decreased slightly from 62.5 (2018) to 57.1 (2019). The DeGIR requirement for being certified as a training center was met by 116 clinics in 2018 including 31 clinics with more than 100 interventions and 129 clinics in 2019 including 36 with more than 100 interventions. Oncological interventions have been performed in each of the 40 regions. An average of 599 interventions per region (standard deviation of 414) was recorded in the period between 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSION Based on the distribution of the documented oncological interventions at federal state level as well as the district level, the supply of interventional tumor therapy depends on the geographical location. Therefore, the demand of oncological interventions might not be sufficiently covered in some regions. KEY POINTS  Interventional-oncological tumor therapies are performed throughout Germany.  Looking at the notable geographical differences, the need for interventional oncological procedures does not seem to be sufficiently met..  In order to improve the comprehensive provision of oncological interventions, the training of interventional radiologists should be promoted further..

However the success of each CKRT session depends much on the hemofilter lifespan. Thus optimising hemofilter lifespan and performance efficiency in CKRT has been a focus in many studies over the years. The objective of this study is to look at the factors affecting hemofilter lifespan in critically ill adults with CKRT in our centre. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted from 1st to 31stAugust 2021 in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Hospital Selayang, Malaysia. Every CKRT sessions prescribed to critically ill adults (18 years and above) during the study period were included. Demographics of patient, biochemical results, CKRT prescriptions and lifespan of the hemofilter for each session were recorded. Results: Total of 46 patients were recruited with 51 sessions of CKRT performed. Male patients were 70.6%.Mean age was 44  11 years. Almost half of the patients (49%) have underlying hypertension and 41% has diabetes. Majority were Covid-19 patients (92.2% ).Sepsis due to Covid-19 (82.4%) was main cause of ICU admission followed by other medical admission such as cardiogenic shock without Covid-19 (11.8%), surgical admission with Covid-19 (3.8%) and surgical admission without Covid-19 (2%). Indications for dialysis were refractory metabolic acidosis (56%),refractory hyperkalemia (24%) and fluid overload (20%). CKRT was performed due to severe shock (91.3%) and raised intracranial pressure (8.7%). Single inotrope was used in 84.3% of CKRT sessions and remaining had 2 or more inotropes (18%). Mean systolic blood pressure was 122  16 mmHg. Anticoagulation used were heparin (70.6 %) and citrate ( 5.9%).No anticoagulation in remaining 23.5% sessions. Mean hemofilter lifespan was 30 23 hours however death censored mean hemofilter lifespan was 4022 hours. Hemofilter lasted less than 24 hours (mean 10 4 hours) in 51% sessions,  24 hours but < 48 hours (mean 36 7 hours) 25.4%, 48 hours but < 72 hours (mean 5910 hours) 11.8% and 72 hours in 11.8% sessions (p= 0.005). The hemofilter lasted 24 hours when anticoagulant (heparin or citrate) is used compared to without anticoagulant (3623 hours versus 93 hours;P = 0.005). Mean hemofilter lifespan among Covid-19 patients were longer compared to non Covid -19 patients ( 3024 hours vs 2418 hours, P=0.937).This maybe due to anticoagulant used in this group of patient as part of Covid-19 management. No significant differences in hemofilter life were found according to age, gender, comorbidity, diagnoses, hemofilter type, site of venous access, blood flow rate, filtration fraction,type of anticoagulant, inotropic drug support, haemoglobin,D Dimer,INR and platelet.

PET at diagnosis/pre-treatment is important for staging, with greater sensitivity compared to standard CT and consequent improved outcomes in truly limited stage FL. Small datasets suggesting a high baseline SUVmax identifies de-novo histologic transformation (HT) are not corroborated by data from GALLIUM, the largest prospective study using modern therapies for FL.

There remain unmet needs: improving the inferior survival for patients remaining PET-positive; and quantifying the PFS and time to next treatment advantage, and additional toxicity of anti-CD20 maintenance in patients achieving complete metabolic remission.

The dysregulation of psychobiological stress systems, such as the autonomic nervous system (ANS) or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, might be an intermediary in this association and chronicity of ethnic discrimination may matter. We studied stress responses to a standardized discriminatory event in Turkish immigrants living in Austria. BACKGROUND Seventy-two male Turkish immigrants were recruited; n = 35 had experienced high levels of ethnic discrimination (high), n = 37 infrequent ethnic discrimination (low). During a two-hour laboratory appointment, they underwent a previously validated 10-minute ethnic discrimination paradigm, i.e., a simulated physician's consultation with verbal and non-verbal discriminatory cues. Perceived stress, perceived discrimination, salivary cortisol, and alpha-amylase were assessed seven times, and ANS measures (heart rate, heart rate variability, and electrodermal activity) were measured continuously. In addition, hair cortisol concentrations were determined. RESULTS The ethnic discrimination paradigm elicited stress responses across all outcomes in both groups. Compared to the low group, the high group reported higher levels of perceived stress and discrimination, exhibited a less steep increase in cortisol in response to the paradigm, and showed higher hair cortisol concentrations. No group differences were found regarding ANS measures. CONCLUSIONS The combination of high subjective stress, flattened cortisol responses, and relatively high hair cortisol concentrations may indicate a dysregulation of the HPA axis in chronic ethnic discrimination. A better understanding of the psychobiological effects of chronic ethnic discrimination is crucial given that alterations in stress response systems may, over time, lead to illness and ultimately to substantial health inequities in ethnic minorities.","output":"Psychobiological effects of chronic ethnic discrimination in Turkish immigrants: Stress responses to standardized face-to-face discrimination in the laboratory."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case-control study sought to confirm and investigate in more depth protective associations previously found of bovine (cattle and water buffalo) ownership with reduced risk of both pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in humans.

Controls were tested for LTBI status and a separate nested case-control study was conducted based on LTBI status. Data were collected on participant household animal ownership. Using logistic regression, animal ownership was investigated for associations with both PTB and LTBI. Data were obtained from 570 PTB cases and 1,224 controls, the latter group providing 396 LTBI-positive and 692 LTBI-negative subjects. Results provided evidence of decreased odds of both PTB and LTBI positivity associated with owning bovines. The evidence was strongest for protection against infection, rather than activation of infection to PTB. Effects were strongest in women, who usually manage the animals in Nepal, and there were exposure-response relationships with numbers of bovines owned. Results suggest that exposure to bovines is protective against LTBI and PTB.

For its safe application, the risks of camostat mesylate to induce pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with co-administered drugs should be known. We therefore tested in vitro the potential inhibition of important efflux (P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2)), and uptake transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) by camostat mesylate and its active metabolite 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA). Transporter inhibition was evaluated using fluorescent probe substrates in transporter over-expressing cell lines and compared to the respective parental cell lines. Moreover, possible mRNA induction of pharmacokinetically relevant genes regulated by the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was analysed in LS180 cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The results of our study for the first time demonstrated that camostat mesylate and GBPA do not relevantly inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.

Induction experiments in LS180 cells excluded induction of PXR-regulated genes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and ABCB1 and AhR-regulated genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 by camostat mesylate and GBPA. Together with the summary of product characteristics of camostat mesylate indicating no inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 in vitro, our data suggest a low potential of camostat mesylate to act as a perpetrator in pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Only inhibition of OATP2B1 by GBPA warrants further investigation.","output":"Low risk of the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA to act as perpetrators of drug-drug interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the high degree of personalization of embedded 3D printing products, traditional 3D printing is not applicable.

ABSTRACT: COVID-19 pandemic has induced governments to promote strict containment measures which inevitably altered patients lifestyle with potential effects on blood pressure (BP) control. We aimed to evaluate the changes in home BP (HBP) during the COVID-19 related lockdown in a cohort of hypertensive patients. Consecutive adult patients with arterial hypertension and stable medical treatment were recruited. HBP values were recorded before and after lockdown in March 2020. An additional set of HBP measurements, recorded one year before the pre-lockdown period, were also considered as reference because of similar environmental temperature. A total of 126 patients were included: 47% males, mean age 66 [58-72], reference HBP 124.78 (9.90)/76.19 (8.10) mmHg. In the whole group, patients during lockdown exhibited lower systolic and diastolic HBP values compared to the pre-lockdown period [123.23 vs 125.05 mmHg, p = 0.008 and 74.45 vs 75.28 mmHg, p = 0.023, respectively]. Patients with uncontrolled HBP showed the most consistent drop of systolic HBP [136.06 (8.36) and 138.0 (2.08) vs 130 (9.35) p = 0.001 and p < 0.001] and diastolic [81.30 (6.75) and 84.9 (1.85) vs 78.78 (9.25), p = 0.018 and p = 0.002] from pre-lockdown to lockdown and when considering reference values taken one year before, respectively. (Figure 1: Mean values at baseline, pre-lockdown and during lockdown in the 3 groups for systolic (A) and diastolic (B) blood pressure (dotted line = uncontrolled BP group, solid line = unstable BP control, dashed line = controlled BP group). *p<.001 (one year before lockdown vs lockdown SBP), #p = 0.001 (pre-lockdown vs lockdown SBP), $p = 0.002 (one year before lockdown vs lockdown DBP), p = 0.018 (pre-lockdown vs lockdown DBP). Grey box refers to the lockdown period. SBP = systolic blood pressure, DBP = diastolic blood pressure.) In conclusion, this study reports for the first time the occurrence of no changes or even a reduction in home BP of treated hypertensive patients during lockdown due to COVID-19. These results may have implications for the management of patients with high blood pressure not only during the current pandemic but also in case of future lockdown conditions.","output":"Home blood pressure during COVID-19 related lockdown in patients with hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a major public health burden around the world.

No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 M of MMPD, viral titers were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop. The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 M significantly reduced viral titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection.

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and included studies that evaluated the association of any respiratory health outcome with exposure to cleaning occupation or products in occupational cleaners. A modified GRADE was used to appraise the quality of included studies. We retrieved 1124 articles, and after applying our inclusion criteria, 39 were selected for the systematic review. We performed a meta-analysis of the 21 studies evaluating asthma which showed a 50% increased pooled relative risk in cleaners (meta-relative risk (RR)=1.50; 95% CI 1.44 to 1.56). Population-based cross-sectional studies showed more stable associations with asthma risk. No evidence of atopic asthma as dominant phenotype emerged. Also, we estimated a 43% increased risk (meta-RR=1.43; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.56) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence for associations with bronchial-hyper-responsiveness, lung function decline, rhinitis, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms was weaker.

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the -CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide valuable insights on the molecular basis of the specificity of -CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptor adaptation of circulating and future novel -CoVs.","output":"Unraveling the molecular basis of host cell receptor usage in SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic -CoVs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic imposes serious problems to health systems around the world and its rapid expansion makes it difficult to serve patients with certain health conditions such as cancer patients which might be at high risk for mortality if they are infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Estimates focused on numbers of deaths, do not quantify potential years of life lost (YLL) through COVID-19. As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some speculate that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs. Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs inform a Bayesian model for likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. From these, we used routine UK healthcare data from Scotland and Wales to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/ combinations of LTCs using Gompertz models. We then calculated YLL based on age, sex, type of LTCs and multimorbidity count. Results: Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (11.6 and 9.4 years for man and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at 80 years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and <3 years for people with 6). Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age.

Since the 1960s, total hip arthroplasty (THA) has made great progress and is nowadays one of the most frequently used procedures in orthopedic surgery. Different bearing concepts exist in various implant designs. A metal-on-metal bearing can create metal debris and lead to metallosis. We present a unique case of a 78-year old woman, who received hip resurfacing with a McMinn-like prosthesis 15 years ago. Over the cause of time, metallosis developed and created a bone cyst in the Os ilium, and osteolysis led to a dislocation of the femoral implant. A minor stumble fall led to a fracture of the Os ilium. We present our treatment method with implantation of a cemented THA and refill of the bone cyst with bone from allogene femoral heads. The surgery led to a reconstruction of the physiological center of rotation in the hip. Consequently, to the inpatient stay, the patient took part in a follow-up treatment with intensive physiotherapy. Taken together, the results after total hip arthroplasty are more superior to other hip surface replacements in terms of longevity and patient satisfaction. Especially, metal-on-metal bearing couples carry a great risk of metallosis, which goes a long with pseudotumors, osteolysis, and the elevated metal ions in the blood.

Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.","output":"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown?

Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as older age groups, are known to have a more severe disease progression and poor prognosis. In this review article, we attempt to better understand the disease process in diabetics and also discuss potential mechanisms by which diabetes may play a role in disease severity. This includes the effect of diabetes on the immune response and immune dysregulation. The role of diabetes mellitus in molecular processes including augmenting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) levels is also discussed as potential mechanisms to explain the grave prognosis seen in these patients.","output":"Heightened ACE Activity and Unfavorable Consequences in COVID-19 Diabetic Subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuing to have a significant effect on the well-being of the global population, thus increasing the demand for rapid testing, diagnosis, and treatment. As COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia, early diagnosis is essential for correct treatment, as well as to reduce the stress on the healthcare system. Along with COVID-19, other etiologies of pneumonia and Tuberculosis (TB) constitute additional challenges to the medical system. Pneumonia (viral as well as bacterial) kills about 2 million infants every year and is consistently estimated as one of the most important factor of childhood mortality (according to the World Health Organization). Chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans are the primary imaging modalities for diagnosing respiratory diseases. Although CT scans are the gold standard, they are more expensive, time consuming, and are associated with a small but significant dose of radiation. Hence, CXR have become more widespread as a first line investigation. In this regard, the objective of this work is to develop a new deep transfer learning pipeline, named DenResCov-19, to diagnose patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, TB or healthy based on CXR images. The pipeline consists of the existing DenseNet-121 and the ResNet-50 networks. Since the DenseNet and Resnet have orthogonal performances in some instances, in the proposed model we have created an extra layer with convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks to join these two models together to establish superior performance as compared to the two individual networks. This strategy can be applied universally in cases where two competing networks are observed. We have tested the performance of our proposed network on two-class (pneumonia and healthy), three-class (COVID-19 positive, healthy, and pneumonia), as well as four-class (COVID-19 positive, healthy, TB, and pneumonia) classification problems. We have validated that our proposed network has been able to successfully classify these lung-diseases on our four datasets and this is one of our novel findings. In particular, the AUC-ROC are 99.60, 96.51, 93.70, 96.40% and the F1 values are 98.21, 87.29, 76.09, 83.17% on our Dataset X-Ray 1, 2, 3, and 4 (DXR1, DXR2, DXR3, DXR4), respectively.","output":"DenResCov-19: A deep transfer learning network for robust automatic classification of COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis from X-rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People living with dementia and multimorbidity are frequent uses of health, amplifying risk of adverse events and fragmented care when moving between and across care settings. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to identify interventions to support transitional care for older people living with dementia and concomitant multimorbidity and their caregivers. RESEARCH DESIGN: Systematic review was completed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search from 2000 to January 2018 of Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Academic Search Complete databases for studies which implemented a transitional care intervention for older people living with dementia and multimorbidity. The search terms used were: \\"dementia,\\" \\"multi-morbidity,\\" \\"multiple chronic conditions,\\" \\"transitional care,\\" and \\"care coordination\\". RESULTS: Out of the 6053 identified abstracts, 11 studies and 13 papers were included. These studies included 1861 people living with dementia, mean age 80 years (SD 3) and 1503 caregivers, with a mean age of 69 years (SD 5). The heterogeneity of study interventions and outcome measures precluded a meta-analysis being conducted. Therefore, narrative synthesis was undertaken identifying six elements of care that optimise outcomes for people living with dementia and/or their carers; 1) unmet needs; 2) depression; 3) education and support; 4) physical decline; 5) poor quality of life and; 6) access and knowledge of community services.

Nowadays it has been proven that a deficiency of certain micronutrients in the diet can disrupt chemical, structural and regulatory processes in the organism, which negatively affects, first of all, the state of immune system. Zinc is one of the most significant essential trace elements affecting immunological resistance. The aim of the study was to substantiate the need of including zinc-containing products and diet supplements in the diet of the population during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the basis of the study of pathogenetic mechanisms of various disorders of the immunological status under zinc deficit. Material and methods. This review analyzes the data from scientific electronic libraries CyberLeninka, eLIBRARY.RU, the Google Scholar databases and bibliographic medical databases MEDLINE and PubMed-NCBI. Results and discussion. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adequate zinc supply is especially important, due to its antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic effects. This element also regulates the severity of the cytokine response, exhibits antibacterial properties and helps to compensate for chronic comorbid diseases, which plays a particularly significant role in preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 and recurrent respiratory diseases. Prevention and correction of zinc deficiency is considered as one of the important measures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, aimed at increasing antiviral and general immunity, reducing the systemic inflammatory response and correcting hormonal and metabolic status. Conclusion. The pathogenetically substantiated inclusion of zinc-containing foods and supplements in the diet will enhance the immunity of the population during the SARSCoV- 2 pandemic.","output":"[Zinc status improving as a pathogenetically grounded platform for maintaining immunity during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal cancer originates from adenomatous polyps. Adenomatous polyps start out as benign, but over time they can become malignant and even lead to complications and death which will spread to adherent and surrounding organs over time, such as lymph nodes, liver, or lungs, eventually leading to complications and death. Factors such as operator's experience shortage and visual fatigue will directly affect the diagnostic accuracy of colonoscopy. To relieve the pressure on medical imaging personnel, this paper proposed a network model for colonic polyp detection using colonoscopy images. Considering the unnoticeable surface texture of colonic polyps, this paper designed a channel information interaction perception (CIIP) module. Based on this module, an information interaction perception network (IIP-Net) is proposed. In order to improve the accuracy of classification and reduce the cost of calculation, the network used three classifiers for classification: fully connected (FC) structure, global average pooling fully connected (GAP-FC) structure, and convolution global average pooling (C-GAP) structure. We evaluated the performance of IIP-Net by randomly selecting colonoscopy images from a gastroscopy database. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy of IIP-NET54-GAP-FC module is 99.59%, and the accuracy of colonic polyp is 99.40%.

Many patients, however, still chose face-2-face (f2f) appointments for nonemergent clinical care. OBJECTIVE: We explored patients personal and environmental barriers to the use of video appointments from April 2020 to December 2020. METHODS: We conducted qualitative telephone interviews of Mayo Clinic patients who attended f2f appointments at the Mayo Clinic from April 2020 to December 2020 but did not utilize Mayo Clinic video appointment services during that time frame. RESULTS: We found that, although most patients were concerned about preventing COVID-19 transmission, they trusted Mayo Clinic to keep them safe when attending f2f appointments. Many expressed that a video appointment made it difficult to establish rapport with their providers. Other common barriers to video appointments were perceived therapeutic benefits of f2f appointments, low digital literacy, and concerns about privacy and security. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides an in-depth investigation into barriers to engaging in video appointments for nonemergent clinical care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings corroborate many barriers prevalent in the prepandemic literature and suggest that rapport barriers need to be analyzed and problem-solved at a granular level.","output":"Patient Telemedicine Perceptions During the COVID-19 Pandemic Within a Multi-State Medical Institution: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State rumination, unlike trait rumination which is described as a persistent and stable response style, is usually triggered by a specific stressful event and causes negative emotions within a short period of time. The measurement methods of trait rumination, such as the ruminative response scale (RRS), are therefore not fully applicable to state rumination. Recently, researchers have developed the brief state rumination inventory (BSRI) to characterize state rumination, addressing the gap in the field of accurate measurement of state rumination. To develop such an effective tool in the Chinese context, we developed a Chinese version of the BSRI and tested its psychometric properties. Two studies were conducted to address the research goal. In Study 1, we recruited 512 subjects, each of whom completed the Chinese version of the BSRI, RRS, emotional regulation questionnaire (ERQ), depressionCanxietyCstress scale (DASS), and positive and negative affect scale (PANAS). Results showed that the scores of the BSRI were positively correlated with all other scale scores (ps < 0.001), and the correlation with the RRS was the highest, indicating that the BSRI showed good convergent validity. Additionally, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the Chinese version of the BSRI was 0.93. Study 2 aimed to examine the ecological validity of the Chinese version of the BSRI. We recruited another 54 subjects who were randomly divided into two groups, with 27 in the rumination induction group and 27 in the distraction group, and recorded the BSRI scores of the two groups before and after a specific experiment. We found there was a significant increase in BSRI scores after rumination induction (t = 3.91, p < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in the concrete distraction group before and after the experiment (t = 0.70, p = 0.48). In sum, the Chinese version of the BSRI showed good reliability and validity for assessing state rumination in the general Chinese population.","output":"Psychometric Properties of the Chinese Version of the Brief State Rumination Inventory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report includes a summary of a current outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus infection in the Republic of Korea as of June 23, 2015.

This study aimed to investigate if combined ultrasound and electrostimulation is an effective adjunctive treatment for hard-to-heal DFUs when compared with standard wound care. METHODS: A randomised controlled pilot study design was used. Patients with hard-to-heal DFUs from two centres were sequentially randomised. For 8 weeks, the experimental group received CUSECS and standard wound care treatment twice a week. The control group received standard wound care treatment once a week. Wound changes were documented using photography, which also facilitated wound size measurement. Self-efficacy, economic cost, quality of life and reoccurrence rates were analysed as secondary objectives. RESULTS: The experimental group (n=6) achieved a higher rate of mean wound healing (mean difference (MD): 0.49) when compared to the control group (n=5, MD: 0.01). Two participants completed full healing in the experimental group and one in the control group. There were no statistically significant findings because of the small sample size. There were no direct adverse reactions to this therapy. Quality of life scores improved in the treatment group. There was no significant change in self-efficacy scores. Costs were higher in the experimental group; however, the healing rate was quicker, which could be extrapolated to cost reductions over time. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that CUSECS may be a useful adjunctive therapy for treatment of hard-to-heal DFUs. Further large-scale studies are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of CUSECS. The findings here are inconclusive but indicate that CUSECS may offer promise as a treatment.","output":"Effectiveness of combined modulated ultrasound and electric current stimulation to treat diabetic foot ulcers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The office environment has changed rapidly due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Companies consider various types of remote work environments to contain the spread of the virus. Among them, a satellite office is a type of remote work environment where a number of employees are allocated to their nearest office. The benefits from satellite offices are twofold: The significant reduction of travel distance also reduces the amount of carbon emission and fuel consumption. In addition, dividing employees into smaller groups significantly reduces the potential risks of infection in the office. This paper addresses a satellite office allocation problem that considers social and environmental sustainability and infection control at work. In order to evaluate the effect of different satellite office allocation, quantitative measures are developed for the following three criteria: carbon emission, fuel consumption, and the probability of infection occurrence at work. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate different scenarios of regional infection rate and modes of transportation. The results show that adopting satellite offices not only reduces carbon emission and fuel consumption, but also mitigates business disruption in the pandemic.","output":"Adoption of Satellite Offices in Response to a Pandemic: Sustainability and Infection Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The triglyceride and glucose index (TyG) has been proposed as a marker of insulin resistance.

By using a mix-method approach, the study addresses three research questions: 1) What kinds of messages did the police tend to post on their Facebook pages before and during this pandemic? 2) What types of COVID-related police Facebook postings were made? 3) How did the public react to COVID-19-related police Facebook postings? Findings: The findings suggest that the police have come to believe that social media can be used as an effective police?public communicative tool in stressful times. The findings also suggest that social media platforms have become a routinized tool of police?public communications which can, to some appreciable extent, substitute for the in-person contacts traditionally relied upon in community policing. Originality/value: This study of police use of social media explores the question of whether the use of these media can serve as an effective tool to connect the police with the public under circumstances where in-person contacts are greatly constrained.

The aim of the study was to examine the disability-inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in four South American Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. METHODS: We conducted documentary research, using framework analysis to analyse reports, legislation, decrees, and other official documents that communicated measures taken in response to the pandemic, published from February 1st until May 22nd, 2020. We included documents reporting measures that affected disabled people either directly (measures specifically designed for disabled people) or indirectly (measures for the general population). We developed an analytical framework based on recommendations for disability-inclusive response to COVID-19 published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Carribean, the World Health Organisation, and other international organisations. RESULTS: We analysed 72 documents. The findings highlight that while some positive measures were taken, the needs of disabled people were not fully considered. Several countries published recommendations for a disability-inclusive response to COVID-19, without ensuring their translation to practice. All countries took at least some steps to ensure access to financial support, health, and education for disabled people, but at the same time they also implemented policies that had a detrimental impact on disabled people. The populations that are most exposed to the impacts of COVID-19, including disabled people living in institutional care, were protected in several cases only by recommendations rather by legislation. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how the official government responses taken by four countries in the region - while positive, in several aspects - do not fully address the needs of disabled people, thus further disadvantaging them.

Children aged between 6 and 14 years, with myopia between ? 2.00 D to ? 6.00 D, astigmatism < 1.50 D and documented previous annual progression greater than ? 0.5 D (cycloplegic spherical equivalent, SE) were included. Once nightly atropine 0.01% eye drops in each eye were prescribed to all participants for 12 months. Age, gender, ethnicity and iris color were registered. All patients underwent the same follow-up protocol in every center: baseline visit, telephone consultation 2 weeks later and office controls at 4, 8 and 12 months. At each visit, best-corrected visual acuity, and cycloplegic autorefraction were assessed. Axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth and pupil diameter were measured on an IOL Master (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA). Adverse effects were registered in a specific questionnaire. Mean changes in cycloplegic SE and AL in the 12 months follow-up were analyzed. SE progression during treatment was compared with the SE progression in the year before enrollment for each patient. Correlation between SE and AL, and annual progression distribution were evaluated. Progression risk factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. Of the 105 recruited children, 92 completed the treatment. Mean SE and AL changes were ? 0.44  0.41 D and 0.27  0.20 mm respectively. Mean SE progression was lower than the year before treatment (? 0.44  0.41 D versus ? 1.01  0.38 D; p < 0.0001).

However, COVID-19 related risk in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery has not been studied yet. We evaluated the safety of breast cancer surgery during COVID-19 pandemic in the West of Scotland region. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having breast cancer surgery was carried out in a geographical region during the first eight weeks of the hospital lockdown and outcomes were compared to the regional cancer registry data of pre-COVID-19 patients of the same units (n = 1415). RESULTS: 188 operations were carried out in 179 patients. Tumour size was significantly larger in patients undergoing surgery during hospital lockdown than before (cT3-4: 16.8% vs. 7.4%; p < 0.001; pT2 - pT4: 45.5% vs. 35.6%; p = 0.002). ER negative and HER-2 positive rate was significantly higher during lockdown (ER negative: 41.3% vs. 17%, p < 0.001; HER-2 positive: 23.4% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.004). While breast conservation rate was lower during lockdown (58.6% vs. 65%; p < 0.001), level II oncoplastic conservation was significantly higher in order to reduce mastectomy rate (22.8% vs. 5.6%; p < 0.001). No immediate reconstruction was offered during lockdown. 51.2% had co-morbidity, and 7.8% developed postoperative complications in lockdown. There was no peri-operative COVID-19 infection related morbidity or mortality.

OBJECTIVES: This focused ethnographic study sought to understand how oncology services balance the unique and complex needs of these patients with those of the service more widely. DESIGN: Focused ethnography. SETTING: Two National Health Service hospital trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen people with dementia and cancer, 22 relatives and 19 staff members participated. METHODS: Participant observation, informal conversations, semi-structured interviews, and medical notes review. RESULTS: Improved satisfaction and outcomes of care were reported when staff were delivering person-centred care. Staff tried to balance the need for personalised and flexible support for individuals with dementia with managing targets and processes of cancer care and treatment. The importance of continuity of people, places, and processes was consistently highlighted. CONCLUSION: Navigating and managing the delicate balance between the needs of the individual and the needs of services more widely was difficult for both staff and patients. Improved awareness, identification and documentation of dementia would help to ensure that staff are aware of any specific patient needs.

In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers.

The objective of this study was to describe sex and age differences and the impact of a dementia diagnosis on symptom occurrence during the last week in life for persons dying from COVID-19 in nursing homes. METHODS: This is a population-based retrospective study based on data from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care. A total of 1994 residents aged 65 or older who died from COVID-19 in nursing homes were identified. The impact of sex, age and a dementia diagnosis on six different symptoms was analysed using chi2-test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Residents dying from COVID-19 were more often men (p < .002). Men more often had dyspnoea and death rattles (p < .001). Nausea was more common in women (p < .001). No sex differences in the occurrence of pain, anxiety or confusion were seen. Dyspnoea and nausea were less commonly reported in residents with dementia (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found sex differences in symptom presentation for fatal COVID-19 in nursing home settings which remained after adjusting for age. Residents with a dementia diagnosis had fewer symptoms reported before death compared to those without dementia.

The study's hypotheses are empirically tested on primary data from a sample of 259 firms in a sub-Saharan African economy. Using structural equation modeling as an analytical tool, the study finds that both disruption absorption and recoverability have positive effects on operational efficiency. Additionally, the study finds that while the effect of disruption absorption on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of high operational disruption, the effect of recoverability on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of low operational disruption. A major implication of these findings is that the nature of operational resilience and the disruption circumstances under which it is deployed shape its efficiency value, thus advancing knowledge on the nuances associated with how and when operational resilience influences operational efficiency.","output":"Operational resilience, disruption, and efficiency: Conceptual and empirical

BACKGROUND Current guidelines for managing patients with hypertension mainly rely on blood pressure (BP) measured at brachial arteries (cuff BP). However, BP measured at the central aorta (central BP [CBP]) may be a better prognostic factor for predicting future cardiovascular events than cuff BP. METHODS In a derivation cohort (1,272 individuals and a median follow-up of 15 years), we determined diagnostic thresholds for CBP by using current guideline-endorsed cutoffs for cuff BP with a bootstrapping (resampling by drawing randomly with replacement) and an approximation method. To evaluate the discriminatory power in predicting cardiovascular outcomes, the derived thresholds were tested in a validation cohort (2,501 individuals with median follow-up of 10 years). RESULTS The 2 analyses yielded similar diagnostic thresholds for CBP. After rounding, systolic/diastolic threshold was 110/80 mm Hg for optimal BP and 130/90 mm Hg for hypertension. Compared with optimal BP, the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased significantly in subjects with hypertension (hazard ratio: 3.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 9.05). Of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, incorporation of a dichotomous variable by defining hypertension as CBP  130/90 mm Hg was associated with the largest contribution to the predictive power. CONCLUSIONS CBP of 130/90 mm Hg was determined to be the cutoff limit for normality and was characterized by a greater discriminatory power for long-term events in our validation cohort.

MethodsEssential workers were selected from a seroprevalence survey cohort in Geneva, Switzerland and were linked to a state centralized registry compiling SARS-CoV-2 infections. Primary outcome was the number of virologically-confirmed infections from serological assessment (between May and September 2020) to January 25, 2021, according to baseline antibody status and stratified by three pre-defined occupational groups (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity, involving brief regular contact or others). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of infection. Results10457 essential workers were included (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity accounted for 3057 individuals, those involving regular brief contact, 3645, and 3755 workers were classified under \\"Other essential occupations\\"). After a follow-up period of over 27 weeks, 5 (0.6%) seropositive and 830 (8.5%) seronegative individuals had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with an incidence rate of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.9 to 3.4) cases per person-week, respectively. Incidences were similar across occupational groups. Seropositive essential workers had a 93% reduction in the hazard (HR of 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17) of having a positive test during follow-up with no significant between-occupational group difference. ConclusionsA ten-fold reduction in the hazard of being virologically tested positive was observed among anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive essential workers regardless of their sector of occupation, confirming the seroprotective effect of a previous SARS-CoV2 exposure at least six months after infection.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study among urological HCWs was performed. HCWs were surveyed for anxiety about the pandemic, stress level and current workload, fear of coronavirus infection, current perception of safety at work, and attitude towards protective equipment and tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Sixty-three HCWs filled in the questionnaire. Overall anxiety of infection with CO-VID-19 is at a median of 4.7 with no statistically significant difference between nurses and physicians (p = 0.0749). Safety at work reaches a median of 6 out of 10. In fact, the highest fear in 56.7% (31/63) of the personnel is to get infected by a colleague tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing surgical face masks. A proportion of 55.7 and 74.6% highly favor swabs for SARS-CoV-2 on a regular basis in HCWs and patients, respectively (p = 0.0001). Workload in the urology department is clearly reduced during the pandemic (physicians 39.3% vs. nurses 32.2%, p = 0.0001) and 57.4% do not feel distress at all; only 27.9% express mental distress. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, urology HCWs perceive lower burden by workload and deem themselves at low risk of infection. However, the greatest anxiety is related to infection by a SARS-CoV-2-positive colleague, despite reciprocal protection by surgical face masks. This highlights a relevant mental stress and uncertainty towards management of infected HCWs, calling for increased education and psychological support.","output":"Does Pandemic Anxiety Affect Urology Health Care Workers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation has often been seen as a disability-specific service needed by only few of the population. Despite its individual and societal benefits, rehabilitation has not been prioritised in countries and is under-resourced. We present global, regional, and country data for the number of people who would benefit from rehabilitation at least once during the course of their disabling illness or injury. METHODS: To estimate the need for rehabilitation, data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 were used to calculate the prevalence and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) of 25 diseases, impairments, or bespoke aggregations of sequelae that were selected as amenable to rehabilitation. All analyses were done at the country level and then aggregated to seven regions: World Bank high-income countries and the six WHO regions (ie, Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific). FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, 241 billion (95% uncertainty interval 234C250) individuals had conditions that would benefit from rehabilitation, contributing to 310 million [235C392] YLDs. This number had increased by 63% from 1990 to 2019. Regionally, the Western Pacific had the highest need of rehabilitation services (610 million people [588C636] and 83 million YLDs [62C106]). The disease area that contributed most to prevalence was musculoskeletal disorders (171 billion people [168C180]), with low back pain being the most prevalent condition in 134 of the 204 countries analysed. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to produce a global estimate of the need for rehabilitation services and to show that at least one in every three people in the world needs rehabilitation at some point in the course of their illness or injury. This number counters the common view of rehabilitation as a service required by only few people. We argue that rehabilitation needs to be brought close to communities as an integral part of primary health care to reach more people in need.

In South Korea, a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system is lacking due to limited resources. We developed a simplified ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation for use by public emergency medical services. METHODS: Eighteen patients utilized our ECMO transport system from December 2011 to September 2015. We retrospectively analyzed the indications for ECMO, the patient status during transport, and the patient outcomes. RESULTS: All transport was conducted on the ground by ambulance. The distances covered ranged from 26 to 408 km (mean, 65.988.1 km) and the average transport time was 56.157.3 minutes (range, 30 to 280 minutes). All patients were transported without adverse events. After transport, 4 patients (22.2%) underwent lung transplantation because of interstitial lung disease. Eight patients who had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome showed recovery of heart and lung function after ECMO therapy. A total of 13 patients (70.6%) were successfully taken off ECMO, and 11 patients (61.1%) survived. CONCLUSION: Our ECMO transport system without mechanical ventilation can be considered a safe and useful method for interhospital transport and could be a good alternative option for ECMO transport in Korean hospitals with limited resources.","output":"Interhospital Transport System for Critically Ill Patients: Mobile Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation without a Ventilator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer-aided-diagnosis for COVID-19 based on chest X-ray suffers from weak bias assessment and limited quality-control.

METHODS: We adapted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVIDTracer Advanced tool to model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school of 596 individuals. We estimate possible reductions in cases and hospitalizations among this population using a scenario-based analysis that accounts for (a) the risk of importation of infection from the community; (b) adherence to key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended mitigation strategies: mask wearing, cleaning and disinfection, hand hygiene, and social distancing; and (c) the effectiveness of contact tracing interventions at limiting onward transmission. RESULTS: Low impact and effectiveness of mitigation strategies (net effectiveness: 27%) result in approximately 40% of exposed staff and students becoming COVID-19 cases. When the net effectiveness of mitigation strategies was 69% or greater, in-school transmission was mostly prevented, yet importation of cases from the surrounding community could result in nearly 20% of the school's population becoming infected within 180 days. The combined effects of mitigation strategies and contact tracing were able to prevent most onward transmission. Hospitalizations were low among children and adults (<0.5% of the school population) across all scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, layering mitigation strategies and contact tracing can limit the number of cases that may occur from transmission in schools. Schools in communities with substantial levels of community spread will need to be more vigilant to ensure adherence of mitigation strategies to minimize transmission. Our results show that for school administrators, teachers, and parents to provide the safest environment, it is important to utilize multiple mitigation strategies and contract tracing that reduce SARS CoV-2 transmission by at least 69%. This will require training, reinforcement, and vigilance to ensure that the highest level of adherence is maintained over the entire school term.","output":"Modeling the Transmission of Covid-19: Impact of Mitigation Strategies in Prekindergarten-Grade 12 Public Schools, United States, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Nous avons men, dans le cadre dune campagne H?pital et Campus Sans Tabac, une tude de prvalence du tabagisme et du vapotage auprs des personnels dun CHRU.

This brief commentary examines the deficits of current models and proposes several improved alternates. The existing single transgene mouse models poorly mimic the clinical features of COVID-19; those strains get a milder disease than human COVID-19 disease. Many of the current transgenic models utilize random integration of several copies of single ACE2 transgenes, resulting in unnatural gene expression and exhibit rapid lethality. We suggest preparing precision knock-in of selected human mini genes at the mouse initiation codon and knock-out of the mouse homolog as a better option. Three genes critical for infection are suggested targets, ACE2 (the viral cellular receptor), its co-infection protease TMRPSS2, and the primary antibody clearance receptor Fc?3RT. To offer the best platform for COVID 19 research, preparation of single, double, and triple humanized combinations offers the researcher the opportunity to better understand the contributions of these receptors, coreceptors to therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we propose to create the humanized strains in the C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2 responders, respectively, and allow modeling of the variability seen in human pathology including lung pathology and late sequelae of COVID-19 disease (BALB/c). We suggest the need to do a thorough characterization of both the short-term and long-term effects of SAR-CoV-2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, hematologic, and immunologic levels. We expect the multiply humanized strains will be superior to the single-gene and multiple-gene-copy transgenic models available to date.

METHODS: 274 Italian and Canadian expectant mothers completed an online-based survey including measures of perceived social support (from family, significant other and friends), state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and satisfaction with life. Correlation analyses and amultivariate analysis of covariance were performed to explore how social support from different sources was related to depressive symptoms, state anxiety and satisfaction with life. RESULTS: Different sources of social support contributed to explaining women's psychological distress and mental well-being. Social support both from family and friends was significantly related to women's state anxiety and depressive symptoms. Social support from friends was specifically related to women's satisfaction with life. CONCLUSION: Our findings endorse the crucial role of perceived social support as a protective factor for pregnant women's mental health.

During the COVID-19(Coronavirus Disease 2019) epidemic,home isolation is considered a boost to the progression of children's myopia. Under geographical conditions of high altitude and strong sunshine, the Tibetan plateau is the main residence of the Tibetan population, where little information is available about the refractive status and developmental trajectory.Therefore,this article aimed to evaluate the distribution,progression,and associated factors of the refractive status in second grade children in Lhasa after COVID-19 quarantine. Materials and Methods Students from 7 elementary schools completed comprehensive ocular examinations in the Lhasa Childhood Eye Study. Data regarding cycloplegic refraction and corneal biometry parameters, including axial length (AL),corneal power,anterior chamber depth(ACD),and other demographic factors,were analyzed. Results A total of 1,819 students were included, with a mean age of 7.90.5 years, of which 961 were boys (52.8%), and 95.1% were Tibetan. The prevalence of myopia, emmetropia, mild hyperopia and hyperopia was 10.94%, 24.02%, 60.80% and 4.24%, respectively. Besides, the average cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction(SER) was +1.070.92D before the COVID-19 quarantine and +0.591.08D after the quarantine, with a growth rate of 7%. Moreover, the prevalence of hyperopia in girls was significantly higher than that of boys. Nonetheless, the proportion of myopia and emmetropia was similar. Meanwhile, children in suburban schools had a significantly lower proportion of myopia. The average AL, ACD, lens power (LP) and axial length-to-corneal radius(AL/CR) ratio were 22.790.78mm, 3.540.21mm, 25.121.48D and 2.930.08, respectively. The result of AL,ACD,and AL/CR for girls were significantly lower than for boys while the result of LP is the opposite. Finally, multivariate regression analysis revealed that SER was negatively correlated with AL, LP, and AL-to-CR ratio, while positively correlated with CR and ACD. Conclusion This study found that after the COVID-19 confinement, myopia progressed faster in Lhasa children but was still significantly lower than that of plain cities in China. Compared to short-term confinement, this acceleration was more likely related to the growth and general trend of myopia in children.

Phylogenetic studies show that host shifts are a frequent event in the evolution of most pathogens, but why pathogens successfully jump between some host species but not others is only just becoming clear. The susceptibility of potential new hosts can vary enormously, with close relatives of the natural host typically being the most susceptible. Often, pathogens must adapt to successfully infect a novel host, for example by evolving to use different cell surface receptors, to escape the immune response, or to ensure they are transmitted by the new host. In viruses there are often limited molecular solutions to achieve this, and the same sequence changes are often seen each time a virus infects a particular host. These changes may come at a cost to other aspects of the pathogen's fitness, and this may sometimes prevent host shifts from occurring.

Elucidation of the hierarchy and temporal order with which DNA damage sensors as well as repair and signaling factors assemble around chromosome breaks has painted a complex picture of tightly regulated macromolecular interactions that build specialized compartments to facilitate repair and maintenance of genome integrity. While many of the underlying interactions, e.g. between repair factors and damage-induced histone marks, can be explained by lock-and-key or induced fit binding models assuming fixed stoichiometries, structurally less well defined interactions, such as the highly dynamic multivalent interactions implicated in phase separation, also participate in the formation of multi-protein assemblies in response to genotoxic stress. Although much remains to be learned about these types of cooperative and highly dynamic interactions and their functional roles, the rapidly growing interest in material properties of biomolecular condensates and in concepts from polymer chemistry and soft matter physics to understand biological processes at different scales holds great promises. Here, we discuss nuclear condensates in the context of genome integrity maintenance, highlighting the cooperative potential between clustered stoichiometric binding and phase separation. Rather than viewing them as opposing scenarios, their combined effects can balance structural specificity with favorable physicochemical properties relevant for the regulation and function of multilayered nuclear condensates.","output":"Biomolecular condensates at sites of DNA damage: More than just a phase(,)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread around the world in 2020. Abnormal pulmonary function and residual CT abnormalities were observed in COVID-19 patients during recovery. Appropriate rehabilitation training is around the corner. The correlation between spirometric impairment and residual CT abnormality remains largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted on the pulmonary function of 101 convalescent COVID-19 patients before discharge. Multivariate analysis was used to establish a scoring system to evaluate the spirometric abnormality based on residual chest CT. RESULTS: Lung consolidation area >25% and severe-type COVID-19 were two independent risk factors for severe pulmonary dysfunction. Besides, a scoring system was established. People scoring more than 12 points have more chances (17 times) to get severe pulmonary function impairment before discharge.

Despite growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in virology as well as many molecular studies, except remdesivir, no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug has been officially approved. METHODS: In the present study molecular docking technique was applied to test binding affinity of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin-two commercially available fluoroquinolones, to SARS-CoV-2 S-, E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PLPRO). Chloroquine and dexamethasone were used as reference positive controls. RESULTS: When analyzing the molecular docking data it was noticed that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin possess lower binding energy with S protein as compared to the references. In the case of TMPRSS2 protein and PLPRO protease the best docked ligand was levofloxacin and in the case of E proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase the best docked ligands were levofloxacin and dexamethasone. Moreover, a molecular dynamics study also reveals that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin form a stable complex with E- and TMPRSS2 proteins, RNA polymerase and papain-like protease (PLPRO).

The GI epithelium also contributes to the poor permeability of numerous antioxidant agents. Thus, lipophilic vitamins do not readily dissolve in the GI tract, and therefore they have low bioavailability. Nanomedicine has the potential to improve the delivery efficiency of oral vitamins. In particular, the use of lipid nanocarriers for certain vitamins that are administered orally can provide improved solubility, chemical stability, epithelium permeability and bioavailability, half-life, nidus targeting, and fewer adverse effects. These lipid nanocarriers include self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs), nanoemulsions, microemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The use of nontoxic excipients and sophisticated material engineering of lipid nanosystems allows for control of the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and improved GI permeation via mucosal or lymphatic transport. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the development of lipid nanocarriers for vitamin delivery. In addition, the same lipid nanocarriers used for vitamins may also be effective as carriers of vitamin derivatives, and therefore enhance their oral bioavailability. One example is the incorporation of d--tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as the emulsifier in lipid nanocarriers to increase the solubility and inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux.

Recent studies suggest that mutation rates are selected for optimal viral fitness and that modest variations in replicase fidelity may be associated with viral attenuation. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are unique in their requirement for host cycling and may necessitate substantial genetic and phenotypic plasticity. In order to more thoroughly investigate the correlates, mechanisms and consequences of arbovirus fidelity, we selected fidelity variants of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) utilizing selection in the presence of a mutagen. We identified two mutations in the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with increased fidelity, V793I and G806R, and a single mutation in the WNV methyltransferase, T248I, associated with decreased fidelity. Both deep-sequencing and in vitro biochemical assays confirmed strain-specific differences in both fidelity and mutational bias. WNV fidelity variants demonstrated host-specific alterations to replicative fitness in vitro, with modest attenuation in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Experimental infections of colonized and field populations of Cx. quinquefaciatus demonstrated that WNV fidelity alterations are associated with a significantly impaired capacity to establish viable infections in mosquitoes. Taken together, these studies (i) demonstrate the importance of allosteric interactions in regulating mutation rates, (ii) establish that mutational spectra can be both sequence and strain-dependent, and (iii) display the profound phenotypic consequences associated with altered replication complex function of flaviviruses.","output":"Sequence-Specific Fidelity Alterations Associated with West Nile Virus Attenuation in Mosquitoes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial genomes have been shown to be partitioned into several-kilobase-long chromosomal domains that are topologically independent from each other, meaning that change of DNA superhelicity in one domain does not propagate to neighbors. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed to question the nature of the topological barriers at play, leading to several predictions on possible molecular actors. Here, we address the question of topological barriers using polymer models of supercoiled DNA chains that are constrained such as to mimic the action of predicted molecular actors. More specifically, we determine under which conditions DNA-bridging proteins may act as topological barriers. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics simulations. As a result, we find that DNA-bridging proteins must exert rather strong constraints on their binding sites; they must block the diffusion of the excess of twist through the two binding sites on the DNA molecule and, simultaneously, prevent the rotation of one DNA segment relative to the other one. Importantly, not all DNA-bridging proteins satisfy this second condition. For example, single bridges formed by proteins that bind DNA nonspecifically, like H-NS dimers, are expected to fail with this respect. Our findings might also explain, in the case of specific DNA-bridging proteins like LacI, why multiple bridges are required to create stable independent topological domains. Strikingly, when the relative rotation of the DNA segments is not prevented, relaxation results in complex intrication of the two domains. Moreover, although the value of the torsional stress in each domain may vary, their differential is preserved. Our work also predicts that nucleoid-associated proteins known to wrap DNA must form higher protein-DNA complexes to efficiently work as topological barriers.","output":"Requirements for DNA-Bridging Proteins to Act as Topological Barriers of the Bacterial Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aggregation and accumulation of amyloid- plaques and tau proteins in the brain have been central characteristics in the pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease (AD), making them the focus of most of the research exploring potential therapeutics for this neurodegenerative disease.

These VPs are perturbed by other proteins, which are: (i) mainly expressed in the lungs, (ii) are targeted directly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins, (iii) can navigate outside the lungs as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs); and (iv) can activate VPs via subdiffusive processes inside the target organ.

Due to its vasodilatory effect and short half-life, the use of NO as an exogenous inhaled medication (iNO) to target the pulmonary vasculature, in conditions with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, has been studied. The use of iNO in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 has therapeutic importance in improving oxygenation. It also has potential anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties. Herein, we want to share our experience of use of iNO in hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID 19 pneumonia. We hypothesized that iNO may be beneficial at preventing intubation, decreasing invasive mechanical ventilation duration, and consequently improve outcomes including hospital mortality. MethodsThis is a descriptive hypothesis generating study of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia who received iNO for hypoxemic respiratory failure, at a single tertiary care center. We collected information on patient demographics, co-morbidities, iNO treatment, need for intubation, arterial blood gas analysis, laboratory values, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of iNO administration: group 1 - \\"pre-intubation\\" (i.e. iNO started at least 1 day prior to endotracheal intubation, if any) and group 2 - \\"post-intubation\\" (i.e. iNO started on the same day as or after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation). ResultA total of 45 (group 1, n=26 [57.8%] vs group2, n=19 [42.2%]) COVID 19 patients who had iNO use. The mean time from hospital admission to iNO administration(days) in group 1 was 2.1 ({+/-}1.8) vs 4.2 ({+/-}5.9) in group 2. The mean hospital length of stay from the beginning of iNO treatment until discharge or death was 18.3 vs 26.2 days, with 8 deaths (30.8%) vs 9 deaths (47.4%) in group 1 vs group 2, respectively. DiscussionOur study is unable to demonstrate comparably outcomes benefit of iNO. Although there was a trend towards decreased need for invasive mechanical ventilation in group 1[Only 11 (42.3%) patients were intubated out of 26 who received iNO early after hospital admission (2.3 days)], no statistical significance could be achieved because of small sample size. Our study demonstrated that iNO administration pre-intubation did not appear harmful and appears to be safe, complementary to HFNC, signalling the domain where systematic investigation is required to confirm or not the potential for iNO to improve patient outcomes in the management of COVID 19-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure.

To screen for antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) pseudovirus system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter gene to screen 188 small potential antiviral compounds. Using this system, we identified nine compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1-10 M.

Especially in ornamental plant production, farmers often stick to current production strategies to avoid the risk of economically harmful plant losses, even though they may recognize the need to optimize farm management. This work focused on the economically important and little-researched production system of ornamental heather (Calluna vulgaris) to help farmers find appropriate measures to sustainably improve resource use, plant quality, and profitability despite existing risks. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis was applied to simulate alternative disease monitoring strategies. The outcomes for more intensive visual monitoring, as well as sensor-based monitoring using hyperspectral imaging were simulated. Based on the results of the probabilistic cost-benefit analysis, the expected utility of the alternative strategies was assessed as a function of the farmers level of risk aversion. The analysis of expected utility indicated that heather production is generally risky. Concerning the alternative strategies, more intensive visual monitoring provides the highest utility for farmers for almost all levels of risk aversion compared to all other strategies. Results of the probabilistic cost-benefit analysis indicated that more intensive visual monitoring increases net benefits in 68% of the simulated cases. The application of sensor-based monitoring leads to negative economic outcomes in 85% of the simulated cases. This research approach is widely applicable to predict the impacts of new management strategies in precision agriculture. The methodology can be used to provide farmers in other data-scarce production systems with concrete recommendations that account for uncertainties and risks.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation analyzed data from 3 Markov models used in previous cost-effectiveness studies that were adapted to compare AI vs standard of care to detect melanoma on skin photographs, dental caries on radiographs, and diabetic retinopathy on retina fundus imaging. The general US and German population aged 50 and 12 years, respectively, as well as individuals with diabetes in Brazil aged 40 years were modeled over their lifetime. Monte Carlo microsimulations and sensitivity analyses were used to capture lifetime efficacy and costs. An annual cycle length was chosen. Data were analyzed between February 2021 and August 2021. EXPOSURE: AI vs standard of care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of AI with tooth retentionCyears for dentistry and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for individuals in dermatology and ophthalmology; diagnostic costs. RESULTS: In 1000 microsimulations with 1000 random samples, AI as a diagnostic-support system showed limited cost-savings and gains in tooth retentionCyears and QALYs. In dermatology, AI showed mean costs of $750 (95% CI, $608-$970) and was associated with 86.5 QALYs (95% CI, 84.9-87.9 QALYs), while the control showed higher costs $759 (95% CI, $618-$970) with similar QALY outcome. In dentistry, AI accumulated costs of 320 (95% CI, 299-341) (purchasing power parity [PPP] conversion, $429 [95% CI, $400-$458]) with 62.4 years per tooth retention (95% CI, 60.7-65.1 years). The control was associated with higher cost, 342 (95% CI, 318-368) (PPP, $458; 95% CI, $426-$493) and fewer tooth retentionCyears (60.9 years; 95% CI, 60.5-63.1 years). In ophthalmology, AI accrued costs of R $1321 (95% CI, R $1283-R $1364) (PPP, $559; 95% CI, $543-$577) at 8.4 QALYs (95% CI, 8.0-8.7 QALYs), while the control was less expensive (R $1260; 95% CI, R $1222-R $1303) (PPP, $533; 95% CI, $517-$551) and associated with similar QALYs. Dominance in favor of AI was dependent on small differences in the fee paid for the service and the treatment assumed after diagnosis. The fee paid for AI was a factor in patient preferences in cost-effectiveness between strategies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that marginal improvements in diagnostic accuracy when using AI may translate into a marginal improvement in outcomes.

METHODS/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The review included studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Records were identified through systematic literature searches in six databases. We summarized results narratively and through meta-analytic strategies. Only studies for the 1918 and 2009 pandemics were identified. Of 14 studies on the 2009 pandemic including data on both medical and social risk factors, after controlling for medical risk factors 8 demonstrated independent impact of SES. In the random effect analysis of 46 estimates from 35 studies we found a pooled mean odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2C1.7, p < 0.001), comparing the lowest to the highest SES, but with substantial effect heterogeneity across studies,Creflecting differences in outcome measures and definitions of case and control samples. Analyses by pandemic period (1918 or 2009) and by level of SES measure (individual or ecological) indicated no differences along these dimensions. Studies using healthy controls tended to document that low SES was associated with worse influenza outcome, and studies using infected controls find low SES associated with more severe outcomes. A few studies compared severe outcomes (ICU or death) to hospital admissions but these did not find significant SES associations in any direction. Studies with more unusual comparisons (e.g., pandemic vs seasonal influenza, seasonal influenza vs other patient groups) reported no or negative non-significant associations.

Antiandrogen therapies reduce expression of TMPRSS2. OBJECTIVE: To determine if temporary androgen suppression induced by degarelix improves clinical outcomes of inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Hormonal Intervention for the Treatment in Veterans With COVID-19 Requiring Hospitalization (HITCH) phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial compared efficacy of degarelix plus standard care vs placebo plus standard care on clinical outcomes in men hospitalized with COVID-19 but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Inpatients were enrolled at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals from July 22, 2020, to April 8, 2021. Data were analyzed from August 9 to October 15, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and disease severity were centrally randomized 2:1 to degarelix, (1-time subcutaneous dose of 240 mg) or a saline placebo. Standard care included but was not limited to supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, vasopressor support, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, intravenous fluids, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The composite primary end point was mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at day 15 after randomization. Secondary end points were time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a temperature within reference range, maximum severity of COVID-19, and the composite end point at 30 days. RESULTS: The trial was stopped for futility after the planned interim analysis, at which time there were 96 evaluable patients, including 62 patients randomized to the degarelix group and 34 patients in the placebo group, out of 198 initially planned. The median (range) age was 70.5 (48-85) years. Common comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (15 patients [15.6%]), hypertension (75 patients [78.1%]), cardiovascular disease (27 patients [28.1%]), asthma (12 patients [12.5%]), diabetes (49 patients [51.0%]), and chronic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline prior to COVID-19 (9 patients [9.4%]). For the primary end point, there was no significant difference between the degarelix and placebo groups (19 patients [30.6%] vs 9 patients [26.5%]; P = .67). Similarly, no differences were observed between degarelix and placebo groups in any secondary end points, including inpatient mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 6 patients [17.6%]) or all-cause mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 7 patents [20.6%]). There were no differences between degarelix and placebo groups in the overall rates of adverse events (13 patients [21.0%] vs 8 patients [23.5%) and serious adverse events (19 patients [30.6%] vs 13 patients [32.4%]), nor unexpected safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of androgen suppression vs placebo and usual care for men hospitalized with COVID-19, degarelix did not result in amelioration of COVID-19 severity.

Moreover, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the type or temperature of coffee consumed will have a different impact on the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of acute coffee consumption on the following: 1. self-reported GI symptoms and salivary gastrin, 2. stress indices [salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA)] and psychometric measures, and 3. blood pressure (BP), in healthy, daily coffee consuming individuals in non-stressful conditions. METHODS This was a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial, in which 40 healthy individuals (20 men, 20 women), 20-55 years of age, randomly consumed four 200 ml coffee beverages containing 160 mg caffeine (hot and cold instant coffee, cold espresso, hot filtered coffee), 1 week apart. Salivary samples and psychometric questionnaires were collected at baseline and post-coffee consumption at 15,30, and 60 min for salivary gastrin and sAA measurements and at 60,120, and 180 min for cortisol measurements. BP was measured at beginning and end of each intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02253628 RESULTS: Coffee consumption significantly increased sAA activity (P = 0.041), with significant differences only between cold instant and filter coffee at 15 and 30 min post-consumption (P < 0.05). Coffee temporarily increased salivary gastrin, without differences between coffee types. Coffee did not affect salivary cortisol or self-reported anxiety levels. Coffee consumption significantly increased BP, within the healthy physiological levels, in a gender specific manner at the end of the experimental periods, without differences between coffee types. CONCLUSION Acute coffee consumption in non-stressful conditions activated sAA and BP but not salivary cortisol, indicating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Post-coffee sAA increase without a concomitant cortisol increase may also indicate that coffee may have some anti-stress properties.","output":"Acute effects of coffee consumption on self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms, blood pressure and stress indices in healthy individuals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between systemic oxidative balance, and the severity of the disease in patients with COVID 19.

Twenty-four healthy controls included to the study. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-), D-dimer, fibrinogen, total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) were measured and oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated. Results: The mean age of severe group was significantly higher than the other groups (p=0.001). TAS levels were significantly decreased in all patient groups compared to controls, while serum TOS and OSI levels were significantly different in all three stages of the disease. Serum IL-6 and TNF-  levels were significantly elevated in severe group compared to other groups. TOS and OSI levels were also significantly correlated with IL-6, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, LDH and D-dimer.

Over a period of 6 weeks, we compounded 1,613 NSTS hydromorphone infusion bags. All lots were cleared for sterility, particulate, potency, and endotoxin testing by an outside FDA registered laboratory. We did not have any safety reports filed specific to the NSTS compounded hydromorphone infusion bags. Over a period of 15 weeks, 715 infusions were consumed. The drug supply chain suffers frequent interruptions and critical shortages, particularly in times of a natural disaster or a global pandemic. Non-sterile to sterile compounding is often associated with risks of inaccuracies, impurities, and contamination. There are instances in which non-sterile to sterile compounding is appropriate and should be considered in times of drug shortages to support the care of hospitalized patients.","output":"Non-Sterile to Sterile Compounding: An Unconventional Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schwannoma is a benign slow growing nerve sheath tumor that is typically encapsulated and composed of well-differentiated schwann cells.

However, there is no published information about how a global pandemic affects the frequency and types of ECS encountered by veterinary team members. An online mixed methods survey was developed to determine the frequency, stressfulness and types of ECS experienced by veterinarians, animal health technicians and veterinary nurses since the advent of the global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Responses from 540 veterinary team members from 22 countries were analyzed. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median frequency of ECS encountered by respondents increased from several times per month to several times per week (Spearman Rank Correlation 0.619, P &lt; 0.0001). The most common ECS (encountered at least several times per week) were: challenging decisions about how to proceed when clients have limited finances (64.4%), conflict between personal well-being and professional role (64.3%), conflict between the interests of clients and the interests of their animals (59.6%). These were followed by challenging decisions about what counts as an essential veterinary service (48.1%);conflict between well-being of family/household members and professional role (46.3%);and challenging decisions about whether to perform non-contact veterinary visits (46.3%). The most stressful ECS (reported to be very or maximally stressful) were: conflicts between the interests of clients and the interests of their animals (50.2%), other (42.9%), conflicts between the interests of my employer and my own interests (42.5%), challenging decisions about how to proceed when clients have limited finances (39.4%), conflict between personal well-being and professional role (38.0%), and conflict between well-being of family/household members and professional role (33.6%). Thematic analysis of free-text responses revealed biosecurity, client financial limitations, animal welfare, working conditions, and client relations as prominent themes.

Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch plays a crucial role in regulating genes involved in synthesizing or transporting thiamine and phosphorylated derivatives in bacteria, archaea, plants, and fungi. Although TPP riboswitch is reasonably well known in bacteria, there is a gap in the knowledge of the fungal TPP riboswitches structure and dynamics, involving mainly sequence variation and TPP interaction with the aptamers. On the other hand, the increase of fungal infections and antifungal resistance raises the need for new antifungal therapies. In this work, we used computational approaches to build three-dimensional models for the three TPP riboswitches identified in Aspergillus oryzae, in which we studied their structure, dynamics, and binding free energy change (G(bind)) with TPP. Interaction patterns between the TPP and the surrounding nucleotides were conserved among the three models, evidencing high structural conservation. Furthermore, we show that the TPP riboswitch from the A. oryzae NMT1 gene behaves similarly to the E. coli thiA gene concerning the G(bind). In contrast, mutations in the fungal TPP riboswitches from THI4 and the nucleoside transporter genes led to structural differences, affecting the binding-site volume, hydrogen bond occupancy, and G(bind). Besides, the number of water molecules surrounding TPP influenced the G(bind) considerably. Notably, our G(bind) estimation agreed with previous experimental data, reinforcing the relationship between sequence conservation and TPP interaction.","output":"In silico investigation of riboswitches in fungi: structural and dynamical insights into TPP riboswitches in Aspergillus oryzae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assays are understudied within contexts of low pre-test probability, including screening asymptomatic persons without epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or asymptomatic surveillance testing. SARS-CoV-2 detection without symptoms may represent resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding, presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or a false positive test. This study assessed clinical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high to low with an alternate assay. Materials and Methods: A total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Significantly less positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with institution-wide screening having []3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in all other groups combined (5/32, 15.6% vs 61/90, 68%; p <0.0001), and in each subgroup with higher pre-test probability (individual subgroup range 50.0% to 85.0%). Conclusions: A higher proportion of false-positive test results are likely with lower pre-test probability. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results should be interpreted within the context of patient history, clinical setting, known exposure, and estimated community disease prevalence.

Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the non-structural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses.

Comparing patients having and lacking a regular source of medical care and other ED patient characteristics, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, reasons for not wanting the vaccine, perceived access to vaccine sites, and willingness to get the vaccine as part of ED care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted from December 10, 2020, to March 7, 2021, at 15 safety net US EDs. Primary outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and sites (including EDs) for potential COVID-19 vaccine receipt. RESULTS: Of 2,575 patients approached, 2,301 (89.4%) participated. Of the 18.4% of respondents who lacked a regular source of medical care, 65% used the ED as their usual source of health care. The overall rate of vaccine hesitancy was 39%; the range among the 15 sites was 28% to 58%. Respondents who lacked a regular source of medical care were more commonly vaccine hesitant than those who had a regular source of medical care (47% versus 38%, 9% difference, 95% confidence interval 4% to 14%). Other characteristics associated with greater vaccine hesitancy were younger age, female sex, Black race, Latinx ethnicity, and not having received an influenza vaccine in the past 5 years. Of the 61% who would accept a COVID-19 vaccine, 21% stated that they lacked a primary physician or clinic at which to receive it; the vast majority (95%) of these respondents would accept the COVID-19 vaccine as part of their care in the ED. CONCLUSION: ED patients who lack a regular source of medical care are particularly hesitant regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Most COVID-19 vaccine acceptors would accept it as part of their care in the ED.

Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2. METHODS This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay. RESULTS The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.","output":"Development and Validation of a Multiplex, Bead-Based Assay to Detect Antibodies Directed Against SARS-CoV-2 Proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spike protein is the surface glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessary for the entry of the virus via the transmembrane receptors of the human endothelial cells of the respiratoty system for the virus to be engulfed causing COVID-19 disease after priming by type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 and then binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the overall adherence rate to the recommended travel screening protocol and to identify factors associated with nonadherence to the protocol. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of adherence to the travel screening program in an academic hospital and three affiliated community hospitals. A regression model identified patient and hospital factors associated with nonadherence. RESULTS: Of the 147,062 patients included for analysis, 93.7% (n = 137,834) had travel screenings completed. We identified several characteristics of patients that were most likely to be missed by the screening protocolpatients with low English proficiency, patients who arrive via ambulance or helicopter, and patients with more severe illness or injury based on initial triage acuity.

Exploring micro-level data on bankruptcy reorganization proceedings in Slovenia, we find that creditors, above all, demand a credible change in the exercise of control rights. The prospects of plan confirmation are positively associated with debt-to-equity conversion as well as those majority ownership changes that occur during the proceeding and feature a domestic incoming owner. In contrast, we find no evidence that plan confirmation is related to management turnover, majority ownership transfers involving a foreign incoming owner, pre-bankruptcy financial indicators other than leverage, the number of creditors, the value of different types of claims, and even the contractual details for the repayment of claims. The incidence of creditor-induced socially costly filtering failures is quite high, with estimates ranging between 41 and 78% based on the ex-post approach and between 40 and 61% based on the ex-ante approach. Confirmations of plans from non-viable businesses are more prevalent than rejections of plans from viable businesses.

Understanding the mechanism underlying the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm is critical for COVID-19 control. Here, we identify that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and host hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) play key roles in the virus infection and pro-inflammatory responses. RNA sequencing shows that HIF-1 signaling, immune response, and metabolism pathways are dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Clinical analyses indicate that HIF-1 production, inflammatory responses, and high mortalities occurr in elderly patients. HIF-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines are elicited in patients and infected cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces mitochondrial damage and Mito-ROS production to promote HIF-1 expression, which subsequently facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokines production. Notably, HIF-1 also broadly promotes the infection of other viruses. Collectively, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, ORF3a induces HIF-1, which in turn aggravates viral infection and inflammatory responses. Therefore, HIF-1 plays an important role in promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection and inducing pro-inflammatory responses to COVID-19.","output":"HIF-1 promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection and aggravates inflammatory responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) urgently requires an effective vaccine for prevention.

In colorectal cancer, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is selectively upregulated, resulting in the further exacerbation of the disease. Therefore, the clearance of H(2)S and the regulation of the enzymes on the H(2)S pathways are of great significance for colorectal cancer therapy. METHODS: Here, we investigated the H(2)S content in various clinical tumor tissues from patients and confirmed that overproduced concentration of H(2)S in colorectal cancer. Accordingly, we developed an H(2)S-responsive nanoplatform based on zinc oxide coated virus-like silica nanoparticles (VZnO) for the therapy of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Owing to its excellent H(2)S scavenging ability, VZnO could effectively reduce H(2)S content in colorectal cancer to prohibit the growth of CT26 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, the removal of H(2)S in colorectal cancer also leads to tumor inhibition through activating ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death. The biosafety-related toxicological and pathological analysis confirmed the low toxicity and high safety of VZnO in colorectal cancer treatment. Furthermore, as an H(2)S-responsible nanosystem, VZnO appears to have no therapeutic effect on other non H(2)S rich cancers, such as the 4T1 breast cancer model. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the H(2)S-depletion-induced ferroptosis strategy using zinc oxide-based nanomaterials would provide insights in designing nanomedicines for colorectal cancer-target theranostics and may offer clinical promise.

Rates of voluntary, as opposed to mandatory, social distancing varies by county characteristics, including partisanship, media consumption, and racial and ethnic composition. Mandatory measures to increase social distancing appear to be effective, most notably stay at home orders which increase the share of devices at home by 2 percentage points. Social distancing orders also appear to have substantial informational content and, in the case of mask mandates, the informational content appears to be greater than the gross effect of mask mandates on behavior.

METHODS Systematic review of international, peer-reviewed literature. Development of the prepublished protocol and search strategy was done in consultation with stakeholder reference groups consisting of people with lived experience of long-term conditions, advocates and clinicians. We searched academic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, AMED, CINAHL, Proquest Dissertations and Theses database, and Business Source Complete for controlled trials comparing a specific vocational intervention against a control intervention or usual care, published between 1 January 2004 and 1 August 2019. Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and appraised studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. Seven studies investigated Individual Placement and Support (IPS) modified for people who were not in intensive mental health treatment services. These studies occurred settings such as community vocational rehabilitation services, a housing programme and community mental health services. The studies provided very low quality evidence that people who receive IPS-style vocational rehabilitation are more likely to gain competitive employment than people who receive usual care (risk ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.34, seven studies, 1611 participants). The remaining four studies considered cognitive behavioural therapy or specific vocational rehabilitation interventions designed to fit a unique context. There was insufficient evidence from these studies to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of non-IPS forms of vocational rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate mental health conditions. DISCUSSION The meta-analysis showed a clear intervention effect but low precision, and more high-quality studies are needed in this field.

Vaccines are often considered as a cost-effective way to prevent and control infectious diseases, and the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines have been progressing unprecedently. It is needed to understand individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) among general population, which provides information about social demand, access and financing for future COVID-19 vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To investigate individuals' WTP and financing mechanism preference for COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic period in China. METHODS: During March 1-18, 2020, we conducted a network stratified random sampling survey with 2058 respondents in China. The survey questionnaires included out-of-pocket WTP, financing mechanism preference as well as basic characteristics of the respondents; risk perception and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; attitude for future COVID-19 vaccination. Multivariable Tobit regression was used to determine impact factors for respondents' out-of-pocket WTP. RESULTS: The individuals' mean WTP for full COVID-19 vaccination was CNY 254 (USD 36.8) with median of CNY 100 (USD 14.5). Most respondents believed that governments (90.9%) and health insurance (78.0%) needed to pay for some or full portions of COVID-19 vaccination, although 84.3% stated that individuals needed to pay. Annual family income, employee size in the workplace, and whether considering the COVID-19 pandemic in China in a declining trend affected respondents' WTP significantly. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated the individuals' WTP for COVID-19 vaccination in China and their preferences for financing sources from individuals, governments and health insurance. And to suggest an effective and optimal financing strategy, the public health perspective with equal access to COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized to ensure a high vaccination rate.","output":"Willingness to pay and financing preferences for COVID-19 vaccination in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still threatening humankind. Despite first successes in vaccine development and approval, no antiviral treatment is available for COVID-19 patients. The success is further tarnished by the emergence and spreading of mutation variants of SARS-CoV-2, for which some vaccines have lower efficacy. This highlights the urgent need for antiviral therapies even more. This article describes how the genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the host-virus interaction of human alveolar macrophages and SARS-CoV-2 was refined by incorporating the latest information about the viruss structural proteins and the mutant variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.28, B.1.427/B.1.429, and B.1.617. We confirmed the initially identified guanylate kinase as a potential antiviral target with this refined model and identified further potential targets from the purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The model was further extended by incorporating the virus lipid requirements. This opened new perspectives for potential antiviral targets in the altered lipid metabolism. Especially the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis seems to play a pivotal role in viral replication. The guanylate kinase is even a robust target in all investigated mutation variants currently spreading worldwide. These new insights can guide laboratory experiments for the validation of identified potential antiviral targets. Only the combination of vaccines and antiviral therapies will effectively defeat this ongoing pandemic.","output":"Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of Infection with SARS-CoV-2 Mutants Confirms Guanylate Kinase as Robust Potential Antiviral Target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the USA, numerous summer programs are available for undergraduate students that seek to increase the number of individuals from groups underrepresented in medicine (URM) that matriculate to medical school.

For 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of on-campus student activities at American universities, necessitating a switch to a virtual format for these URM-focused programs. Outcomes, however, from these programs conducted virtually, necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been reported. The Penn Access Summer Scholars (PASS) program at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) targets URM undergraduates, providing two consecutive summers of mentored research and enrichment experiences, with the goal of enabling participants matriculation to PSOM. PASS has been an 8 week on-campus experience, but during summer 2020, virtual programming of 6 weeks was provided due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the 2020 virtual offering of PASS completed pre- and post-program surveys that included 5-point Likert-style and open-ended questions to determine the impact of the programing on self-assessments of research skills, familiarity with the physician identity, and preparedness to be a PSOM student. Post-program, participants also assessed program administration and content. With respect to program objectives, participants reported significant increases in their self-reported confidence in conducting research, understanding of physician identity, and sense of preparedness for medical school.

We compared the performance of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Midnight and ARTIC tiling amplicon protocols using 196 Delta lineage SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens, and 71 mostly Omicron lineage samples with S gene target failure (SGTF), reflecting circulating lineages in the United Kingdom during December 2021. 96-plexed nanopore sequencing was used. For Delta lineage samples, ARTIC v4 recovered the greatest proportion of >=90% complete genomes (81.1%; 159/193), followed by Midnight (71.5%; 138/193) and ARTIC v3 (34.1%; 14/41). Midnight protocol however yielded higher average genome recovery (mean 98.8%) than ARTIC v4 (98.1%) and ARTIC v3 (75.4%), resulting in less ambiguous final consensus assemblies overall. Explaining these observations were ARTIC v4's superior genome recovery in low viral titre/high cycle threshold (Ct) samples and inferior performance in high titre/low Ct samples, where Midnight excelled.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR). Methods : A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests. Results : Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT.

Vaccination is the primary public health strategy to protect against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in addition to other measures, such as mask wearing and social distancing. Vaccination has reduced COVID-19 severity and mortality dramatically. Nevertheless, incidence globally remains high, and certain populations are still at risk for severe outcomes. Additional strategies to support immunity, including potentially enhancing the response to vaccination, are needed. Many vitamins and trace minerals have recognized immunomodulatory actions, and their status and/or supplementation have been reported to correspond to the incidence and severity of infection. Furthermore, a variety of observational and some interventional studies report that adequate micronutrient status or micronutrient supplementation is associated with enhanced vaccine responses, including to COVID-19 vaccination. Such data suggest that micronutrient supplementation may hold the potential to improve vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness, although additional interventional studies to further strengthen the existing evidence are needed. Positive findings from such research could have important implications for global public health, since deficiencies in several micronutrients that support immune function are prevalent in numerous settings, and supplementation can be implemented safely and inexpensively.","output":"Micronutrients to Support Vaccine Immunogenicity and Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe pulmonary involvement, are at an increased thromboembolic risk related, among various causes, to the cytokine storm and excessive activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets. Different intensity of anticoagulation for them is proposed, mainly with low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs); in a confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) the therapeutic dose of LMWH is routinely used. Some authors suggest that hemorrhagic complications in COVID-19 patients are rare. At the same time, one can find reports on internal bleeding, including retroperitoneal hematoma (RPH) and other abdominal hematomas. CASE REPORTS The authors describe 5 cases (3 of those aged more than 80 years) with giant RPHs and with moderate/severe COVID-19 pneumonia, treated before RPH diagnosis with different enoxaparin doses. The therapeutic dose was given to the male with verified PE limited to the segmental/subsegmental pulmonary arteries and initially to the female in whom echocardiography was strongly suggestive of PE, yet this diagnosis was excluded on CT angiography. In one patient, the enoxaparin dose was escalated from 40 mg bd to 60 mg bd after the D-dimer increase. Two patients had bleeding complications despite the enoxaparin dose restricted to 40 mg/daily or bd. Two males had a coexistent psoas hematoma while in only one female there was a coexistent femoral hematoma. RPHs occurred between day 4 and 14 of hospitalization and all were treated conservatively. Three patients who died were particularly charged, so their deaths were not merely directly associated with RPH, which was closely analyzed in one autopsy performed. The authors underline that the choice of anticoagulation intensity in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia without venous thromboembolism seems sometimes difficult but recent publications indicate the low prophylactic enoxaparin dose as an optimal option. Anticoagulation dose escalation based only on the D-dimer level may not be appropriate for certain patients; moreover, the D-dimer increase is commonly observed during internal bleeding.","output":"Retroperitoneal hematoma in COVID-19 patients - case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess differences in neuromotor attributes of shoulder muscles between age groups in both sexes and to better understand functional disorders in older women.

We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50C60 years and 60 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death. RESULTS: We included 51 studies with a total of 48 317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients.

We aimed to describe the clinical use, conduct, and potential for FMT in Europe. METHODS: We invited all hospital-based FMT centres within the European Council member states to answer a web-based questionnaire covering their clinical activities, organisation, and regulation of FMT in 2019. Responders were identified from trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov and from the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) working group for stool banking and FMT. FINDINGS: In 2019, 31 FMT centres from 17 countries reported a total of 1,874 (median 25, quartile 10C64) FMT procedures; 1,077 (57%) with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) as indication, 791 (42%) with experimental indications, and 6 (0?3%) unaccounted for. Adjusted to population size, 0?257 per 100,000 population received FMT for CDI and 0?189 per 100,000 population for experimental indications. With estimated 12,400 (6,100C28,500) annual cases of multiple, recurrent CDI and indication for FMT in Europe, the current European FMT activity covers approximately 10% of the patients with indication. The participating centres demonstrated high safety standards and adherence to international consensus guidelines. Formal or informal regulation from health authorities was present at 21 (68%) centres. INTERPRETATION: FMT is a widespread routine treatment for multiple, recurrent CDI and an experimental treatment. Embedded within hospital settings, FMT centres operate with high standards across Europe to provide safe FMT. A significant gap in FMT coverage suggests the need to raise clinical awareness and increase the FMT activity in Europe by at least 10-fold to meet the true, indicated need.

In this study we aimed to construct machine-learning (ML) models to predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on the clinical features of patients visiting an ED during the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of all patients who received reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the ED of Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center, Fort Worth, from February 23-May 12, 2020. The variables collected included patient demographics, ED triage data, clinical symptoms, and past medical history. The primary outcome was the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 infection) by a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and was used as the label for ML tasks. We used univariate analyses for feature selection, and variables with P<0.1 were selected for model construction. Samples were split into training and testing cohorts on a 60:40 ratio chronologically. We tried various ML algorithms to construct the best predictive model, and we evaluated performances with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the testing cohort. RESULTS: A total of 580 ED patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study periods, and 98 (16.9%) were identified as having the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the RT-PCR results. Univariate analyses selected 21 features for model construction. We assessed three ML methods for performance: of the three methods, random forest outperformed the others with the best AUC result (0.86), followed by gradient boosting (0.83) and extra trees classifier (0.82). CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to use ML models as an initial screening tool for identifying patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further validation will be necessary to determine how effectively this prediction model can be used prospectively in clinical practice.","output":"Clinical Features of Emergency Department Patients from Early COVID-19 Pandemic that Predict SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Machine-learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 30 December 2019, Dr Marjorie Pollack, deputy editor of ProMed, received information about a SARS-like disease in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

However, there are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Phillygenin (PHI), a lignan isolated from Forsythiae Fructus, showed potential anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects but the mechanisms remain unknown. In view of the vital role of gut microbiota in the development of liver fibrosis, this study aimed to explore whether PHI could protect intestinal epithelial barrier and attenuate liver fibrosis by maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota. Therefore, the liver fibrosis model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of olive oil containing 10% carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) for 4 weeks in C57BL/6J mice. Histological analysis including Hematoxylin-Eosin, Masson, Sirius red, and immunohistochemistry staining were carried out to detect the histopathology and collagen deposition of mice liver tissues. The biochemical indexes related to liver function (ALT, AST, AKP, -GT), fibrosis (HYP, HAase, LN, PC III, IV-C) and inflammation (TNF-, MIP-1, LPS) were determined by specific commercial assay kits. In vivo experimental results showed that PHI could improve liver histopathological injury, abnormal liver function, collagen deposition, inflammation and fibrosis caused by CCl(4). Moreover, PHI restored the intestinal epithelial barrier by promoting the expression of intestinal barrier markers, including ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1. More importantly, the corrective effect of PHI on the imbalance of gut microbiota was confirmed by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. In particular, PHI treatment enriches the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, which is reported to alleviate inflammation and fibrosis of damaged liver.

The second objective is to scrutinize Parkers idiosyncratic use of the methodology of auto-ethnography. Here it is argued, again, that Parkers appropriation of this method not only is ideally positioned to question the problematic field of mainstream psychology, but also opens up a different perspective on subjectivity and sociality that should challenge Critical Psychology.

RESULTS Of a total of 4617 cases of the above selected diseases notified in Singapore, 3599 (78.0%) were imported. The majority of the imported cases originated from Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Malaria constituted the largest bulk (of which 95.9% of the 2126 reported cases were imported), followed by hepatitis A (57.1% of 1053 cases imported), typhoid (87.6% of 596 cases imported), paratyphoid (87.6% of 241 cases imported), and hepatitis E (68.8% of 231 cases imported). Furthermore, there were 14 cases of imported cholera, 6 cases of imported severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 13 cases of imported chikungunya.

METHODS: In this study, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients were treated preoperatively with docetaxel and cyclophosphamide alternating with epirubicin and cisplatin every 2 weeks. Patients were evaluated for anemia pre- and post-chemotherapy. We examined trends in the red cell indices, transfusion requirement, time to transfusion, as well as risk factors associated with transfusion during treatment, along with delay in treatment due to anemia and the additional cost incurred. RESULTS: A total of 116 consecutive women with nonmetastatic TNBC were treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The median age was 44.5 years. 56.1% of patients had stage III disease. Anemia was detected at baseline in 54 (46.5%) patients with mild anemia (10C12 g/dl) in 42 (36.2%) patients and moderate anemia (8C10 g/dl) in 12 (10.3%) patients. During the course of treatment, all patients developed anemia. A total of 44 patients (37.9%) required transfusion during chemotherapy, with 55(47.4%) patients developing grade 1C2 anemia and 40 (34.5%) patients developing grade 3 anemia. The factors associated with anemia requiring transfusion were a steeper decline in hemoglobin after two cycles (OR 1.65, p = 0.02), low-grade tumor (OR 2.48, p = 0.03), and thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4 (OR 4.35, p = 0.034), of which tumor grade and thrombocytopenia remained significant in multivariate analysis. Nearly one-fourth of the study population had a delay between two cycles of chemotherapy due to anemia. A median additional cost of INR 7000 was incurred among those requiring blood transfusion. CONCLUSION: Anemia is a common toxicity associated with dose-dense chemotherapy during curative breast cancer treatment leading to delay in treatment and increased cost. Low-grade tumor, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and grade 2 or higher anemia after two cycles of chemotherapy are risk factors for blood transfusions during treatment.","output":"Anemia requiring transfusion in breast cancer patients on dose-dense chemotherapy: Prevalence, risk factors, cost and effect on disease outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus.

Based on previous research of self-control, this article explores whether ordering by electronic device or waiter prompts healthier food choices. Through four experimental studies conducted in China, our findings demonstrated that whether ordering by electronic device or waiter is also one determinant of healthy eating. Compared to waiter ordering, consumers would make healthier food choices through electronic ordering, because it relives the time pressure brought on by the interpersonal waiter interaction. Whereas electronic ordering may be effective only if there is no waiting line or only for consumers who have a relatively low degree of trait self-control.

This study examined if SARS may result in cardiovascular complications. METHODS AND RESULTS 121 patients (37.5 (SD13.2) years, 36% male) diagnosed to have SARS were assessed continuously for blood pressure, pulse, and temperature during their stay in hospital. Hypotension occurred in 61 (50.4%) patients in hospital, and was found in 28.1%, 21.5%, and 14.8% of patients during the first, second, and third week, respectively. Only one patient who had transient echocardiographic evidence of impaired left ventricular systolic function required temporary inotropic support. Tachycardia was present in 87 (71.9%) patients, and was found in 62.8%, 45.4%, and 35.5% of patients from the first to third week. It occurred independent of hypotension, and could not be explained by the presence of fever. Tachycardia was also present in 38.8% of patients at follow up. Bradycardia only occurred in 18 (14.9%) patients as a transient event. Reversible cardiomegaly was reported in 13 (10.7%) patients, but without clinical evidence of heart failure. Transient atrial fibrillation was present in one patient. Corticosteroid therapy was weakly associated with tachycardia during the second (chi(2) = 3.99, p = 0.046) and third week (chi(2) = 6.53, p = 0.01), although it could not explain tachycardia during follow up. CONCLUSIONS In patients with SARS, cardiovascular complications including hypotension and tachycardia were common but usually self limiting.

Since this disease is highly contagious and 33% of cases are asymptomatic, it is crucial to develop methods to predict its course. We developed a predictive model for Covid-19 infection in Spanish provinces. METHODS: We applied main components analysis to epidemiological data for Spanish provinces obtained from the National Centre of Epidemiology, based on the epidemiological curve between 24 February and 8 June 2020. Using this method, we classified provinces according to their epidemiological progress (worst, intermediate, and good). RESULTS: We identified 2 components that explained 99% of variability in the 52 epidemiological curves. The first component can be interpreted as the crude incidence rate trend and the second component as the speed of increase or decrease in the incidence rate during the period analysed. We identified 10 provinces in the group with the worst progress and 17 in the intermediate group. The threshold values for the 7-day incidence rate for an alert 1 (intermediate) were 134 cases/100,000 inhabitants, and 167 for alert 2 (high), respectively, showing a high discriminative power between provinces. CONCLUSIONS: These alert levels might be useful for deciding which measures may affect population mobility and other public health decisions when considering community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a given geographical area. This information would also facilitate intercomparison between healthcare areas and Autonomous Communities.","output":"A Proposed Epidemiologic Risk Threshold for SARS-CoV-2 for Assisting Healthcare Decision-Making./ Sistema de ayuda a la toma de decisiones sanitarias.

Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1345 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at an in-hospital screening station on an outpatient basis. The subjects were healthcare workers (HCWs) with suspected COVID-19 symptoms or exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19, caregivers at the hospital for complete enumeration, and patients who were scheduled to be admitted to a nonrestricted area in the hospital or to visit for outpatient treatment, but had suspected COVID-19 symptoms. The subjects were divided and compared as follows: HCW versus non-HCW groups and RT-PCR positive versus negative groups. Results: A total of 140 had symptoms, 291 wanted to be tested, and 664 were asymptomatic but were screened. Seven subjects had positive results for COVID-19. Compared with the non-HCWs, the HCWs were younger and had a lower rate of underlying medical conditions. In addition, there were more women, individuals with exposure to confirmed cases, and individuals with symptoms or those who just wanted to be tested. The frequency of all symptoms was high among the HCWs. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the HCWs were significantly associated with the presence of symptoms, having an odds ratio of 23.317 (confidence interval, 15.142-35.907L;P &lt; 0.001). The positive group had a high rate of exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 and had more subjects with symptoms or those who wanted to be tested.

Children with chronic diseases including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at higher risk of food insecurity due to their complex care needs, medication burden, and dietary restrictions. No data exists describing food insecurity prevalence in pediatric ESKD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Food insecurity was assessed among families of children (age 0-18 years) with ESKD on chronic dialysis at two pediatric academic medical centers. Families were screened in April 2020 using the Hunger Vital Sign, a validated 2-question screening tool. We assessed impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity. We compared serum phosphorus pre-COVID (January/February 2020) to during COVID (April/May 2020). Results A total of 29 families enrolled in this study. 62% (18/29) of children with ESKD lived in food insecure households, and of those, 72% (13/18) reported that COVID-19 had worsened their food insecurity status. During the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecure patients experienced greater rise in their serum phosphorus levels ( p =0.03) and decreased likelihood of having adequate phosphorus control ( p =0.03). Conclusion Food insecurity was common among children with ESKD on chronic dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children with food insecurity had a greater increase in their phosphorus levels during the pandemic than did food secure children.

The unit root and the structural break tests confirm the presence of structural breaks and mixed order of integrations. Besides, the long-run nonlinear autoregressive distribution lag results substantiate a long-run asymmetric relationship between the explanatory variables (economic policy uncertainty, institutional quality, corruption level) and the outcome variables (digital banking services and banking stability). The study reveals that a 1 percent increase in the economic policy uncertainty increases nonperforming loans (proxy to measure banking stability) by 1.48 percent and decreases Z-score (proxy to measure banking stability) by ?1.12 percent. Likewise, a 1 percent increase in policy uncertainty reduces the progress of digital financial services by ?1.23 percent in India. In addition, the study also depicts a long-run cointegration between the explanatory and the outcome variables. Overall, the study shows significant evidence that policy uncertainty, corruption, and institutional regulation hampers Indian banking stability and digital growth.

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. RESULTS: Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested.

Methods We leveraged a large prospective cohort of the UK biobank (UKBB) (N=412,096; current age 50-87) to identify associations of COVID-19 with hospitalization and mortality due to different diseases post-infection. We conducted a comprehensive survey on disorders from all systems (up to 135 disease categories). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For sensitivity analysis, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases, and other sensitivity analysis such as the prior event rate adjustment (PERR) approach to minimize effects of unmeasured confounders. Results Compared to individuals with no known history of COVID-19, those with severe COVID-19 (requiring hospitalization) exhibited higher hazards of hospitalization and/or mortality due to multiple disorders (median follow-up=608 days), including disorders of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and musculoskeletal systems. Increased hazards of hospitalizations and/or mortality were also observed for injuries due to fractures, various infections and other non-specific symptoms. These results remained largely consistent after sensitivity analyses. Severe COVID-19 was also associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR=14.700, 95% CI: 13.835-15.619). Mild (non-hospitalized) COVID-19 was associated with modestly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR=1.237, 95% CI 1.037-1.476) and mortality from neurocognitive disorders (HR=9.100, 95% CI: 5.590-14.816), as well as hospital admission from a few disorders such as aspiration pneumonitis, musculoskeletal pain and other general signs/symptoms.

Median anti\\\\spike IgG in the group of kidney transplant recipients vaccinated after transplantation (10.7 AU/ml, [IQR 0C62.5]) was lower than the patients vaccinated before transplantation (66.2 AU/ml [21.6C138]), which was significantly lower than in the controls (156 AU/ml [99.7C215.5]). Negative humoral response was associated with vaccination post transplantation (odds ratio 22.4), older age (OR = 1.04), and longer time on dialysis (OR = 1.02), while higher lymphocyte count at time of vaccination was protective (OR = .52). Our findings of sustained superior humoral response to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients vaccinated prior to transplantation strongly support the recommendations of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccination of transplant candidates, especially those younger than 60 years.","output":"Kidney transplant recipients vaccinated before transplantation maintain superior humoral response to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: COVID-19 patients with severe heart or respiratory failure are potential candidates for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Indications and management of these patients are unclear. Our aim is to describe the results of a prospective registry of COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Methods: an anonymous prospective registry of COVID-19 patients treated with veno-arterial (V-A) or veno-venous (V-V) ECMO was created on march 2020. Clinical, analytical and respiratory pre-implantation variables, implantation data and post-implantation course data were recorded. The primary endpoint was all cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary events were functional recovery and the combined endpoint of mortality and functional recovery in patients followed at least 3 months after discharge. Results: Three hundred and sixty-six patients from 25 hospitals were analyzed, 347 V-V ECMO and 18 V-A ECMO patients (mean age 52.7 and 49.5 years respectively). Patients with V-V ECMO were more obese, had less frequently organ damage other than respiratory failure and needed less inotropic support. Thirty three percent of V-A ECMO and 34.9% of V-A ECMO were discharged (p=NS). Hospital mortality was non-significantly different, 56.2% versus 50.9% respectively, mainly during ECMO therapy and mostly due to multiorgan failure. Other 51 patients (14%) remained admitted. Mean follow-up was 196+/-101.7 days (95% IC 95170.8-221.6). After logistic regression, body weight (OR 0.967, IC 95% 0.95-0.99, p=0.004) and ECMO implantation in the own centre (OR 0.48, IC 95% 0.27-0.88, p=0.018) were protective for hospital mortality. Age (OR 1.063, IC 95% 1.005-1.12, p=0.032), arterial hypertension (3.593, IC 95% 1.06-12.19, p=0.04) and global (2.44, IC 95% 0.27-0.88, p=0.019), digestive (OR 4,23, IC 95% 1.27-14.07, p=0.019) and neurological (OR 4.66, IC 95% 1.39-15.62, p=0.013) complications during ECMO therapy were independent predictors of primary endpoint occurrence. Only the post-discharge day at follow-up was independent predictor of both secondary endpoints occurrence. Conclusions: hospital survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO is near 50%. Age, arterial hypertension and ECMO complications are predictors of hospital mortality, and body weight and implantation in the own centre are protective. Functional recovery is only predicted by the follow-up time after discharge. A more homogeneous management of these patients is warranted for clinical results and future research optimization.","output":"Oxigenacin con membrana extracorprea en el paciente COVID-19: resultados del Registro Espa?ol ECMO-COVID de la Sociedad Espa?ola de Ciruga Cardiovascular y Endovascular (SECCE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Speech is one of the major communication tools to share information among people. This exchange method has a complicated construction consisting of not the best imparting of voice but additionally consisting of the transmission of many-speaker unique information. The most important aim of this research is to extract individual features through the speech-dependent health monitoring and management system; through this system, the speech data can be collected from a remote location and can be accessed. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed model has a good efficiency. Consequently, in the last 5 years, many researchers from this domain come in front to explore various aspects of speech which includes speech analysis using mechanical signs, human system interaction, speaker, and speech identification. Speech is a biometric that combines physiological and behavioural characteristics. Especially beneficial for remote attack transactions over telecommunication networks, the medical information of each person is quite a challenge, e.g., like COVID-19 where the medical team has to identify each person in a particular region that how many people got affected by some disease and took a quick measure to get protected from such diseases and what are the safety measure required. Presently, this task is the most challenging one for researchers. Therefore, speech-based mechanisms might be useful for tracking his/her voice quality or throat getting affected. By collecting the database of people matched and comparing with his/her original database, it can be identified in such scenarios. This provides the better management system without touching and maintains a safe distance data that can be gathered and processed for further medical treatment.

In this review, we examined current peer-reviewed publications containing serological and safety data following COVID-19 vaccination of patients with cancer. METHODS: This analysis examined 21 studies with a total of 5,012 cancer patients, of which 2,676 (53%) had hematological malignancies, 2,309 (46%) had solid cancers, and 739 were healthy controls. Serological responses by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1/S2 IgG (anti-S IgG) antibody levels and post-vaccination patient questionnaires regarding vaccine-related side effects following the first and second dose were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In general, a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine yields weaker and heterogeneous serological responses in both patients with hematological and solid malignancies. Upon receiving a second dose, serological response rates indicate a substantial increase in seropositivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in all cancer cohorts, but antibody titers remain reduced in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore, seroconversion in patients with hematological malignancies was significantly lower compared to patients with solid tumors. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and well-tolerated in cancer patients based on current data of local and systemic effects. CONCLUSION: Together, these data support the prioritization of patients with cancer to receive their first and second doses to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe complications in this vulnerable population. Additional prophylactic measures must be considered for high-risk patients where current vaccination programs may not mount sufficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine response in cancer patients: an interim analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regenerative medicine applications require cells that are not inflicted with senescence after in vitro culture for an optimal in vivo outcome.

The expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-gal) by human chondrocytes from osteoarthritis-affected cartilage tissue, grown in a conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture versus in 3D-TGP were compared. In 2D, the cells de-differentiated into fibroblasts, expressed higher SA-gal and started degenerating at 25 days. SA-gal levels decreased when the chondrocytes were transferred from the 2D to the 3D-TGP culture, with cells exhibiting a tissue-like growth until 42-45 days. Other senescence associated markers such as p16INK4a and p21 were also expressed only in 2D cultured cells but not in 3D-TGP tissue engineered cartilage. This is a first-of-its-kind report of a chemically synthesized and reproducible in vitro environment yielding an advantageous reversal of aging of human chondrocytes without any genomic modifications.

In this regard, we focus on an ultra-dense wireless network consisting of Femto Access Points (FAPs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), known as caching nodes, where there are more than one possible caching node to handle user's request. To efficiently cope with the dynamic topology of wireless networks and time-varying behavior of ground users, our focus is to develop an efficient connection scheduling framework, where ground users are autonomously trained to determine the optimal caching node, i.e., UAV or FAP. Our aim is to minimize users' access delay by maintaining a trade-off between the energy consumption of UAVs and the occurrence of handovers. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem and propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Q-Network-based Connection Scheduling (CQN-CS) framework. More specifically, to solve the constructed multi-objective connection scheduling problem, a deep Q-Network model is developed as an efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to train ground users to handle their requests in an optimal and trustworthy fashion within the coupled UAV-based femtocaching network. The effectiveness of the proposed CQN-CS framework is evaluated in terms of the cache-hit ratio, user's access delay, energy consumption of UAVs, handover, lifetime of the network, and cumulative rewards.

The standard approach to monitoring this fishery has been to base trained scientific staff at the major processing facility for M. cephalus, where they access whole fish from entire catches to generate representative length and age compositions during the peak season, April to May. Covid-19 restrictions prevented this approach for 2020 in eastern Australia. In recognition that in addition to the high-value roe, all components of the female fish are utilized (heads and guts for bait, bodies for human consumption), a multi-stage, spatially stratified sampling design was investigated. Female heads were retained from randomly selected catches from each of the three major fishing zones and transported to the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries fish laboratory based in Sydney. Head lengths (HLs) were measured and converted to Fork Lengths (FLs) using a HL to FL relationship. The resulting fish length compositions from each catch were subsequently combined based on: (i) relative catch size of females within an ocean zone, and; (ii) the relative reported landings of females in each ocean fishing zone. Otoliths were randomly collected from heads sampled from each ocean zone and used to estimate age. The resulting ocean zone to age matrix was combined with the relative reported landings of female fish in each ocean fishing zone to generate a total female age composition for the fishery. The estimated age composition of females were typical in being mainly between ages 3 and 6, with a strong presence of 4-year olds. This stronger cohort was present as 3-year olds in 2018/19 and 5-year olds in 2020/21, thus providing confidence that our sampling was representative of the fishery.

However, this process is inefficient. Experiments were therefore conducted to delineate the rate limiting step(s) involved, using a phage vector that contains a mammalian luciferase reporter gene cassette. The efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells was quantitated, in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors of cell uptake and degradation pathways. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases and proteasome inhibitors strongly enhanced phage-mediated luciferase expression, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the destruction of intracellular phage particles. In contrast, inhibition of endosome acidification had no effect on phage-mediated gene transfer, presumably because phage lambda is tolerant to extended exposure to low pH. These findings provide insights into the pathways by which phage vectors enter and transduce mammalian cells, and suggest that it may be possible to pharmacologically enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells.

Remarkable developments achieved in the last decades are herein discussed in three main sections: (i) an upstream stage, including genetically engineered genes, vectors, and hosts, and optimization of culture conditions (culture media, induction temperature, type and concentration of inducer, induction regimens, and scale); (ii) a downstream stage, focusing on single- and multiple-step chromatography, and emerging alternatives (e.g., aqueous two-phase systems); and (iii) formulation and delivery, providing an overview of improved bioactivities and extended half-lives and targeted delivery to the site of action. This review ends with an outlook and foreseeable prospects for underdeveloped aspects of biopharma research involving human interferons.","output":"Interferon-Based Biopharmaceuticals: Overview on the Production, Purification, and Formulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, public health experts have emphasized testing, tracking infected people, and tracing their contacts as an effective strategy to reduce the spread of the virus. Several diagnostic methods are reported for detecting the coronavirus in clinical, research, and public health laboratories. Some tests detect the infection directly by detecting the viral RNA and other tests detect the infection indirectly by detecting the host antibodies. A diagnostic test during the pandemic should help make an appropriate clinical decision in a short period of time. Recently reported diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 have varying throughput, batching capacity, requirement of infrastructure setting, analytical performance, and turnaround times ranging from a few minutes to several hours. These factors should be considered while selecting a reliable and rapid diagnostic method to help make an appropriate decision and prompt public health interventions. This paper reviews recent SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods published in journals and reports released by regulatory agencies. We compared the analytical efficiency including limit of detection, sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. In addition, we also looked into ease of use, affordability, and availability of accessories. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the methods and provide our perspectives on priorities for future test development.","output":"Review of analytical performance of COVID-19 detection methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: New recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during delivery have changed the maternal birth experience. In this study, we investigated the mental perceived impact of PPE use during delivery on the development of maternal postpartum depression (PPD) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study concerning women who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic first lockdown period in Israel. Postpartum women were approached and asked to complete a comprehensive online questionnaire. Impact of PPE was graded on a scale of 1-5, and Impact of PPE &#8805;4 was considered high. PPD and PTSS were assessed using the EPDS and City BiTS questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 421 parturients, 36 (9%) reported high Impact of PPE. Parturients with high Impact of PPE had significantly higher PPD and PTSS scores)EPDS 8.4  5.8 vs. 5.7  5.3; City BiTS 9.2  10.3 vs. 5.8  7.8, p < 0.05 for both). Following adjustment for socio-demographic and delivery confounders and fear of COVID-19 (using Fear of COVID19 scale), Impact of PPE remained positively correlated with PPD symptoms (? = 0.103, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.029-1.006, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: When examining the risk factors for developing postpartum PTSS-experiences during labor and PPE were found to be significant variables. As the use of PPE is crucial in this era of COVID-19 pandemic in order to protect both parturients and caregivers, creative measures should be taken in order to overcome the communication gap it poses.","output":"The use of personal protective equipment as an independent factor for developing depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in the postpartum period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has arguably facilitated a shift toward increased sedentariness and reduced physical activity. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that mental health has also declined during the pandemic. However, it remains unknown to what extent social distancing (SD) behaviors and mental health have affected the physical activity levels of the general population. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of SD behaviors and prevailing mental health on the odds of being physically active during the early COVID-19 pandemic response. METHODS: A total of 4819 adults (2474/4819, 51.3%, female) from the US population with a median age of 46 (IQR 35-59) completed an online survey during the early pandemic response (April-June 2020). The survey included questions on adherence to 11 SD behaviors, and validated questionnaires which assessed self-reported physical activity, depression, anxiety, and mental well-being. Respondents were categorized into 2 physical activity groups: inactive (0-599 metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-minutes/week) and active (600 MET-minutes/week). A logistic generalized additive model (GAM) was used to determine which SD factors and mental health outcomes were associated with physical activity level. RESULTS: The GAM analysis revealed that wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.79; P=.003), limiting the use of public transport (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19-1.83; P=.001), and restricting travel outside the house (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.19-2.05; P=.002) were SD behaviors associated with higher odds of being more physically active. Conversely, avoiding physical activity outside the house was associated with higher odds of being inactive (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.63; P<.001). Leaving the house more frequently, and a higher mental well-being were associated with increasing odds of being physically active (P<.001). Engaging with a moderate number of SD behaviors (3-7 total) was positively associated with physical activity, whereas a very high SD vigilance (ie, engaging with 10 total behaviors) decreased the odds of being active during the early pandemic response. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of our study, we suggest that future public health messaging of SD guidelines should include (1) a clear portrayal of the benefits of regular exercise on mental health; and (2) a specific focus on how to be physically active outdoors in a COVID-safe manner.","output":"The Influence of Social Distancing Behaviors and Psychosocial Factors on Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurring during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery.

Data collection took place via in-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews during June-August 2020. Four of the participants self-identified as Native American. Three of them were male; between the ages of 74 and 75; had at least some college education. The fourth Native American elder was a 68 year-old female with some college education. All four participants were coping well with everyday life during the pandemic. Connectedness emerged as the overarching theme among the 4 cases. Regular communication with their families was expressed as most important. A variety of communication technology was used to maintain contact with family members such as phone calls, texting, email, and video chat services particularly Zoom, FaceTime, and Facebook Video Chat. Challenges with using these technologies were also frequently reported. The participants expressed they did not feel a sense of increased loneliness or loss of being connected. Another theme emerged related to surviving the impact of the pandemic. Having the vaccine accessible along with financial resources necessary to sustain essential needs were most frequently expressed by the participants. These findings have implications for community interventions and policies that support the provision of mechanisms for Native American elders to maintain a sense of connectedness, including the adoption and use of communication technology, during times of crises such as pandemics and natural disasters.","output":"Native American Elders Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to address the apparent contradiction between the urban demographic and migratory trends and the transition towards a more sustainable mobility that local and metropolitan governments seek.

Employing demographic, mobility and transport, and air quality statistics, we intend to analyse: (a) the spatial demographic trends in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (AMB), particularly regarding the core and periphery population growth or decline;(b) trends in daily mobility and how the public and private transport mix has changed;and (c) pollution data changes confirming the success or failure of the private vehicle reduction policy. Findings confirm our initial hypothesis: the slow but steady transition towards sustainable forms of mobility in the core city and the dense contiguous municipalities is counterbalanced by what occurs in the peripheral suburbs. There, the use of private vehicles is still preeminent and growing. Nevertheless, the air quality has improved in the most central municipalities of the AMB (for which data are available), even if not all parameters have seen a similar pollution reduction.","output":"Transition towards a Sustainable Mobility in a Suburbanising Urban Area: The Case of Barcelona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging public health problem threatening not only the life but also the normal psychology of people.

As we found large variations among the gestures exist between participants, we then proposed a set of gestures for the proposed commands to be used as a common foundation for robot interaction. We collected ~7500 video demonstrations of the proposed gestures and trained a gesture recognition model, adapting 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the classifier, with a final accuracy of 84.1% (sigma=2.4).

To date, it has affected 465,915 individuals in 200 countries, and has been responsible for 21,031 deaths. In the absence of definitive treatment strategies, there is a pressing demand for drug discovery against CoVID-19. Drug repurposing is a cost- effective and time-saving strategy which essentially involves the identification of novel targets for known drug candidates. This reduces the time and cost of drug discovery, as the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles of the drugs are already known, which makes phase-I clinical trials redundant. Here, we employed a computational drug repurposing strategy for identifying drug hits against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) protein of CoVID-19. Analysis of the human-virus protein-protein associations revealed that the viral RDRP (NSP12) is associated with multiple host proteins that partake in cellular processes, which indicated that NSP12 could be a potential target for drug discovery. This, combined with the fact that the RDRP protein is a potential antiviral target in several viral diseases, led us to consider the NSP12 as a potential drug target for CoVID-19. Owing to the absence of an experimentally-derived structure in the PDB, we constructed the NSP12 protein of CoVID-19 by homology modelling, and the potential druggable sites were analysed. The 13,533 entries in DrugBank were initially screened using the sequence of CoVID-19 NSP12. The 7 hits thus identified were subjected to a consensus docking and scoring strategy for identifying hits against the druggable site of CoVID-19 NSP12. Analysis of the docking scores and protein- ligand interactions revealed that two hits C N-alpha-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-n-[(1r)-4- hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxobutyl]-l-phenylalaninamide and S-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-4h-1,2,4- triazol-3-yl] 5-(phenylethynyl) furan-2 -carbothioate, had stronger binding affinity than remdesivir, which is being presently tested in clinical trials for its antiviral activity against CoVID-19. This indicated that these two compounds might be effective against CoVID-19, however, further experimentation is necessary for obtaining substantial evidence.

Fifty-four articles were included following a search of PubMed and Google Scholar databases for studies published between January 2020 and September 2021 that investigated humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer. Immunogenicity of vaccines was found to be lower in patients with cancer versus healthy individuals, and humoral immune responses were inferior in those with haematological versus solid cancers. Patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors associated with poorer vaccine responses should be identified and corrected or mitigated when possible. Consideration should be given to offering patients with cancer second doses of COVID vaccine at shorter intervals than in healthy individuals. Patients with cancer warrant a third vaccine dose and must be prioritized in vaccination schedules. Vaccine adverse effect profiles are comparable between patients with cancer and healthy individuals.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has worked with other federal agencies to identify counties with increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspots) and offers support to local health departments to limit the spread of the disease. Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of hotspot events is of great importance to support policy decisions and prevent large-scale outbreaks. This paper presents a spatio-temporal Bayesian framework for early detection of COVID-19 hotspots (at the county level) in the United States. We assume both the observed number of cases and hotspots depend on a class of latent random variables, which encode the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19. Such latent variables follow a zero-mean Gaussian process, whose covariance is specified by a non-stationary kernel function. The most salient feature of our kernel function is that deep neural networks are introduced to enhance the model's representative power while still enjoying the interpretability of the kernel. We derive a sparse model and fit the model using a variational learning strategy to circumvent the computational intractability for large data sets. Our model demonstrates better interpretability and superior hotspot-detection performance compared to other baseline methods.","output":"Early Detection of COVID-19 Hotspots Using Spatio-Temporal Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health systems are facing unprecedented socioeconomic pressures as well as the need to cope with the ongoing strain brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the reconfiguration of health systems to encourage greater collaboration and integration has been promoted with a variety of collaborative shapes and forms being encouraged and developed. Despite this continued interest, evidence for success of these various arrangements is lacking, with the links between collaboration and improved performance often remaining uncertain. To date, many examinations of collaborations have been undertaken, but use of realist methodology may shed additional light on how and why collaboration works, and whom it benefits. METHODS: This paper seeks to test initial context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) of interorganisational collaboration with the view to producing a refined realist theory. This phase of the realist synthesis used case study and evaluation literature; combined with supplementary systematic searches. These searches were screened for rigour and relevance, after which CMOCs were extracted from included literature and compared against existing ones for refinement, refutation, or affirmation. We also identified demi-regularities to better explain how these CMOCs were interlinked. RESULTS: Fifty-one papers were included, from which 338 CMOCs were identified, where many were analogous. This resulted in new mechanisms such as 'risk threshold' and refinement of many others, including trust, confidence, and faith, into more well-defined constructs. Refinement and addition of CMOCs enabled the creation of a 'web of causality' depicting how contextual factors form CMOC chains which generate outputs of collaborative behaviour. Core characteristics of collaborations, such as whether they were mandated or cross-sector, were explored for their proposed impact according to the theory. CONCLUSION: The formulation of this refined realist theory allows for greater understanding of how and why collaborations work and can serve to inform both future work in this area and the implementation of these arrangements. Future work should delve deeper into collaborative subtypes and the underlying drivers of collaborative performance.

This disease causes the infection of bursa, which leads to major immune losses. A total number of 30 samples from five IBD outbreaks during the period of 2019-20 were collected from different areas of Faisalabad district, Pakistan and assayed by targeting the IBD virus VP2 region through RT-PCR. Among all the outbreaks, almost 80% of poultry birds were found positive for the IBDV. The bursa tissues were collected from the infected birds and histopathological examination of samples revealed severe lymphocytic depletion, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and necrosis of the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Positive samples were subjected to re-isolation and molecular characterization of IBDV. The Pakistan IBDV genes were subjected to DNA sequencing to determine the virus nucleotide sequences. The sequences of 100 Serotype-I IBDVs showing nearest homology were compared and identified with the study sequence. The construction of the phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences was accomplished by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA-6 with reference strains. The VP2 segment reassortment of IBDVs carrying segment A were identified as one important type of circulating strains in Pakistan. The findings indicated the molecular features of the Pakistan IBDV strains playing a role in the evolution of new strains of the virus, which will contribute to the vaccine selection and effective prevention of the disease.","output":"Molecular Characterization and Demographic Study on Infectious Bursal Disease Virus in Faisalabad District"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome from patient samples is an important epidemiological tool for monitoring and responding to the pandemic, including the emergence of new mutations in specific communities. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples collected, along with epidemiological metadata, at a walk-up, rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California during November 22-December 1, 2020 and January 10-29, 2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants. RESULTS: A total of 12,124 tests were performed yielding 1,099 positives. From these, 928 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.4% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to the \\"California\\" or \\"West Coast\\" variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429) were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.36 vs 0.29, RR=1.28; 95% CI:1.00-1.64). The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains, as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms (60.9% vs 64.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in prevalence, relative household attack rates, and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants.","output":"Estimation of secondary household attack rates for emergent spike L452R SARS-CoV-2 variants detected by genomic surveillance at a community-based testing site in San Francisco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease that may cause fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.

Frequency of LFT abnormality was significantly greater in patients with severe/critical (SC) COVID-19 compared to those with mild/moderate (MM) COVID-19 (32.4% vs 11.6%, p=0.011). Among patients with LFT abnormality, the median age was significantly higher in the SC group compared to the MM group (52 vs 39 years, p=0.021). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is frequently associated with mild liver function abnormality, particularly in individuals with severe/critical COVID-19 who were older. Liver function should be monitored carefully during infection, with judicious use of hepatotoxic agents where possible and avoidance of prolonged hypotension to minimize liver injury in older patients.

Tools provided by the field of implementation science can guide practitioners through a comprehensive implementation process, making innovations more adaptable, efficient, and sustainable. It is equally important to report on the design and implementation process so others can analyze, replicate, and improve on the progress made from an intervention. The current study reports on the design and implementation of an mHealth intervention to improve child health in the Amazon of Peru. The study aims to provide insight into how an implementation science tool can be used to improve implementation and reporting of an evidence-based intervention in a global health setting. Methods: Implementation of a community-based mHealth intervention is analyzed and reported through the lens of the Active Implementation Frameworks (AIF). The AIF is used to analyze the design, implementation, adaptation, and monitoring of the intervention. The implementation process is categorized in the four stages of implementation. The results of the analysis and subsequent implementation activities are reported. Results: The exploration stage was used to learn about the local context in the Amazonian communities and identify an evidence-based solution to address poor child health. Several potential solutions were combined to create an innovative mHealth tool. During the installation stage, the stakeholders worked together to improve the intervention and plan for implementation through human-centered design. The providers in the field were trained and data was gathered to monitor implementation. During initial implementation stage, electronic tablets were distributed to community health agents and continuous quality improvement activities allowed for rapid improvements to be implemented. The intervention moved on to full implementation stage as acceptance and fidelity approached 100%. Conclusion: The AIF highlighted several potential barriers to implementation that may have been overlooked without the guidance of a science-based implementation tool. Reporting on the implementation process shows how implementation science tools can be used to foresee and address potential threats to successful implementation.

Both are required to fuel progress and propel efforts towards heightening health and security. The urgency to build capacity has been catalysed by an increasing number of sanitary crises, threats, and disease outbreaks that have spanned countries, regions and continents. Education has often bridged the gaps in learning, but it has also divided the ways in which learning is practised. Differing cultural, religious and political beliefs, together with alternate economic priorities, have meant that countries have been advocating for education to meet their own specific needs, and not necessarily those of the international community. The varying contents of veterinary curricula around the world do not always demonstrate that the initial education of veterinary students provides them with the necessary skill sets to fulfil their responsibilities as key actors in the private and public sectors of national Veterinary Services. This has resulted in discrepancies in the competencies acquired by veterinarians and their capacities to uphold good veterinary governance and practices. To address this educational imbalance, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has drafted recommendations and guidelines to assist Veterinary Education Establishments worldwide with improving the breadth and depth of their veterinary curricula in order to strengthen their national Veterinary Services. The OIE has, furthermore, developed a twinning programme for Veterinary Education Establishments, under which learning opportunities for teaching staff and students are created and shared.

In contrast, the Beta and Delta variants of this same virus can join the ACE2 with high affinity even with the presence of DHF.

After autoproteolytic cleavage, the CHIKV capsid protein (CP) is involved in RNA binding and assembly of the viral particle. The monomeric CP is approximately 30 kDa in size and is small enough for passive transport through nuclear pores. Some alphaviruses are found to harbor nuclear localization signals (NLS) and transport of these proteins between cellular compartments was shown to be energy dependent. The active nuclear import of cytoplasmic proteins is mediated by karyopherins and their export by exportins. As nuclear and cytoplasmic trafficking may play a role in the life cycle of CHIKV, we have sought to identify nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in CHIKV CP in a virus-free system. METHODS: EGFP-fusion proteins of CHIKV CP and mutants thereof were created and used to monitor their intracellular localization. Binding of cellular proteins was confirmed in pull-down assays with purified CP using co-immuoprecipitation. Nuclear localization was demonstrated in a virus-free system using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Here we show that CHIKV CP is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein with an active NLS that binds to karyopherin  (Kar) for its nuclear translocation. We also found that the Kar4 C-terminal NLS binding site is sufficient for this interaction. We further demonstrate that CHIKV CP interacts directly with the export receptor CRM1 to transport this viral protein out of the nucleus via a nuclear export signal (NES). The CHIKV CP NES was mapped between amino acids 143 and 155 of CP. Deduced from in silico analyses we found that the NES has a mode of binding similar to the snurportin-1 CRM1 complex. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that in a virus-free system that the CHIKV capsid protein contains both, a NLS and a NES, and that it is actively transported between the cytoplasma and the nucleus. We conclude that CHIKV CP has the ability to shuttle via interaction with karyopherins for its nuclear import and, vice versa, by CRM1-dependent nuclear export.","output":"Chikungunya virus capsid protein contains nuclear import and export signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to mitigate risks in supply chain activities in tuna products during the Covid-19 pandemic.

If the mouth and nose of HCWs are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help reduce the risk of active infection being passed from infected patients to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves, or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. Understanding these possible side effects is particularly important when the HCWs are otherwise fit and well. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays used by healthcare workers (HCWs) to protect themselves when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. SEARCH METHODS Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: RCTs; quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to HCWs, with or without the same intervention being given to the patients with COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) viral content of aerosol, when present (if intervention administered to patients); 4) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 5) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified three ongoing studies (including two RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 700 participants. The interventions included in these trials are povidone iodine, nitric oxide and GLS-1200 oral spray (the constituent of this spray is unclear and may not be antimicrobial in nature). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by two RCTs and a non-randomised study. We are concerned that only one of the ongoing studies specifically states that it will evaluate adverse events and it is not clear if this will include changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular, where those receiving the intervention are otherwise fit and well, it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.","output":"Use of antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays by healthcare workers to protect them when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prognostic tools are required to guide clinical decision-making in COVID-19. METHODS: We studied the relationship between the ratio of interleukin (IL)-6 to IL-10 and clinical outcome in 80 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and created a simple 5-point linear score predictor of clinical outcome, the Dublin-Boston score. Clinical outcome was analysed as a three-level ordinal variable (Improved, Unchanged, or Declined). For both IL-6:IL-10 ratio and IL-6 alone, we associated clinical outcome with a) baseline biomarker levels, b) change in biomarker level from day 0 to day 2, c) change in biomarker from day 0 to day 4, and d) slope of biomarker change throughout the study. The associations between ordinal clinical outcome and each of the different predictors were performed with proportional odds logistic regression. Associations were run both unadjusted and adjusted for age and sex. Nested cross-validation was used to identify the model for incorporation into the Dublin-Boston score. FINDINGS: The 4-day change in IL-6:IL-10 ratio was chosen to derive the Dublin-Boston score. Each 1 point increase in the score was associated with a 5.6 times increased odds for a more severe outcome (OR 5.62, 95% CI -3.22C9.81, P = 1.2  10(?9)). Both the Dublin-Boston score and the 4-day change in IL-6:IL-10 significantly outperformed IL-6 alone in predicting clinical outcome at day 7.

PMOs are highly stable, are effective by a variety of routes of administration, can be readily formulated in common isotonic delivery vehicles, and can be rapidly designed and synthesized. These are properties which may make PMOs good candidates for use during responses to emerging or reemerging viruses that may be insensitive to available therapies or for use during outbreaks, especially in regions that lack a modern medical infrastructure. While the efficacy of sequence-specific therapies can be limited by target-site sequence variations that occur between variants or by the emergence of resistant mutants during infections, various PMO design strategies can minimize these impacts. These strategies include the use of promiscuous bases such as inosine to compensate for predicted base-pair mismatches, the use of sequences that target conserved sites between viral strains, and the use of sequences that target host products that viruses utilize for infection.","output":"Advanced morpholino oligomers: A novel approach to antiviral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preliminary data from different cohorts of small sample size or with short follow-up indicate poorer prognosis in people with obesity compared to other patients.

The Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) was used to assess frailty before cardioversion. The six-month visit after the electrical cardioversion was a follow-up. The follow-up period for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion was 180  14 days. Results: Patients in whom cardioversion was effective had a statistically significantly lower severity of frailty syndrome (3.44  1.83 vs 5.87  1.12; p=0.000) and its components: physical components (2.14  1.33 vs 3.62  1.05 p=0.000); emotional components (0.92  0.79 vs 1.29  0.86 p=0.037) and social components (0.37  0.56 vs 0.96  0.46; p=0.000) compared to those patients in which cardioversion was ineffective.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present descriptive-analytic and cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 year on family members of nurses working in Hajar Hospital for admission and hospitalization of patients with COVID-19, after obtaining the necessary permits and coordination. To prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory or contact droplets, a blog was designed to collect data using software. Participation in this study was voluntary. Data collection tools included consent, demographic questionnaire, and mental health questionnaire (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data were analyzed by SPSS version 22. RESULTS: Findings of this study showed that out of 208 family members of nurses participating in this study, 96 were male and 112 were female and their mean age was 35.78 years, and 55.3% of the participants had university education. Their mean mental health score was 12.91  3.75, so that 22.6% of people had mild depression, 71.4% of people had moderate depression, and 1.8% of people had severe depression.

The high-throughput oscillation method described here collects 1-5 of data per crystal at room temperature with fast (10 s-1) oscillation rates and translation times, giving a crystal-data collection rate of 2.5 Hz. Partial datasets collected by the oscillation method at a storage-ring source provide more complete data per crystal than still images, dramatically lowering the total number of crystals needed for a complete dataset suitable for structure solution and refinement - up to two orders of magnitude fewer being required. Thus, this method is particularly well suited to instances where crystal quantities are low.

METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13th April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Tocilizumab is used for treating this highly fatal syndrome. We think that the starting time of tocilizumab is important. In this article, we aimed to discuss the efficacy of tocilizumab and to review the necessity of starting it in the early period and the laboratory values that guide us in determining the time of this early period. METHODS: This retrospective study includes a total of 308 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were treated with tocilizumab, who were hospitalized in the University of Health Sciences, Gazi Ya?argil Training and Research Hospital between July 2020 and December 2020. The data of the patients were recorded on the day of hospitalization, the day of taking tocilizumab (day 0), and the 1st day, 3rd day, 7th day, and 14th day after taking tocilizumab. Data included age, gender, underlying diseases, where the patient was followed, duration of symptoms before admission to the hospital, duration of oxygen demand before tocilizumab, fever, saturation, and laboratory values. Patients were divided into the mortality group (group 1) and the survival group (group 2), and all data were compared. RESULTS: The study consisted of 308 COVID-19 patients divided into two groups: the mortality group (group 1, n = 135) and the survival group (group 2, n = 173). The median age of the patients was 60 (minCmax: 50-70) years, 75.3% (n = 232) were male, and 56.8% had at least one comorbidity. While 88.9% of group 1 was in the intensive care unit, 26.6% of group 2 received tocilizumab while in the intensive care unit, and there was a statistically significant difference. Median SpO(2) values and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2, both on the day of hospitalization and on the day of the first dose of tocilizumab treatment (p < 0.001 for both). C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and alanine aminotransferase values were higher in the mortal group on the first day of hospitalization, and this was significant (p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.036, respectively). In our study, d-dimer was 766.5 ng/mL in the survivor group and 988.5 ng/mL in the mortal group. In our patient group, the mean lymphocyte count was 700  10(3)/mm(3) in the group that survived the first day of TCZ and 500  10(3)/mm(3) in the mortal group. In addition, the CRP value was 135.5 mg/L in the survivor group and 169 mg/L in the mortal group. There was no difference between ferritin values. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab is still among the COVID-19 treatment options and appears to be effective. But the start time is important. In order to increase its effectiveness, it may be important to know a cut-off value of the laboratory findings required for the diagnosis of cytokine release syndrome.

The purpose of this study was to correlate 18F-FDG PET with standard sarcoidosis activity parameters during infliximab treatment. METHODS Twelve patients with refractory sarcoidosis were treated with 6 cycles of infliximab. Pre- and post-therapy 18F-FDG PET was visually evaluated and SUVmax was measured. In addition, the effect of infliximab was evaluated by changes in symptoms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), vital capacity (VC), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and chest radiography. SUVmax and conventional parameters were correlated. RESULTS Clinical improvement as judged by conventional parameters was seen in all patients, though with a minor response in one. Symptoms improved in 11/12 patients while chest radiographic stages did not change. The decrease in ACE was 39% and in sIL-2R 47% (p<0.01). Improvement of VC and DLCO was 5.4% and 3.3% (p<0.05), respectively. 18F-FDG PET revealed either improvement or normalization in 11/12 (92%) clinically responding patients. The overall decrease in SUVmax was 55% (p<0.01); the patient with a limited response showed a 34% increase. A decrease in SUVmax of the lung parenchyma correlated with an improvement of VC (r=-0.75, p<0.01). No significant correlation between SUVmax and other parameters was found.

However, research supporting these links has often focused on only one of these predictors and psychopathology, and interactions among these variables in association with symptoms are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The current study utilized a cross-sectional, multi-informant, and multi-method design to investigate the associations of ACEs, SES, parenting, and concurrent internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data are from a volunteer sample of 97 adolescents and their caregivers recruited from 2018 to 2021 in a southern U.S. metropolitan area to sample a range of exposure to ACEs. METHODS: Multiple linear regression models were used to assess associations among adolescents' ACEs exposure, SES, observed parenting practices, and symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. RESULTS: Lower SES was associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, while higher ACEs exposure and observed parenting were related to externalizing but not internalizing symptoms. Associations of adolescents' exposure to physical abuse and perceived financial insecurity with externalizing symptoms were moderated by warm and supportive parenting behaviors. Conversely, harsh parenting was linked to increased levels of externalizing symptoms, particularly in the context of low income. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the presence of multiple risk factors may incur greater vulnerability to externalizing problems, while warm and supportive parenting practices may provide a buffer against externalizing problems for adolescents exposed to physical abuse.

METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 32,144 patients who underwent total gastrectomy and were registered in the NCD database between January 2012 and December 2013. Mortality and morbidities were compared between patients who received LTG and those who underwent open total gastrectomy (OTG) in the propensity score-matched Stage I cohort and Stage II-IV cohort. RESULTS There was no significant difference in mortality rate between LTG and OTG in both cohorts. Operating time was significantly longer in LTG while the blood loss was smaller. In the Stage I cohort, LTG, performed in 33.6% of the patients, was associated with significantly shorter hospital stay but significantly higher incidence of readmission, reoperation, and anastomotic leakage (5.4% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.01). In the Stage II-IV cohort, LTG was performed in only 8.8% of the patients and was associated with significantly higher incidence of leakage (5.7% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.02) although the hospital stay was shorter (15 days vs. 17 days, p < 0.001).

We hypothesise that compared to conventional diagnostic methods, a multiplex bacterial polymerase chain reaction assay has a higher diagnostic yield in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and improved clinical outcomes in patients with suspicion of pulmonary infection. METHODS: A prospective, monocentric, quasi-experimental, observational study was carried out. Unselected patients with suspected pulmonary infection who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL were included in the study over a period of 1 year. In addition to conventional diagnostic methods, a multiplex PCR bacterial assay was performed in BAL on a 2 week on: 1 week off pre-determined schedule. No therapeutic recommendations were provided to the treating physician. RESULTS: 605 cases were included, 54% of whom were immunosuppressed. Conventional diagnostic methods detected 56% of the bacteria evidenced by PCR. PCR failed to detect bacteria in 4% of the cases with a positive conventional diagnostic result. After bronchoscopy, 42% of the patients received antibacterial therapy for pulmonary infection for a median of 12 antibiotic days. There was no statistically significant difference in length of hospital stay (median 8 versus 8; p=0.839), antibiotic exposure (median 11 versus 14; p=0.362) or number of antibiotics prescribed (median 2 versus 2; p=0.595) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex bacterial PCR detected more bacteria in BAL fluid than conventional diagnostic methods. However, without a specific antibiotic stewardship approach and a clear understanding of the clinical implications of a positive or negative PCR result, the PCR results did not influence clinical outcomes.","output":"Multiplex bacterial PCR in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of non-intubated patients with suspected pulmonary infection: a quasi-experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus can cause respiratory syndrome which to date has affected about twelve thousand individuals, especially in China.

Data on treatment are sparse. We systematically evaluated the literature on botulinum antitoxin and other treatments. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of published articles in PubMed via Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and included all studies that reported on the clinical course and treatment for foodborne botulism. Articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers and independently abstracted for treatment type and toxin exposure. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effect of timing of antitoxin administration, antitoxin type, and toxin exposure type. Results We identified 235 articles that met the inclusion criteria, published between 1923 and 2016. Study quality was variable. Few (27%) case series reported sufficient data for inclusion in meta-analysis. Reduced mortality was associated with any antitoxin treatment (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], .09-.30) and antitoxin treatment within 48 hours of illness onset (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, .03-.41). Data did not allow assessment of critical care impact, including ventilator support, on survival. Therapeutic agents other than antitoxin offered no clear benefit. Patient characteristics did not predict poor outcomes. We did not identify an interval beyond which antitoxin was not beneficial. Conclusions Published studies on botulism treatment are relatively sparse and of low quality. Timely administration of antitoxin reduces mortality; despite appropriate treatment with antitoxin, some patients suffer respiratory failure.

However, the proper deployment of air filtration has been hampered by an insufficient understanding of its principles. These misconceptions have led to uncertainty about the effectiveness of air filtration at arresting potentially infectious aerosol particles. A correct understanding of how air filtration works is critical for further decision-making regarding its use in managing the spread of COVID-19. The issue is significant because recent evidence has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can remain airborne longer and travel farther than anticipated earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with diminishing concentrations and viability. While SARS-CoV-2 virions are around 60-140 nm in diameter, larger respiratory droplets and air pollution particles (>1 m) have been found to harbor the virions. Removing particles that could carry SARS-CoV-2 from the air is possible using air filtration, which relies on the natural or mechanical movement of air. Among various types of air filters, high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters have been recommended. Other types of filters are less or more effective and, correspondingly, are easier or harder to move air through. The use of masks, respirators, air filtration modules, and other dedicated equipment is an essential intervention in the management of COVID-19 spread. It is critical to consider the mechanisms of air filtration and to understand how aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 virions interact with filter materials to determine the best practices for the use of air filtration to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Air filtration and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection in developed countries and is a known cause of intrauterine fetal death.

Progranulin signaling has not been systematically studied and compared between sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), COVID-19 pneumonia and a sterile systemic inflammatory response (SIRS). We delineated molecular networks of progranulin signaling by next-generation sequencing (NGS), determined progranulin plasma concentrations and quantified the diagnostic performance of progranulin to differentiate between the above-mentioned disorders using the established biomarkers procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for comparison. METHODS: The diagnostic performance of progranulin was operationalized by calculating AUC and ROC statistics for progranulin and established biomarkers in 241 patients with sepsis, 182 patients with SIRS, 53 patients with CAP, 22 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 53 healthy volunteers. miRNAs and mRNAs in blood cells from sepsis patients (n = 7) were characterized by NGS and validated by RT-qPCR in an independent cohort (n = 39) to identify canonical gene networks associated with upregulated progranulin at sepsis onset. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of progranulin (ELISA) in patients with sepsis were 57.5 (42.8C84.9, Q25CQ75) ng/ml and significantly higher than in CAP (38.0, 33.5C41.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001), SIRS (29.0, 25.0C35.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and the healthy state (28.7, 25.5C31.7 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher progranulin concentrations than patients with CAP (67.6, 56.6C96.0 vs. 38.0, 33.5C41.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The diagnostic performance of progranulin for the differentiation between sepsis vs. SIRS (n = 423) was comparable to that of procalcitonin. AUC was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87C0.93) for progranulin and 0.92 (CI = 0.88C0.96, p = 0.323) for procalcitonin. Progranulin showed high discriminative power to differentiate bacterial CAP from COVID-19 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.94, AUC 0.91 (CI = 0.8C1.0) and performed significantly better than PCT, IL-6 and CRP. NGS and partial RT-qPCR confirmation revealed a transcriptomic network of immune cells with upregulated progranulin and sortilin transcripts as well as toll-like-receptor 4 and tumor-protein 53, regulated by miR-16 and others. CONCLUSIONS: Progranulin signaling is elevated during the early antimicrobial response in sepsis and differs significantly between sepsis, CAP, COVID-19 and SIRS. This suggests that progranulin may serve as a novel indicator for the differentiation between these disorders.

In this study the Poles knowledge about COVID-19 as well as peoples behaviours, attitudes and fears during the pandemic were assessed. Changes in these between the outset of the pandemic and the imposition of the strictest lockdown measures in Poland were investigated. METHODS: Physicians, nurses, students of medicine-oriented faculties, non-medical professionals, students of non-medicine-oriented faculties and secondary school students were surveyed by an anonymous online questionnaire two times: at the onset of the pandemic and in the second week of the strictest lockdown. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests C Pearson Chi Square, Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: In total 2618 responses were collected. At the beginning people knew that the respiratory system was attacked (97.9%); correctly identified the major symptoms of COVID-19 (95.0%) and ways to prevent infection: hand washing (99.8%), covering mouth (85.9%) and the need to call sanitary-epidemiological services if one experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (92.1%). The biggest changes between the first and second phase of the study concerned behaviours: more people wearing facial masks (+ 37.5%) and staying at home (+ 66.1%). Respondents in the second wave of the survey were also more scared of the pandemic (+ 19.6%), economic crisis (+ 64.1%), and worried about their families (+ 26.5%). However, they were less afraid of the quarantine (lockdown) (? 18.2%). Nurses and physicians were the most worried groups.

To estimate the effectiveness of different containment measures, the paper uses a methodological approach that takes into consideration the persistence in the dynamics between coronavirus containment measures and contagion/death rates, countries' idiosyncratic characteristics, and the endogeneity of the containment measures. To obtain efficient estimates of the effect of coronavirus containment measures on contagion and death rates, a dynamic panel-data technique is used, complemented by efficient instruments for the decision of adopting coronavirus containment measures. The results show that countries with better health systems, higher temperatures, and more democratic regimes tended to delay the adoption of coronavirus containment measures. The results also detect demonstration effects as the early adoption of coronavirus containment measures in Western Europe led other countries to accelerate their adoption. Using predictions from the estimated model, it is possible to benchmark the timing of adoption of coronavirus containment measures and assess whether their adoption was timely or not and if they were lifted prematurely or not. The findings of this exercise show that countries with timely adopted coronavirus containment measures restricted activities, meanwhile they lagged in the adoption of measures restricting individual liberties. The evidence indicates that most countries resisted the urge to lift restrictions in advance, once they have been in place: over 60 percent of the countries have reacted as predicted by our econometric models, maintaining coronavirus containment measures in place until contagion rates receded. Nevertheless, around one-quarter of the countries lifted their restrictions one month or more ahead of what the worldwide evidence would have suggested, in particular by removing lockdowns and re-opening workplaces. Finally, the results show that coronavirus containment measures have been effective in reducing contagion and death rates, but there are differences in the effectiveness among them, and restrictions on activities have been more effective than restrictions on personal liberties.","output":"Do coronavirus containment measures work?

However, how the SIN regulates integral CR components was unknown. Here, we identify the essential cytokinetic formin Cdc12 as a key CR substrate of SIN kinase Sid2. Eliminating Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation leads to persistent Cdc12 clustering, which prevents CR assembly in the absence of anillin-like Mid1 and causes CRs to collapse when cytokinesis is delayed. Molecularly, Sid2 phosphorylation of Cdc12 abrogates multimerization of a previously unrecognized Cdc12 domain that confers F-actin bundling activity. Taken together, our findings identify a SIN-triggered oligomeric switch that modulates cytokinetic formin function, revealing a novel mechanism of actin cytoskeleton regulation during cell division.","output":"SIN-dependent phosphoinhibition of formin multimerization controls fission yeast cytokinesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) is a common bariatric operation performed for obesity. Complications of LAGB commonly evolve around device malfunction and physiological changes secondary to the gastric banding. Complications of LAGB involving the aorta are rare. A case of gastric band misplacement around the aorta and subsequent successful retrieval of the misplaced device is reported. Report: A 45 year old obese woman presented as an emergency with food bolus obstruction secondary to gastric banding inserted 10 years previously. Investigations revealed that her gastric band was misplaced around both the oesophagus at the level of the gastro-oesophageal junction and the descending thoracic aorta at the level of T12. Successful and safe retrieval of the misplaced device is reported electively via a two staged approach: first covering the segment of supra-coeliac aorta at the level of the gastric band with a thoracic aortic stent graft (TAG), and, second, assessing for any oesophageal injury via endoscopy and finally extracting the misplaced device via laparoscopy. A Gore C-TAG device size 26 mm  100 mm was successfully implanted percutaneously via unilateral femoral access during her first stage procedure. Her gastric band was safely retrieved during her second stage procedure with no complications. She recovered well post-operatively. Discussion: Complications of LAGB involving the aorta are rare but potentially life threatening. Multidisciplinary pre-operative planning is necessary for safe removal of the gastric band.","output":"Aorta, the Innocent Bystander of Bariatric Banding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To assess the overall prevalence of clinical signs, symptoms, and radiological findings in children and/or adolescents with COVID-19. METHODS We systematically researched in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases observational studies describing COVID-19 in children and/or adolescents until April 11, 2020. Data regarding clinical and radiological features were extracted from eligible studies and meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. RESULTS We examined 19 eligible studies for a total of 2855 children and/or adolescents with COVID-19. Approximately 47% of subjects had fever (95% confidence interval [CI] 22-72%; I2 = 98.6%), 37% cough (95%CI 15-63%; I2 = 98.6%), 4% diarrhea (95%CI 0-12%; I2 = 92.2%), 2% nasal congestion (95%CI 0-7%; I2 = 87.7%), 1% dyspnea (95%CI 0-7%; I2 = 91.5%) and 0% abdominal pain (95%CI 0-1%; I2 = 76.3%).

Although resilience plays a crucial role in the daily functioning of individuals by acting as a protective shield that lessens the impact of disasters on their mental well-being, to date little is known about the long-term impact of wildfires on resilience and associated predictors of low resilience. Objectives: The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and predictors of resilience among residents of Fort McMurray five years after the wildfires. Method: This was a quantitative cross-sectional study. A self-administered online survey which included standardized rating scales for resilience (BRS), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)(PCL-C) was used to determine the prevalence of resilience as well as its demographic, clinical, and wildfire-related predictors. The data were collected between 24 April and 2 June 2021 and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 using univariate analysis with a chi-squared test and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 186 residents completed the survey out of 249 who accessed the online survey, producing a response rate of 74.7%. Most of the respondents were females (85.5%, 159), above 40 years of age (81.6%, 80), employed (94.1%, 175), and in a relationship (71%, 132). Two variableshaving had PTSD symptoms (OR = 2.85; 95% CI: 1.06C7.63), and agewere significant predictors of low resilience in our study. The prevalence of low resilience in our sample was 37.4%. Conclusions: Our results suggest that age and the presence of PTSD symptoms were the independent significant risk factors associated with low resilience five years after the Fort McMurray wildfire disaster.

OBJECTIVES To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death.

RESULTS: The data reported by hospitals was used to develop a mathematical model that reflects the flow of the population among the different interest groups in relation to COVID-19. This tool allows to analyse different scenarios based on socio-health restriction measures, and to forecast the number of people infected, hospitalized and admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model is capable of providing predictions on the evolution of the COVID-19 sufficiently in advance as to anticipate the peaks of prevalence and hospital and ICU care demands, and also the appearance of periods in which the care for non-COVID patients could be intensified.","output":"Mathematical model optimized for prediction and health care planning for COVID-19()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Obesity has been demonstrated to increase the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and may influence the quality and effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Our aim was to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and the outcome of OHCA victims not treated by targeted temperature management. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of OHCA patients. The patients were categorized according to BMI into two groups: the normal BMI group (nBMI) and the elevated BMI group (eBMI). The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), while secondary outcomes were survival to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and survival to ICU discharge. RESULTS Of the initial 99 patients who were transported to the Emergency Department, 84 (85%) were included in the study. Mean BMI was 29.8kg/m2. Thirteen (15.5%) patients achieved ROSC and were admitted to the ICU, with the mean duration of ICU length of stay being 6.74.9days. Survival to ICU admission and ICU discharge were higher in the eBMI group (17.6% vs. 6.25%, p=0.010 and 10.3% vs. 6.25%, p=0.021, respectively). Survival to ICU discharge was higher in ventricular fibrillation patients compared to patients with non-shockable rhythms, irrespectively of their BMI (p=0.002).

Despite surgical removal, glioma is still prone to recurrence because it grows rapidly in the brain, is resistant to chemotherapy, and is highly aggressive.

Early and accurate detection of breast cancer plays a critical role in improving the prognosis and bringing the patient survival rate to 50%. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has achieved remarkable performance in early breast cancer diagnosis. This review focuses on literature considering deep learning architecture for breast cancer diagnosis. Therefore, this study anchors a well systematic and analytical review from six aspects: the model architecture of breast cancer diagnosis, datasets and image pre-processing, the manner of breast-cancer imaging, performance measurements, and research directions. ABSTRACT: Breast cancer is now the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, and its percentage is gradually increasing. Optimistically, there is a good chance of recovery from breast cancer if identified and treated at an early stage. Therefore, several researchers have established deep-learning-based automated methods for their efficiency and accuracy in predicting the growth of cancer cells utilizing medical imaging modalities. As of yet, few review studies on breast cancer diagnosis are available that summarize some existing studies. However, these studies were unable to address emerging architectures and modalities in breast cancer diagnosis. This review focuses on the evolving architectures of deep learning for breast cancer detection. In what follows, this survey presents existing deep-learning-based architectures, analyzes the strengths and limitations of the existing studies, examines the used datasets, and reviews image pre-processing techniques. Furthermore, a concrete review of diverse imaging modalities, performance metrics and results, challenges, and research directions for future researchers is presented.","output":"A Comprehensive Survey on Deep-Learning-Based Breast Cancer Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: IFN lambda (type III-IFN-&#955;1) is a molecule primarily produced by epithelial cells that provides an important first-line defence against viral respiratory infections and has been linked to the pathogenesis of viral-induced wheezing in early life. The goal of this study was to better understand the regulation of innate IFN-lambda responses in vitro in primary human infant airway epithelial cells (AECs) and in vivo using nasal aspirates during viral respiratory infections. METHODS: IFN-lambda protein levels were quantified: (a) in human infant AECs exposed to (poly(I:C) dsRNA) under different experimental conditions (n = 8 donors); and (b) in nasal aspirates of young children (&#8804;3 years) hospitalized with viral respiratory infection (n = 138) and in uninfected controls (n = 74). In vivo IFN-lambda airway levels during viral infections were correlated with individual characteristics and respiratory disease parameters. RESULTS: Our in vitro experiments showed that the poly(I:C)-induced innate production of IFN lambda in human infant AECs is regulated by (a) p38-MAPK/NF-kB dependent mechanism; and (b) exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as IL1?. Our in vivo studies demonstrated that (a) infants (<18 months) had higher virus-induced IFN-lambda airway secretion; (b) subjects with RSV infection showed the highest IFN-lambda airway levels; and (c) individuals with the highest virus-induced IFN-lambda levels (>90th percentile) had higher viral loads and were more likely to have respiratory sick visits within 12 months of discharge (OR = 5.8). CONCLUSION: IFN-lambda responses to dsRNA in the human infant airway epithelium are regulated by p38-MAPK and NF-kB signalling.

Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated using RT-PCR as reference method. Findings: Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was performed on 2542 asymptomatic adults in a community with a SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 193%. It showed a sensitivity of 7143% (CI 95%: 5674 - 8342) and a specificity of 9968% (CI 95%: 9937 - 9986). Positive Predictive Value was 814 (CI 95% 666 - 9161) and Negative Predictive Value was 9944 (CI 95% 9906 - 9969).

The Spanish government has enforced social distancing, quarantine, and home confinement measures. Such restrictions on activities of daily life and separation from loved ones may lead to social isolation and loneliness with health-related consequences among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their caregivers. Additionally, inadequate access to health care and social support services may aggravate chronic conditions. Home-based technological interventions have emerged for combating social isolation and loneliness, while simultaneously preventing the risk of virus exposure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cohort study is to explore, analyze, and determine the impact of social isolation on (1) cognition, quality of life, mood, technophilia, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and on the caregiver burden; (2) access to and utilization of health and social care services; and (3) cognitive, social, and entertainment-related uses of information and communication technologies. METHODS: This study will be conducted in Mlaga (Andaluca, Spain). In total 200 dyads, consisting of a person with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and his/her informal caregiver, will be contacted by telephone. Potential respondents will be participants of the following clinical trials: support, monitoring, and reminder technology for mild dementia (n=100) and television-based assistive integrated service to support European adults living with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (n=100). RESULTS: As of May 2021, a total of 153 participants have been enrolled and assessed during COVID-19 confinement, of whom 67 have been assessed at 6 months of enrollment. Changes in the mean values of the variables will be analyzed relative to baseline findings of previous studies with those during and after confinement, using repeated-measures analysis of variance or the nonparametric Friedman test, as appropriate. The performance of multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to introduce potential covariates will also be considered. Values of 95% CI will be used. CONCLUSIONS: If our hypothesis is accepted, these findings will demonstrate the negative impact of social isolation owing to COVID-19 confinement on cognition, quality of life, mood, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia, the impact on technophilia, caregiver burden, the access to and utilization of health and social care services, and the cognitive, social, and entertainment-related use of information and communication technologies during and after COVID-19 confinement.

However, their association with Tumor Associated Blood Eosinophilia (TABE) in OSCCs is still far fetched. We, therefore, attempted to evaluate their individual roles and to achieve a ratio between TATE and TABE in order to signify its usage in objectifying the diagnosis. Materials and Methods: TATE was evaluated using H and E stain per 10 high power fields in 33 previously diagnosed cases of OSCC which were retrieved from department archives. TABE values were achieved from complete blood hemogram reports of patients. TATE/TABE ratio was calculated. All the parameters were clinicopathologically correlated and statistically evaluated using SPSS. Results: TATE represented higher values in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSCC) and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDSCC) and was least in moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC), whereas TABE linearly increased from WDSCC to PDSCC. TNM Stage II cases revealed the highest TATE and lowest TABE. TATE/TABE ratio was the highest in WDSCC. Conclusion: Due to the dual nature of eosinophils in early and late carcinogenesis events, evaluation of only TATE might not be conclusive in determining tumor grade.

In addition, how thermal stratification affects the transport of exhaled particles has not been explored so far. In this study, a water tank experiment was conducted according to the similarity protocols to mimic how the expiratory airflow and particles behaved in both uniform and stratified environments.

Results showed that our previously developed theoretical model of a respiratory airflow was effective to predict the airflow dispersion in stratified environments. Stratification frequency (N) of the background fluid and the Froude Number [Formula: see text] of the thermal flow jointly determined the lock-up layer in a power law. For the particle dispersion, it indicated that small particles such as fine droplets and droplet nuclei would be locked by indoor thermal stratification, and disperse with the thermal flow over a long distance, potentially increasing the long-range airborne infection risk.

To explore these knowledge gaps, we transcriptionally profiled BDBV-infected rhesus macaques, a disease model that results in incomplete lethality. This approach enabled us to identify prognostic indicators. As expected, survival (60%) correlated with reduced clinical pathology and circulating infectious virus, although peak viral RNA loads were not significantly different between surviving and nonsurviving macaques. Survivors had higher anti-BDBV antibody titers and transcriptionally derived cytotoxic T cell-, memory B cell-, and plasma cell-type quantities, demonstrating activation of adaptive immunity.

Hence, it is important to ensure food security for them. This effort is not easy, as the number of undernourished people (NUP) in the world has increased. We investigated the impact of food and non-production factors on the NUP in developing countries. This study employed secondary data from 57 developing countries between 2002 and 2018. These countries come from three regions, namely Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. One-step and two-step generalized method of moments (sys-GMM) models were used to analyze the data. The findings showed that the food production index, cereal import dependency ratio, economic globalization index, and human capital index had different effects on the NUP in each region. The excellent news is that corruption control can help developing countries minimize their NUP. Based on the findings, we propose efforts to improve physical and economical food access and control corruption, and developing country governments and the international community must demonstrate a strong commitment to reducing the prevalence of undernourishment.","output":"Effects of Corruption Control on the Number of Undernourished People in Developing Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is increasing global focus on small and nutritionally at-risk infants aged <6 months (<6 m). Current WHO guidelines recommend weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) for enrolment to malnutrition treatment programmes but acknowledge a weak evidence-base. This review aims to inform future guidelines by examining which anthropometric criteria best identify infants <6 m at high risk of mortality/morbidity. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane Library and POPLINE for studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries and published between 1990 and October 2020. We included studies reporting anthropometric assessment of nutritional status in infants <6 m and assessed the association with subsequent morbidity or mortality. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included in the final review, covering 20 countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. WLZ had poor reliability and poor prognostic ability to identify infants at risk of death. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) were better at identifying infants at risk of mortality/morbidity. MUAC-for-age z-score did not perform better than using a single MUAC cut-off. Suggested MUAC cut-offs for this age group varied by context, ranging from 10.5 to 11.5 cm. The assessment for reliability showed that length was difficult to measure, making WLZ the least reliable indicator overall. CONCLUSION: Evidence from our review suggests that a change in current practice is necessary. To better identify small and nutritionally at-risk infants <6 m WAZ and/or MUAC rather than WLZ should be used. Future research should explore possible benefits for programme coverage, impact and cost-effectiveness. Research should also examine if context-specific MUAC thresholds are needed.","output":"Anthropometric Criteria for Identifying Infants Under 6 Months of Age at Risk of Morbidity and Mortality: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many employees to work from home, and the magnitude of the shift to remote work is staggering Before the pandemic, about 15% of US employees were working from home at least some of the time During the first half of April, half of US employees were doing all of their work remotely Here, Sull et al discuss the challenges with remote work","output":"Five Ways Leaders Can Support Remote Work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its discovery in December 2019, COVID-19 has been an unprecedented global threat A massive collective scientific effort has been in place since the pandemic took off in order to put off its health threatening effects The aim of this work is to evaluate the potential nitric oxide as a candidate therapeutics that can be considered for fighting against the severe effects of COVID-19 The findings of this work provide valuable molecular understanding on how nitric oxide behaves in close contact with natural deep eutectic solvents and this work paves the way towards enhancing bioavailibity of nitric oxide via liquid infusion through natural deep eutectic solvents Nanoscopic explanation of nitric oxide interactions with L-Arginine based natural deep eutectic solvents are reported through findings obtained from density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations Structural characteristics of the studied systems and critical interaction patterns of nitric oxide within proposed carrier medium are the main focus of the presented work The results that are shared in this work can be considered fundamental scientific basis on increasing the mobility, availability and the accessibility of the nitric oxide, as it ameliorates pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary selectivity as well as improve cardiovascular health by providing protection against the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis in multiple proven ways","output":"A nanoscopic explanation of nitric oxide solubility in natural deep eutectic solvents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"D2 gastrectomy is now the globally accepted surgical standard for locally advanced gastric cancer.

Although the findings from the Intergroup 0116 study and the MAGIC trial were positive, recent studies, such as the ARTIST and EORTC 40954 studies, found no survival benefit for patients who had undergone D2 gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Regarding the adjuvant chemotherapy strategy, two pivotal phase III trials: the ACTS-GC and the CLASSIC, demonstrated the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy following D2 gastrectomy. However, more intensive chemotherapy is necessary to improve the survival rate.

However, there is no evidence for the expression of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles, which deliver neurotransmitter to synaptic cleft. The aim of this paper was to investigate the presence of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles purified from the rat brain and to study their possible involvement in vesicles life cycle. According to dynamic light scattering analysis, the antibody against extracellular domain (1-208) of 7 nAChR subunit inhibited synaptic vesicles clustering. Sandwich ELISA with nAChR subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of 42, 7 and 72nAChR subtypes in synaptic vesicles and showed that 7 and 2 nAChR subunits are co-localized with synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Pre-incubation with either 7-selective agonist PNU282987 or nicotine did not affect synaptic vesicles clustering but delayed their Ca(2+)-dependent fusion with the plasma membranes. In contrast, nicotine but not PNU282987 stimulated acidification of isolated synaptic vesicles, indicating that 42 but not 7-containing nAChRs are involved in regulation of proton influx and neurotransmitter refilling. Treatment of rats with levetiracetam, a specific modulator of SV2A, increased the content of 7 nAChRs in synaptic vesicles accompanied by increased clustering but decreased Ca(2+)-dependent fusion. These data for the first time demonstrate the presence of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles and suggest an active involvement of cholinergic regulation in neurotransmitter release. Synaptic vesicles may be an additional target of nicotine inhaled upon smoking and of 7-specific drugs widely discussed as anti-inflammatory and pro-cognitive tools.","output":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate clustering, fusion and acidification of the rat brain synaptic vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Substantial concern exists regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use behaviors. This is especially true for subpopulations like young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (YMSM-YTW) who report higher rates of substance use. This study examines changes in prevalence and frequency of marijuana and non-marijuana drug use among YMSM-YTW following the onset of the pandemic. METHOD: Data for this analysis (n = 458 participants, 1356 observations) come from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of YMSM-YTW. A series of Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine change in prevalence and frequency of use for marijuana and non-marijuana drugs. RESULTS: Results indicated no systematic change in prevalence or frequency of marijuana use. However, a decrease in non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 0.60, 95 % CrI: [0.37, 0.94]) following the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, a small increase in the frequency of non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 1.79, 95 % CrI: [1.02, 3.21]) among individuals who used these substances. CONCLUSIONS: These findings concur with a small number of studies identifying a decrease in drug use prevalence but increase in frequency among those who continue to use drugs. Despite the protective effect of lower drug use prevalence, higher frequency of use may lead to additional negative health outcomes of drug use, particularly among groups facing multiple health challenges such as YMSM-YTW.

Elective surgeries, visits with general practitioners, and diagnoses of medical emergencies were consequently delayed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of patients admitted to a northern Israeli hospital with common surgical complaints during three periods: the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and a regular period. METHODS: Demographic, medical, laboratory, imaging, intraoperative, and pathological data were collected from electronic medical files of patients who received emergency treatment at the surgery department of a single hospital in northern Israel. We retrospectively compared the characteristics of patients who were admitted with various conditions during three periods. RESULTS: Patients' mean age and most of the clinical parameters assessed were similar between the periods. However, pain was reportedly higher during the COVID-19 than the control period (8.7 vs. 6.4 on a 10-point visual analog scale, P < 0.0001). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War, and the regular period, the mean numbers of patients admitted daily were 1.4, 4.4, and 3.0, respectively. The respective mean times from the onset of symptoms until admission were 3, 1, and 1.5 days, P < 0.001. The respective proportions of surgical interventions for appendiceal disease were 95%, 96%, and 69%; P = 0.03.

We examined the mental health outcomes for older adults whose ability to be socially and physically active was reduced during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of Canadian residents aged 45C85 years, at CLSA baseline (2012C15), follow-up 1 (2018), COVID-19 baseline (AprilCMay, 2020), and COVID-19 exit surveys (SeptemberCDecember, 2020) were used. Participants were asked the degree to which their ability to participate in social and physical activity had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between the risk of a positive screen for depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score >10) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 score >10) and reduced participants' ability to participate in social and physical activity. Models were adjusted for age group, dwelling type, geographic area, household composition, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and smoking status at COVID-19 baseline; alcohol consumption at COVID-19 exit; and multimorbidity, physical activity, income, social participation, and diagnosis of anxiety or mood disorders before the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Of the 24 108 participants who completed the COVID-19 exit survey, 5219 (220%) screened positive for depression and 1132 (50%) screened positive for anxiety. Depression and anxiety were associated with a decreased ability to participate in social activity (odds ratio [OR] 185 [95% CI 167C204] for depression; 166 [137C202] for anxiety) and physical activity (246 [225C269] for depression; 196 [168C230] for anxiety). Interpretation Older adults whose ability to participate in social and physical activities was reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic had poorer mental health outcomes than those whose ability remained the same or improved. Individuals who had low pre-COVID-19 levels of social and physical activity had a higher frequency of positive depression and anxiety screens. These findings highlight the importance of fostering social and physical activity resources in advance of, and during, future lockdown measures.

In what Barad calls intra-action, the research apparatus, the researched phenomena,andthe research results, constitute a complex system of relatedness. In intra-action these elements never fully melt into one another, but rather, retain their ontological individuality.

Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecular-based diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.","output":"Emerging Technologies for the Detection of Rabies Virus: Challenges and Hopes in the 21st Century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pre-operative radiographic assessment of the anatomical relationship between the roots of the mandibular third molar and the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is a must to minimize the risk of IAN injury during surgery. OBJECTIVES: To compare the radiographic signs of digital orthopantomogram (OPG) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). An additional objective was to assess the cortex status between the mandibular canal and third molar on CBCT images in relation to the demographic characteristics, region (right or left side), and angulation of mandibular molar. METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective study, a total of 350 impacted mandibular third molars with a close relationship between the inferior alveolar canal (IAC) and impacted mandibular third molars on digital OPG were further referred for CBCT imaging for assessment of the position of the mandibular canal. The study was conducted between August 2018 and February 2020. Digital OPGs were evaluated for radiographic signs like interruption of the mandibular canal wall, darkening of the roots, diversion of the mandibular canal, and narrowing of the mandibular canal. The age and sex of patients, site of impacted third molar, Winter's classification of mandibular third molar, position of IAC relative to impacted molar, and the radiographic markers of OPG were assessed for cortical integrity using CBCT. Chi square testing was applied to study the values of difference and binomial logistic regression was done to assess the factors associated with cortication. Statistical significance was set at p  0.05. RESULTS: Among 350 patients, 207 (59.1%) were male and 143 (40.9%) were female with a mean age of 36.8 years. The most common OPG sign was interruption of white line, seen in 179 (51.1%) cases. In total, 246 cases (70.3%) showed an absence of canal cortication between the mandibular canal and the impacted third molar on CBCT images. Cortication was observed in all cases with a combination of panoramic signs which was statistically significant (p = 0.047). Cortication was observed in 85 (50.6%) cases where IAC was positioned on the buccal side, 11 (16.9%) in cases of inferiorly positioned IAC, and just 8 (7.6%) for cases of lingually positioned IAC which was statistically significant (p = 0.003). Statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) results were noted for cortex status in CBCT images with regards to the age, sex, site, and angulation of impacted third molars. CONCLUSION: CBCT imaging is highly recommended for those cases where diversion of the mandibular canal is observed on OPG and when the roots are present between canals.","output":"Comparison of Digital OPG and CBCT in Assessment of Risk Factors Associated with Inferior Nerve Injury during Mandibular Third Molar Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic mobilized the international scientific community in the search for its cure and containment. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of the rapid response to the COVID-19 of the scientific community in selected Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico) in the period running from January to August 2020. Rapid response is reconceptualized from its original meaning in health policy, as the swift mobilization of existing scientific resources to address an emergency (DeVita et al., 2017).Design/methodology/approachThe paper explores the rapid response of the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian and Mexican scientific communities from the perspective of bibliometric and altmetric data. The authors will examine scientific publications indexed to the Web of Science (WoS) dealing with COVID-19. Besides patterns of scientific output and impact as measured by citations, the authors complement the analysis with altmetric analysis. The aim is to verify whether or not factors that explain the extent of scientific impact can also be identified with respect to the wider impact made evident by altmetric indicators (Haustein, 2016).FindingsThe authors identified a somewhat limited response of the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian and Mexican scientific communities to COVID-19 in terms of quantity of publications. The authorship of publications in the topic of COVID-19 was associated with authorship of publications dealing with locally relevant diseases. Some factors appear to contribute to visibility of scientific outputs. Papers that involved wider international collaborations and authors with previous publications in arboviruses were associated with higher levels of citations. Previous work on arbovirus was also associated with higher altmetric attention. The country of origin of authors exerted a positive effect on altmetric indicators.Research limitations/implicationsA limitation in the analysis is that, due to the nature of the data source (WoS), the authors were unable to verify the career status and the productivity of the authors in the sample. Nonetheless, the results appear to suggest that there is some overlapping in authors conducting research in Arboviruses and COVID-19. Career status and productivity should be the focus of future research.Practical implicationsIn the context of countries with limited scientific resources, like the ones investigated in our Latin American sample, previous efforts in the study of locally relevant diseases may contribute to the creation of an expertise that can be applied when a health emergency brings about a novel disease.Originality/valueThe originality of the paper rests on the fact that the authors identified that previous work on arbovirus contributed to the scientific visibility of publications on COVID-19.","output":"The nature of rapid response to COVID-19 in Latin America: an examination of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a systemic infection that exerts a significant impact on cell metabolism.

Whether renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are beneficial or harmful is controversial. Methods: We have performed a national retrospective, nonexperimental comparative study from two tertiary hospitals to evaluate the impact of chronic use of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to strengthen our findings. Results: Of 849 patients, 422 (49.7%) patients were hypertensive and 310 (73.5%) were taking RAAS inhibitors at baseline. Hypertensive patients were older, had more comorbidities, and a greater incidence of respiratory failure (-0.151 [95% CI -0.218, -0.084]). Overall mortality in hypertensive patients was 28.4%, but smaller among those with prescribed RAAS inhibitors before (-0.167 [95% CI -0.220, -0.114]) and during hospitalization (0.090 [-0.008,0.188]). Similar findings were observed after two propensity score matches that evaluated the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers among hypertensive patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of hypertensive patients found that age, diabetes mellitus, C-reactive protein, and renal failure were independently associated with all-cause mortality. On the contrary, ACEIs decreased the risk of death (OR 0.444 [95% CI 0.224-0.881]). Meta-analysis suggested a protective benefit of RAAS inhibitors (OR 0.6 [95% CI 0.42-0.8]) among hypertensive COVID-19. Conclusion: Our data suggest that RAAS inhibitors may play a protective role in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. This finding was supported by a meta-analysis of the current evidence.

This study proposes a clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using CT features to automatically discriminate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: Overall, 612 patients (306 COVID-19 and 306 non-COVID-19 pneumonia) were recruited. Twenty radiological features were extracted from CT images to evaluate the pattern, location, and distribution of lesions of patients in both groups. All significant CT features were fed in five classifiers namely decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, na?ve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble to evaluate the best performing CAD system in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Location and distribution pattern of involvement, number of the lesion, ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features to classify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. Our proposed CAD system obtained the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.965, 93.54%, 90.32%, and 91.94%, respectively, using ensemble (COVIDiag) classifier. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposed a COVIDiag model obtained promising results using CT radiological routine features. It can be considered an adjunct tool by the radiologists during the current COVID-19 pandemic to make an accurate diagnosis. KEY POINTS: ?

BI 836880 is a humanized bispecific nanobody that targets VEGF and Ang2, and ezabenlimab (BI 754091) is an anti-PD-1 antibody. Phase I studies investigating each as monotherapies have reported safety and preliminary antitumor activity. This ongoing Phase Ib study is evaluating the combination of BI 836880 and ezabenlimab in pts with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1 (dose escalation), the combination was feasible in pts with advanced NSCLC, with a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 836880 720 mg + ezabenlimab 240 mg IV q3w. Here, we report updated results from Part 2 (expansion phase), which is assessing the antitumor activity and safety of the RP2D. Methods: Seven cohorts are currently recruiting pts in Part 2: metastatic (m) NSCLC after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) monotherapy (Cohort A);mNSCLC after chemotherapy (CT) + CPI (Cohort B);mSCLC after CT  CPI (Cohort C);1 and 2nd recurrences of glioblastoma (GBM;Cohort D);immunotherapy-resistant mmelanoma (Cohort E);hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after prior sorafenib or lenvatinib  CPI (Cohort F);and previously untreated/unresectable HCC (Cohort G). Primary endpoint is objective response rate (complete response + partial response [PR]). Results: As of January 2021, 196 pts have received BI 836880 plus ezabenlimab (14 in Part 1, 182 in Part 2 [Cohort A, 26;B, 30;C, 19;D, 31;E, 32;F, 28;G, 16]). 134 (68%) pts were male, median age was 63 years and 102 (52%) had prior CPI use. Any grade and G3 adverse events (AEs;any cause) were reported by 160 (82%) and 62 (32%) pts, most commonly (all%/ G3%) hypertension (20/8), asthenia (20/3), diarrhea, decreased appetite, and nausea (all 11/1). 95 (48%) pts had a drug-related AE, most commonly hypertension and asthenia (both 11%). 6 pts had a G4 AE (non-related: hyperkalemia + cardiac arrest, laryngospasm, gastrointestinal perforation;drug-related: anaphylactic reaction, acute pancreatitis, transaminases increased);8 pts had a G5 AE (non-related: general physical health deterioration, epilepsy, hemoptysis, cardiorespiratory arrest, hepatic failure, intracranial hemorrhage, COVID-19 pneumonia;drugrelated tracheal hemorrhage). 30 (15%) pts had immune-related AEs (3% G3), including hypothyroidism (3%). 11 (6%) pts had an AE leading to discontinuation. Overall, 145 pts were evaluable for response: 9 pts achieved confirmed PR (2 pts in Part 1 and 7 in Part 2 [NSCLC, n = 3;SCLC, n = 1;GBM, n = 1;melanoma, n = 1;and 2 -line HCC, n = 1]), 87 pts had stable disease and 49 pts had progressive disease. 111 pts remain on treatment.

However, the precise mechanism of MHV persistence in the CNS remains elusive. Here we show that the progenitor oligodendrocytes (central glial 4 [CG-4] cells) derived from newborn rat brain were permissive to MHV infection, which resulted in cell death, although viral replication was restricted. Interestingly, treatment with fetal bovine serum or exogenous expression of cellular oncogene Bcl-xL prevented CG-4 cells from MHV-induced cell death. Significantly, overexpression of Bcl-xL alone was sufficient to convert acute to persistent, nonproductive infection in CG-4 cells. This finding indicates that intracellular factors rather than viral components play a critical role in establishing viral persistence in CNS cells. Although viral genomic RNAs continuously persisted in Bcl-xL-expressing CG-4 cells over 10 passages, infectious virus could no longer be isolated beyond 2 passages of the cell. Such a phenomenon resembles the persistent MHV infection in animal CNS. Thus, the establishment of a persistent, nonproductive infection in CG-4 cells may provide a useful in vitro model for studying viral persistence in animal CNS. The data also suggest that direct virus-host cell interaction is one of the underlying mechanisms that regulate viral persistence in CNS cells.","output":"Expression of cellular oncogene Bcl-xL prevents coronavirus-induced cell death and converts acute infection to persistent infection in progenitor rat oligodendrocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After-school programs provide a range of support for students.

METHODS: Original data were analyzed from a cross-sectional online survey of 590 teens in grades 6-12 attending school remotely in 35 US states, in May/June 2020. RESULTS: Students reported waking up 2.1-2.9 hours later during school closures and averaged 7.9-8.7 hours of sleep and 8.6-9.5 hours in bed on school nights. Compared to middle schoolers, high school students had later bed and wake times, accompanied by spending less time in bed and less time sleeping. The delay in wake time after school closures was also longer for high school students than for middle schoolers. Students with later class start times went to bed later, but also woke up later, slept longer, and spent more time in bed. When comparing intraindividual sleep before and after school closures, later class start times resulted in greater delays in wake time and greater odds of increased sleep duration. In addition, parent-set bedtimes were associated with earlier bedtimes and longer sleep duration during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of COVID-19-related school closures and remote instruction, more middle and high school students achieved recommended amounts of sleep, primarily by waking up later in the morning.

To carry it out, a cross-sectional and perception-based epidemiological research design was used, and the primary tool used for data collection was a questionnaire. Two hundred twenty-eight people participated in the survey, and a pulmonary function test (PFT) was performed on 63 participants. Most of the respondents from different occupational groups complained about headaches/giddiness, nausea, and muscular cramps during extreme heat events due to the physically demanding nature of their jobs in the outdoor environment. Furthermore, autorickshaw drivers reported the highest prevalence of ophthalmic symptoms, such as eye redness (44%) and eye irritation (36%). In comparison, vendors reported a higher prevalence of headaches (43%) and eye redness (40%) due to increased exposure to vehicular emissions. Among sweepers, musculoskeletal problems like joint pain (40%), backache (38%), and shoulder pain (35%) were most prevalent due to occupation-related ergonomic factors. In addition, the majority of autorickshaw drivers (47%), vendors (47%), and sweepers (48%) considered that air quality had a severe impact on their health. PFT results showed that most respondents had restricted lung function. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that lung function impairment had a significant association with smoking (p = 0.023) and age (0.019).

The Gambia study site contributed a high child mortality, high pneumonia incidence, low HIV prevalence, Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines-vaccinated rural West African setting to the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) Study. METHODS: The PERCH study was a 7-country case-control study of the etiology of hospitalized severe pneumonia in children 1C59 months of age in low and middle-income countries. Culture and nucleic acid detection methods were used to test nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, blood, induced sputum and, in selected cases, lung or pleural fluid aspirates. Etiology was determined by integrating case and control data from multiple specimens using the PERCH integrated analysis based on Bayesian probabilistic methods. RESULTS: At The Gambia study site, 638 cases of World Health Organization-defined severe and very severe pneumonia (286 of which were chest radiograph [CXR]-positive and HIV-negative) and 654 age-frequency matched controls were enrolled. Viral causes predominated overall (viral 58% vs. bacterial 28%), and of CXR-positive cases respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 37%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 13% and parainfluenza was responsible for 9%. Nevertheless, among very severe cases bacterial causes dominated (77% bacterial vs. 11% viral), led by S. pneumoniae (41%); Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not included in bacterial, accounted for 9%. 93% and 80% of controls 1 year of age were, respectively, fully vaccinated for age against Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Viral causes, notably RSV, predominated in The Gambia overall, but bacterial causes dominated the severest cases.

Methods: Using a random-assignment (1:1), intent-to-treat, 2-site, quadruple-masked, parallel-group (metformin to 2,000 mg/d or placebo) clinical trial design, patients with DSM-5 bipolar disorder (BD) type I or II and IR received study medication for 26 weeks (February 2016 to October 2019). The primary outcome was the change in depression rating scores (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) at 14 weeks between those who no longer met IR criteria (converters) and those who still did (non-converters). Additional outcomes included scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF); the Clinical Global Impressions Scale, Bipolar Disorders version (CGI-BP); and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and maintenance of improved outcomes up to 26 weeks. Results: Forty-five BD patients were randomized to metformin (n = 20) or placebo (n = 25), and at 14 weeks or later, 11 subjects no longer met IR criteria (n = 10 with metformin, n = 1 with placebo; P = .0009). These converters experienced significant improvements in MADRS (P values ranged from .031 to .008) and GAF (P values ranged from .045 to .008) scores compared to non-converters beginning at week 6, sustained to week 26. HAM-A (P = .022 at week 14 and .019 at week 26) and CGI-BP change scores (P = .046 at 26 weeks) significantly favored converters over non-converters. Effect sizes were large for the MADRS and GAF (Cohen d > 1 at 14 and 26 weeks) and large for the HAM-A and CGI-BP at 26 weeks. Transient gastrointestinal side effects occurred under both treatment conditions. Conclusions: Pending replication, this early study suggests that reversal of IR by metformin offers a path out of TRBD. Further characterization of metformin converters with TRBD will prove informative.

Excisional procedures can pose a risk for subsequent pregnancies, thus conservative management of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) lesions should be adopted in young women. The aim of our study is to evaluate the ability of viral and cellular biomarkers in predicting regression/progression of CIN2. Methods: Women aged 25 to 45 years, participating to population-based organised cervical cancer screening programmes in the Veneto Region (Italy), diagnosed with a CIN2 lesion and fitting predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, are invited to take part in a multicentre observational longitudinal cohort study with a follow-up of 24 months. Upon signing an informed consent, women are enrolled in the study and cervical cell samples collected. Treatment is delayed and subsequently performed in the case of lesion progression, or persistence for >12 months. HPV genotyping, p16(INK4A)/ki67 expression and methylation status for L1 viral sequences and FAM19A4/miR124-2 cellular genes are determined at baseline and during follow-up, and evaluated in relation to the clinical outcome.

METHODS: Here, we tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (SARS-CoV-2-Exp), with or without symptoms. RESULTS: Post-vaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5-18 days after the first dose compared to na?ve subjects (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those that voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain and fever significantly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all a/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose. CONCLUSION: Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrookes hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.","output":"Balancing scarce hospital resources during the COVID-19 pandemic using discrete-event simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the approximate linear relationship between muscle force and muscle activity, muscle forces are often estimated during maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) from torque and surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements. However, sEMG recordings from a target muscle may contain cross-talk originating from nearby muscles, which could lead to erroneous force estimates. Here we used ultrasound imaging to measure in vivo muscle fascicle length (Lf) changes and sEMG to measure muscle activity of the tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles during ramp MVICs in plantar and dorsiflexion directions (n = 8). After correcting longitudinal Lf changes for ankle rotation, the antagonist Lf at peak antagonist root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude were significantly longer than the agonist Lf at this sEMG-matched level. On average, Lf shortened from resting length by 1.29 to 2.90 mm when muscles acted as agonists and lengthened from resting length by 0.43 to 1.16 mm when muscles acted as antagonists (depending on the muscle of interest). The lack of fascicle shortening when muscles acted as antagonists indicates that cocontraction was likely to be negligible, despite cocontraction as determined by sEMG of between 7 and 23% MVIC across all muscles. Different interelectrode distances (IEDs) over the plantar flexors revealed significantly higher antagonist RMS amplitudes for the 4-cm IEDs compared with the 2-cm IEDs, which further indicates that cross-talk was present. Consequently, investigators should be wary about performing agonist torque corrections for isometric plantar flexion and dorsiflexion based on the antagonist sEMG trace and predicted antagonist moment.","output":"Ultrasound reveals negligible cocontraction during isometric plantar flexion and dorsiflexion despite the presence of antagonist electromyographic activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Fragmented QRS (fQRS) results from myocardial scarring and predicts cardiovascular mortality and ventricular arrhythmia (VA). We evaluated the prevalence and prognostic value of fQRS in Asian patients hospitalized for heart failure. Methods and Results: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized for heart failure between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2016 at a tertiary center in Hong Kong. The baseline ECG was analyzed. QRS complexes (<120 ms) with fragmented morphology in 2 contiguous leads were defined as fQRS. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, VA, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The secondary outcomes were the components of the primary outcome, myocardial infarction, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. In total, 2,182 patients were included, of whom 179 (8.20%) had fQRS. The follow-up duration was 5.63  4.09 years. fQRS in any leads was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.428 [1.097, 1.859], p = 0.001), but not myocardial infarction or new-onset atrial fibrillation. fQRS in >2 contiguous leads was an independent predictor of SCD (HR 2.679 [1.252, 5.729], p = 0.011). In patients without ischaemic heart disease (N = 1,396), fQRS in any leads remained predictive of VA and SCD (adjusted HR 3.526 [1.399, 8.887], p = 0.008, and 1.873 [1.103, 3.181], p = 0.020, respectively), but not cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 1.064 [0.671, 1.686], p = 0.792).

CT data was retrospectively used to create fusion images of pre-RFA and post-RFA CT using automatic rigid registration and manual correction referring to intrahepatic structures and hepatic contours around a tumor. Clinical factors including a minimal ablative margin (MAM) measured on fusion images were examined to prove risk factors for local tumor progression (LTP).

METHODS: Participants included 8,003 adults from the address-based sampled, nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS), surveyed at regular intervals between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2021 who completed at least two waves of the survey. Respondents answered questions about COVID-19 vaccine status and self-reported mental distress as measured with the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4).

Depression hurts birth outcomes and maternal health. OBJECTIVE: To assess depression and its associated factors among HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal care at Northwest Amhara referral hospitals, 2021. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 291 HIV-positive pregnant mothers from March 15, 2021 to April 30, 2021 at Northwest Amhara referral hospitals. Census was applied to reach the study participants. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. A binary logistic regression was conducted to see the relationship between dependent variables and independent. Those variables having a p-value of 0.05 were found to be statistically associated with the response. RESULTS: Depression among HIV-positive pregnant women was found to be 28.7% [95% CI (24.8C33.40)] with a response rate of 96.04. Age 30 years [AOR = 1.32, 95% CI (1.24C3.35)], urban residency [AOR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.57C4.61)], having first pregnancy <18 years [AOR = 3.82, 95% CI (1.54C17.34)], known HIV serostatus during pregnancy [AOR = 1.29, 95% CI (1.08C2.47)], and COVID-19-related knowledge [AOR = 0.32, 95% CI (0.12C1.12) were significantly associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Nearly one-third of the pregnant women attending antenatal care were depressed. The age of the mother, residence, known HIV serostatus during pregnancy, age in the first pregnancy, and COVID-19-related knowledge were significantly associated with depression, and strengthening the existing care provided was the recalled interventions to combat antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Depression Among HIV-Positive Pregnant Women at Northwest Amhara Referral Hospitals During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the greater New York metropolitan area became an epicenter for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The initial evolution of case incidence has not been well characterized. METHODS: Northwell Health Laboratories tested 46,793 persons for SARS-CoV-2 from March 4 through April 10. The primary outcome measure was a positive reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. The secondary outcomes included patient age, sex, and race if stated; dates the specimen was obtained and the test result; clinical practice site sources; geo-location of patient residence; and hospitalization. RESULTS: From March 8 through April 10, a total of 26,735 of 46,793 persons (57.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Males of each race were disproportionally more affected than females above age 25, with a progressive male predominance as age increased. Of the positive persons, 7,292 were hospitalized directly upon presentation; an additional 882 persons tested positive in an ambulatory setting before subsequent hospitalization, a median of 4.8 days later. Total hospitalization rate was thus 8,174 persons (30.6% of positive persons). There was a broad range (greater than 10-fold) in the cumulative number of positive cases across individual zip codes following documented first case incidents. Test positivity was greater for persons living in zip codes with lower annual household income. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 incidence emerged rapidly and almost simultaneously across a broad demographic population in the region. These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection was widely distributed prior to virus testing availability.","output":"Rapid Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Greater New York Metropolitan Area: Geolocation, Demographics, Positivity Rates, and Hospitalization for 46,793 Persons Tested by Northwell Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 brought the global tourism industry to a standstill In response, various tourism stakeholders adopted innovative approaches such as virtual tours (VTs) to keep their attractions firmly in the minds of potential visitors This study has integrated the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) models to determine the factors that affect a person?s decision to adopt VTs as temporary alternatives during times of crises Data were collected from a sample of 401 respondents after they had experienced at least one of the VTs simulating Egyptian heritage sites The results show that the antecedents of the TAM and PADM models are effective in predicting users? intention to adopt VTs and that adoption intention has a positive impact on the tendency to visit the actual site In addition, practical implications are provided for site managers to consider when opting for VTs as a promotional tool or as an alternative product during times of crisis","output":"Virtual Tours a Means to an End: An Analysis of Virtual Tours Role in Tourism Recovery Post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Caveolin family proteins, including caveolin-1 (Cav-1), caveolin-2 (Cav-2), and caveolin-3 (Cav-3), are identified as the principal protein components of caveolae in mammalian cells. Circulating form of caveolin family proteins can be used as a good potential biomarker for predicting disease. METHODS To investigate the clinical significance of the serological levels of caveolin family proteins in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we evaluated the soluble serum levels of caveolin family proteins in patients with SLE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and assessed their associations with various known clinical variables. RESULTS The major findings of our study are as follows: Cav-2 was not detected in serum of SLE patients and normal controls (NCs). Serum Cav-1 and Cav-3 levels were higher in SLE patients compared with NCs. There were no significant correlations between serum Cav-1 and Cav-3 levels and SLE disease activity. Further analysis showed that serum Cav-3 may be more valuable as a marker than serum Cav-1 in SLE patients.

With the pulmonary inflammation accompanying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), patients experience significant alterations in ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) ratios resulting in lower blood oxygenation. In severe cases, patients are typically rotated into a prone position to facilitate improved blood flow to portions of the lung that were not previously participating in the gas exchange process. However, proning a patient increases the risk of complications, requires up to seven hospital staff members to carry out, and does not guarantee an improvement in the patient's condition. The low-cost V/Q vest presented here was designed to reproduce the effects of proning while also requiring less hospital staff than the proning process. Additionally, the V/Q Vest helps hospital staff predict whether patients would respond well to a proning treatment. A pilot study was conducted on nine patients with ARDS from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The average increase in oxygenation with the V/Q Vest treatment for all patients was 19.7 +/- 38.1%. Six of the nine patients responded positively to the V/Q Vest treatment, exhibiting increased oxygenation. The V/Q Vest also helped hospital staff predict that three of the five patients that were proned would experience an increase in oxygenation.

Understanding the root cause of the instability of these vaccines may help to rationally improve mRNA-LNP product stability and thereby ease the temperature conditions for storage. In this review we discuss proposed structures of mRNA-LNPs, factors that impact mRNA-LNP stability and strategies to optimize mRNA-LNP product stability. Analysis of mRNA-LNP structures reveals that mRNA, the ionizable cationic lipid and water are present in the LNP core. The neutral helper lipids are mainly positioned in the outer, encapsulating, wall. mRNA hydrolysis is the determining factor for mRNA-LNP instability. It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with the mRNA and to what extent the degradation prone sites of mRNA are protected through a coat of ionizable cationic lipids. To improve the stability of mRNA-LNP vaccines, optimization of the mRNA nucleotide composition should be prioritized. Secondly, a better understanding of the milieu the mRNA is exposed to in the core of LNPs may help to rationalize adjustments to the LNP structure to preserve mRNA integrity.

METHODS: At the Department of Otolaryngology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan (Italy), from December 2016 to October 2020, 14 patients underwent trans-nasal balloon-assisted dacryoplasty after a failed dacryocystorhinostomy (both external and endoscopic endonasal). The routinary pre-operative work-up included multidisciplinary study of the lacrimal disease, which consisted in primary ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological visits associated with nasal endoscopy, in which a radiological exam was added if needed. The surgical approach includes pneumatic enlargement of the stenotic rhinostomy, created during the primary dacryocystorhinostomy, using a high-pressure trans-nasal balloon catheter. Anatomical success was considered when the ostium was patent upon irrigation, while functional success was considered as resolution of epiphora or free lacrimal flow on functional test. RESULTS: Among 14 patients included and after a mean follow-up of 19.5 months (range 13C51 months), anatomic success was achieved in 100% of patients and functional success was achieved in the 85.7% (12/14). Operative time ranged from 9 to 28 min (mean 18 min) and no complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Trans-nasal balloon-assisted dacryoplasty is a mini-invasive surgical approach to treat failed dacryocystorhinostomies with reliable and stable outcomes in the long term.

In March 2020, the Australian Government introduced telehealth services to ensure that people more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not delay routine care from their general practitioners. Evidence about patients' experience of telehealth and its impact on patient care is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the experience with telehealth by Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients from nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide (May-June 2020). Participants were identified by their regular doctor as being at high risk of poor health outcomes. Interviews sought participants' perspectives and experiences about telehealth services in the general practice setting during COVID-19, and the value of offering continued telehealth services post pandemic. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a coding structure developed based on deductive codes derived from the research questions and any additional concepts that emerged inductively from interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed satisfaction with telehealth including convenient and timely access to general practice services. Yet, participants identified challenges including difficulties in expressing themselves and accessing physical exams. Prescription renewal, discussing test results and simple follow-ups were the most common reasons that telehealth was used. Telehealth was mainly via phone that better suited those with low digital literacy. Participants indicated that an existing doctor-patient relationship was important for telehealth services to be effective. Subjects believed that telehealth services should be continued but needed to be combined with opportunities for face-to-face consultations after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of telehealth supported access to general practice including chronic disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this review, we further comment on the design strategies for multiple innovative applications of living functional biofilms. With the integration of signaling pathways, engineering of metabolic pathways and modification of extracellular polymeric substances, living functional biofilms have been constructed by researchers through various strategies. Functional biofilms for diverse applications, including catalysis, electric conduction, bioremediation, and medical therapy have been demonstrated in the literature. The mechanical properties of biofilms can be tuned through genetic editing, metal ion curing and synthetic gene circuits, etc. In addition, the improvement of 3D printing to use bioinks has also achieved significant progresses in fabricating living functional biofilms with specific structures.

Optimal techniques to minimize complications remain controversial. Here, we report a retrospective review of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant User Files (PUF) database, comparing outcomes between revision RBS and LBS. METHODS: The 2015 and 2016 MBSAQIP PUF database was retrospectively reviewed. Revision cases were identified using the Revision/Conversion Flag. Selected cases were further stratified by surgical approach. Subgroup analysis of sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass cases was performed. CaseCcontrolled matching (1:1) was performed of the RBS and LBS cohorts, including gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts separately. Cases and controls were match by demographics, ASA classification, and preoperative comorbidities. RESULTS: 26,404 revision cases were identified (93.3% LBS, 6.7% RBS). 85.6% were female and 67% white. Mean age and BMI were 48 years and 40.9 kg/m(2). 1144 matched RBS and LBS cases were identified. RBS was associated with longer operative duration (p < 0.0001), LOS (p = 0.0002) and a higher rate of ICU admissions (1.3% vs 0.5%, p = 0.05). Aggregate bleeding and leak rates were higher in the RBS cohort. In both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts, the robotic-assisted surgery remain associated with longer operative duration (p < 0.0001). In gastric bypass, rates of aggregate leak and bleeding were higher with robotic surgery, while transfusion was higher with laparoscopy. For sleeve gastrectomy cases, reoperation, readmission, intervention, sepsis, organ space SSI, and transfusion were higher with robotic surgery. CONCLUSION: In this matched cohort analysis of revision bariatric surgery, both approaches were overall safe. RBS was associated with longer operative duration and higher rates of some complications. Complications were higher in the robotic sleeve cohort. Robotic is likely less cost-effective with no clear patient safety benefit, particularly for sleeve gastrectomy cases.","output":"Outcomes in conventional laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted revisional bariatric surgery: a retrospective, caseCcontrolled study of the MBSAQIP database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 771,000 deaths worldwide.

Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of smoking on the clinical manifestations, disease progression, inflammatory responses, immunopathogenesis, racial ethnic disparities, and incidence of COVID-19. This review also documents future directions of smoking related research in COVID-19. The current epidemiological finding suggests that active smoking is associated with an increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Smoking can upregulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cell and activate a cytokine storm which can lead to worsen outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This receptor can also act as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic sheds light on a legacy of inequalities regarding gender, racial, and ethnic health disparities associated with active smoking, thus, smoking cessation may help in improving outcomes.

These barriers impact sex workers ability and desire to routinely engage with the healthcare system. Community empowerment interventions that are culturally safe offer an effective strategy to improve access to services and health outcomes for sex workers. OBJECTIVES: This project was designed to inform the development of community empowerment interventions for sex workers by understanding their self-management, health promotion, and harm reduction needs. METHODS: In-depth interviews (N = 21) were conducted with sex workers in Chicago. Transcripts of individual interviews were analyzed in Dedoose using rapid content analysis. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 32.7 years; 45% identified as White, 20% as Black, 15% as Latinx, and 20% as multiple races; 80% identified as Queer. A total of 52% of participants identified as cisgender women, 33% as transgender or gender fluid, 10% as cisgender men, and 5% declined to answer. Themes of self-management practices, stigmatizing and culturally unsafe experiences with healthcare providers, and the prohibitive cost of healthcare emerged as consistent barriers to routinely accessing healthcare. Despite identifying patient-centered care as a desired healthcare model, many participants did not report receiving care that was respectful or culturally responsive. Themes also included developing strategies to identify sex worker-safe care providers, creating false self-narratives and health histories in order to safely access care, and creating self-care routines that serve as alternatives to primary care. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate how patient-centered care for sex-workers in Chicago might include holistic wellness exercises, accessible pay scales for services, and destigmatizing healthcare praxis. Focus on culturally safe healthcare provision presents needs beyond individualized, or even community-level, interventions.

Amidst intersecting crises of COVID-19, racism, and police brutality, this report describes survey development and data collection procedures for the SHUR. BASIC PROCEDURES: We conducted focus groups with Black men, Latinxs, and immigrants in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Findings were used to develop and refine measures of conditions salient to the health of urban residents across the country. Quota sampling was employed; oversampling people of color and persons whose usual source of care was not a doctors office. MAIN FINDINGS: Non-Hispanic Whites made up just under two thirds of the sample (63.65%, n = 2793). Black/African American respondents accounted for 14.2% of the sample (n = 623), while 11.62% (n = 510) were Latinx. Only 43.46% of respondents reported a doctors office as their usual source of care. Novel measures of population-specific stressors include a range of negative encounters with the police, frequency of these encounters, and respondents assessments of whether the encounters were necessary. SHUR assessed the likelihood of calling the police if there is a problem, worries about incarceration, and cause-specific stressors such as race-related impression management.

However, liking can be influenced by mood, with people feeling more uncomfortable, or more unhappy reporting lower liking ratings than those in a higher affect. Though consumer testing typically takes place as a central location test (CLT, usually in a set of standardized sensory booths), the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has resulted in a global pivot to home use tests (HUTs), where panelists can taste and smell samples unmasked more safely while in their own homes. Unfortunately, as this situation differs in many ways to a central location test, this puts the validity of longitudinal comparisons of liking scores under question. Further, as people across the globe report feelings of worry, unease, and stress during the pandemic, this may present a second source of variation in affect with previous years. We tested a set of snack bar samples both at home and in a central location, in repeated measures with the same panel, to test the validity of comparisons across locations. We further compared CLT results to those when testing the same samples in a previous year. Finally, we performed a meta\\\\analysis of existing data on this subject. While liking behavior in CLTs did not differ between years, panelists rated some samples higher when in their own homes, in line with results from the meta\\\\analysis of previous reports. Interestingly, panelists in the study also assigned fewer penalties in the HUT, implying a less analytical mindset when in the home. Results suggest that care should be taken when comparing results taken at home during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic to those taken previously in a central location. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Consumer testing is applied in the food industry to evaluate a panelist's liking for a food product or stimulus. However, liking is also dependent on factors extrinsic to the samples tested. Thus, with the switch to in\\\\home testing due to COVID\\\\19, we compared liking scores from in\\\\home and central locations testing, with higher scores common in HUTs.","output":"On the validity of longitudinal comparisons of central location consumer testing results prior to COVID\\\\19 versus home use testing data during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an initiative to rapidly transition to a telebehavioral health (TBH) service delivery model was developed to maintain access to primary care behavioral health (PCBH) services at Geisinger, a predominantly rural health system based in Central Pennsylvania.

Vitamin K deficiency result in the failure of the matrix GLA protein (MGP) to undergo carboxylation. MGP is a natural local inhibitor of vascular calcification and the lack of functional carboxylated MGP may contribute to increase vascular calcification. Vitamin K supplement should therefore correct this anomaly and decrease the rate or severity of vascular calcification in this population of patients on long-term maintenance hemodialysis. Our study seeks to evaluate the prevalence and the progression of vascular calcification in a cohort of maintenance hemodialysis patients. It will also evaluate the efficacy of vitamin K supplementation in reducing the progression of vascular calcification in this group of patients. METHODS: This will be a single-center randomized, prospective and open-label interventional clinical trial of end stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis. We aim to recruit 200 patients. Eligible patients will be randomized to either the standard care arm or active treatment arm. Active treatment arm patients will receive standard care plus supplementation with oral vitamin K2 isoform 360 mcg 3 times weekly for a total duration of 18 months. Primary outcome measured will be absolute difference in coronary artery calcification score at 18-month between control and intervention arms. Secondary outcomes will be to compare absolute difference in aortic valve calcification, percentage of patients with regression of coronary artery calcification of at least 10%, absolute difference in aortic and systemic arterial stiffness, mortality from any cause and major adverse cardiovascular over the same period.

This study explores a specific phenotype of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI), and its associations with escalation of respiratory support and survival. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive inpatients (aged 18 years) admitted to University College London Hospitals and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals in the UK with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of community-acquired infection. Demographic data, laboratory tests, and clinical status were recorded from the day of admission until death or discharge, with a minimum follow-up time of 28 days. We defined COV-HI as a C-reactive protein concentration greater than 150 mg/L or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or a ferritin concentration greater than 1500 g/L. Respiratory support was categorised as oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation. Initial and repeated measures of hyperinflammation were evaluated in relation to the next-day risk of death or need for escalation of respiratory support (as a combined endpoint), using a multi-level logistic regression model. FINDINGS: We included 269 patients admitted to one of the study hospitals between March 1 and March 31, 2020, among whom 178 (66%) were eligible for escalation of respiratory support and 91 (34%) patients were not eligible. Of the whole cohort, 90 (33%) patients met the COV-HI criteria at admission. Despite having a younger median age and lower median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, a higher proportion of patients with COV-HI on admission died during follow-up (36 [40%] of 90 patients) compared with the patients without COV-HI on admission (46 [26%] of 179). Among the 178 patients who were eligible for full respiratory support, 65 (37%) met the definition for COV-HI at admission, and 67 (74%) of the 90 patients whose respiratory care was escalated met the criteria by the day of escalation. Meeting the COV-HI criteria was significantly associated with the risk of next-day escalation of respiratory support or death (hazard ratio 224 [95% CI 162C287]) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. INTERPRETATION: Associations between elevated inflammatory markers, escalation of respiratory support, and survival in people with COVID-19 indicate the existence of a high-risk inflammatory phenotype.

However, in our survey (N = 9571) conducted in five advanced Asian economies during the outbreak of COVID\\\\19, we found that COVID\\\\19 vulnerability was positively associated with support for immigration. Drawing on insight from policy feedback theories, we propose that the positive association is caused by the presence of widespread border crossing restrictions, which have changed the meaning and cost implications of COVID\\\\19. As the outbreak expands, the pandemic has become not just a threat to people's health but also a barrier to globalization. Consequently, people who are worried about the disease may see globalization processes, including migration, as signs of pandemic relief. We find supportive evidence in our analysis. First, the positive association between COVID\\\\19 vulnerability and support for immigration is more salient among respondents who considered restrictions on international travel to be stringent. Second, the positive association between COVID\\\\19 vulnerability and immigration attitude was mediated by perceived economic threat from the pandemic and contribution by immigrants towards the containment of the pandemic.

Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection cause changes in the normal physiological state of the gastrointestinal (GI) flora. Although the physiological state of the GI tract is closely related to mental disorders, few population studies have examined the relationship between H pylori infection and depressive symptoms in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine whether H pylori infection is related to depressive symptoms among the general adult population. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional study included 5558 inhabitants of Tianjin, China. H pylori infection was diagnosed with the carbon 13 breath test. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Chinese version of 20-item Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) with three cutoffs (45, 48, and 50) to indicate elevated depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to assess the association between H pylori infection and depressive symptoms. RESULTS The prevalence of depressive symptoms (SDS  45) was 12.7% in men and 17.4% in women. In multivariable models, the odds ratios and 95% confidence interval of having depressive symptoms by H pylori infection were 1.25 (1.01-1.56), 1.46 (1.11-1.91), and 1.46 (1.05-2.06) for three cutoffs: 45, 48, and 50 in women.

The rapid viral spread has made the disease a public health emergency of worldwide concern. The gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is reverse transcription followed by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); however, the role of viral load quantification has not been thoroughly investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a high-precision quantitative one-step RT-qPCR reaction using the association of the viral target and the human target in the same reaction. METHODS: The assay standardization involved the absolute quantification method, with serial dilutions of a plasmid with the N gene in a biological matrix to build a standard curve. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated the possibility of quantifying as few as 2.5 copies/reaction and an analysis of 244 patients with known results selected by cross-section that revealed 100% agreement with a qualitative RT-qPCR assay registered by Anvisa. In this population, it was possible to quantify patients with between 2.59 and 3.5  107 copies per reaction and negative patients continued to indicate the same result. CONCLUSION: This assay can be a useful tool for a proper patient management, because the level and duration of viral replication are important factors to assess the risk of transmission and to guide decisions regarding the isolation and release of patients; an accurate diagnosis is critical information, whereas the current COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest current global health problem.","output":"Development of a quantitative one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a biological matrix"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDHyponatremia is a frequent electrolytic disorder in hospitalized patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Participant demographics and responses were tabulated, and independent sample t-tests as well as multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of demographic characteristics, prior online learning experience, and orientation with students perspectives on the online learning experience. RESULTS: Among 118,030 medical students participated in the survey (response rate 52.4%), 99,559 provided valid data for the analysis. The sample is fairly nationally representative. 65.7% (65,389/99,559) supported great orientation and 62.1% (61,818/99,559) reported that they were satisfied with the ongoing online-learning experience. The most common problem students would encounter was the network congestion (76,277/99,559; 76.6%). Demographics, learning phases, and academic performance were associated with online-learning engagement and perceptions. Formal orientation and prior PU (perceived usefulness of online learning) were significantly positively associated with the satisfaction and evaluation of the online learning experience (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this national survey indicates a relatively positive role of online learning as a formal teaching/learning approach in medical education. Considerations should be made regarding such application in aspects of students different learning phases. We suggest that further policy interventions should be taken from technological, organizational, environmental, as well as individual aspects, to help improve the outcome of online learning for future doctors.","output":"Students initial perspectives on online learning experience in China during the COVID-19 outbreak: expanding online education for future doctors on a national scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Clinically depressed patients without substance use disorders, compared to controls, exhibit significantly lower resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, we examined the link between resting rCBF in the PFC and current depressive symptoms in methadone-maintained opiate-dependent (MM) patients with or without major depression. METHODS Arterial spin labeled perfusion fMRI at 3 Tesla was used to measure resting rCBF in 21 MM patients. Perfusion data were analyzed using SPM2. The relationship between Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score and resting rCBF was examined in a single regression analysis. RESULTS The BDI scores ranged between 0 and 18 (m=7.0, S.D.=4.8), and 30% of the sample had mild to moderate depression symptoms according to BDI scores. A negative correlation was observed between BDI scores and relative rCBF in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle frontal gyri. CONCLUSIONS The inverse relationship between prefrontal paralimbic rCBF and depression scores suggests a link between reduced fronto-limbic activity and depressive symptoms in MM patients. A significant subgroup of opiate-dependent patients has clinical or sub-clinical depression that is often undetected; our data identify brain substrates of depression symptoms that may also be a potential marker of relapse in this population. Treatment strategies targeting these brain regions may improve outcomes in depressed substance abusers.","output":"Low prefrontal perfusion linked to depression symptoms in methadone-maintained opiate-dependent patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sitting in front of computers has become a major part of our workaday routines, challenging us in maintaining active and healthy lifestyles This challenge becomes even more salient during this worldwide work-from-home period due to COVID-19 While a wide variety of existing interactive systems have been developed to facilitate health tracking and healthy exercises, relatively little research concerns incorporating healthy behaviors as HCI elements To maximize pervasive health benefits in users' technology routines, this workshop sets out to explore a design paradigm that enables users to use lightweight, healthy behaviors to perform daily interactions with computing systems To navigate this new design space, this workshop calls for interdisciplinary endeavors, synergizing expertise from HCI design, health informatics, persuasive technology, exertion game, and psychology ? 2020 Owner/Author","output":"Weaving healthy behaviors into new technology routines: Designing in (and for) the COVID-19 work-from-home period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that a shockingly large fraction of the public is willing to ignore scientific judgements on issues such a vaccines and mask wearing.

This widespread misunderstanding should serve as a wake-up call for scientists, clearly demonstrating that the standard way that we teach science - as a large collection of \\"facts\\" that scientists have discovered about the world - needs major change. Three more ambitious and important goals for science education at all levels are outlined. In order of increasing difficulty, these are: (1) to provide all adults with an ability to investigate scientific problems as scientists do, using logic, experiment, and evidence; (2) to provide all adults with an understanding of how the scientific enterprise works - and why they should therefore trust the consensus judgements of science on issues like smoking, vaccination, and climate change; and (3) to provide all adults with the habit of solving their everyday problems as scientists do, using logic, experiment, and evidence. Although examples exist for attaining all of these goals, extensive education research will be needed to discover how best to teach the last two.

We first apply the SWItch Miner (SWIM) methodology, which predicts important (switch) genes within the co-expression network that regulate disease state transitions, then map them to the human proteinCprotein interaction network (PPI, or interactome) to predict novel diseaseCdisease relationships (i.e., a SWIM-informed diseasome). Although the relevance of switch genes to an observed phenotype has been recently assessed, their performance at the system or network level constitutes a new, potentially fascinating territory yet to be explored. Quantifying the interplay between switch genes and human diseases in the interactome network, we found that switch genes associated with specific disorders are closer to each other than to other nodes in the network, and tend to form localized connected subnetworks. These subnetworks overlap between similar diseases and are situated in different neighborhoods for pathologically distinct phenotypes, consistent with the well-known topological proximity property of disease genes. These findings allow us to demonstrate how SWIM-based correlation network analysis can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new disease gene associations. When integrated with an interactome-based network analysis, it not only identifies novel candidate disease genes, but also may offer testable hypotheses by which to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of human disease and reveal commonalities between seemingly unrelated diseases.","output":"Gene co-expression in the interactome: moving from correlation toward causation via an integrated approach to disease module discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV2 virus has been an emerging virus since December 2019 and is the cause of a global pandemic whose clinical manifestations extend far beyond respiratory disease.

Here, we made use of genomic and structural information to create a biomass function capturing the amino and nucleic acid requirements of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating this biomass function into a stoichiometric metabolic model of the human lung cell and applying metabolic flux balance analysis, we identified host-based metabolic perturbations inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. Our results highlight reactions in the central metabolism, as well as amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. By incorporating host cellular maintenance into the model based on available protein expression data from human lung cells, we find that only few of these metabolic perturbations are able to selectively inhibit virus reproduction. Some of the catalysing enzymes of such reactions have demonstrated interactions with existing drugs, which can be used for experimental testing of the presented predictions using gene knockouts and RNA interference techniques. In summary, the developed computational approach offers a platform for rapid, experimentally testable generation of drug predictions against existing and emerging viruses based on their biomass requirements.","output":"Inhibiting the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 through perturbations in human lung cell metabolic network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the summer of 2019 there was a rise in clusters of adolescents and young adults in the United States reporting to emergency departments with acute respiratory distress related to e-cigarette or vaping usage.

In the United States, choices about these policies are made by individual states. We develop a game-theoretic model and then test it econometrically, showing that the policy choices made by one state are strongly influenced by the choices made by others. If enough states engage in social distancing or mask wearing, they will tip others that have not yet done so to follow suit and thus shift the Nash equilibrium. If interactions are strongest amongst states of similar political orientations there can be equilibria where states with different political leanings adopt different strategies. In this case a group of states of one political orientation may by changing their choices tip others of the same orientation, but not those whose orientations differ. We test these ideas empirically using probit and logit regressions and find strong confirmation that inter-state social reinforcement is important and that equilibria can be tipped. Policy choices are influenced mainly by the choices of other states, especially those of similar political orientation, and to a much lesser degree by the number of new COVID-19 cases. The choice of mask-wearing policy shows more sensitivity to the actions of other states than the choice of SIP policies, and republican states are much less likely to introduce mask-wearing policies.

Here, we investigated the aphid diet of two common aphid predators in Central European agroecosystems, the native Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus) and the invasive Harmonia axyridis (Pallas; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by means of high throughput sequencing (HTS). For acquiring insights into diets of mobile flying insects at landscape scale minimizing trapping bias is important, which imposes methodological challenges for HTS. We therefore assessed the suitability of three field sampling methods (sticky traps, pan traps and hand-collection) as well as new aphid primers for identifying aphid prey consumption by coccinellids through HTS. The new aphid primers facilitate identification to species level in 75% of the European aphid genera investigated. Aphid primer specificity was high in silico and in vitro but low in environmental samples with the methods used, although this could be improved in future studies. For insect trapping we conclude that sticky traps are a suitable method in terms of minimizing sampling bias, contamination risk and trapping success, but compromise on DNA-recovery rate. The aphid diets of both field-captured ladybird species were dominated by Microlophium carnosum, the common nettle aphid. Another common prey was Sitobion avenae (cereal aphid), which got more often detected in C. septempunctata compared to H. axyridis. Around one third of the recovered aphid taxa were common crop pests.

Inadequate provider documentation leads to discrepancies between the ideal current procedural terminology (CPT) code and the assigned CPT code based on the care provided. Multiple studies demonstrate improvement in medical provider documentation after implementing standardized documentation templates and educational programs. The primary aim of this project was to improve the concordance between the ideal CPT code and assigned CPT code from a baseline of 71% to 85% in 12 months. METHODS: We introduced an asthma-specific note template in January 2018. We reviewed a random sample of 20 encounters per month to compare the ideal and assigned CPT codes in the baseline and intervention periods. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of encounters with agreement between ideal and assigned billing. The secondary outcome measure was the percentage of encounters with intravenous magnesium that were billed for critical care. The process measure was asthma note usage. Provider education and Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles continued throughout the intervention period. We used statistical process control to measure changes over time. RESULTS: We reviewed 740 patient encounters over a 12-month baseline and 25-month intervention period.

Regarding the WEMWBS, emotional exhaustion was observed in 54% (N = 47) of participants, depersonalization in 77% (N = 67), and low personal accomplishment was reported in 31% (N = 27) of participants. The results of the survey further highlight that depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and low personal accomplishment were associated significantly with a history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 postings. Hence, immediate measures are required to reduce the burnout among physicians while battling the second wave of the pandemic.","output":"Assessing the Mental Impact and Burnout among Physicians during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Developing Country Single-Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a newly emerging disease that is not yet fully understood. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that is easily transmitted from human to human through the respiratory route. Usually, it presents with fever, headache, fatigue accompanied by respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea, and other systemic involvements. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoproliferative neoplasm characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and demonstration of clonality unlike other causes of lymphocytosis. Patients with CLL are considered immunocompromised because of impaired humoral immunity (mainly) and cellular immunity. Therefore, they are vulnerable to various infections including COVID-19. Little is known about the COVID-19 infection when it unmasks CLL. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man with no significant previous illnesses, and an unremarkable family history, presented with a moderate COVID-19 infection. He initially presented to the emergency department with fever and mild shortness of breath. A complete blood count showed a high white blood cell count with absolute lymphocytosis. Flow cytometry revealed the clonality of the lymphocytes confirming the diagnosis of CLL. Despite having CLL, he developed a moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered in a few days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CLL, which presented with a COVID-19 infection as the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS Lymphocytosis is an unexpected finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and the elevated lymphocytes may be indicative of other conditions. Secondary causes of lymphocytosis like malignancy or other infections should be considered in these cases.","output":"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Concomitant with COVID 19: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last few months, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and has provoked an exceptional effort from the scientific community to understand the disease.

In this review article, we describe and discuss clinical studies that show advances in the understanding of mild and severe illness and we highlight major points that are critical for improving the comprehension of different clinical outcomes. The understanding of pulmonary immunopathology will contribute to the identification of biomarkers in an attempt to classify mild, moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 illness.

Purposive sampling was used to identify front-line paramedics working for one NHS Ambulance Trust. Interviews lasted between 16 and 45 min, were audiorecorded, verbatim transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Four themes were identified: paramedics reported a lack of respect displayed both verbally and non-verbally from other professional groups. The general public and interdisciplinary colleagues alike have unrealistic expectations of the role of a paramedic. In order to deal with incivility paramedics often reported taking the path of least resistance which impacts on ways of working and shapes subsequent clinical decision-making, potentially threatening best practice. Finally paramedics report using coping strategies to support well-being at work. They report that a single episode of incivility is easier to deal with but subsequent episodes compound the first.

However, an inappropriate activation of the complement system is involved in numerous disorders, including peripheral neuropathies. Current strategies for neuropathy-related pain fail to achieve adequate pain relief, and although several therapies are used to alleviate symptoms, approved disease-modifying treatments are unavailable. This urgent medical need is driving the development of therapeutic agents for this condition, and special emphasis is given to complement-targeting approaches. Recent evidence has underscored the importance of complement component C5a and its receptor C5aR1 in inflammatory and neuropathic pain, indicating that C5a/C5aR1 axis activation triggers a cascade of events involved in pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathy and painful neuro-inflammatory states. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this signaling in peripheral neuropathy are not fully known. Here, we provide an overview of complement pathways and major components associated with dysregulated complement activation in peripheral neuropathy, and of drugs under development targeting the C5 system. C5/C5aR1 axis modulators could represent a new strategy to treat complement-related peripheral neuropathies.

One key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of an enigmatic insertion in the spike glycoprotein gene representing a novel multibasic S1/S2 protease cleavage site. The proteolytic cleavage of the spike at this site is essential for viral entry into host cells. However, it has been systematically abrogated in structural studies in order to stabilize the spike in the prefusion state. In this study, multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio modeling were leveraged to gain insights into the structures and dynamics of the loop containing the S1/S2 protease cleavage site. They unveiled distinct conformations, formations of short helices and interactions of the loop with neighboring glycans that could potentially regulate the accessibility of the cleavage site to proteases and its processing.

METHODS Computer models were used to simulate RFA with a 3-cm Cool-tip applicator and MWA with an Amica-Gen applicator. The Arrhenius model was used to compute the damage index (). CZ was considered when  > 4.6 (>99% of damaged cells). Regions with 0.6< < 2.1 were considered as the PZ (tissue that has undergone moderate sub-ablative hyperthermia). The ratio of PZ volume to CZ volume (PZ/CZ) was regarded as a measure of performance, since a low value implies achieving a large CZ while keeping the PZ small. RESULTS Ten-min RFA (51 W) created smaller periablational zones than 10-min MWA (11.3 cm3 vs. 17.2-22.9 cm3, for 60-100 W MWA, respectively). Prolonging duration from 5 to 10 min increased the PZ in MWA more than in RFA (2.7 cm3 for RFA vs. 8.3-11.9 cm3 for 60-100 W MWA, respectively). PZ/CZ for RFA were relatively high (65-69%), regardless of ablation time, while those for MWA were highly dependent on the duration (increase of up to 25% between 5 and 10 min) and on the applied power (smaller values as power was raised, 102% for 60 W vs. 81% for 100 W, both for 10 min). The lowest PZ/CZ across all settings was 56%, obtained with 100 W-5 min MWA.

The first pandemic in the 21st century, caused by the pathogenic representative of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia was recorded in December 2019. The disease spread so quickly around the world that already on February 11, 2020, WHO was forced to declare a pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19. The first case of COVID-19 in the Stavropol Territory was registered on March 20, 2020, and three weeks later, starting from the 15th week of the year, a steady increase in the incidence began, which lasted until the 52nd week. During the study period, the incidence increased from 21.1 to 28.3 per hundred thousand of the population. Growth 1.3 times. Purpose: to determine the dynamics of population immunity among the population of the Stavropol Territory in 2020-2021. during the period of an epidemic increase in the incidence of COVID-19. Materials and methods. The SARS-CoV-2 study was carried out according to a unified methodology within the framework of the program for assessing the population immunity of the population of the Russian Federation, developed by Rospotrebnadzor with the participation of the St. Pasteur. In total, 2688 people were examined, divided into 7 age groups. In the examined individuals, the level of specific IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid was determined by the enzyme immunoassay. Results. The level of seroprevalence among residents of the Stavropol Territory was 9.8%. The largest proportion of seropositive individuals was found in the age groups 1-6 and 7-13 years old (19.2% and 19.7%, respectively). Seroprevalence had no gender differences and ranged from 9.3% to 10.8%. When assessing the distribution of the proportion of seropositive persons in different geographic territories of the region, it was found that the maximum proportion was found in the Kochubeevsky district (23.1%), the minimum in Kislovodsk (7.7%). Among convalescents, the content of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was noted in 73.3%, which is 7.8 times higher than the average population level. When conducting seromonitoring in the 2nd half of 2020, a 10-fold increase in seroprevalence was recorded, accompanied by a decrease in incidence from the 5th week of 2021. Among asymptomatic volunteers in whom SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction, antibody titers to viruses were found in 78.6%, which corresponds to the seroprevalence of convalescents. The proportion of seropositive persons among those who have come into contact with CO-VID-19 patients was 16.4%, (1.8 times higher than the average for the population). Out of 262 seroprevalent volunteers, the asymptomatic form of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 92% of the examined, which indicates a significant role of the number of asymptomatic forms of infection in the epidemic process of COVID-19. Conclusion. The results of assessing the population immunity of the population of the Stavropol Territory indicate that it has not yet reached the threshold level at which a decrease in the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic process can be expected. ? 2021 Interregional public organization Association of infectious disease specialists of Saint-Petersburg and Leningrad region (IPO AIDSSPbR).

We aimed to investigate whether echocardiographic measures of ventricular function were independently associated with adverse clinical course and cardiac sequaele in MIS-C. METHODS: In a longitudinal observational study of 54 MIS-C patients (mean age 6.8  4.4 years, 46% male, 56% African American), measures of ventricular function and morphometry at initial presentation, pre-discharge, and median of 3 and 10 week follow-up were retrospectively analyzed, and were compared to 108 84 age and gender matched normal controls. The magnitude of strain is expressed as an absolute value. Risk stratification for adverse clinical course and outcomes were analyzed between the tertiles of clinical and echo data using ANOVA, univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Median LV apical 4-chamber longitudinal (LVA4LS) and global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) at the initial presentation were significantly decreased in MIS-C compared to normal cohort (16.2% and 15.1% vs. 22.3% and 22.0% respectively, p<0.01). Patients in the lowest LVA4LS tertile (<13%) had significantly higher CRP and hs-Troponin, need for intensive care (ICU), mechanical life support, and longer hospital length of stay (LOS) compared to those in the highest tertile (>18.5%) (p<0.01). Initial LVA4LS and LVGLS were normal in 13 of 54 and 10 of 39 patients respectively. There was no mortality. In multivariate regression, only LVA4LS was associated with both the need for ICU and LOS. At median 10 week follow-up to date, 7 of 36 patients (19%) and 6 of 25 patients (24%) had abnormal LVA4LS and LVGLS respectively. Initial LVA4LS<16.2% indicated abnormal LVA4LS at follow-up with 100% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Impaired LVGLS and LVA4LS at initial presentation independently indicate a higher risk of adverse acute clinical course and persistent subclinical LV dysfunction at 10 weeks follow-up, suggesting they could be applied to identify higher risk children with MIS-C.","output":"Echocardiographic Indicators Associated with Adverse Clinical Course and Cardiac Sequelae in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis replicates within a membrane-bound inclusion that acquires host sphingomyelin (SM), a process that is essential for replication as well as inclusion biogenesis. Previous studies demonstrate that SM is acquired by a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway, although paradoxically, this pathway is dispensable for bacterial replication. This finding suggests that other lipid transport mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of host SM. In this work, we interrogated the role of specific components of BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways to define their contribution in SM acquisition during infection. We found that C. trachomatis hijacks components of both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways for SM acquisition but that the SM obtained from these separate pathways is being utilized by the pathogen in different ways. We show that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts only one of the three known BFA targets, GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. The Arf1/GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition is essential for inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not required for bacterial replication. In contrast, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts CERT, a lipid transfer protein that is a key component in non-vesicular ER to trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (the precursor for SM), for C. trachomatis replication. We demonstrate that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner, VAP-A, and SM synthases, SMS1 and SMS2, to the inclusion and propose that these proteins establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion. We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen redirects SM biosynthesis to its replicative niche.","output":"Chlamydia trachomatis Co-opts GBF1 and CERT to Acquire Host Sphingomyelin for Distinct Roles during Intracellular Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction As junior doctors, we very rarely receive formal teaching on communication after medical school, with telephone encounters and difficult conversations over technology being a vital yet missing part of our education The COVID-19 pandemic has required us to adapt how we communicate with patients families due to hospital visiting restrictions In an era where tragically deterioration and death have been much more commonplace, we looked to identify areas where junior doctors felt their communication skills could be improved, and implemented a teaching programme to deliver this Methods Pre-teaching questionnaires were distributed to a range of grades of junior doctors working in University Hospital of Llandough, Cardiff The questionnaires were distributed at the beginning of June 2020, after 3 months of working in pandemic conditions A teaching session on telephone and video communication skills was delivered by a local palliative care consultant Post-teaching, a repeat questionnaire was undertaken to assess response and identify key learning points Results Pre-teaching, 100% of the 22 respondents had had to participate in difficult conversations over the phone, 82% had had no formal phone based communication skills training and 81 82% felt some form of formal teaching would be helpful Post-teaching, 12 junior doctors provided feedback with an average 37% increase in confidence to undertake difficult conversations Key learning points from the session highlighted the importance of preparation, regularly updating the family to build trust and rapport, and integrating family updates via tele-communication into daily ward life Conclusions Education around telephone communication skills is critical to enable us to adapt our skills in accordance with the demands of the pandemic, to continue to support relatives and to engage with technology with confidence Increased preparation is required to navigate difficult conversations via technology, and successful communication requires clinicians to take responsibility for initiating regular family updates","output":"140 Lessons From the Front Line: Communication is Key"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To present an unusual case of recurrent multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) following the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination.

An expert committee composed of 15 optometrists evaluated content validity (item-level (I-CVI) and scale-level (S-CVI) content validity index were calculated). A pretest was performed (n = 20 participants) to verify the comprehensibility of the questionnaire. A total of 102 computer users completed the final questionnaire. Criterion validity and diagnostic performance of the CVS-Q FA(?) were assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity and receiver characteristic operator curve. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the assessment of internal consistency and 46 participants refilled the questionnaire for the second time and the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa () were evaluated for testCretest reliability. RESULTS: The translation and cross-cultural adaptation process was performed successfully according to accepted scientific recommendations without any major difficulties. The I-CVI was above 0.80 for all items (symptoms) except item 15 (feeling that sight is worsening) and the S-CVI was 0.92.

METHODS: We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3C14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2C13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days.

Energetic and structural analysis showed that the differences in infectivity can be explained by differences in affinity of the protein-protein interface between the wild-type and mutant S-protein with ACE2.

As vehicle fleets become electrified, and tailpipe emissions become less prevalent, non-tailpipe emissions (from tires and brake disks) will become the dominant source of traffic related emissions, and will in all likelihood become a major concern for human health. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by the heavier weight of electric vehicles, their increased power, and their increased torque capabilities, when compared with traditional vehicles. While the problem of emissions from tire wear is well-known, issues around the process of tire abrasion, its impact on the environment, and modelling and mitigation measures, remain relatively unexplored. Work on this topic has proceeded in several discrete directions including: on-vehicle collection methods; vehicle tire-wear abatement algorithms and controlling the ride characteristics of a vehicle, all with a view to abating tire emissions. Additional approaches include access control mechanisms to manage aggregate tire emissions in a geofenced area with other notable work focussing on understanding the particle size distribution of tire generated PM, the degree to which particles become airborne, and the health impacts of tire emissions.

Unfortunately, there is a non-available effective treatment to combat these viruses. Domain-motif interactions (DMIs) are an essential means by which viruses mimic and hijack the biological processes of host cells. To disentangle how viruses achieve this process can help to develop new rational therapies. Data mining was performed to obtain DMIs stored as regular expressions (regexp) in 3DID and ELM databases. The mined regexp information was mapped on the coronaviruses' proteomes. Most motifs on viral protein that could interact with human proteins are shared across the coronavirus species, indicating that molecular mimicry is a common strategy for coronavirus infection. Enrichment ontology analysis for protein domains showed a shared biological process and molecular function terms related to carbon source utilization and potassium channel regulation. Some of the mapped motifs were nested on B, and T cell epitopes, suggesting that it could be as an alternative way for reverse vaccinology. The information obtained in this study could be used for further theoretic and experimental explorations on coronavirus infection mechanism and development of medicines for treatment.","output":"The analysis on the human protein domain targets and host-like interacting motifs for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 infers the molecular mimicry of coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to analyze results of interviews that we conducted with Japanese municipal officials who have engaged in legislative drafting and to present main issues addressed by the interviewees. Moreover, based on the results of analysis, it aims to clarify remaining problems that legislators face with during legislation, which will be necessary conditions for expanding and improving human-centered functions of e-legislation systems. Using qualitative analysis of interviews with municipal officers, this paper identifies the following four issues addressed by interviewees: (1) inconsistency among ordinances; (2) inconsistency of an ordinance; (3) insufficiency in consideration of legislative objectives and facts; (4) inadequacy of legal research. Based on the results of interview analysis, this study clarifies whether the eLen regulation database system copes with them and discusses remaining problems. Overall, it illustrates that some functions included in the eLen are helpful for diminishing those issues. However, in order to overcome the problems with which legislators face in the process of legislation, the results of this study show that it is significant to provide legislators education, such as trainings for the way to use the system and benchmarking method or for learning legislation process. Although the eLen has already implemented several instructive mechanisms, we will improve further the system so that users can learn the proper process of legislation through the usage of the system.","output":"Qualitative Analysis of Interviews with Municipal Officers Toward the Human-Centered Improvement of the eLen Regulation Database System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implant design factors and the abutment connection are correlated with crestal bone stability. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a new type of screw-retained prostheses delivered on tissue-level implants with conical external vertical seal and internal hexagon connection. Implants 4.25 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length (Prama, Sweden and Martina) were placed in partially edentulous patients needing at least one implant in the healed site, having sufficient bone volume. The implant neck was positioned above the bone crest. A healing abutment was placed according to a one-stage approach. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis survival rate, any complications, marginal bone loss (MBL), periodontal parameters, and pink esthetic score (PES). Overall, 13 patients (4 women and 9 men; mean age 50  22 years) with the same number of implants were treated and followed for one year after loading. At the 12-month follow up, no implant and no prosthesis failed, and no complications were experienced. The mean MBL experienced at the one year follow-up was 0.65  0.48 mm. One year after loading, 2 out of 13 implants present bleeding on probing (15.4%), 4 out of 13 patients presented with plaque at the one year of follow-up (30.8%) and the PES was 10.5  2.3 mm.

The accrediting body for trauma centers in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation (PTSF), was one of the many agencies forced to find creative and safe ways to maintain prepandemic processes of evaluating trauma centers for compliance with trauma standards. With the uncertainty of government and hospital regulations prohibiting on-site participation and precautionary efforts to protect the health and well-being of survey participants, a virtual site visit survey process was developed to facilitate trauma center accreditation within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to describe an accrediting body's experience with implementing a virtual accreditation site visit survey process for Level I and II trauma centers. METHODS In 2021, the PTSF piloted the virtual survey process and completed two virtual accreditation surveys. RESULTS Feedback from participants included both positive and negative responses. The virtual format was effective in maintaining a high-quality accreditation process. However, multiple downsides were identified, including loss of interactive participation, loss of collaboration, limited educational opportunities, and increased presurvey workload for all participants. CONCLUSION The in-person and virtual formats can accomplish the goal of the accreditation survey.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TP53 mutation features were analyzed in the Geneplus cohort (n = 1184). The MSK-BREAST cohort was used to explore the value of TP53 mutation in predicting anti-HER-2 antibody efficacy. Sequencing of ctDNA in phase Ib, phase Ic, phase II clinical trials of pyrotinib (HER2+ patients), and an investigator-initiated phase II study of pyrotinib (HER2-/mut patients) were performed to analyze the relationships between TP53 mutation and prognosis for HER2 TKIs. The MSK-BREAST cohort, MutHER, and SUMMIT cohort were used for verification. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were detected in 53.1% (629/1184) of patients in the Geneplus cohort. The TP53 mutation rate was higher in HR-negative (p < 0.001) and HER2 amplification-positive (p = 0.015) patients. Among patients receiving anti-HER2 antibody therapy, those whose tumors carried TP53 mutations had a shorter PFS (p = 0.004). However, the value of TP53 mutation in predicting HER2 TKI response was inconsistent. In HER2+ patients, no difference in PFS was observed among patients with different TP53 statuses in the combined analysis of the pyrotinib phase Ib, phase Ic, and phase II clinical trials (p = 1.00) or in the MSK-BREAST cohort (p = 0.62). In HER2-/mut patients, TP53 mutation-positive patients exhibited a trend toward worse prognosis with anti-HER2 TKI treatment than TP53-wild-type patients in our investigator-initiated phase II study (p = 0.15), and this trend was confirmed in the combined analysis of the MutHER and SUMMIT cohorts (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutation can be used to identify biomarkers of anti-HER2 antibody drug resistance in HER2+ patients and HER2 TKI resistance in HER2-/mut patients.","output":"Molecular landscape of TP53 mutations in breast cancer and their utility for predicting the response to HER-targeted therapy in HER2 amplification-positive and HER2 mutation-positive amplification-negative patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper attempts to explain how the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the complications that make COVID-19 a serious disease in specific patient subgroups. It suggests that cortisol-associated activation of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) in epithelial and endothelial cells infected with the virus stimulates the release of ATP which then acts back on purinergic receptors. In the lung this could produce the non-productive cough via purinergic P2X3 receptors on vagal afferent nerves. In endothelial cells it could stimulate exocytosis of Weibel-Palade (WP) bodies that contain angiopoietin-2 which is important in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) by increasing capillary permeability and Von Willebrand Factor which mediates platelet adhesion to the endothelium and hence clotting. Both angiopoietin-2 and VWF levels are markedly elevated in COVID-19 associated ARDS. The paper offers an explanation for the sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 complications and also for why these are strongly associated with age, race, diabetes and body mass index. It also explains why individuals with blood group A have a higher risk of severe infection than those with blood group O. Dexamethasone has been shown to be of benefit in coronavirus ARDS patients and has been thought to act as an anti-inflammatory drug. This paper suggests that a major part of its effect may be due to suppression of cortisol secretion. There is an urgent need to trial the combination of dexamethasone and an MR antagonist such as spironolactone to more effectively block the MR and hence the exocytosis of WP bodies.","output":"New Horizons: Does Mineralocorticoid Receptor activation by cortisol cause ATP release and COVID-19 complications?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are large molecules intended to bind to specific targets often expressed on the immune system, and to treat various immunopathological conditions.

Increasing frailty predicts adverse health outcomes in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) Despite this, frailty is not routinely measured in clinical practice where clinician perception of frailty is used to inform decision making. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a clinical judgement-based score that is a useful screening tool for frailty. Increasing frailty measured by CFS is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) including falls, worsening disability, care home admissions, hospitalizations and ultimately mortality. It has been widely used in the assessment of patients with COVID-19 to help inform decisions regarding ceiling of care. This study aimed to assess the correlation between clinician perception of frailty and frailty as measured using the CFS. METHOD: Frailty was assessed for all patients undergoing in centre hospital haemodialysis (n=53) in a single dialysis unit in Northern Ireland. A CFS score was calculated for all patients by a clinician who routinely uses the CFS in clinical practice. Patients with a score of 1-3 were classified as not frail, 4-5 as intermediately frail and 6-9 as frail. Nephrologists received basic education about frailty. They were then asked to categorize their patients as non-frail, intermediately frail or frail. The relationship between measured and perceived frailty was assessed using percent agreement. Participant characteristics of frail patients who were misclassified as intermediately frail or non-frail by clinicians were compared to those patients correctly classified as non-frail by clinicians. Fishers exact test was employed for categorical variables and t-tests were employed for pseudo normally distributed continuous variables. RESULTS: Of the 53 participants, the median age was 59 years (26-89). 41.5% were women. The median time on dialysis was 1.6 years. According to the CFS, 6 patients were categorised as non-frail, 30 patients as intermediately frail and 17 as frail. Among frail participants, 41% were correctly perceived as frail by their nephrologist. Among non-frail participants, 100% were correctly perceived as non-frail by their nephrologist. Among those who were frail according to the CFS, those misclassified as intermediately frail or non-frail, were younger (median age of those misclassified 49 years vs 62 years of those not mis-classified, P=0.03) but did not differ by sex (P=1), time on dialysis (P=0.39), presence of diabetes (P=0.30) or presence of vascular disease (P=1). CONCLUSION: In this study of adult patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, perceived frailty correlated with measured frailty using the CFS less than 50% of the time. This suggests that clinical perception is not an accurate surrogate for frailty status in this population group. Additionally, this study suggests that younger patients with ESRD are less likely to be correctly perceived as frail. Such misclassification could influence clinical decisions for treatment, including candidacy for kidney transplantation.","output":"MO152 CORRELATION OF PERCEIVED FRAILTY WITH MEASURED FRAILTY IN AN ADULT HAEMODIALYSIS POPULATION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy (TME) has been reported in 7-31% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some reports include sedation-related delirium and few data exist on the etiology of TME. We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. RESULTS: Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n = 247 of 559 [62%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 331 of 559 [59%]), and uremia (n = 156 of 559 [28%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n = 3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27% vs. 3%) or psychiatric history (20% vs. 10%), were more often intubated (37% vs. 20%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25% vs. 66% [all P < 0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n = 267 of 4491 [6%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n = 128 of 425 [30%] patients with TME died, compared with n = 600 of 3799 [16%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.52, P = 0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n = 97 of 233 [42%] patients with HIE died, compared with n = 631 of 3991 [16%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.00, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia.

Antimicrobial, non-antibiotic biomaterials have the potential to reduce bacterial adhesion to the mesh surface and adjacent tissues while avoiding the development of novel antibiotic resistance. This study assesses the efficacy of presoaking reticular polypropylene meshes in chlorhexidine or a chlorhexidine and allicin combination (a natural antibacterial agent) for preventing bacterial infection in a short-time hernia-repair rabbit model. METHODS Partial hernia defects (5 x 2 cm) were created on the lateral right side of the abdominal wall of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 21). The defects were inoculated with 0.5 mL of a 106 CFU/mL Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 strain and repaired with a DualMesh Plus antimicrobial mesh or a Surgipro mesh presoaked in either chlorhexidine (0.05%) or allicin-chlorhexidine (900 g/mL-0.05%). Fourteen days post-implant, mesh contraction was measured and tissue specimens were harvested to evaluate bacterial adhesion to the implant surface (via sonication, S. aureus immunolabeling), host-tissue incorporation (via staining, scanning electron microscopy) and macrophage response (via RAM-11 immunolabeling). RESULTS The polypropylene mesh showed improved tissue integration relative to the DualMesh Plus. Both the DualMesh Plus and the chlorhexidine-soaked polypropylene meshes exhibited high bacterial clearance, with the latter material showing lower bacterial yields. The implants from the allicin-chlorhexidine group displayed a neoformed tissue containing differently sized abscesses and living bacteria, as well as a diminished macrophage response.

We examined the possible complementary role of laboratory-developed class-specific clinical serology in assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. Serological tests for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using samples from real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)-confirmed inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. We analyzed the influence of timing and clinical severity on the diagnostic value of class-specific COVID-19 serology testing. Cross-sectional analysis revealed higher sensitivity and specificity at lower optical density cutoffs for IgA in hospitalized patients than for IgG and IgM serology (IgG area under the curve [AUC] of 0.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.89 to 0.93] versus IgA AUC of 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98] versus IgM AUC of 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97]). The enhanced performance of IgA serology was apparent in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset and the first week after PCR testing. In patients requiring intubation, all three tests exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Among PCR-negative patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 out of 61 showed clear evidence of seroconversion IgG, IgA, and IgM. Suspected false-positive results in the latter population were most frequently observed in IgG and IgM serology tests. Our findings suggest the potential utility of IgA serology in the acute setting and explore the benefits and limitations of class-specific serology as a complementary diagnostic tool to PCR for COVID-19 in the acute setting.","output":"Comparison of Antibody Class-Specific SARS-CoV-2 Serologies for the Diagnosis of Acute COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the application of pulmonary ultrasound in the diagnosis of neonatal COVID-19.

Bedsides pulmondary ultrasound was conducted on admission, during the hospitalization, and before discharge, the result were compared with the chest X-ray or CT done at the same time. Results: Among the 5 cases who aged 1-18 days, 3 were male. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The pulmonary ultrasonography on admission showed abnormal pleural line and pulmonary edema of different severity in all 5 cases, presented as increase and fusion of B-line, and pulmonary interstitial syndrome; among them, one case also had a small-range consolidation. The chest CT on admission showed no obvious parenchymal infiltration in 2 cases, small strip or patchy high-density shadow in 2 cases, and ground glass change in one case. The re-examination of ultrosound during the hospitalization and at discharge showed improvement in all cases and were consistent with the chest X-ray taken at the same time. Conclusions: The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and alveolar interstitial syndrome, and may coexist with small range of pulmonary consolidation.

Impairment of the recruitment of new adipocytes in the adipose tissue is associated with ectopic fat accumulation, diabetes and insulin resistance. Torreya nucifera, an evergreen conifer that grows in warm temperate climates, has been found to exert beneficial effects against inflammation, infection and diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects at the cellular level remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate effects of Torreya nucifera seed oil (TNSO) on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and its underlying regulatory mechanism. METHODS: To investigate the effects of TNSO on adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate for 5 days in the presence of 0.75 L/mL TNSO. Oil Red O staining and an assay for intracellular triglyceride were performed to determine the extent of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of TNSO, adipogenic gene expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, we monitored TNSO-derived activation of PPAR and STAT3 with 3T3-L1 reporter cell lines engineered to secrete Gaussia luciferase upon the interaction of a transcription factor to its DNA binding element. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining revealed that TNSO improved the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. The mRNA levels of adipogenic genes, including adiponectin, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4), were upregulated and intracellular triglyceride levels increased upon TNSO treatment. We also established that adipocyte differentiation was improved by TNSO-derived activation of PPAR and STAT3. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TNSO improves adipocyte differentiation by regulating the activation of adipogenic transcription factors, indicating that it may serve as a potential treatment strategy for adipocyte dysfunction.

Although all patients with HLH typically need intensive anti-inflammatory therapy, patients with FHL also need HSCT to be cured. In the international HLH-2004 study, 187 children aged <18 years fulfilling the study inclusion criteria (5 of 8 diagnostic criteria, affected sibling, or molecular diagnosis in FHL-causative genes) underwent 209 transplants (2004-2012), defined as indicated in patients with familial/genetic, relapsing, or severe/persistent disease. Five-year overall survival (OS) post-HSCT was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-72); event-free survival (EFS) was 60% (95% CI, 52-67). Five-year OS was 81% (95% CI, 65-90) for children with a complete response and 59% (95% CI, 48-69) for those with a partial response (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.27; P = .035). For children with verified FHL (family history/genetically verified, n = 134), 5-year OS was 71% (95% CI, 62-78) and EFS was 62% (95% CI, 54-70); 5-year OS for children without verified FHL (n = 53) was significantly lower (52%; 95% CI, 38-65) (P = .040; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03-2.77); they were also significantly older. Notably, 20 (38%) of 53 patients without verified FHL had natural killer cell activity reported as normal at diagnosis, after 2 months, or at HSCT, suggestive of secondary HLH; and in addition 14 (26%) of these 53 children had no evidence of biallelic mutations despite having 3 or 4 FHL genes analyzed (natural killer cell activity not analyzed after 2 months or at HSCT). We conclude that post-HSCT survival in FHL remains suboptimal, and that the FHL diagnosis should be carefully investigated before HSCT.

We analyze in this article the mortality of the infection, the mortality rates of the disease the differences and importance between the estimated mortality and the counted mortality and, finally, the mortality commixed between influenza and COVID-19. The global IMR figures that are more in line with reality are approximately 0.7%. The true rate is likely to vary by geographic region. The mortality figures of the first wave were affected by the low diagnostic capacity as diagnostic tests by PCR were highly restricted. There were probably many more patients affected and died by COVID-19 than those reported, leading to an underestimation of mortality, explaining in the Spanish case the discrepancies between the excess mortality figures and the official figures reported by the Ministry of Health from Spain. A provisional summary of global hospital mortality from COVID-19 is 15% to 20%, but this figure can exceed 40% in patients admitted to the ICU. In any case, mortality rates vary between the different cohorts, reflecting differences in the confirmation of infection and identification of cases, different thresholds for hospitalization, and differences in prognosis. Hospital mortality ranges from less than 5% of hospitalized patients under 40 years of age to 35% for patients between 70 and 79 years of age and greater than 60% for patients in the age range of 80 to 89 years. The failure of civil society and its political leaders, by not taking the proper steps seriously to prevent viral transmission, has made nations more vulnerable.

However, vaccines have not been well-studied regarding their effects on heart rhythm disorders. Methods: We used the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) between 1990-2021 to search for atrial fibrillation and other less prevalent arrhythmias. Disproportionality signal analysis was conducted by measuring reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Over 1,300,000 adverse events were reported between 1990-2021. Among these events, atrial fibrillation was reported 2149 times in association with various vaccines. 90% of atrial fibrillation was associated with COVID-19 vaccines with ROR of 9.7739 (CI: 8.3703 to 11.4130) (P<0.0001). Interestingly, influenza vaccines, polyvalent polysaccharide pneumococcal (PPSV23) vaccine, pneumococcal 13-valent (PCV13) vaccine, zoster vaccine, and tetanus-containing vaccines were significantly associated with reduced atrial fibrillation. Of note, deaths were predominantly within the 50-year-old and above age group. Conclusion: While vaccines have not been linked to heart rhythm disorders, the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines in 2020 showed a significant association with atrial fibrillation.

METHODS: This study included adult non-pregnant women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) using International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria during their index pregnancy (2012C2019). Eligible participants underwent a concurrent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test. A detailed questionnaire documenting relevant personal and medical history was filled, and the relevant anthropometric parameters were recorded. RESULTS: We evaluated data from 377 women at a mean ( SD) age of 32.1  4.6 years and at a median duration of 15 (10C33) months following childbirth. Diabetes was diagnosed in 42 (11.1%) women. Use of a combination cutoff [fasting plasma glucose (FPG)  6.1 mmol/L or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)  6.0% (42 mmol/mol)] avoided OGTT in 80.9% of the study cohort, without missing the diagnosis of diabetes in any study subject. The diagnosis was missed in 2.4% of women with diabetes (and 0.3% of whole cohort) using only the FPG criterion ( 5.6 mmol/L) or HbA1c criterion [HbA1c  5.7% (39 mmol/mol)] alone. These tests avoided the need for an OGTT in 75.3% and 65.5% of women, respectively.

We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness and safety of NIPPV in a cohort of COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the COVID-19 general wards of a medium-size Italian hospital, from March 6 to May 7, 2020. Healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for COVID-19 patients were monitored, undergoing nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in case of onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and periodic SARS-CoV-2 screening serology. Overall, 50 patients (mean age 74.6 years) received NIPPV, of which 22 (44%) were successfully weaned, avoiding endotracheal intubation (ETI) and AHRF-related death. Due to limited life expectancy, 25 (50%) of 50 NIPPV-treated patients received a do not intubate (DNI) order. Among these, only 6 (24%) were weaned from NIPPV. Of the remaining 25 NIPPV-treated patients without treatment limitations, 16 (64%) were successfully weaned, 9 (36%) underwent delayed ETI and, of these, 3 (33.3%) died. NIPPV success was predicted by the use of corticosteroids (OR 15.4, CI 1.79C132.57, p 0.013) and the increase in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio measured 24C48 h after NIPPV initiation (OR 1.02, CI 1C1.03, p 0.015), while it was inversely correlated with the presence of a DNI order (OR 0.03, CI 0.001C0.57, p 0.020).

Secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of HCQ in preventing viral shedding of COVID-19 among HCWs and to assess the safety and tolerability of HCQ. Methods HCWs joined the Registry and were pre-screened for trial interest and eligibility. Trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive HCQ or placebo. On-site baseline assessment included a COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR and blood serology test. Weekly follow-up was done via an online portal and included screening for symptoms of COVID-19, self-reported testing, adverse events, and quality of life assessments. The on-site visit was repeated at Day 30. Discussion The HERO research platform offers an approach to rapidly engage, screen, invite and enroll into clinical studies using a novel participant-facing online portal interface and remote data collection, enabling limited onsite procedures for conduct of a pragmatic clinical trial. This platform may be an example for future clinical trials of common conditions to enable more rapid evidence generation.","output":"Design of the healthcare worker exposure response and outcomes (HERO) research platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the existing legal responses to the challenge of insufficient data on water service delivery in cities.

However, it is not the only threat. On 30 November 2013, a human H10N8 infection case was first described in China. The origin and genetic diversity of this novel virus is similar to that of H7N9 virus. As H10N8 avian influenza virus (AIV) was first identified from a duck in Guangdong Province during 2012 and there is also evidence of H10N8 infected dogs in this region, we sought to examine archived sera from animal workers to see if there was evidence of subclinical human infections before the first human H10N8 cases. METHODS: We studied archived serum samples (cross-sectional study, convenience sample) collected between May and September 2013 from 710 animal workers and 107 non-animal exposed volunteers living in five cities of Guangdong Province. Study participants sera were tested by horse red blood cells (RBCs) hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays according to World Health Organization guidelines. The A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346-1/2013(H10N8) virus was used. Sera which have an HI assay 1:20 were further tested with the MN assay. Questionnaire data were examined for risk factor associations with positive serological assays. Risk factor analyses failed to identify specific factors associated with probable H10N8 infections. RESULTS: Among the 827 sera, only 21 animal workers had an HI titer 1:20 (18 had an HI titer of 1:20 and 3 had an HI titer of 1:40). None of these 21 subjects reported experiencing any influenza symptoms during the three months before enrollment. Among the three subjects with HI titers of 1:40, two had MN antibody titers of 1:40, and one had a MN antibody titer of 1:80 (probable H10N8 infections). CONCLUSIONS: Study data suggest that animal workers may have been infected with the H10N8 virus before the first recognized H10N8 human infection cases.

At the organismal level, the innate immune system is essential for the detection of viruses and constitutes the first line of defense. Viral components are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs can be further classified based on their localization into Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLR), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and cytosolic DNA sensors (CDS). TLR and RLR signaling results in production of type I interferons (IFN and -) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in a cell-specific manner, whereas NLR signaling leads to the production of interleukin-1 family proteins. On the other hand, CLRs are capable of sensing glycans present in viral pathogens, which can induce phagocytic, endocytic, antimicrobial, and pro- inflammatory responses. Peripheral immune sensing of viruses and the ensuing cytokine response can significantly affect the central nervous system (CNS). But viruses can also directly enter the CNS via a multitude of routes, such as the nasal epithelium, along nerve fibers connecting to the periphery and as cargo of infiltrating infected cells passing through the blood brain barrier, triggering innate immune sensing and cytokine responses directly in the CNS.

Trends in the frequency of NH coverage and its tone (negative) and prominence (average words, daily article count, opinion piece) were examined. RESULTS: Findings indicate a dramatic rise in the number of NH articles published in the months following the first COVID-19 case, far exceeding previous levels. NH coverage became considerably more prominent, as the average number of words and daily articles on NHs increased. The proportion of negative articles largely remained consistent, though volume rose dramatically. Weekly analysis revealed acceleration in observed trends within the post-COVID-19 period itself. These trends, visible in all papers, were especially dramatic in The New York Times.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions for NCDs in Brazil according to the type of NCD, sex, age group, and region of Brazil. METHODS: This is an ecological study conducted in Brazil. Data on hospital admissions from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2021 were extracted from the Unified Health Systems Hospital Admissions Information System. The hospital admission rates per 100,000 thousand inhabitants were calculated monthly according to the type of NCD, sex, age group, and region of Brazil. Poisson regression models were used to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of hospital admissions. In this study, the pre-pandemic period was set from January 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020 and the during-pandemic from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. RESULTS: There was a 27.0% (95.0%CI: -29.0; -25.0%) decrease in hospital admissions for NCDs after the onset of the pandemic compared to that during the pre-pandemic period. Decreases were found for all types of NCDscancer (-23.0%; 95.0%CI: -26.0; -21.0%), diabetes mellitus (-24.0%; 95.0%CI: -25.0%; -22.0%), cardiovascular diseases (-30.0%; 95.0%CI: -31.0%; -28.0%), and chronic respiratory diseases (-29.0%; 95.0%CI: -30.0%; -27.0%).

Various technologies, including laboratory assays and point-of-care self-tests, are available for antibody testing. The interpretation of seroprevalence studies requires comparative data on the performance of antibody tests. METHODS: In June 2020, current and former members of the UK Police forces and Fire service performed a self-test lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), had a nurse-performed LFIA and provided a venous blood sample for ELISA . We present the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; the acceptability and usability of self-test LFIAs; and determine the sensitivity and specificity of LFIAs compared to laboratory ELISA. RESULTS: In this cohort of 5189 current and former members of the Police service and 263 members of the Fire service, 7.4% (396/5,348; 95% CI, 6.7-8.1) were antibody positive. Seroprevalence was 8.9% (6.9-11.4) in those under 40 years, 11.5% (8.8-15.0) in those of non-white ethnicity and 7.8% (7.1-8.7) in those currently working. Self-test LFIA had an acceptability of 97.7% and a usability of 90.0%. There was substantial agreement between within-participant LFIA results (kappa 0.80; 0.77-0.83). The LFIAs had a similar performance: compared to ELISA, sensitivity was 82.1% (77.7-86.0) self-test and 76.4% (71.9-80.5) nurse-performed with specificity of 97.8% (97.3-98.2) and 98.5% (98.1-98.8) respectively. CONCLUSION: A greater proportion of this non-healthcare key worker cohort showed evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population at 6.0% (5.8-6.1) following the first wave in England. The high acceptability and usability reported by participants and similar performance of self-test and nurse-performed LFIAs indicate that the self-test LFIA is fit for purpose for home-testing in occupational and community prevalence studies.","output":"Acceptability, usability and performance of lateral flow immunoassay tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: REACT-2 study of self-testing in non-healthcare key workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In contrast to air pollution and pollen exposure, data on the occurrence of the common cold are difficult to incorporate in models predicting asthma hospitalizations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess whether web-based searches on common cold would correlate with and help to predict asthma hospitalizations. METHODS: We analyzed all hospitalizations with a main diagnosis of asthma occurring in 5 different countries (Portugal, Spain, Finland, Norway, and Brazil) for a period of approximately 5 years (January 1, 2012-December 17, 2016). Data on web-based searches on common cold were retrieved from Google Trends (GT) using the pseudo-influenza syndrome topic and local language search terms for common cold for the same countries and periods. We applied time series analysis methods to estimate the correlation between GT and hospitalization data. In addition, we built autoregressive models to forecast the weekly number of asthma hospitalizations for a period of 1 year (June 2015-June 2016) based on admissions and GT data from the 3 previous years. RESULTS: In time series analyses, GT data on common cold displayed strong correlations with asthma hospitalizations occurring in Portugal (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.63 to 0.73), Spain (=0.82-0.84), and Brazil (=0.77-0.83) and moderate correlations with those occurring in Norway (=0.32-0.35) and Finland (=0.44-0.47). Similar patterns were observed in the correlation between forecasted and observed asthma hospitalizations from June 2015 to June 2016, with the number of forecasted hospitalizations differing on average between 12% (Spain) and 33% (Norway) from observed hospitalizations.

We first describe a novel method, SiteEngine, that assumes no sequence or fold similarities and is able to recognize proteins that have similar binding sites and may perform similar functions. We achieve high efficiency and speed by introducing a low-resolution surface representation via chemically important surface points, by hashing triangles of physico-chemical properties and by application of hierarchical scoring schemes for a thorough exploration of global and local similarities. We proceed to rigorously apply this method to functional site recognition in three possible ways: first, we search a given functional site on a large set of complete protein structures. Second, a potential functional site on a protein of interest is compared with known binding sites, to recognize similar features. Third, a complete protein structure is searched for the presence of an a priori unknown functional site, similar to known sites. Our method is robust and efficient enough to allow computationally demanding applications such as the first and the third. From the biological standpoint, the first application may identify secondary binding sites of drugs that may lead to side-effects. The third application finds new potential sites on the protein that may provide targets for drug design. Each of the three applications may aid in assigning a function and in classification of binding patterns.

Eighty-nine patients were in the standard suture group and 208 patients were included in the barbed suture group. Vaginal cuff dehiscence was identified in only three (3.3%) patients within the standard suture group and none in the barbed suture group. Five (5.6%) patients in the standard suture group and two (0.9%) patients in the barbed suture group developed postoperative cuff infection/cellulitis. Duration of the surgery was significantly shorter in the barbed suture group than in the standard suture group (p < .05). V-Loc? 180 unidirectional barbed suture, which is used during TLH for vaginal cuff closure, is an applicable, safe and tolerable alternative to a standard suture. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject: Barbed sutures are a relatively new type of suture that include sharp barbs inserted on monofilament material in various configurations, and are used for approximating tissues without any need for surgical knotting. They have increasingly been used in obstetrics and gynaecology in recent years, particularly in total laparoscopic hysterectomy and laparoscopic myomectomy. At present, there are a limited number of studies of V-Loc? suture in the literature. What the results of this study add: We demonstrated that barbed sutures used for enabling vaginal cuff integrity did not cause major morbidity and mortality for the patient. We suggest that V-Loc? 180 barbed sutures offer a practical, safe and tolerable alternative for surgeons because they are easy to use, do not cause a significant increase in vaginal cuff complications, and shorten the operating time. Our study with V-Loc? 180 unidirectional barbed suture is the second largest series after the study of Cong et al. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that the barbed suture, the surgery results of which are openly discussed in our study, will be more prominent in clinical practice owing to the shortened operating time, and that the use of these sutures does not cause a significant increase in vaginal cuff complications.","output":"Comparison of barbed unidirectional suture with figure-of-eight standard sutures in vaginal cuff closure in total laparoscopic hysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This editorial note considers the legal controversy surrounding Novak Djokovics deportation from Australia, and the Full Federal Court of Australias rejection of Djokovics judicial review of the Ministers decision to cancel his visa in Djokovic v Minister for Immigration [2022] FCAFC 3.

To support patient management and capacity planning in hospitals, we estimated the length of stay (LoS) in hospital and odds of intensive care (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients []18 years who had been vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, compared to unvaccinated patients. MethodsUsing national registry data, we conducted a cohort study on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalised in Norway between 1 February and 30 September 2021, with COVID-19 as the main cause of hospitalisation. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to examine the association between vaccination status and LoS. We used logistic regression to examine the association between vaccination status and ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. ResultsWe included 2,361 patients, including 70 (3%) partially vaccinated and 183 (8%) fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated patients 18-79 years had a shorter LoS in hospital overall (adjusted hazard ratio for discharge: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.07-1.72), and lower odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.33-0.96). Similar estimates were observed when collectively analysing partially and fully vaccinated patients. We observed no difference in the LoS for patients not admitted to ICU, nor odds of in-hospital death between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. ConclusionsVaccinated patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Norway have a shorter LoS and lower odds of ICU admission than unvaccinated patients.

Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1-2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. As a result, we devised a study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 and subsequently, identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome;if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients and receiving treatment compared to males and this was found to be statistically significant. Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic. As we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing.","output":"The Prevalence and Clinical Significance of Presymptomatic COVID-19 Patients: How We Can be One Step Ahead in Mitigating a Deadly Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease was first reported in China in December 2019, and WHO declared the coronavirus pandemic on 11 March 2020 Since then, all the continents have observed a fast-growing upward trend in number of confirmed cases During the epidemics, Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights became a monumentous public health issue The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is new to humans and there is only some experimental data available to describe the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) effects of COVID-19 disease, including clinical appearance and consequences of COVID-19 infection during birth, or for people with STI (sexually transmitted infections) or HIV-related immunosuppression We should not neglect the bearings at the level of the health system and delays or interludes in the routine availability of SRH facilities outside the therapeutic reach of SRH, such as pre-and postnatal tests, safe abortion, contraception, HIV/AIDS, and sexually transmitted infections In addition, other factors warrant con-sideration, such as the possible rise in gender-based violence and domes-tic abuse and the consequences of COVID-19-related stigma and prejudice and their effect on SRH customers and health care providers Therefore, the research community has an immediate requirement for the creation of all-inclusive clinical, epidemiological, and psycho-social behavioral ties between COVID-19 and SRH and the effects of rights A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out","output":"Effects of covid-19 on sexual and reproductive health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Satellite imagery is changing the way we understand and predict economic activity in the world.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a cause of stress among university students, as well as inducing changes in their physical activity and eating habits. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in body mass index and risk of developing eating disorders among university students during the COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1004 female students recruited from a university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from December 2020 to March 2021 through a self-administered questionnaire comprising three parts: sociodemographic items, the Eating Attitudes Test, and an evaluation of behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Most participants were aged 18C24 years, single, lived with their parents, and had a moderate to high family income. There was a significant relationship between the risk of developing eating disorders and marital status (p < 0.001). College type (p < 0.003), fast food consumption (p = 0.010), and engaging in exercise (p < 0.001) were also significant factors. Based on categorizations of risk levels derived from the literature, about 31.5% of the participants had a high risk of developing eating disorders.

To provide a treatment algorithm for care of COVID-19 positive/suspected hip fractures patients that accounts for their increased risk of morbidity and mortality. SETTING One academic medical center including 4 level 1 trauma centers, 1 university-based tertiary-care referral hospital, and 1 orthopedic specialty hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS 1278 patients treated for hip fractures between October 2014 and April 2020, including 136 patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTION The STTGMAORIGINAL score was modified by adding COVID-19 virus as a risk factor for mortality to create the STTGMACOVID score. Patients were stratified into quartiles to demonstrate differences in risk distribution between the scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Inpatient and 30-day mortality, major, and minor complications. RESULTS Both STTGMA score and COVID-19 positive/suspected status are independent predictors of inpatient mortality, confirming their use in risk assessment models for geriatric hip fracture patients. Compared to STTGMAORIGINAL where COVID-19 patients are haphazardly distributed among the risk groups and COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities comprise 50% of deaths in the minimal and low risk cohorts, the STTGMACOVID tool is able to triage 100% of COVID-19 patients and 100% of COVID-19 inpatient and 30 day mortalities into the highest risk quartile, where it was demonstrated that these patients have a 55% rate of pneumonia, a 35% rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a 22% rate of inpatient mortality, and a 35% rate of 30 day mortality. COVID-19 patients who are symptomatic on presentation to the ED and undergo surgical fixation have a 30% inpatient mortality rate compared to 12.5% for patients who are initially asymptomatic but later develop symptoms. CONCLUSION The STTGMA tool can be modified for specific disease processes, in this case to account for the COVID-19 virus and provide a robust risk stratification tool that accounts for a heretofore unknown risk factor. COVID-19 positive/suspected status portends a poor outcome in this susceptible trauma population and should be included in risk-assessment models. These patients should be considered high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms on presentation should have surgery deferred until symptoms improve or resolve and should be reassessed for surgical treatment versus definitive nonoperative treatment with palliative care and/or hospice care.

Pre-stroke depression may be an important contributor, however the epidemiology of pre-stroke depression is poorly understood. Using systematic review and meta-analysis, we described the prevalence of pre-stroke depression and its association with post-stroke depression. METHODS We searched multiple cross-disciplinary databases from inception to July 2017 and extracted data on the prevalence of pre-stroke depression and its association with post-stroke depression. We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using validated tools. We described summary estimates of prevalence and summary odds ratio (OR) for association with post-stroke depression, using random-effects models. We performed subgroup analysis describing the effect of depression assessment method. We used a funnel plot to describe potential publication bias. The strength of evidence presented in this review was summarised via 'GRADE'. RESULTS Of 11 884 studies identified, 29 were included (total participants n = 164 993). Pre-stroke depression pooled prevalence was 11.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.2-14.7]; range: 0.4-24% (I2 95.8). Prevalence of pre-stroke depression varied by assessment method (p = 0.02) with clinical interview suggesting greater pre-stroke depression prevalence (~17%) than case-note review (9%) or self-report (11%). Pre-stroke depression was associated with increased odds of post-stroke depression; summary OR 3.0 (95% CI 2.3-4.0). All studies were judged to be at RoB: 59% of included studies had an uncertain RoB in stroke assessment; 83% had high or uncertain RoB for pre-stroke depression assessment. Funnel plot indicated no risk of publication bias. The strength of evidence based on GRADE was 'very low'. CONCLUSIONS One in six stroke patients have had pre-stroke depression.

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was a significant burden for endoscopy units and subjected patients to inappropriate concern at being referred and investigated for suspected cancer. The BSG endorsed use of the Edinburgh Dysphagia Score (cut-off 3.5) to target endoscopy for those at highest risk,1 based on previously published results2.MethodsUse of the EDS was agreed as a service addition during the COVID-19 recovery period in SE London. All patients referred for dysphagia on the suspected cancer pathway in four acute Trusts were contacted either prior or on arrival in the endoscopy unit to complete the EDS, but the result did not alter the intended pathway (ie. all patients still completed endoscopy). Patients were then followed to final or working diagnosis as determined by the direct care team. As the EDS was primarily designed to prioritise for cancer diagnosis, this was the primary outcome measure. All other diagnoses were recorded and considered significant if felt to be the cause of the patients presentation. Data on ethnicity was collected to ensure the reliability of the EDS in diverse patient groups found across SE London.Results240 patients (117F;mean age 55.714.7y;n=112 (46.7%) non-White British) completed their investigation pathway with 20 (8%) cancers diagnosed. 125 reported EDS <3.5 and none had upper GI cancer, while all 20 cancers occurred in the ESD>3.5 group (n=115;17.3%;median score 8(7-9)). Significant diagnoses were found in 35 patients (28%) with EDS<3.5 and 48 (41.7%) in the >3.5 group.ConclusionThe EDS cut-off of 3.5 had a 100% negative predictive value in this new prospective cohort and would have resulted in a more-than-doubling of hit-rate for diagnosis of cancer. The rate of significant diagnoses in the <3.5 cohort emphasises that investigations are still required, but adoption of the EDS could be used to safely defer or divert patients, avoiding inappropriate use of suspected cancer pathways.ReferenceBr J Surg 2010;97(12):1831-7. www.bsg.org.uk","output":"Prospective validation of the edinburgh dysphagia score in South-east London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a 14-month-old boy, with a previous diagnosis of propionic acidemia (PA) by expanded newborn screening, who, admitted for a suspected metabolic crisis, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The suspension of clinical placements and cancellation of objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) is likely to have an influence on students performance. METHODS: Using a questionnaire, a retrospective observational study was conducted. Our primary focus was 3rd year medical students following their examinations in May 2020. RESULTS: Out of 46 responses obtained, the results demonstrated over 2/3 felt they perform better in clinical OSCE compared to written examinations and the majority performed worse this year during the pandemic. On a Likert scale, a mean result of 3/5 was obtained for confidence upon returning to placement and to address this, most stated they would benefit from extra optional teaching. Additionally, a further average of 3.82 was derived to represent how greatly students believed the absence of third year clinical OSCE would negatively impact their performance in the OSCE for the following academic year. Conclusion: The results of our study highlight that the cancellation of clinical placements and OSCE due to coronavirus has negatively impacted on medical education and if we are to be faced with future pandemics, we must be better prepared to train future doctors.

How might we quickly prepare a large number of ambulatory-based clinicians to care for hospitalized patients using the inpatient workflow of the electronic health record (EHR)? OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to create a successful training intervention which prepares ambulatory-based clinicians as they transition to inpatient services. METHODS: We created a training guide with embedded videos that describes the workflow of an inpatient clinician. We delivered this intervention via an e-mail hyperlink, a static hyperlink inside of the EHR, and an on-demand hyperlink within the EHR. RESULTS: In anticipation of the first peak of inpatients with COVID-19 in April 2020, the training manual was accessed 261 times by 167 unique users as clinicians anticipated being called into service. As our institution has not yet needed to deploy ambulatory-based clinicians for inpatient service, usage data of the training document is still pending. CONCLUSION: We intend that our novel implementation of a multimedia, highly accessible onboarding document with access from points inside and outside of the EHR will improve clinician performance and serve as a helpful example to other organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Ambulatory Clinician's Guide to Inpatient Service: An Innovative Rapid Onboarding Strategy for the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transfer factor (TF), also called \\"Lawrence transfer factor\\", or dialyzable leukocyte extract (DLE), has been used since the mid-twentieth century to transfer specific skin hypersensitivity through the injection of leukocytes from immunized donors to animals and humans. The main mechanism of action of TF has been suggested at the level of cell-mediated immunity, as it induces the production of migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interferon gamma (IFN-?3). Otherwise, TF can inhibit nuclear factor &#954;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B), and decrease tumoral necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and IL-4 levels. Given these biological effects, TF has been prescribed for a wide variety of conditions including infections, allergies, autoimmunity, and cancer, with inconsistent results. The exact nature of TF, however, remains unknown, so it has been impossible to accurately define its pharmacokinetics or dosage. This is further complicated because researchers have used TF in a variety of ways across the different studies: antigen-specific or non-antigen-specific, orally or subcutaneously administered, human and non-human origin. In this review we summarize the most important data about what TF is, its mechanism of action, how it is produced, its biological effects, and the available clinical trials using it, in order to establish its role and potential clinical applications in modern medicine.","output":"Transfer Factor: Myths and Facts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the vocalization characteristics of infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the context of frustration.

Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during India's March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. RESULTS: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95% CI 0.367-0.824; p = 0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10-12 months (OR 1.761; 95% CI 1.196-2.591; p = 0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95% CI 0.478-0.816; p = 0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, despite their younger age. First-year immunization coverage among heavily exposed children decreased by 6.9 pp to 10.4 pp (9.7% to 14.0%). Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4-5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.","output":"COVID-19 related immunization disruptions in Rajasthan, India: A retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, women with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) are living longer, increasing the number of patients receiving post-treatment follow-up care.

While developing materials for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the feasibility of a nurse-led Telephone Survivorship Clinic (TSC) for a smooth transition of ESBC survivors to follow-up care, we explored patients' and OPs' reactions to several of our proposed methods. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design with thematic analysis and a two-pronged approach. We interviewed OPs, seeking feedback on ways to recruit their ESBC patients for the trial, and ESBC patients, seeking input on a questionnaire package assessing outcomes and processes in the trial. RESULTS: OPs identified facilitators and barriers and offered suggestions for study design and recruitment process improvement. Facilitators included the novelty and utility of the study and simplicity of methods; barriers included lack of coordination between treating and discharging clinicians, time constraints, language barriers, motivation, and using a paper-based referral letter. OPs suggested using a combination of electronic and paper referral letters and supporting clinicians to help with recruitment. Patient advisors reported satisfaction with the content and length of the assessment package. However, they questioned the relevance of some questions (childhood trauma) while adding questions about trust in physicians and proximity to primary-care providers. CONCLUSIONS: OPs and patient advisors rated our methods for the proposed trial highly for their simplicity and relevance then suggested changes.

Interruptions in anti-HER2 therapy due to cardiotoxicity can lead to suboptimal cancer treatment. The purpose of this narrative review is to outline opportunities to optimize cardiovascular care in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer to prevent interruptions in therapy. METHODS: This case-based review presents the current literature on evidence-based strategies for personalized cardiotoxicity risk assessment, risk mitigation interventions, cardiac function surveillance tools, and management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in breast cancer patients receiving anti-HER2 therapy. RESULTS: Pretreatment cardiac risk assessment incorporates both treatment-related risk factors and patient-related risk factors for the development of cardiac dysfunction. Prevention and monitoring strategies while on treatment utilize risk factor modification, imaging and biomarker surveillance. Management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction due to anti-HER2 therapy is evolving. Permissive cardiotoxicity in asymptomatic patients while starting cardioprotective therapies requires close collaboration between oncology and cardiology, and referral to cardio-oncology if available.

In addition to SARS-CoV-2 causing pneumonia, many studies have reported ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. This article describes the effects and possible underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 on ischemic stroke. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and other COVID-dedicated databases and the combination of the keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and ischemic stroke up to November 28, 2020. Results: SARS-CoV-2 invades the host through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in the brain and vascular endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause direct vascular disease or enhance the immunogenic thrombosis environment through several mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate the host immune response and can cause inflammation, coagulation disorders, renin angiotensin system disorders, hypoxia, and stress disorders, which may lead to the occurrence of ischemic stroke. Conclusions: Some patients with COVID-19 can develop ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has a high risk of causing disability and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is hoped that when medical staff treat patients with COVID-19, they would pay attention to the occurrence of ischemic stroke to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","output":"The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on ischemic stroke and the possible underlying mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of children in the home and household crowding as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.

METHODS: To capture the impact of COVID-19 on its members, the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) sent 6 surveys over a span of seven months from late March until September of 2020 querying its members regarding the effects of COVID on the health and wellbeing of their personal, financial and clinical practice. RESULTS: 92% of surgeons reported a cessation of elective inpatient cases during the height of the crisis. The reduction was greatest for surgeries performed in hospital-based sites of care. 91% reported a drop in clinic volume. At the final surveys, these numbers where 7% and 59%, respectively. In addition, there was a widespread increase in the use of telemedicine during this period. Only a small number of orthopaedic practices permanently closed due to COVID-19; 68% of surgeons, however, sought federal funding to offset their loss of revenue due to the restrictions placed on elective surgeries. Lastly, once elective surgeries were re-instated, the majority of surgeons reported no restrictions with surgical cases and that they believed they were adapting to the challenges of COVID successfully. DISCUSSION: The impact of COVID-19 in 2020 on the practice of arthroplasty resulted in nearly universal loss of volume and significant financial stress.

In addition to the health concerns, COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous impact on economic and political conditions of every nation. Ever since the start of pandemic the physicians were constrained to rely on the management strategies due to lack of clear understanding of the disease pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Scientists are working tirelessly to gather maximum information about the deadly virus and come up with various strategies which can be used against COVID-19 infection in terms of therapeutics and vaccine development. It is quite evident that virus infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and most of the deaths occur due to respiratory failure. As the virus spread through respiratory droplets, the strenuous exercise of preventive measures and large scale diagnosis has been in practice across the globe to prevent the transmission.

Because of the coinciding silent epidemic of MDR organisms the handling of COVID-19 patients became even more challenging. In the present study, the microbiological characteristics of bacteraemias in confirmed cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were determined. Data from 1165 patients hospitalized between September and December 2020 were reviewed regarding the frequency of bloodstream infections, the epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the causative bacteria. The hospital's antibiotic susceptibility data for all major nosocomial pathogens isolated from bacteremias of COVID-19 patients between September-December 2020 versus September-December 2019 bacteremias were also compared. Overall, 122 patients developed bacteremia (10.47%). The average of time interval between hospitalization date and development of bacteremia was 13.98 days. Admission to ICU occurred in 98 out of 122 patients with an average time of stay 15.85 days and 90.81% in-hospital mortality. In total, 166 pathogens were recovered including 114 Gram-negative bacteria and 52 Gram-positive cocci. Acinetobacter baumannii were the most frequent (n = 51) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 45) and Enterococcus faecium (n = 31). Bacteremias in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were related with prolonged time of hospitalization and higher in-hospital mortality and the isolated microorganisms represented the bacterial species that were present in our hospital before the COVID-19 pandemic. Worryingly, the antibiotic resistance rates were increased compared to the pre-pandemic era for all major opportunistic bacterial pathogens. The pandemic highlighted the need for continuous surveillance of patients with prolonged hospitalization.","output":"Microbiological characteristics of bacteremias among COVID-19 hospitalized patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Greece during the second epidemic wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the pediatric population appears to be less severe among children <18 years old, emerging evidence from Europe, North America, Asia, and Latin America indicates that COVID-19 infection may precipitate the hyperinflammatory state among children following infection.

This disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions.

In pandemic and post-pandemic scenarios, populist political parties could use vaccine-related issues to generate distrust in evidence-based knowledge. Therefore, some questions arise. What impact could populist political parties impinge on vaccination uptake rates through sowing political discontent? What could the medical institutions do to avoid the adverse effects that these political strategies could infringe? For answering these research questions, we first hypothesized that vaccine uptake was negatively associated with distrust in the institutions. Furthermore, we analyzed whether populism mediates this relationship. In doing so, we hypothesized a positive association between distrust and populism, because populists, mainly fueled by politically discontent citizens, offer hope of a better future, blaming their misfortune on the actions of the elite. Additionally, we hypothesized that those citizens with a higher level of political dissatisfaction, following the claims of the populist political parties, will have lower vaccine uptake results, because they will be discouraged from making the efforts to counter the pandemic. Based on a survey carried out by the European Commission that covered 27 E.U. + U.K. countries (totaling 27,524 respondents), this paper proves that an individuals political discontent fully mediates the relationship between distrust in institutions and vaccine uptake. Targeting the vaccine-hesitant population is quite convenient for populists because they only need to convince a minority of citizens not to be vaccinated to achieve their destabilizing goals. New outbreaks will appear if the minimum herd immunity coverage is not reached, reinforcing a vicious circle of distrust in elites, in consequence.

The major functions of HSPs include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides, protecting cells from toxic stress, and presenting immune and inflammatory cytokines. Regarded as a double-edged sword, HSPs also cooperate with numerous viruses and cancer cells to promote their survival. RNA chaperones are a group of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are essential factors for manipulating both the functions and metabolisms of pre-mRNAs/hnRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. hnRNPs involve in a large number of cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, transcription regulation, RNP assembly and stabilization, RNA export, virus replication, histone-like nucleoid structuring, and even intracellular immunity.

When we talk about oncofertility, we are talking about those patients worried about the delay in receiving medical services (possible cancelation of surgery, decreased availability of medical services, reorientation of medical resources) due to COVID-19. Finally, patients worsening biological and reproductive statuses, associated with high levels of anxiety and depression, are closely related to social restrictions, economic impact, reorientation of medical resources, health policies, and fears of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aim: We reviewed the current literature on fertility during the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on cancer patients. Specifically, how cancer treatment can affect fertility, the options to maintain fertility potential, and the recovery options available after treatment are increasingly common concerns among cancer patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using two main central databases (PubMed(?)/MEDLINE, and Web of Science) to identify relevant studies using keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, oncofertility, young cancer patient, cryopreservation, assisted reproductive techniques (ART), psychosocial, telemedicine.

Conclusions: Fertility preservation (FP) should not be discontinued, but instead practiced with adjustments to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients requires screening for COVID-19 before FP procedures, among both patients and medical staff in FP clinics, to prevent infection that would rapidly worsen the condition and lead to severe complications.","output":"Oncofertility and COVID-19: At the Crossroads between Two Time-Sensitive Fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To minimize losses caused by flooding of areas in a river basin, flood risk management may sacrifice the interests of some areas.

In summary, we find that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength can vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on absorption by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals in buildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received signal strength need not decrease with increasing distance. This suggests that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal strength is likely to be challenging.

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, has been shown to possess anti-inflammation, anti-virus, and antitumor properties. However, whether ivermectin affects CRC is still unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ivermectin on CRC using CRC cell lines SW480 and SW1116. We used CCK-8 assay to determine the cell viability, used an optical microscope to measure cell morphology, used Annexin V-FITC/7-AAD kit to determine cell apoptosis, used Caspase 3/7 Activity Apoptosis Assay Kit to evaluate Caspase 3/7 activity, used Western blot to determine apoptosis-associated protein expression, and used flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cell cycle. The results demonstrated that ivermectin dose-dependently inhibited colorectal cancer SW480 and SW1116 cell growth, followed by promoting cell apoptosis and increasing Caspase-3/7 activity. Besides, ivermectin upregulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved PARP and downregulated antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Mechanism analysis showed that ivermectin promoted both total and mitochondrial ROS production in a dose-dependent manner, which could be eliminated by administering N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) in CRC cells. Following NAC treatment, the inhibition of cell growth induced by ivermectin was reversed. Finally, ivermectin at low doses (2.5 and 5 M) induced CRC cell arrest. Overall, ivermectin suppressed cell proliferation by promoting ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and inducing S phase arrest in CRC cells, suggesting that ivermectin might be a new potential anticancer drug therapy for human colorectal cancer and other cancers.","output":"Ivermectin has New Application in Inhibiting Colorectal Cancer Cell Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims Sarcoidosis is a rare multisystem disease characterised by the presence of noncaseating granulomas. It most commonly affects the lungs though can affect any other organ system. Rarely, it can manifest as an acute myopathy. We describe a case of a patient presenting with muscle weakness and constitutional symptoms who was eventually diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Methods A 48-year-old male with a background of lumbar spondylosis and BPH, presented with a 6-week history of progressive upper and lower limb weakness, myalgia and reduced mobility. He also described an 18-month history of progressive fatigue, drenching night sweats and 10-kilogram weight loss. His symptoms meant he was unable to work as a firefighter. Examination demonstrated profound muscle wasting and reduced power in the proximal muscles of his upper and lower limbs. There was no evidence of rash, synovitis or lymphadenopathy. Blood tests showed a normocytic anaemia (Hb 100 g/L) and raised C-reactive peptide (180 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (100 mm/hour). The creatine kinase ranged between 20-42 units/litre. He had a weakly positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:80). The remaining autoantibody screen was negative including ENA, DSDNA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP. Complement proteins were unremarkable. Furthermore, an extended myositis panel revealed no myositis-specific or myositis-associated antibodies. Serum calcium and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were normal. Blood cultures and virology screen including for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV, EBV, COVID-19 and respiratory viruses were all negative. A chest radiograph was also unremarkable. Results He subsequently underwent electromyography which revealed generalised myopathy. An MRI of the lower limb proximal musculature showed evidence of muscle oedema worse on the right-side but no definitive evidence of myositis. A PET-CT followed revealing FDG-avid generalised lymphadenopathy and polyarticular uptake, but little uptake in the skeletal muscles. He underwent an external iliac lymph node core biopsy which demonstrated multiple noncaseating granulomas and lymphadenitis. Cultures for Tuberculosis were negative and there was no evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder. A muscle biopsy was desired but not possible due to lack of availability because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and commenced on three pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by a weaning regimen of high-dose oral prednisolone and subcutaneous methotrexate. This resulted in a sustained improvement in his symptoms and normalisation of inflammatory markers. Conclusion Symptomatic myopathy is present in only 0.5-2.5% of sarcoidosis patients. This unique case highlights the heterogeneity of this disease and the vital role different diagnostic modalities play in achieving the correct diagnosis. It is also pertinent that the lymphadenopathy, found incidentally via imaging, led to the diagnosis. Although notoriously a diagnosis of exclusion, this case emphasises the importance of considering sarcoidosis even in the absence of respiratory symptoms, a raised ACE or hypercalcaemia.

We compared pipeline embolization device (PED) versus conventional endovascular treatment in terms of evolution of mass effect, complications, recurrence, and retreatment rate. METHODS One hundred fifty-seven patients harboring 167 cavernous carotid aneurysms were treated using PED placement, coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and carotid vessel destruction. Procedural complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared. RESULTS There were no difference in age, sex, and mean aneurysm size between those treated with PED and those treated with conventional endovascular procedures. The patients treated with PED had a significantly lower proportion of small-size aneurysms (<10 mm) and a shorter follow-up duration. Multivariate analysis revealed treatment other than PED (PED: odds ratio [OR], 0.03; P=0.002) and size >15 mm (OR, 4.27; P=0.003) to be predictors of no improvement in symptoms. The rate of complete occlusion was 81.36% (48 of 59) for PED, 42.25% (39 of 71) for stent-assisted coiling, 27.27% (6 of 22) for coiling, and 73.33% (11 of 15) for carotid vessel destruction. Retreatment was needed in patients with aneurysm size >15 mm (OR, 2.67; P=0.037) and those who were not treated with PED (PED: OR, 0.16; P=0.006). The rate of major complications was 6.6% (11 of 167). Patients who were treated with PED or stent-assisted coiling had 3.84 lower odds to develop complications (OR, 0.26; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The use of PED should be encouraged, especially in symptomatic patients. We found PED to be associated with less need for future treatment, higher improvement in symptoms rate, and lower rate of complications.","output":"Flow diversion versus conventional treatment for carotid cavernous aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communication constitutes the core of human life. A large portion of our everyday social interactions is non-verbal. Of the sensory modalities we use for non-verbal communication, olfaction (i.e., the sense of smell) is often considered the most enigmatic medium. Outside of our awareness, smells provide information about our identity, emotions, gender, mate compatibility, illness, and potentially more. Yet, body odors are astonishingly complex, with their composition being influenced by various factors. Is there a chemical basis of olfactory communication? Can we identify molecules predictive of psychological states and traits? We propose that answering these questions requires integrating two disciplines: psychology and chemistry. This new field, coined sociochemistry, faces new challenges emerging from the sheer amount of factors causing variability in chemical composition of body odorants on the one hand (e.g., diet, hygiene, skin bacteria, hormones, genes), and variability in psychological states and traits on the other (e.g., genes, culture, hormones, internal state, context). In past research, the reality of these high-dimensional data has been reduced in an attempt to isolate unidimensional factors in small, homogenous samples under tightly controlled settings. Here, we propose big data approaches to establish novel links between chemical and psychological data on a large scale from heterogeneous samples in ecologically valid settings.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in the air quality indexes (AQI) in industrial, densely populated and capital cities in different countries of the world before and after 2020. In this ecological study, we used AQI obtained from the free available databases such as the World Air Quality Index (WAQI). Bivariate correlation analysis was used to explore the correlations between meteorological and AQI variables. Mean differences (standard deviation: SD) of AQI parameters of different years were tested using paired-sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test as appropriate. Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to recognize meteorological variables affecting the AQI parameters. RESULTS: AQI-PM(2.5), AQI-PM(10) and AQI-NO(2) changes were significantly higher before and after 2020, simultaneously with COVID-19 restrictions in different cities of the world. The overall changes of AQI-PM(2.5), AQI-PM(10) and AQI-NO(2) in 2020 were C 7.36%, C 17.52% and C 20.54% compared to 2019. On the other hand, these results became reversed in 2021 (+ 4.25%, + 9.08% and + 7.48%). In general, the temperature and relative humidity were inversely correlated with AQI-PM(2.5), AQI-PM(10) and AQI-NO(2). Also, after adjusting for other meteorological factors, the relative humidity was inversely associated with AQI-PM(2.5), AQI-PM(10) and AQI-NO(2) ( = ? 1.55,  = ? 0.88 and  = ? 0.10, P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that air quality generally improved for all pollutants except carbon monoxide and ozone in 2020; however, changes in 2021 have been reversed, which may be due to the reduction of some countries restrictions. Although this quality improvement was temporary, it is an important result for planning to control environmental pollutants.","output":"Air quality index variation before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic: a comprehensive study on 87 capital, industrial and polluted cities of the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between tax evasion and COVID-19 public health risk exposure in both high-corruption countries and low-corruption countries Design/methodology/approach: This study uses cross-sectional data from 138 countries Tax evasion is measured using the shadow economy size (light intensity approach) as calculated by (Medina and Schneider, 2018) The SolAbility COVID-19 public health risk exposure index (CPHRE) is used to measure COVID-19 health risk Also, the corruption perception index from transparency international is used for measuring the level of corruption Findings: This study finds that the level of tax evasion is positively related to CPHRE Also, the results revealed a positive relationship between corruption and CPHRE Furthermore, this study examined the moderation effect of corruption The results indicate that the positive relationship between tax evasion and public health risk exposure is significant in low-corruption countries, but it is insignificant in high-corruption countries These results imply that the severity of corruption can increase COVID-19 health risk exposure more than tax evasion Practical implications: Our findings are alerting the policymakers for the negative noneconomic consequences of tax evasion and corruption It provides evidence that tax evasion and corruption can increase CPHRE Originality/value: According to the authors knowledge, this is the first study that examines the relationship between tax evasion and COVID-19 risk and that tests the moderation effect of corruption ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Tax evasion, corruption and COVID-19 health risk exposure: a cross country analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires evidence to help mitigate its global harm.

We designed the present longitudinal study to evaluate the psychological impact of quarantine in Italian community-dwelling adult participants. METHODS: A sample of 304 Italian community-dwelling adult participants (75.7% female; mean age = 35.28 years) was administered self-reported measures of depression, anxiety and acute stress symptoms at the beginning and at the end of the lockdown. Potential predictors of clinically relevant symptoms at the end of the lockdown were assessed. Specifically, data on gender, civil status, education level, occupation, and area of residence, as well as maladaptive personality domains were collected. RESULTS: More than 43% of participants suffered from the early impact of the lockdown; at the end of the lockdown roughly 32% of participants still reported any clinically relevant depression anxiety, and/or acute stress disorder condition. Clinically relevant acute stress reaction at the beginning of lockdown was a particularly important risk factor for experiencing clinically relevant acute stress, depression, and anxiety at the end of the lockdown. Maladaptive personality domains represent non-trivial predictors of participants' self-reports of clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and acute stress conditions at the end of the lockdown. LIMITATIONS: Excess of female participants and the impossibility of evaluating if participants suffered from any internalizing disorder before the COVID-19 quarantine represent major limitations of our study.

Since late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for a global pandemic that has resulted in 205,338,159 confirmed cases of infection and 4,333,094 deaths as of August 11, 2021, according to the World Health Organization. Currently, there are no approved antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Several strategies to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines rely on different technologies such as DNA- and RNA-based formulations, recombinant subunits with viral particles, viral vectors, and purified inactivated viral formulations with or without adjuvant. Method: Here we report the development of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate and show that its efficacy and safety in preclinical studies warrant further clinical evaluation. For this purpose, a vaccine candidate was manufactured by using microcarrier based cell culture methods in a disposable wave bioreactor, purified by using ultrafiltration and multimodal chromatography system, and their effect and possible side effects on different doses were evaluated using qRT-PCR, Western Blotting, antigen ELISA, histopathology, serum neutralization test in Balb/c mice. Results: Microcarrier-based production in disposable wave bioreactors (SARTORIUS Biostat RM20, Germany) was very efficient for vaccine production. Each dose of the vaccine candidate contains about 340 C400 ng viral spike protein. TEM analysis verified the viral replication in VERO cells and showed intact, oval-shaped particles with diameters of 90 to 110 nm of the virus after the final purification step. The preliminary results in mice showed that the NtAb titers reached the peak post-priming and boosting in 21 days. The titers were respectively 1/ 595, 1 /791, and 1/1048 in 4, 6, and 10 g groups. In transgenic ferrets, the inactivated vaccine doses were well tolerated in all dose groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse effects. Conclusions: In conclusion, two different doses (4 and 6 micrograms) of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine administered twice were shown to be effective and safe in preclinical studies.

By March, 2020, New York City had become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. METHODS We tracked all patients with confirmed coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY). Data were obtained through manual review of electronic medical records. Patients had at least 30 days of follow-up. RESULTS Our first 300 ICU patients were admitted March 10 through April 11, 2020. The majority (60.7%) of patients were men. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was documented in 91.7% of patients; 91.3% required mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning was employed in 58% of patients and neuromuscular blockade in 47.8% of mechanically-ventilated patients. Neither intervention was associated with decreased mortality. Vasopressors were required in 77.7% of patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was present on admission in 40.7% of patients, and developed subsequently in 36.0%; 50.9% of patients with AKI received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 52.3%, and 55.8% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In univariate analysis, higher mortality rate was associated with increasing age, male sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, number of comorbidities, AKI on presentation, and need for vasopressor support. A representative multivariable model for 30-day mortality is also presented, containing patient age, gender, body mass index, and AKI at admission. As of May 11, 2020, 2 patients (0.7%) remained hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Mortality in critical illness associated with COVID-19 is high.

People living in precarious conditions were relocated by the authorities to emergency shelters, hotels and large venues. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) then intervened to provide medical care in several of these locations in Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis, one of its suburbs, between March and June 2020. A seroprevalence survey was conducted to assess the level of exposure to COVID-19 among the population living in the sites. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the impact of the pandemic on populations living in insecure conditions in Europe. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the food distribution sites, emergency shelters and workers residences supported by MSF in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, to determine the extent of COVID-19 exposure as determined by SARS-CoV2 antibody seropositivity. The detection of SARS-COV2 antibodies in serum was performed at the Institut Pasteur of Paris using two LuLISA (Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assays and a Pseudo Neutralization Test. A questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, adherence to sanitary recommendations and symptom manifestations was also completed. We describe here the seroprevalence site by site and identify the risk factors for seropositivity using a multivariable logistic regression model with site random effects. We also investigated associations between seropositivity and symptoms eventually reported. Findings Overall, 426/818 individuals tested positive in the 14 sites investigated. Seroprevalence varied significantly with the type of site (chi2 p<0.001). It was highest at 88.7% (95%CI 81.8-93.2) among individuals living in workers residences, followed by 50.5% (95%CI 46.3-54.7) in emergency shelters and 27.8 % (95%CI 20.8-35.7) among individuals recruited from the food distribution sites. Seroprevalence also varied significantly between sites of the same type. Among other risk factors, the odds for seropositivity were higher among individuals living in crowded sites (medium: adj. OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.001; high: adj. OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.7-6.9, p<0.001) compared with individuals from low crowding sites and among those who reported transit accommodation in a gymnasium before the lockdown (adj.

Interpretation The results demonstrate rather high exposure to SARS-COV-2 with important variations between study sites. Living in crowded conditions was identified as the most important explanatory factor for differences in levels of exposure.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, fathers with diverse gender ideologies were forced to stay home with their baby. Method: 42 longitudinal interviews were conducted with 23 fathers, before and after the birth of their child. 10 of these fathers unexpectedly stopped their paid work for the first two months post-partum because of distancing measures. This group is compared with 10 others who took at most their 14 days of paid leave before returning to paid work and 3 others who deliberately planned to take a month off. All mothers were on maternity leave. Results: Lockdowns isolated couples from the help of extended family and fathers had to assume a caregiving position. However, staying home involved different things for different fathers. For some, it meant sharing unpaid work equally. For others, it was more about bonding with the baby, whereas intensive childcare was considered the mother's role. Conclusion: Drawing on an integrative approach, the findings suggest that changes at the institutional level, such as lockdowns, impact fathering trajectories differently depending on gender ideologies at the individual level.","output":"Exploring COVID-19 lockdowns as unexpected paternity leave: One shock, diverse gender ideologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening programmes were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the effects of five restart strategies after the disruption on required screening capacity and cancer burden. METHODS: Microsimulation models simulated five restart strategies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The models estimated required screening capacity, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific mortality after a disruption of 6 months. The restart strategies varied in whether screens were caught up or not and, if so, immediately or delayed, and whether the upper age limit was increased. RESULTS: The disruption in screening programmes without catch-up of missed screens led to an increase of 2.0, 0.3, and 2.5 cancer deaths per 100 000 individuals in 10 years in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Immediately catching-up missed screens minimised the impact of the disruption but required a surge in screening capacity. Delaying screening, but still offering all screening rounds gave the best balance between required capacity, incidence, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies with the smallest loss in health effects were also the most burdensome for the screening organisations. Which strategy is preferred depends on the organisation and available capacity in a country.","output":"Effects of cancer screening restart strategies after COVID-19 disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents an investigation on the strategies of higher education teachers to adopt academic activities to virtuality in times of pandemic.

Several meta-analyses have indicated that many comorbidities were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severity or mortality. The original report also showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 in breast cancer patients is more dependent on comorbidities than previous radiation therapy or current anti-cancer therapy. However, no meta-analysis has focused on this aspect. This systematic review aims to assess whether breast cancer will increase the severity and mortality of patients infected with COVID-19 and to explore which factors that may affect the severity or mortality rate of breast cancer patients with COVID-19. METHODS We will search the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Wanfang database from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Cohort studies comparing the disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients with and without breast cancer will be included. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included cohort studies using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We will conduct meta-analyses to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the random-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to rate the quality of the evidence.

The threats of the COVID-19 pandemic require the mobilization of scientists, including mathematicians. To understand how the number of cases increases versus time, various models based on direct observations of a random number of new cases and differential equations can be used. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches should also be used, for example, some smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic in different countries and regions and to make adequate predictions of the duration, hidden periods, reproduction numbers, and final sizes of its waves. In particular, seven waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated. Objective. We will detect new epidemic waves in Ukraine that occurred after September 1, 2020 and estimate the epidemic characteristics with the use of generalized SIR model. Some predictions of the epidemic dynamics will be presented. Methods. In this study we use the smoothing method for the dependence of the number of cases on time; the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before. Results. Seventh and eights epidemic waves in Ukraine were detected and the reasons of their appearance were discussed. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated. The prediction for the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine is not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June 2021. Only mass vaccination and social distancing can change this trend. Conclusions. New waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical simulations.

Turkey is one of the countries with the highest antibiotic consumption in the world. Considering the role of transnational ties between Turkish migrants and their social contacts in Turkey, the attitudes and behaviors relating to rational antibiotic use in Turkey can also affect the use of antibiotics by Turkish migrants residing abroad. This study explores physicians and pharmacists experiences and perspectives on rational antibiotic use among Turkish adults in Turkey and among Turkish migrants in Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands, three European countries with large populations of Turkish migrants. METHODS: Following a qualitative study design using convenience and snowball sampling, in-depth interviews with 21 family physicians and 24 pharmacists were conducted in the aforementioned countries. We transcribed all interviews verbatim and performed content analysis separately in the countries, followed by translation, pooling and joint interpretation of the findings. RESULTS: Physicians and pharmacists encountered irrational use of antibiotics among their patients in Turkey. Physicians interviewed in the three European countries explained that Turkish migrants differ from non-migrants with respect to their attitudes towards antibiotics, for example by more often expecting to be prescribed antibiotics. All physicians and pharmacists in the selected countries reported to inform their patients on how to use antibiotics upon prescription; however, Turkish migrants poor language proficiency was considered as a substantial communication barrier by the physicians and pharmacists interviewed in the European countries. CONCLUSIONS: The study illustrated some aspects of irrational antibiotic use among the population in Turkey and Turkish migrants in selected European countries. It emphasized the need for closer community participation, adequate information campaigns, as well as in-service training of health care providers in Turkey. The strategies and interventions on rational antibiotic use should also be supported and encouraged by health care providers, who need to reach out to people with various cultural backgrounds.

To date, there is little data specifically addressing how care has been disrupted and the impact upon patient attitudes and beliefs. Herein, we describe the results of a national study investigating how COVID-19 has; (1) reduced access to services; (2) altered treatment and drug monitoring; (3) impacted on clinic follow-up; (4) changed patient beliefs regarding ongoing/future care. Methods We conducted an online survey of patients attending rheumatology clinics in the UK. Questions were developed by clinicians with input from patient charities and four expert patients. The survey was hosted online between 8 September and 8 October 2020. Results In total, 2,054 patients completed the survey and the average number of rheumatic conditions each patient reported was 1.981.38 with the most common being; rheumatoid arthritis (48%), lupus (20%), Sjogrens syndrome (19%), fibromyalgia (15%) and vasculitis (8%). More than half (57%) were told to shield, whilst 10% decided to shield of their own accord. Compared with before the pandemic, 57% felt it was difficult/very difficult to contact their rheumatologist. Regarding treatment, 15% reported difficulty obtaining their usual medication. Less than half (45%) of patients continued medication as previously and had no problem accessing it, although 21% said their usual drug monitoring had been discontinued. Overall, 3% stopped their treatment of their own accord. In all, 26% said their appointments in rheumatology clinics had been cancelled and they did not know when they would be seen again (4% reported no change in their outpatient follow-up). Prior to the pandemic, 13% of patients had received a telephone consultation, however, since the pandemic 60% had received one. Just 19% felt it was easy to be honest with their clinician via telephone. Only 33% were satisfied with the current level of care, 43% reported their rheumatology care was worse than pre-pandemic and 38% of patients felt they needed to see their rheumatologist but could not get an appointment. Over half (57%) of patients expressed worries about their future care. If offered an appointment in the next few months 66% said they would prefer it be face-to-face. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is the largest survey of patient experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic under rheumatological care anywhere in the world. We found more than half of patients were told to shield and one-in-ten decided to shield without being directly told to do so. Less than half of patients maintained relatively good access to their usual medication without necessary monitoring in many cases. In particular, patients express high levels of concern about their future care.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic time lag between infection and death.

It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir, while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably, due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931, these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.","output":"Role of different tautomers in the base-pairing abilities of some of the vital antiviral drugs used against COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endeavor to understand the human brain has seen more progress in the last few decades than in the previous two millennia.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and Scopus databases was conducted, from inception to 1 March 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the effect size (as Hedge's g) of vitamin C supplementation on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Finding from 10 trials with 836 participants revealed no significant improvement in mood status in overall analysis (n = 10, Hedge's g = 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.15 to 0.33; P = 0.465). However, subgroup analysis showed beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation in patients who were not prescribed antidepressants (subclinical depressed) (n = 5, Hedge's g: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01, P = 0.041; I2 = 0.00%,). CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant effect on mood status was observed in overall population, this meta-analysis tentatively suggests that vitamin C may produce mood-elevating effects in patients with subclinical depression.

Our situational analysis in collaboration with NPHIs in three countriesEthiopia, Nigeria and Pakistancharacterises these challenges. Our findings indicate that NPHIs role necessitates collection and analysis of data from multiple sources that do not routinely share data with public health authorities. Since initiating requests for access to new data sources can be a lengthy process, it is essential that NPHIs are routinely monitoring a broad set of priority indicators that are selected to reflect the country-specific context. NPHIs must also have the authority to be able to request rapid sharing of data from public and private sector organisations during health emergencies and to access additional human and financial resources during disease outbreaks. Finally, timely, transparent and informative communication of synthesised data from NPHIs will facilitate sustained data sharing with NPHIs from external organisations.

Chance fusion with cellular entities and intracellular replication of exogenotes started the journey of viruses on this planet. While replicating, pairing occurred in between the viral exogenotes and the host endogenote at their homologous sites. Therefore, both of the genes become recombined. Sometimes the viral exogenotes get integrated into the host genome resulting in a new reading frame in gene sequences. So, at every cycle of cellular infection with a viral particle, both the host and the parasite genes are recombined. The virulent the viral infection, the better is the chance of gene recombination of the host. Every stratum of cellular living forms has its viral pathogen. In lower living forms, depending on the habitats, a complete gene or its fragments may enter a cell using membrane receptors from the nucleic acid pool resulted from the lysis of cellular entities or viral particles, and gene recombination occurs. These are Transforming Principles or Transposable Elements. This lateral passage of genes through individuals is called Horizontal Gene Transfer. When mediated by viruses, it is called Transduction. Eventually, gene recombination occurs at the cellular level. Genetic Recombination is the basis of speciation, survival, evolution, and a way out of genetic bottleneck in cellular life. Humans too are facing a genetic bottleneck and living on the edge of extinction. Therefore, the viral infections in humans might be one of mother nature's designs to find a way out of this genetic bottleneck and survive and evolve further. ? 2020 iGlobal Research and Publishing Foundation.

Methadone is long-acting full opioid agonist which has been approved to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). Methadone can cause respiratory depression that may result in mortality. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic. MethodsThe Center for Disease Control and Preventions Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database, which draws data from death certificates, was used to find the unintentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999-2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10th revision codes: X40-44 with only data which was coded for methadone (T40.3). Data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, narcotic treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states, including the District of Columbia, for 2020 and corrected for population. ResultsThere have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in overdoses involving methadone. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50) = 3.05, p < .005). The correlations between overall methadone use (r(49) = +0.75, p < 0.001), and narcotic treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p < 0.001) were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with overdoses (r(49) = -.08, p = .57). ConclusionsOverdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. This mortality increase is much larger than the 5.3% elevation in calls involving methadone reported to poison control centers in the year following the March 16, 2020 loosening of methadone take-home regulations.

This association may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy that affects treatment efficacy. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of treatment bias in patient outcomes by studying the intensity of diagnostic procedures, treatment, and overall 30-day mortality in different age groups of patients with TBI. METHODS: Included in this study was consecutively admitted patients with TBI, aged  15 years, with a cerebral CT showing intracranial signs of trauma, during the time-period between 2015C2018. Data were extracted from our prospective quality control registry for admitted TBI patients. As a measure of management intensity in different age groups, we made a composite score, where placement of intracranial pressure monitor, ventilator treatment, and evacuation of intracranial mass lesion each gave one point. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses were performed using logistic multinomial regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,571 patients with TBI fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age was 58 years (range 15C98), 70% were men, and 39% were  65 years. Head injury severity was mild in 706 patients (45%), moderate in 437 (28%), and severe in 428 (27%). Increasing age was associated with less management intensity, as measured using the composite score, irrespective of head injury severity. Multivariate analyses showed that the following parameters had a significant association with an increased risk of death within 30 days of trauma: increasing age, severe comorbidities, severe TBI, Rotterdam CT-score  3, and low management intensity. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the management intensity of hospitalised patients with TBI decreased with advanced age and that low management intensity was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality. This suggests that the high mortality among elderly TBI patients may have an element of treatment bias and could in the future be limited with a more aggressive management regime.","output":"Traumatic brain injurythe effects of patient age on treatment intensity and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obesity and comorbid conditions are associated with worse outcomes related to COVID-19. Moreover, social distancing adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic may predict weight gain due to decreased physical activity, increased emotional eating, and social isolation. While early studies suggest that many individuals struggled with weight management during the pandemic, less is known about healthy eating and weight control behaviors among those enrolled in weight loss programs. METHODS: The present study evaluated weight management efforts among weight loss program participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 55, 90.9% female, 36% white, M(age) = 49.8) demographics and body mass index were collected two months prior to the COVID-19 statewide shutdown. During the lockdown, an online survey assessed health behaviors, coping, COVID-19 experiences (e.g., social distancing, loneliness), and weight gain. Logistic regressions examined demographics, health behaviors, and COVID-19 factors as predictors of weight gain. RESULTS: Most participants (58%) reported gaining weight during COVID-19. Weight gain was predicted by challenges with the following health behaviors: physical activity, monitoring food intake, choosing healthy foods, and emotional eating. Loneliness and working remotely significantly related to emotional eating, physical activity, and choosing healthy foods. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness and working remotely increased the difficulty of weight management behaviors during COVID-19 among weight loss program participants. However, staying active, planning and tracking food consumption, choosing healthy foods, and reducing emotional eating protected against weight gain.

Using methods-bandit algorithms-similar to those used to search for other kinds of lost or hidden objects, from downed aircraft or underground oil deposits, we can address the explore v. exploit tradeoff facing active surveillance efforts and optimize the deployment of mobile testing resources to maximize the yield of new SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses. These bandit algorithms can be implemented easily as a guide to active case finding for SARS-CoV-2. A simple Thompson sampling algorithm and an extension of it to integrate spatial correlation in the data are now embedded in a fully functional prototype of a web app to allow policymakers to use either of these algorithms to target SARS-CoV-2 testing. In this instance, potential testing locations were identified by using mobility data from UberMedia to target high-frequency venues in Columbus, Ohio, as part of a planned feasibility study of the algorithms in the field. However, it is easily adaptable to other jurisdictions, requiring only a set of candidate test locations with point-to-point distances between all locations, whether or not mobility data are integrated into decision making in choosing places to test.","output":"Maximizing the Efficiency of Active Case Finding for SARS-CoV-2 Using Bandit Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to spread world-wide, new symptoms associated with the disease continue to appear Common manifestations include fever, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal illness In addition, COVID is known to induce coagulopathy Here, we present the case of a 17-year-old male who presented with a massive hemopneumothorax and was found to incidentally be positive for Covid-19 We suspect that he had a primary pneumothorax from a bleb and the hemothorax could've been induced by the coagulopathic state induced by COVID infection","output":"Spontaneous hemopneumothorax in an adolescent with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate factors that might influence inappropriate prescriptions of antibiotics (ABs) by UK-based general dental practitioners (GDPs) in their management of acute dental pain in adults in primary dental care.Methods A questionnaire was circulated via social media to UK-based GDPs. The questionnaire examined GDPs' likelihood of issuing an inappropriate AB in two hypothetical clinical scenarios.Results A total of 205 questionnaires were completed, of which 198 were included for analysis. The resulting data were analysed to try and identify factors that correlated with an increased likelihood of an inappropriate AB prescription being issued for each clinical scenario. The results suggested the following factors as being associated with a statistically greater chance of the survey respondent issuing an inappropriate AB prescription: no postgraduate qualification; received their primary dental qualification from a non-UK university; scheduled appointments of less than 20 minutes; and low confidence in their ability to provide adequate local anaesthesia for the patients in the clinical scenario.Conclusions Four factors were shown to be associated with dentists' stated intention to prescribe ABs for acute dental pain, not in accordance with guidance. These results should guide further research to understand the significance of appropriate AB prescribing on the quality of urgent dental care. While the total number of respondents was too low to enable the results to be generalised, it is hoped that the results may help guide future research.

This is the focus of the study described in this paper. Following a design-based research (DBR) approach and guided by concepts from the socio-cultural perspective and human-computer interaction (HCI), we design, test, and evaluate a teacher-facing LA dashboard, the Canvas Discussion Analytics Dashboard (CADA), in real educational settings. The goal of this dashboard is to support teachers roles in online environments through insights into students participation and discourse patterns. We evaluate CADA through 10 in-depth interviews with university teachers to examine their experiences using CADA in seven blended undergraduate and graduate courses over a one-year period. The findings suggest that engaging teachers throughout the analytics tool design process and giving them control/agency over LA tools can favour their adoption in practice. Additionally, the alignment of dashboard metrics with relevant theoretical constructs allows teachers to monitor the learning designs and make course design changes on the fly. The teachers in this study emphasise the need for LA dashboards to provide actionable insights by moving beyond what things are towards how things should be. This study has several contributions. First, we make an artefact contribution (e.g. CADA), an LA dashboard to support teachers with insights into students online discussions. Second, by leveraging theory, and working with the teachers to develop and implement a dashboard in authentic teaching environments, we make an empirical, theoretical and methodological contribution to the field of learning analytics and technology enhanced learning.

The mutated and wild type S genes were expressed by means of recombinant vaccinia viruses and it could be shown that the mutated S protein was not cleaved when it was expressed in mouse DBT cells, in contrast to the wild type S protein. Nevertheless, the non-cleaved S protein induced extensive syncytium formation in mouse DBT cells.

Yet, detailed information on how drugs are being prescribed and dispensed to pediatric populations is not documented in China. AIM: The study objective was to analyze the details of medicine use and categorize the types of inappropriate use of medications on children. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on the prescriptions of pediatric outpatients aged < 18 years from 2019 to 2020 at a major Chinese tertiary academic center. Each age groups demographic and clinical characteristics were collected, and the ratios of inappropriate prescriptions were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of pediatric outpatients was 652,152, and 49.37% (322000) were prescribed medications, in which the most widely used medicines were respiratory, anti-infectives, and Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs). The prevalence rate of inappropriate prescriptions reached 20.49%, and in 2019 it was higher (21.71%) than that in 2020 (18.36%). The top three common inappropriate categories were indication-related off-label drug use, improper administration frequency, and overdosing, accounting for 67.93, 17.80 and 11.06% of all inappropriate prescriptions, respectively. The inappropriate prescriptions were more likely seen in patients aged 2C5 years and respiratory medicines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed database to identify relevant articles written in English/Spanish, and published through May 15, 2020. Search terms included: coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, COVID, renal transplantation, and kidney transplantation. Case series were considered eligible, and case reports excluded. Thirty-four articles were included in the review. RESULTS: KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis.

A teleproctoring concept using optical see-through head-mounted displays with a proctor's ability to see and, more important, virtually interact in the operator's visual field is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test conditions were created for simulated proctoring using a bifurcation aneurysm flow model for WEB device deployment. The operator in the angiography suite wore a Magic Leap-1 optical see-through head-mounted display to livestream his or her FOV to a proctor's computer in an adjacent building. A Web-based application (Spatial) was used for the proctor to virtually interact in the operator's visual space. Tested elements included the quality of the livestream, communication, and the proctor's ability to interact in the operator's environment using mixed reality. A hotspot and a Wi-Fi-based network were tested. RESULTS: The operator successfully livestreamed the angiography room environment and his FOV of the monitor to the remotely located proctor. The proctor communicated and guided the operator through the procedure over the optical see-through head-mounted displays, a process that was repeated several times. The proctor used mixed reality and virtual space sharing to successfully project images, annotations, and data in the operator's FOV for highlighting any device or procedural aspects.

While detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed, I suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the John Hopkins University database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics. I show that, after few days from the beginning of the outbreak, the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression. The variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only (r^2=0.91) on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the instantaneous apparent lethality rates are as different as 9% in Italy and 0.4% in Germany. Extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests, I obtain a death rate of 0.012+/- 0.012, in agreement with other estimates. The inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50% of cases were undetected in most countries, with more than 90% undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as Italy.

The simulation results show that external shocks of different degrees will increase the number of initial infected enterprises and lead to the increase in credit risk contagion speed but have no significant impact on network steady state;the speed of credit risk contagion is positively correlated with network complexity but not significantly affected by network size;core enterprises infected will increase the rate of credit risk contagion. The intensity of policy intervention has obvious curative effect on the risk caused by external shock. When the supply chain financial network is affected by external shocks, the intensity, time, and pertinence of policy response can effectively prevent the credit risk contagion. ? 2021 Wentao Chen et al.","output":"On Credit Risk Contagion of Supply Chain Finance under COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens typically existing in biofilm formation and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, although unrelated phenomena, have demonstrated the urgent need for methods to combat such increasing threats. New avenues of research for natural molecules with desirable properties to alleviate this situation have, therefore, been expanding. Biosurfactants comprise a group of unique and varied amphiphilic molecules of microbial origin capable of interacting with lipidic membranes/components of microorganisms and altering their physicochemical properties. These features have encouraged closer investigations of these microbial metabolites as new pharmaceutics with potential applications in clinical, hygiene and therapeutic fields. Mounting evidence has indicated that biosurfactants have antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities that are exploitable in new anticancer treatments and wound healing applications. Some biosurfactants have already been approved for use in clinical, food and environmental fields, while others are currently under investigation and development as antimicrobials or adjuvants to antibiotics for microbial suppression and biofilm eradication strategies. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, biosurfactants are now being explored as an alternative to current products or procedures for effective cleaning and handwash formulations, antiviral plastic and fabric surface coating agents for shields and masks. In addition, biosurfactants have shown promise as drug delivery systems and in the medicinal relief of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"Recent Advances in Biomedical, Therapeutic and Pharmaceutical Applications of Microbial Surfactants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted financial markets and the real economy worldwide.

Few studies have examined temporal trends and determinants of in-hospital mortality among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a life-threatening condition that requires emergency medical care. Using nation-wide data before, during and after the Wuhan lockdown, we aimed to depict temporal patterns and major determinants of STEMI in-hospital mortality in China across five time periods of the COVID-19 epidemic. We analyzed the data of 283,661 STEMI patients who were admitted to 4,487 chest-pain-centers across China, from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. Compared with the period before the lockdown, STEMI in-hospital mortality increased by 25% (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.16C1.34) during Early Lockdown, by 12% (OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.03C1.22) during Later Lockdown, by 35% (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.21C1.50) during Early Lift, and returned to pre-COVID risk (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.95C1.14) during Later Lift. For each time-period, we observed a clear mortality gradient by timing and types of revascularization procedure. In conclusion, the COVID-19 epidemic had a significant adverse impact on STEMI in-hospital mortality, with bimodal peaks during early lockdown and early lift periods and clear mortality gradients by timing and types of revascularization procedure, independent of the time periods.

In the area surrounding Pavia during the critical stage of the outbreak (March-April), 1,225 of the documented 4,200 deaths were related to COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 181/100,000 inhabitants and an increase in deaths of 138% compared to the same period in previous years. AIM: Our aim was to report the experience of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Pavia (Lombardy), including the lessons learned and future perspectives regarding the management of COVID-19 patients who developed severe acute ischemia with impending lower limb loss or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective data collection of COVID-19 patients with severe acute ischemia of the lower limbs or DVT observed in our Department during the period March 1(st) to April 30(th) 2020. Primary outcomes of the analysis were postoperative mortality for all patients and amputation rates only in those COVID-19 patients suffering from acute lower limb ischemia. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of the disease among admitted COVID-19 patients, and any possible correlation between inflammatory parameters, thrombolytic status, and the presence of acute ischemia or DVT. RESULTS: We observed 38 patients (28 male) with severe COVID-19 infection (6 with lower limb arterial thrombosis and 32 with DVT). The median age was 64 years (range 30-94 years). In the arterial group, 3 had thrombosis on plaque and 3 on healthy arteries (\\"simple\\" arterial thrombosis). All underwent operative or hybrid (open/endo) revascularization; 1 patient died from major organ failure (MOF) and one patient underwent major amputation. In the DVT group, 9 (28%) patients died from MOF, despite aggressive medical therapy. In patients with \\"simple\\" arterial thrombosis and those with DVT, we observed a decrease in inflammatory parameters (CRP) and in D-dimer and fibrinogen after aggressive therapy (p <0.001).

Vaccination is an effective measure to control the disease caused by TGEV. METHODS: In this study, cell-cultured TGEV HN-2012 strain was inactivated by formaldehyde (FA), -propiolactone (BPL) or binaryethylenimine (BEI), respectively. Then the inactivated TGEV vaccine was prepared with freund's adjuvant, and the immunization effects were evaluated in mice. The TGEV-specific IgG level was detected by ELISA. The positive rates of CD4(+), CD8(+), CD4(+)IFN-(+), CD4(+)IL-4(+) T lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry assay. Lymphocyte proliferation assay and gross pathology and histopathology examination were also performed to assess the three different inactivating reagents in formulating TGEV vaccine. RESULTS: The results showed that the TGEV-specific IgG level in FA group (n = 17) was earlier and stronger, while the BEI group produced much longer-term IgG level. The lymphocyte proliferation test demonstrated that the BEI group had a stronger ability to induce spleen lymphocyte proliferation. The positive rates of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets of peripheral blood lymphocyte in BEI group was higher than that in FA group and BPL groups by flow cytometry assay. The positive rate of CD4(+)IFN-(+) T lymphocyte subset was the highest in the BPL group, and the positive rate of CD4(+)IL-4(+) T lymphocyte subset was the highest in the FA group. There were no obvious pathological changes in the vaccinated mice and the control group after the macroscopic and histopathological examination.

We found support for long-term negative effects of noise on tree seedling recruitment, evenness of woody plants and increasingly dissimilar vegetation communities with differences in noise levels. Furthermore, seedling recruitment and plant community composition did not recover following noise removal, possibly due in part to a lag in recovery among animals that disperse and pollinate plants.

Parents help their adult children with financial transfers and hands-on-support and childcare, while children in mid-life often support their older parents with help and care. However, there is profound social inequalities linked to intergenerational transfers. While there is some research on inequality for some types of intergenerational transfers and some transfer directions, there is still no conclusive study bringing together all different support types between multiple generations from different social backgrounds over time. In our view, taking a longitudinal multi-generational perspective is essential to capture dependencies and negotiations within families from different socio-economic backgrounds within different regional contexts. If middle-aged parents have to take care of their own older parents, they have fewer resources for their(grand-)children, who might then receive less attention and support from them. This may differ according to access to support from public or private institutions. Here, country and regional specifics have a huge impact on support patterns within the family, which can only be captured when looking into developments and change. Using six waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we look at intergenerational transfers between multiple generations over time across European regions, considering mid-aged Europeans in the sandwich position between older parents and children and include multiple transfer directions and types over time to assess the links between social inequality and intergenerational solidarity in Europes ageing societies.

The peptide showed weak activity against Gram-negative bacteria (MLCs  75.0 M) but potent efficacy towards Gram-positive bacteria (MLCs  6.25 M). E2EM-lin adopted an -helical structure in the presence of bacterial membranes that increased as pH was increased from 6 to 8 ( 15.5C26.9%), whilst similar increases in pH enhanced the ability of the peptide to penetrate ( 2.3C5.1 mN m(?1)) and lyse ( 15.1C32.5%) these membranes. Theoretical analysis predicted that this membranolytic mechanism involved a tilted segment, that increased along the -helical long axis of E2EM-lin (1C23) in the N  C direction, with ? < H > increasing overall from circa ? 0.8 to ? 0.3. In combination, these data showed that E2EM-lin killed bacteria via novel mechanisms that were enhanced by alkaline conditions and involved the formation of tilted and membranolytic, -helical structure. The preference of E2EM-lin for Gram-positive bacteria over Gram-negative organisms was primarily driven by the superior ability of phosphatidylglycerol to induce -helical structure in the peptide as compared to phosphatidylethanolamine. These data were used to generate a novel pore-forming model for the membranolytic activity of E2EM-lin, which would appear to be the first, major reported instance of pH dependent AMPs with alkaline optima using tilted structure to drive a pore-forming process.

This study aimed to describe the cognition and social behaviors related to COVID-19 among medical college students in China and to explore the relevant factors that have affected individual social behaviors. The study could enrich practical research on the social behaviors of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From February to April 2020, online questionnaire survey was conducted meticulously. Based on their majors, the students were divided into a medical student group (249 cases) and a near-peer medical student group (397 cases). Descriptive statistics was used to elaborate the cognition related to the pandemic and the status quo of social behaviors among these students. A multiple linear regression model was established to analyze the relevant factors affecting individual social behaviors from various perspectives during the pandemic. RESULTS: Regarding the cognition situation: 76.32% of those surveyed had good pandemic awareness, and the average general cognition score was 30.55  3.17 points. In terms of social behaviors, the average scores for purposive rational actions and affective actions during the outbreak were relatively high, scoring 8.85  1.72 points (>10 points) and 4.32  1.41 points (>6 points), respectively, while the average value rational actions score was relatively low at 5.95  1.90 points (>10 points). The results of the multiple linear regression model showed that urban college students had higher scores for purposive rational actions; college students with the CCP membership had higher value rational actions scores; school and major were also significant factors affecting affective actions scoring. The COVID-19 cognition score had a significant effect on the social behavior score in all dimensions (P < 0.001).

METHODS: This multicenter study was carried out retrospectively on 3551 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and whose blood groups were recorded during the time of hospitalization. As control groups, 22133 individuals medical data who were admitted to the blood bank affiliated with our hospitals during the last year was used. The differences between the blood groups and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 3551 patients, A Rh (+) blood group was found to be in a higher ratio in the case group than controls, with increased risk to be infected (case: 41.3% vs. control: 38.8%), (OR 1.113; 95% CI: 1.036C1.197; p=0.003). Meanwhile O Rh (+) blood group ratios were significantly lower in the case group than in the control group (case: 26% vs. control: 28.3%) (OR 0.862; 95% CI: 0.823C0.966; p=0.005).

These economies include the European Union, the U.S., China, Japan and Korea. In Russia, these trends are typically viewed through the prism of risk: carbon neutrality implies a dramatic decrease in demand for fossil fuels, the production and export of which still play a key role in the Russian economy. However, apart from the risk to traditional sources of income, the global transition to carbon neutrality creates new opportunities for the development and diversification of the Russian economy, as well as for international cooperation in new areas. This article is devoted to the general identification of such opportunities. The authors perform a content analysis of the official plans of the largest economies related to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050-60. The main areas in which actions will be taken are identified. The current state of the corresponding industries in Russia and the possibilities for improvement are investigated.

To perform their functions, many GPCRs must accumulate inside primary cilia, microtubule-based plasma membrane protrusions working as cellular antennae. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying GPCR ciliary targeting remain poorly understood. Serotonin receptor 6 (HTR6) and somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) are two brain-enriched ciliary GPCRs involved in cognition and pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Although the third intracellular loops (IC3) of HTR6 and SSTR3 suffice to target non-ciliary GPCRs to cilia, these IC3s are dispensable for ciliary targeting of HTR6 and SSTR3 themselves, suggesting these GPCRs contain additional ciliary targeting sequences (CTSs). Herein, we discover and characterize novel CTSs in HTR6 and SSTR3 C-terminal tails (CT). These CT-CTSs (CTS2) act redundantly with IC3-CTSs (CTS1), each being sufficient for ciliary targeting. In HTR6, RKQ and LPG motifs are critical for CTS1 and CTS2 function, respectively, whereas in SSTR3 these roles are mostly fulfilled by AP[AS]CQ motifs in IC3 and juxtamembrane residues in CT.

Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of HbA1c levels and outpatient diabetes treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: We included 1,126 hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19 for analysis, among whom mean age was 68 years, 50% were male, 75% were Black, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2, 98% had type 2 diabetes, mean HbA1c was 7.5%, and 33.1% died. HbA1c levels were not associated with mortality in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, but an outpatient regimen with any insulin treatment was strongly predictive. Additionally, age, sex, and BMI interacted such that in all age categories, mortality was higher with increasing BMI in males compared with females. CONCLUSIONS: In this large U.S. cohort of hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19, insulin treatment, as a possible proxy for diabetes duration, and obesity rather than long-term glycemic control were predictive of mortality.

The nanoparticles are noncytotoxic when directing these biological activities. Mechanism studies for the anti-inflammation aspects of Fe-Cur NPs were systematically carried out, in which the infected cells and tissues were alleviated through downregulating levels of several important inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6), decreasing the intracellular Ca(2+) release, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasomes, and suppressing NF-B signaling pathways. In addition, we performed both the intratracheal and intravenous injection of Fe-Cur NPs in mice experiencing ALI and, importantly, found that the accumulation of such nanozymes was enhanced in lung tissue (better than free curcumin drugs), demonstrating its promising therapeutic efficiency in two different administration methods. We showed that the inflammation reduction of Fe-Cur NPs was effective in animal experiments and that ROS scavenging was also effectively achieved in lung tissue. Finally, we revealed that Fe-Cur NPs can decrease the level of macrophage cells (CD11b(lo)F4/80(hi)) and CD3(+)CD45(+) T cells in mice, which could help suppress the inflammation cytokine storm caused by ALI. Overall, this work has developed the strategy of using Fe-Cur NPs as nanozymes to scavenge intracellular ROS and as an anti-inflammation nanodrugs to synergistically cure ALI, which may serve as a promising therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of this deadly disease. Fe-Cur NP nanozymes were designed to attenuate ALI by clearing intracellular ROS and alleviating inflammation synergistically.

METHODS: Allelic effects were obtained from the largest SSc Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to date (9 095 SSc and 17 584 healthy controls with European ancestry). The best-fitting GRS was identified under the additive model in an independent cohort that comprised 400 patients with SSc and 571 controls. Additionally, GRS for clinical subtypes (limited cutaneous SSc and diffuse cutaneous SSc) and serological subtypes (anti-topoisomerase positive (ATA+) and anti-centromere positive (ACA+)) were generated. We combined the estimated GRS with demographic and immunological parameters in a multivariate generalised linear model. RESULTS: The best-fitting SSc GRS included 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between patients with SSc and controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)=0.673). Moreover, the GRS differentiated between SSc and other IMIDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj?gren's syndrome.

CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Schwannomas originating from the greater omentum are less common than in the lesser omentum due to the paucity of nervous tissue in the former. They can undergo malignant transformation and the most common presentation is abdominal pain/discomfort. Larger tumors may cause catastrophic bleeding. Prompt surgery should be offered and wide local excision with sufficient margins be performed when there is suspicion of malignancy. Schwannomas presenting with multiple or synchronous lesions are commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, and Carney's complex. Whether this co-occurrence is simply incidental or has a causal relationship remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Benign schwannoma of the greater omentum is rare and only requires complete tumor excision. However, surgeons should be aware that synchronous presentation of cervical cancer is possible and that thorough examination of both sites should be undertaken when either primary tumor presents.","output":"Large benign schwannoma of the greater omentum with synchronous cervical cancer: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore the active compounds of Feiduqing in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia Method(s): The Chinese medicine system pharmacology analysis platform (TCMSP) was used to obtain the three Chinese medicine-related components and targets of Oroxylum indicum, Gardenia jasminoides and Sophora flavescens of Feiduqing, and the genes corresponding to the targets were queried through the UniProt database The STRING platform was used to build the target PPI network DAVID was used to perform GO biological processes and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was used to perform network topology analysis on core targets Cytoscape 3 7 0 was used to construct a component-target network analysis to predict the mechanism of Feiduqing The core active compound of Feiduqing was molecularly docked with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolase, and the first three compounds with the lowest binding energy were docked with angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) Result(s): The component-target network included 269 nodes and 4 204 edges, including 50 components such as quercetin, beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, etc, and key targets included JUN, AKT1, TP53, PTGS2, FOS, ESR1, etc The function enrichment analysis of GO yielded 2 187 (P 0 05), including 1 877 biological process (BP) entries, 105 cellular components (CC) entries, and 205 molecular functions (MF) entries Twenty-five signal pathways were screened by KEGG enrichment analysis (P 0 05), mainly including hepatitis B, pathways in cancer, TNF signaling pathway, pancreatic cancer, toxoplasmosis pathway, etc The active ingredients with the lowest molecular docking binding energy acting on SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase were luteolin (-26 78 kJ/mol), quercetin (-26 36 kJ/mol), 8-prenyl-kaempferol (-25 94 kJ/mol) Conclusion(s): The active compound of Feiduqing may have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19 through the action on targets such as JUN, AKT1, TP53, PTGS2, FOS, ESR1, binding with angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and regulating many signaling pathways Copyright ? 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs All right reserved","output":"Exploration on active compounds of Feiduqing for treatment of COVID-19 based on network pharmacology and molecular docking [Chinese]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019.

The neuronal isoform of BIN1 (BIN1V1), but not the non-neuronal isoform (BIN1V9), has been shown to regulate tau-pathology and A generation via RAB5-mediated endocytosis in neurons. BIN1 directly interacts with RIN3 to initiate RAB5-mediated endocytosis, which is essential for -secretase (BACE1)-mediated -secretase cleavage of -amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate Amyloid- (A), the key component of senile plaques in AD. Understanding the regulatory roles of BIN1 (neuronal BIN1V1) and RIN3 in -secretase mediated cleavage of APP and A generation is key to developing novel therapeutics to delay or prevent AD progression. Neuronal and non-neuronal isoforms of BIN1 (BIN1V1 and BIN1V9, respectively) were introduced with RIN3 into an in vitro cell-based system to test RIN3-dependent effects of neuronal BIN1V1 and non-neuronal BIN1V9 on -secretase-mediated cleavage of APP and A generation. Confocal microscopy was performed to examine RIN3-dependent subcellular localization of BIN1V1 and BIN1V9. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the effects of RIN3 and BIN1V1/BIN1V9 on -secretase mediated processing of APP. We enriched cells expressing BIN1V1 without or with RIN3 via FACS to measure A generation using A ELISA assay, and to evaluate APP internalization by chasing biotinylated or antibody-labeled cell surface APP. Neuronal BIN1V1 containing the CLAP domain and non-neuronal BIN1V9 lacking the CLAP domain are the major isoforms present in the brain. Employing confocal microscopy, we showed that RIN3 differentially regulates the recruitment of both BIN1V1 and BIN1V9 into RAB5-endosomes. We further showed that BIN1V1, but not BIN1V9, downregulates -secretase (BACE1)-mediated processing of APP in a RIN3-dependent manner. Overexpression of BIN1V1 also attenuated A generation in a RIN3-dependent manner. Using cell-based internalization assays, we show BIN1V1, but not BIN1V9, delays the endocytosis of APP, but not of BACE1, into early endosomes, thereby spatially and temporally separating these two proteins into different cellular compartments, resulting in reduced cleavage of APP by BACE1 and reduced A generation-all in a RIN3-dependent manner. Finally, we show that RIN3 sequesters BIN1V1 in RAB5-positive early endosomes, likely via the CLAP-domain, resulting in attenuated -secretase processing of APP and A generation by delaying endocytosis of APP. Our findings provide new mechanistic data on how two AD-associated molecules, RIN3 and BIN1 (neuronal BIN1V1), interact to govern A production, implicating these two proteins as potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of AD.","output":"The neuronal-specific isoform of BIN1 regulates -secretase cleavage of APP and A generation in a RIN3-dependent manner."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Many antiviral agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, have been used to treat COVID-19, without being broadly accepted. QTc prolongation is a worrisome adverse effect, scarcely studied in pediatrics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paediatric patients affected from COVID-19 who received antivirals were matched (1:2) with controls not infected nor exposed. Electrocardiograms were prospectively analyzed at baseline, during the first 72 h of treatment and after 72 h. RESULTS: Eleven (22.9%) out of 48 patients admitted due to COVID-19 (MarchCJuly 2020) received antiviral therapy. All had underlying diseases: congenital heart disease (4/11; 36.4%) and immunosuppression (3/11; 27.3%) stand out. 5/11 (45.5%) received treatment at baseline with a potential effect on QTc. There where no differences observed in the baseline QTc between cases and controls: 414.8 ms (49.2) vs 416.5 ms (29.4), (P = .716). Baseline long QT was observed in 2/11 cases and 2/22. Among cases, 10/11 (90.9%) received hydroxychloroquine, mainly associated with azithromycin (8/11; 72.7%), 3 received lopinavir/ritonavir and one remdesivir. The median increase in QTc after 72 h under treatment was 28.9 ms [IQR 48.7] (P = .062). 4/11 (36.4%) patients had a long QTc at 72 h, resulting in 3 patients 500 ms; treatment was stopped in one (QTc 510 ms) but ventricular arrhythmias were not documented. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antivirals caused an increase on the QTc interval after 72 h of treatment, being the QTc long in 36.3% of the patients, although no arrhythmic events were observed. The use of hydroxychloroquine and antivirals requires active QTc monitoring and it is recommended to discontinue treatment if QTc > 500 ms.","output":"QTc interval prolongation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with antiviral drugs()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toona sinensis Roem has an important value as a type of traditional vegetable and Chinese medicinal herb, and is also a valuable source of wood in China.

Our results indicated a relatively low level of genetic diversity both at species (Hs = 0.1662, 0.2098, respectively) and population levels (Hs = 0.0978, 0.1145, respectively). Molecular variance analyses revealed a relatively high degree of differentiation among populations (GST = 0.3901, 0.4498), and low levels of gene flow (Nm = 0.7816 and 0.6116).

The correlation of genetic relationships among populations fits well with their geographical distribution (Mantel test; r = 0.7236 and 0.6789, respectively).

However, because a state of emergency has never been declared in Japan, its effects remain unknown. The required countermeasures are similar to those implemented in the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Miyazaki in 2010. This study aimed to quantitatively estimate the effect of the declaration in 2010 and investigate the nature of the epidemic based on the day on which the declaration took effect. METHODS Only publicly available data were used. Data for farms in the most affected town were analyzed. A modified susceptible-infected-recovered model was used to estimate the effect and for the simulation. Another model was used to estimate the effective reproduction number. RESULTS After the declaration, the intra-bovine transmission rate decreased by 18.1 %, and there were few days when the effective reproduction number was >1.0. A few weeks delay in the declaration significantly increased the possibility of epidemic, number of farms at peak, and final infection scale. CONCLUSIONS Based on the substantial decrease in the transmission rate after the declaration of a state of emergency in 2010, a future declaration will have a similar effect for a new infectious disease even though a direct extrapolation is not valid. Although a declaration should be carefully considered owing to the potential socioeconomic effects, it is essential to prepare for the implementation given that a delay of only a few weeks should be acceptable.","output":"Quantitative effects of a declaration of a state of emergency on foot-and-mouth disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide responsible for about 10 million deaths per year.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or loss of CEP63 decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection or loss of CEP63 also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactors, Mindbomb1 (MIB1) and DTX4, ubiquitin ligases that respectively activate and degrade TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV NS3 binds CEP63 to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response. In addition to identifying a mechanism by which CEP63 controls the innate immune responses in ZIKV infection, we propose that the altered centrosomal organization caused by altered CEP63 function may contribute to ZIKV-associated microcephaly.","output":"Zika virus alters centrosome organization to suppress the innate immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This retrospective study evaluated long-term weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, quality of life (QoL), and food tolerance after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).

We investigated the effects of DAC treatment on the myeloid MDS cell line SKM-1 and investigated the role of FOXO3A, a potentially tumor-suppressive transcription factor, by silencing its expression prior to DAC treatment. We found that FOXO3A exists in an inactive, hyperphosphorylated form in SKM-1 cells, but that DAC both induces FOXO3A expression and reactivates the protein by reducing its phosphorylation level. Furthermore, we show that this FOXO3A activation is responsible for the DAC-induced differentiation of SKM-1 cells into monocytes, as well as for SKM-1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy.

The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection.

It is reported that the negative consequences of understaffing and underfunding have worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This is a cross-sectional study that aimed to examine short and long-term District and Community nursing working conditions. The objectives were to assess the prevalence of understaffing and missed care and the relationship between individual and organisational factors and their association with missed care outcome. We further explored the relationship between additional caseload, staffing levels and missed care. Methods: We developed a questionnaire based on the validated MISSCARE survey. Outcome measures were, number of vacancies per team, staffing levels, reported incidence of missed care, type of missed care, length of shift and overtime. Results: Only 23% of teams reported having no vacancies. The mean staffing ratio was reported at 60%, including agency/bank staff (0.591.5). Prevalence of missed care was relatively high (60%). The distribution of types of missed care was spread evenly across all types of nursing care. A backward stepwise regression analysis showed that the Proportion of Permanent staff capacity OR=7.9 (95% CI 0.09-0.65), Active Caseload Size OR= 5.5 (95% CI: 1.0 C 1.003), Number of RNs on the team (OR 4.8 (95% CI:1.003-1.058) and Amount of Overtime worked (OR= 3.9 (95% CI:0.98-1.0) variable are statistically significant predictors of missed care. The analysis showed an increase in additional allocated cases per RN as the permanent staff proportion decreased to 70%, at which point the likelihood of reported Missed Care outcome peaks. Conclusion: The compromised quality of care related to human resources and organisational aspects of the nursing process. Where RNs worked longer hours to make up for the backlog of cases, the prevalence of missed care was more likely. Longer working hours in the community increased the risk of compromised care and sub-optimal patient care.

ASCs were isolated from peri uterine fat tissue of the rats. Then the rats received a 30 Gy single dose radiation to their buttocks skin using gamma radiation. Next day stem cells were transplanted subcutaneously in 16 rats as the case group. A group of 16 rats was considered as control group with radiation but no transplantation of stem cells. Then rats were examined and observed by macroscopic analysis and phenotypic scores during 4 weeks of follow up. Results The wound size in control group was significantly higher than case group in the second, third and fourth weeks of evaluation (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in skin lesion severity, pathological factors, and the onset of recovery signs between two groups (P>0.05).

These cases are poorly defined in the literature and the course of patients with this pattern of disease is unclear. OBJECTIVE To describe an uncommon and potentially treatable pattern of acute bronchiolitis that has been termed fibrosing bronchiolitis. MAIN RESULTS We report three patients with respiratory failure and acute onset of probable infectious or inhalational bronchiolitis that was characterized by centrilobular nodules and a variable tree-in-bud appearance on computed tomography. All patients showed an uncommon pattern of bronchiolitis on surgical lung biopsy. The pathologic abnormalities were confined to the bronchioles and consisted of reepithelialized, partially collagenized and variably polypoid plugs of granulation tissue that narrowed the bronchiolar lumens. All three patients improved dramatically on immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS These cases of fibrosing bronchiolitis represent an uncommon pattern of acute bronchiolitis that is reversible if detected at an early stage.

We did a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis evaluating the epidemiology, genetic basis, and treatment outcomes associated with bedaquiline resistance, using data from South Africa (2015-19). METHODS Patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis starting bedaquiline-based treatment had surveillance samples submitted at baseline, month 2, and month 6, along with demographic information. Culture-positive baseline and post-baseline isolates had phenotypic resistance determined. Eligible patients were aged 12 years or older with a positive culture sample at baseline or, if the sample was invalid or negative, a sample within 30 days of the baseline sample submitted for bedaquiline drug susceptibility testing. For the longitudinal study, the first surveillance sample had to be phenotypically susceptible to bedaquiline for inclusion. Whole-genome sequencing was done on bedaquiline-resistant isolates and a subset of bedaquiline-susceptible isolates. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases tuberculosis reference laboratory, and national tuberculosis surveillance databases were matched to the Electronic Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Register. We assessed baseline resistance prevalence, mutations, transmission, cumulative resistance incidence, and odds ratios (ORs) associating risk factors for resistance with patient outcomes. FINDINGS Between Jan 1, 2015, and July 31, 2019, 8041 patients had surveillance samples submitted, of whom 2023 were included in the cross-sectional analysis and 695 in the longitudinal analysis. Baseline bedaquiline resistance prevalence was 38% (76 of 2023 patients; 95% CI 29-46), and it was associated with previous exposure to bedaquiline or clofazimine (OR 71, 95% CI 23-219) and with rifampicin-resistant or MDR tuberculosis with additional resistance to either fluoroquinolones or injectable drugs (pre-extensively-drug resistant [XDR] tuberculosis: 42, 17-105) or to both (XDR tuberculosis: 48, 20-117). Rv0678 mutations were the sole genetic basis of phenotypic resistance. Baseline resistance could be attributed to previous bedaquiline or clofazimine exposure in four (53%) of 76 patients and to primary transmission in six (79%). Odds of successful treatment outcomes were lower in patients with baseline bedaquiline resistance (05, 03-1). Resistance during treatment developed in 16 (23%) of 695 patients, at a median of 90 days (IQR 62-195), with 12 of these 16 having pre-XDR or XDR. INTERPRETATION Bedaquiline resistance was associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Rapid assessment of bedaquiline resistance, especially when patients were previously exposed to bedaquiline or clofazimine, should be prioritised at baseline or if patients remain culture-positive after 2 months of treatment. Preventing resistance by use of novel combination therapies, current treatment optimisation, and patient support is essential.

However, there are insufficient data about the effect of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 prognosis in non-diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between random blood glucose levels measured at the time of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in non-diabetic patients. Methods: A nationwide retrospective cohort of non-diabetic patients with con?rmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. The patients were stratified into three groups according to blood glucose levels which were <100 mg/dL in group-1, in the range of 100-139 mg/dl in group-2, and the range of 140-199 mg/dl in group-3. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the groups. The primary outcome was mortality. Results: A total of 12,817 non-diabetic patients (median age [IQR]: 44 [25] years, females: 50.9%) were included. Patients in group-2 (5%) and group-3 (14%) had higher mortality rates than patients in group-1 (2.1%). The rates of hospitalization, hospital stays longer than 8 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay more than 6 days, and mechanical ventilation were also significantly higher in group-3 patients. Likewise, glucose levels in the range of 140-199 mg/dL were an independent associate of mortality and composite of ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation.

APPROACH: Multiple audio and video inputs capturing an outpatient clinic setting were routed through Open Broadcast Software (OBS) to create a customised feed streamed to remote learners through a videoconferencing platform. Sessions were conducted between September 2020 and March 2021. Twelve students sequentially interacted with a patient who held an iPad. Higher quality Go-Pro cameras captured the scene, allowing students to view the consultation from the patient and doctor's perspective. A consultant then conducted a 'gold standard' patient consultation observed by students. A faculty member remotely facilitated the session, providing pre-clinic teaching and debriefing. The equipment required with costing for a standard and low-cost version is described, as well as a set-up schematic and overview of ideal conditions and barriers encountered during trials. EVALUATION: All students completed a post-participation questionnaire, rating the overall quality of the sessions as 9.7/10. The quality of online facilitation, utility of observing peers' and consultant interaction with the patient, opportunity for peer-to-peer learning and availability of multiple camera angles were particularly valued by students.

To date, the spike protein has become the principal target for vaccine and therapeutic development while the exact effects of its glycosylation remain elusive. Experimental reports have described the heterogeneity of the spike protein glycosylation profile. Subsequent molecular simulation studies provided a knowledge basis of the glycan functions. However, there are no studies to date on the role of discrete glycoforms on the spike protein pathobiology. Building an understanding of its role in SARS-CoV-2 is important as we continue to develop effective medicines and vaccines to combat the disease. Herein, we used designed combinations of glycoengineering enzymes to simplify and control the glycosylation profile of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Measurements of the receptor binding affinity revealed the regulatory effects of the RBD glycans. Remarkably, opposite effects were observed from differently remodeled glycans, which presents a potential strategy for modulating the spike protein behaviors through glycoengineering. Moreover, we found that the reported anti-SARS-CoV-(2) antibody, S309, neutralizes the impact of different RBD glycoforms on the receptor binding affinity. Overall, this work reports the regulatory roles that glycosylation plays in the interaction between the viral spike protein and host receptor, providing new insights into the nature of SARS-CoV-2. Beyond this study, enzymatic remodeling of glycosylation offers the opportunity to understand the fundamental role of specific glycoforms on glycoconjugates across molecular biology.

We investigated short-term, medium-term, and long-term neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay in neonates and young children after parechovirus-CNS-infection. METHODS In this systematic review and meta-analyses of studies, we searched PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo, from the inception of the database until March 18, 2019, for reviews, systematic reviews, cohort studies, case series, and case control studies reporting on neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes of children 3 months or younger with parechovirus infection of the CNS. Studies that were published after Dec 31, 2007, assessed children younger than 16 years, detailed parechoviruses infection of the CNS (confirmed by PCR), and followed up on neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes were included. Studies published before Dec 31, 2007, were excluded. The predefined primary outcomes were the proportions of children with neurological sequelae, impairment in auditory or visual functions, or gross motor function delay. The proportion of children in whom neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported was pooled in meta-analyses. For each outcome variable we calculated the pooled proportion with 95% CI. The proportion of children in whom neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported was extracted by one author and checked by another. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies. FINDINGS 20 studies were eligible for quantitative synthesis. The meta-analyses showed an increasing proportion of children with neurological sequelae over time: 5% during short-term follow-up (pooled proportion 005 [95% CI 003-008], I2=000%; p=083) increasing to 27% during long-term follow-up (027 [017-040], I2=5274%; p=0026). The proportion of children with suspected neurodevelopmental delay was 9% or more during long-term follow-up. High heterogeneity and methodological issues in the included studies mean that the results should be interpreted with caution. INTERPRETATION This systematic review suggests the importance of long follow-up, preferably up to preschool or school age (5-6 years), of children with parechovirus infection of the CNS. Although not clinically severe, we found an increasing proportion of neonates and young children with CNS infection had associated neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay over time. We recommend the use of standardised methods to assess neurological and neurodevelopmental functions of these children and to compare results with age-matched reference groups.

We present here a novel approach for the selection of immunoprevalent SARS-CoV-2-derived T cell epitopes using an in silico cohort of HLA-genotyped individuals with different ethnicities. Nine 30-mer peptides derived from the four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were selected and included in a peptide vaccine candidate to recapitulate the broad virus-specific T cell responses observed in natural infection. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were detected in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents' blood against on average seven different vaccine peptides. Furthermore, convalescents' complete HLA-genotype predicted their T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides with 84% accuracy. Computational extrapolation of this relationship to a cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination will likely elicit multi-antigenic T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity.

Then, the prediction of the potential active ingredients, action targets, and signaling pathways were conducted through the Gene Ontology (GO), proteinCprotein interaction (PPI),and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. The results of network pharmacology prediction suggested that H. cordata may act through multiple signaling pathways to alleviate PF, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathways.

Four patients were re-admitted for relapse of infections and one patient was re-admitted for colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. No mortality was reported for any patient during OPAT treatment and 30 days after program completion. Conclusions The implementation of this novel OPAT program was safe, effective, and offered significant cost-savings to our institution. The entire process was very dynamic and was centered around proper patient selection and education as well as excellent communication between patients and the entire multidisciplinary team involved in the program. We hope that these results will encourage other institutions in the region to implement similar OPAT programs to alleviate the existing bed crisis due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Implementing the First Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT) Program to Utilize Disposable Elastomeric Pumps in the Gulf Region: Results From a Tertiary Teaching Hospital in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses official data from Guatemalas Departamento de Atencion a la Victima (Victim Attention Department), a specialized unit in Guatemalas National Civil Police, to assess the long-term impacts of a government mandated lockdown and reopening on domestic violence.

The epidemiology and clinical course of infected patients with life-threatening forms of ALD, including severe alcoholic hepatitis (sAH) and decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis (DAC), and specific risk factors for infection remain mostly unknown. APPROACH & RESULTS In this observational study, we assessed all infectious episodes occurring within a 90-day period from diagnosis in all consecutive patients with biopsy-proven sAH (mDF32, MELD18) and DAC (MELD18), without alcoholic hepatitis, in our tertiary hospital between 2003 and 2016. A total of 207 patients were included, 139 with sAH and 68 with DAC. One hundred seventeen(84%) patients with sAH and 41(60%) patients with DAC experienced at least one infection episode at 90 days(p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with the development of infection were the presence of sAH and baseline MELD score. Bacterial infections represented the most common infection in the two groups, and only MELD score was independently associated with the occurrence of bacterial infection. In both groups, pneumonia was the most prevalent bacterial infection and Gram-negative bacilli were the main pathogens. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) occurred in 20(14.5%) patients with sAH and 3(4.5%) with DAC patients(p<0.05). Multivariable regression showed that younger age, higher MELD, and corticosteroid therapy were independently associated with IFI. The 90-day cumulative incidence of death in infected patients with sAH and DAC were 46% and 41.5% respectively(p=0.43). CONCLUSIONS Patients with sAH are more susceptible to develop infection than those with DAC. In life-threatening forms of ALD, infected patients share a similar mortality rate. Corticosteroid treatment, not sAH, seems to be the main risk factor triggering IFI.","output":"Clinical course and risk factors for infection in severe forms of alcohol-related liver disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we investigate young people's trust in online sexual health resources.

Unhealthy alcohol use is associated with increased risk for poor medical outcomes, substantial societal costs, and death, including suicide. Based on substantial evidence from randomized controlled trials and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, VA/DoD clinical guidelines stipulate that all Veterans screening positive for unhealthy alcohol use should receive evidence-based alcohol care in PC, including brief counseling interventions (BI) and additional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy) for those with alcohol use disorders (AUD). The VA pioneered implementing alcohol screening and BI in PC, yet substantial implementation gaps remain. To improve alcohol-related care, this study will conduct a pilot study to assess whether a multi-faceted evidence-based implementation strategypractice facilitationhas the potential to improve PC-based alcohol-related care at a single VA clinic. METHODS: We will first recruit and conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use (n = 20C25) and PC stakeholders (N = 10C15) to understand barriers and facilitators to high-quality alcohol care and use results to refine and hone the multifaceted practice facilitation intervention. Qualitative interviews, analysis, and refinement of the intervention will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Focus groups with a small sample of PC providers and staff (n = 5C7) will be used to further refine the practice facilitation intervention and assess its acceptability and feasibility. The refined practice facilitation intervention will then be offered in the PC clinic to assess implementation (e.g., reach) and effectiveness (reduced drinking) outcomes based on the RE-AIM framework. DISCUSSION: This research directly addresses one of the largest public health crises of our time, as alcohol kills more people than opioids and is associated with increased risk of suicide. If successful, this pilot may generate an intervention with far-reaching effects on adverse outcomes experienced by Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use, including increased access to care and suicide prevention.

The objectives of the study were to assess a trainees' ability to reach technical competence by assessing learning patterns of the acquisition of surgical skills. Furthermore, it aims to determine whether individuals' learning patterns were consistent across a range of open and laparoscopic tasks of variable difficulty. METHODS Sixty-five preclinical medical students participated in a training curriculum with standardized feedback over forty repetitions of the following laparoscopic and open technical tasks: peg transfer (PT), circle cutting (CC), intracorporeal knot tie (IKT), one-handed tie, and simulated laparotomy closure. Data mining techniques were used to analyze the prospectively collected data and stratify the students into four learning clusters. Performance was compared between groups, and learning curve characteristics unique to trainees who have difficulty reaching technical competence were quantified. RESULTS Top performers (22-35%) and high performers (32-42%) reached proficiency in all tasks. Moderate performers (25-37%) reached proficiency for all open tasks but not all laparoscopic tasks. Low performers (8-15%) failed to reach proficiency in four of five tasks including all laparoscopic tasks (PT 7.8%; CC 9.4%; IKT 15.6%). Participants in lower performance clusters demonstrated sustained performance disadvantage across tasks, with widely variable learning curves and no evidence of progression towards a plateau phase. CONCLUSIONS Most students reached proficiency across a range of surgical tasks, but low-performing trainees failed to reach competence in laparoscopic tasks.

This study examined patient experiences with and preferences for telehealth at a cancer genetic counseling clinic throughout the first 6 months of the pandemic (March-August 2020). METHODS: An anonymous survey assessed patient demographics; usage and prior experience with technology; emotional responses, technical experiences, and satisfaction with the telehealth appointment (via the Genetic Counseling Satisfaction Scale and Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire); preference for future telehealth; and recommendation of telehealth to others. RESULTS: Among 380 respondents, most were highly satisfied with the telehealth appointment (with 65.6% and 66.4% of participants completing the Genetic Counseling Satisfaction Scale and Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire, respectively). Multivariable analyses indicated several notable findings. Adjusting for relevant covariates, participants with less education felt significantly more concerned about telehealth than those with highest educational attainment. Participants age 40-69 years were generally more comfortable, relieved, and grateful that their appointment was scheduled as telehealth than were those older than 70 years. Women were marginally more relieved and grateful for telehealth appointments than men. As the pandemic progressed, significantly more participants were highly satisfied with their telehealth appointment and participants trended toward having greater preferences for future telehealth use. Most participants (78.6%) would recommend telehealth to others, although 50.8% preferred future in-person appointments.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was performed on 300 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction analysis. All participants of the study were divided into C (a) Group I: patients with mild symptoms and normal chest radiographic findings;(b) patients with moderate disease presenting with fever and cough along with other respiratory symptoms, and (c) patients suffering from severe disease. Data collection was done from all patients at the time of hospital admission for hematological and immunological parameters C (a) total leukocyte count, (b) lymphocyte count, (c) lymphocytic subset count, (d) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, (e) D-dimer, (f) C-reactive protein (CRP), and (g) ferritin levels. SPSS 22.0 software was used for determining P values by independent t-test and Chi-square test. Results: The median age was 65 years (interquartile range C57C71 years). While comparing white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, extremely significant P values were obtained. D-dimers and ferritin levels demonstrated extremely significant P values while both LDH and CRPs showed statistical significance. Correlation of lymphocytic subsets showed extreme significance in total lymphocyte counts in mild-to-moderate as compared to severely infected patients while both CD4+ and CD8+ counts demonstrated statistical significance in mild-moderate infected cases. Statistical significance was noted in D-dimer, CRP, and LDH levels also. Conclusion: Assessment of hematological and immunological parameters can be used to plan the management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Role of hematological and immunological parameters in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are the causative agents of an estimated 60% of human infections worldwide.

Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19. They must face high-risk infection conditions, insufficient anti-epidemic material supplies, mental pressure, and so on. COVID-19 seriously affects their dietary and behavioral habits, and poor habits make them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, their baseline dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of COVID-19 remain unclear for these workers in China. This study aimed to explore the baseline dietary and behavioral habits of frontline workers and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of the epidemic; in addition, susceptible subgroups were identified by stratified analyses as targets of protective measures to keep them from being infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a sample of 22,459 valid individuals living in China, including 9402 frontline epidemic prevention workers. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 23.9% of the frontline epidemic prevention workers reported a high-salt diet, 46.9% of them reported a high frequency of fried foods intake, and 50.9% of them smoked cigarettes. After the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% of them expressed a willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% of them wanted to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetables intake. A total of 37.9% of them expressed a willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% of them wanted to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline dietary and behavioral habits and the willingness to change their habits were observed between frontline epidemic prevention workers and other participants. Among the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19, frontline epidemic prevention experience was a promoting factor for adopting worse dietary and behavioral habits, including those in the high-salt intake subgroup (OR, 2.824; 95% CI, 2.341-3.405) and the 11-20 cigarettes/day subgroup (OR, 2.067; 95% CI, 1.359-3.143). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary and behavioral habits of frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than that those of other participants before COVID-19. They had a greater willingness to adopt healthy dietary and behavioral habits after experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19. However, frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 continued in engage in these poor habits.

Prophylactic mesh-augmented reinforcement during laparotomy closure has been proposed in patients at high risk of incisional hernia. METHODS A multicenter randomized trial was conducted on patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair through a midline laparotomy (Clinical.Trials.gov: NCT00757133). In the study group, retromuscular mesh-augmented reinforcement was performed with a large-pore polypropylene mesh (Ultrapro, width 7.5 cm). The primary endpoint was the incidence of incisional hernias at 2-year follow-up. RESULTS Between February 2009 and January 2013, 120 patients were recruited at 8 Belgian centers. Patients' characteristics at baseline were similar between groups. Operative and postoperative characteristics showed no difference in morbidity or mortality. The cumulative incidence of incisional hernias at 2-year follow-up after conventional closure was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-41%) versus 0% (95% CI, 0%-6%) after mesh-augmented reinforcement (P < 0.0001; Fisher exact test). The estimated \\"freedom of incisional hernia\\" curves (Kaplan-Meier estimate) were significantly different across study arms ( = 19.5, P < 0.0001; Mantel-Cox test). No adverse effect related to mesh-augmented reinforcement was observed, apart from an increased mean time to close the abdominal wall for mesh-augmented reinforcement compared with the control group: 46 minutes (SD, 18.6) versus 30 minutes (SD, 18.5), respectively (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test).

In this study, we aimed to assess long-standing symptoms (LS) (symptoms lasting from the time of discharge) in previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and assess associated risk factors. Methods This is a longitudinal cohort study of adults (18 years of age and above) with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Sechenov University Hospital Network in Moscow, Russia. Data were collected from patients discharged between April 8 and July 10, 2020. Participants were interviewed via telephone using Tier 1 ISARIC Long-term Follow-up Study CRF and the WHO CRF for Post COVID conditions. Reported symptoms were further categorised based on the system(s) involved. Additional information on dyspnoea, quality of life and fatigue was collected using validated instruments. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to investigate risk factors for development of LS categories. Findings Overall, 2,649 of 4,755 patients discharged from the hospitals were available for the follow-up and included in the study. The median age of the patients was 56 years (IQR, 46-66) and 1,353 (51.1%) were women. The median follow-up time since hospital discharge was 217.5 (200.4-235.5) days. At the time of the follow-up interview 1247 (47.1%) participants reported LS. Fatigue (21.2%, 551/2599), shortness of breath (14.5%, 378/2614) and forgetfulness (9.1%, 237/2597) were the most common LS reported. Chronic fatigue (25%, 658/2593) and respiratory (17.2% 451/2616) were the most common LS categories. with reporting of multi-system involvement (MSI) less common (11.3%; 299). Female sex was associated with LS categories of chronic fatigue with an odds ratio of 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.02), neurological (2.03, 1.60 to 2.58), mood and behaviour (1.83, 1.41 to 2.40), dermatological (3.26, 2.36 to 4.57), gastrointestinal (2.50, 1.64 to 3.89), sensory (1.73, 2.06 to 2.89) and respiratory (1.31, 1.06 to 1.62).

Evidence suggests that immune-related genes play an important role in the initiation of inflammation and the recruitment of immune cells. However, the underlying mechanisms and immune-related biomarkers in DN have not been elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to explore immune-related biomarkers in DN and the underlying mechanisms using bioinformatic approaches. In this study, four DN glomerular datasets were downloaded, merged, and divided into training and test cohorts. First, we identified 55 differentially expressed immune-related genes; their biological functions were mainly enriched in leukocyte chemotaxis and neutrophil migration. The CIBERSORT algorithm was then used to evaluate the infiltrated immune cells; macrophages M1/M2, T cells CD8, and resting mast cells were strongly associated with DN. The ICI-related gene modules as well as 25 candidate hub genes were identified to construct a protein-protein interactive network and conduct molecular complex detection using the GOSemSim algorithm. Consequently, FN1, C3, and VEGFC were identified as immune-related biomarkers in DN, and a related transcription factorCmiRNACtarget network was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was estimated in the test cohort; FN1 and C3 had large area under the curve values (0.837 and 0.824, respectively). Clinical validation showed that FN1 and C3 were negatively related to the glomerular filtration rate in patients with DN. Six potential therapeutic small molecule compounds, such as calyculin, phenamil, and clofazimine, were discovered in the connectivity map.

Given that more than 80% of financing for health in the Pacific comes from domestic and external public sources, the net impact of the economic contraction on resources for health will depend on whether overall public spending can offset the decline in economic activity and how health will be prioritized in government budgets relative to other sectors. Without active reprioritization, most countries could see a slowdown or even decline in per capita levels of public spending for health in the region, risking gains made in advancing universal health coverage in recent years.

Invasive infections, including infective endocarditis, appear to be increasing in incidence. To date, preventive efforts have focused on modifying individual-level risk behaviours (eg, hand-washing and skin-cleaning) without much success in reducing the population-level impact of these infections. Learning from successes in HIV prevention, there may be great value in looking beyond individual-level risk behaviours to the social determinants of health. Specifically, the risk environment conceptual framework identifies how social, physical, economic and political environmental factors facilitate and constrain individual behaviour, and therefore influence health outcomes. Understanding the social and structural determinants of injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections could help to identify new targets for prevention efforts in the face of increasing incidence of severe disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a systematic review. We will review studies of PWID and investigate associations between risk factors (both individual-level and social/structural-level) and the incidence of hospitalisation or death due to injecting-related bacterial infections (skin and soft-tissue infections, bacteraemia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, epidural abscess and others). We will include quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies. Using directed content analysis, we will code risk factors for these infection-related outcomes according to their contributions to the risk environment in type (social, physical, economic or political) and level (microenvironmental or macroenvironmental). We will also code and present risk factors at each stage in the process of drug acquisition, preparation, injection, superficial infection care, severe infection care or hospitalisation, and outcomes after infection or hospital discharge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As an analysis of the published literature, no ethics approval is required. The findings will inform a research agenda to develop and implement social/structural interventions aimed at reducing the burden of disease.

Postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUCD) is a safe and effective FP method which allows women to obtain long-acting contraception before discharge from the point of delivery. We observed poor coverage of deliveries with PPIUCD at our facility. This was the trigger to initiate a quality improvement (QI) initiative to increase the PPIUCD coverage from current rate of 4.5%C10% in 3-month period. METHOD: A fishbone analysis of the problem was done and the following causes were identified: lack of focused counselling for FP, lack of sensitisation and training of resident doctors and inconsistent supply of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs). A QI team was constituted with representatives from faculty members, residents, interns, nursing officers and FP counsellors. The point of care quality improvement methodology was used. INTERVENTIONS: Daily counselling of antenatal women was started by the counsellors and interns in antenatal wards. A WhatsApp group of residents was made initially to sensitise them; and later for parking of problems and trouble shooting. The residents were provided hands-on training at skills lab. Uninterrupted supply of IUCDs was ensured by provision of buffer stock of IUCDs with respective store keepers.

The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter modelthe Blue Sky modeland show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network.

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the 2-stage sequential version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests.

A transient kinetic analysis using a single-step competitive inhibition model provided rate constants of k(on) = 153,000 M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 4.40 x 10(-5) s(-1) (K(i) = 0.29 nM). The compound also displayed cathepsin L/B selectivity of >700-fold and was nontoxic to human aortic endothelial cells at 100 muM. The oxocarbazate and a related thiocarbazate (PubChem CID 16725315) were tested in a SARS coronavirus (CoV) and Ebola virus-pseudotype infection assay with the oxocarbazate but not the thiocarbazate, demonstrating activity in blocking both SARS-CoV (IC(50) = 273 +/- 49 nM) and Ebola virus (IC(50) = 193 +/- 39 nM) entry into human embryonic kidney 293T cells. To trace the intracellular action of the inhibitors with intracellular cathepsin L, the activity-based probe biotin-Lys-C5 alkyl linker-Tyr-Leu-epoxide (DCG-04) was used to label the active site of cysteine proteases in 293T lysates. The reduction in active cathepsin L in inhibitor-treated cells correlated well with the observed potency of inhibitors observed in the virus pseudotype infection assay. Overall, the oxocarbazate CID 23631927 was a subnanomolar, slow-binding, reversible inhibitor of human cathepsin L that blocked SARS-CoV and Ebola pseudotype virus entry in human cells.","output":"A small-molecule oxocarbazate inhibitor of human cathepsin L blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome and ebola pseudotype virus infection into human embryonic kidney 293T cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles that store and supply lipids for energy metabolism, membrane synthesis and production of lipid-derived signaling molecules.

Generally, the couple outlines plans and has expectations regarding the baby. When these plans are interrupted because of a perinatal loss, it turns out to be a traumatic experience for the family. Validating the grief of these losses has been a challenge to Brazilian society, which is evident considering the childbirth care offered to bereaved families in maternity wards. Positively assessed care that brings physical and emotional memories about the baby has a positive impact on the bereavement process that family undergoes. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects supportive guidelines have on mental health. They were designed to assist grieving parents and their families while undergoing perinatal loss in public maternities in Ribeir?o Preto, S?o Paulo state, Brazil. METHOD: A mixed-methods (qualitative/quantitative), quasi-experimental (before/after) study. The intervention is the implementation of bereavement supportive guidelines for women who experienced a stillbirth or a neonatal death. A total of forty women will be included. Twenty participants will be assessed before and twenty will be assessed after the implementation of the guidelines. A semi-structured questionnaire and three scales will be used to assess the effects of the guidelines. Health care professionals and managers of all childbirth facilities will be invited to participate in focus group. Data will be analyzed using statistical tests, as well as thematic analysis approach. DISCUSSION: The Perinatal Bereavement guidelines are a local adaptation of the Canadian and British corresponding guidelines. These guidelines have been developed based on the families needs of baby memories during the bereavement process and include the following aspects: (1) Organization of care into periods, considering their respective needs along the process; (2) Creation of the Bereavement Professional figure in maternity wards; (3) Adequacy of the institutional environment; (4) Communication of the guidance; (5) Creation of baby memories. We expect that the current project generates additional evidence for improving the mental health of women and families that experience a perinatal loss. Trial registration RBR-3cpthr PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: For many couples, getting pregnant does not only mean carrying a baby, but also having a child. Most of the time, the couple has already made many plans and has expectations towards the child. When these plans are interrupted because of a perinatal loss, it turns out to be a traumatic experience for the family. In Brazilian culture, validating this traumatic grief is very difficult, especially when it happens too soon. The barriers can be noticed not only by the way society deals with the parents grief, but also when we see the care the grieving families receive from the health care establishment. Creating physical and emotional memories might bring the parents satisfaction regarding the care they receive when a baby dies. These memories can be built when there is good communication throughout the care received; shared decisions; the chance to see and hold the baby, as well as collect memories; privacy and continuous care during the whole process, including when there is a new pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. With this in mind, among the most important factors are the training of health staff and other professionals, the preparation of the maternity ward to support bereaved families and the continuous support to the professionals involved in the bereavement. This article proposes guidelines to support the families who are experiencing stillbirth and neonatal death. It may be followed by childbirth professionals (nurses, midwives, obstetricians and employees of a maternity ward), managers, researchers, policymakers or those interested in developing specific protocols for their maternity wards.","output":"The perinatal bereavement project: development and evaluation of supportive guidelines for families experiencing stillbirth and neonatal death in Southeast Brazila quasi-experimental before-and-after study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 the management of transboundary fisheries was severely impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the recent authorization of vaccine boosters among vulnerable Americans, this study aims to assess COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitancy and its associated factors in a nationally representative sample. A web-based 48-item psychometric valid survey was used to measure vaccine literacy, vaccine confidence, trust, and general attitudes towards vaccines. Data were analyzed through Chi-square (with a post hoc contingency table analysis) and independent-sample t-/Welch tests. Among 2138 participants, nearly 62% intended to take booster doses and the remaining were COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitant. The vaccine-booster-hesitant group was more likely to be unvaccinated (62.6% vs. 12.9%) and did not intend to have their children vaccinated (86.1% vs. 27.5%) compared to their non-hesitant counterparts. A significantly higher proportion of booster dose hesitant individuals had very little to no trust in the COVID-19 vaccine information given by public health/government agencies (55% vs. 12%) compared to non-hesitant ones. The mean scores of vaccine confidence index and vaccine literacy were lower among the hesitant group compared to the non-hesitant group. Compared to the non-hesitant group, vaccine hesitant participants were single or never married (41.8% vs. 28.7%), less educated, and living in a southern region of the nation (40.9% vs. 33.3%). These findings underscore the need of developing effective communication strategies emphasizing vaccine science in ways that are accessible to individuals with lower levels of education and vaccine literacy to increase vaccination uptake.","output":"Assessing Acceptability of COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose among Adult Americans: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To develop prognosis prediction models for COVID-19 patients attending an emergency department (ED) based on initial chest X-ray (CXR), demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods All symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital ED between February 24th and April 24th 2020 were recruited. CXR features, clinical and laboratory variables and CXR abnormality indices extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) diagnostic tool were considered potential predictors on this first visit. The most serious individual outcome defined the three severity level: 0) home discharge or hospitalization  3 days, 1) hospital stay >3 days and 2) intensive care requirement or death. Severity and in-hospital mortality multivariable prediction models were developed and internally validated. The Youden index was used for the optimal threshold selection of the classification model. Results A total of 440 patients were enrolled (median 64 years;55.9% male);13.6% patients were discharged, 64% hospitalized, 6.6% required intensive care and 15.7% died. The severity prediction model included oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen fraction (SatO2/FiO2), age, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, extent score of lung involvement on CXR (ExtScoreCXR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer level and platelets count, with AUC-ROC = 0.94 and AUC-PRC = 0.88. The mortality prediction model included age, SatO2/FiO2, CRP, LDH, CXR extent score, lymphocyte count and D-dimer level, with AUC-ROC = 0.97 and AUC-PRC = 0.78. The addition of CXR CNN-based indices did not improve significantly the predictive metrics.

These strains seem to be more easily transmissible than other variants, which may lead to more cases and more deaths. Currently, there are many vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 available in the market but without full clinical data beside. Despite the existence of these vaccines, the numbers of outpatients are still increasing in many countries around the world, and the reliability of these vaccines still remains elusive. It is well known that trace element deficiencies increase the individual susceptibility to immune dysfunction and lead to global health problem. In this context, improving the immune defense system to combats this pandemic is absolutely necessary. The purpose of this review is to establish the probable relation between trace elements supplementation and COVID-19. MAIN BODY: Several clinical studies confirmed that Cu, Se, and Zn insufficiencies alter the immune system and increase the vulnerability to viral infections. Based on antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of these micronutrients, it seems logical that dietary supplementations of these components might enhance human immune system and lower the graveness of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Based on available data, we hypothesize that the clinical use of some essential trace element supplementations such as copper, selenium, and zinc might be a preventive and promising option to enhance human immunity against the new pandemic COVID-19 and its new strains.

Understanding how the host and pathogen interact in active TB will have a significant impact on global TB control efforts. Exosomes are increasingly recognized as a means of cell-to-cell contact and exchange of soluble mediators. In the case of TB, exosomes are released from the bacillus and infected cells. In the present study, a comprehensive lipidomics and proteomics analysis of size exclusion chromatography-isolated plasma-derived exosomes from patients with TB lymphadenitis (TBL) and treated as well as untreated pulmonary TB (PTB) was performed to elucidate the possibility to utilize exosomes in diagnostics and knowledge building. According to our findings, exosome-derived lipids and proteins originate from both the host and Mtb in the plasma of active TB patients. Exosomes from all patients are mostly composed of sphingomyelins (SM), phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, free fatty acids, triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesterylesters. Relative proportions of, e.g., SMs and TAGs, vary depending on the disease or treatment state and could be linked to Mtb pathogenesis and dormancy. We identified three proteins of Mtb origin: DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (RpoC), Diacyglycerol O-acyltransferase (Rv2285), and Formate hydrogenase (HycE), the latter of which was discovered to be differently expressed in TBL patients. Furthermore, we discovered that Mtb infection alters the host protein composition of circulating exosomes, significantly affecting a total of 37 proteins. All TB patients had low levels of apolipoproteins, as well as the antibacterial proteins cathelicidin, Scavenger Receptor Cysteine Rich Family Member (SSC5D), and Ficolin 3 (FCN3). When compared to healthy controls, the protein profiles of PTB and TBL were substantially linked, with 14 proteins being co-regulated. However, adhesion proteins (integrins, Intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM2), CD151, Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4)) were shown to be more prevalent in PTB patients, while immunoglobulins, Complement component 1r (C1R), and Glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) were found to be more abundant in TBL patients, respectively. This study could confirm findings from previous reports and uncover novel molecular profiles not previously in focus of TB research. However, we applied a minimally invasive sampling and analysis of circulating exosomes in TB patients. Based on the findings given here, future studies into hostCpathogen interactions could pave the way for the development of new vaccines and therapies.","output":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis Affects Protein and Lipid Content of Circulating Exosomes in Infected Patients Depending on Tuberculosis Disease State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the spread of COVID-19, the deterioration of public mental health has become a major global and social problem. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the 3 mental health problems associated with COVID-19, that is, perceived stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms, and the various demographic factors, including occupation. METHODS: A nationwide web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in Japan from August 4 to 31, 2020. In addition to sociodemographic data, the degrees of perceived stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms associated with COVID-19 were measured. After performing a descriptive statistical analysis, factors related to stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8203 respondents submitted survey responses, among whom 34.9% (2861/8203) felt intense stress associated with COVID-19, 17.1% (1403/8203) were depressed, and 13.5% (1110/8203) had severe anxiety symptoms. The logistic regression analysis showed that each of the 3 mental health problems were prevalent in females, nonbinary gender, people in their 50s, 60s and older, respondents who visited psychiatrists, and those currently in psychiatric care. Severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms were associated with the number of effective lifestyle coping strategies during the lockdown period. Severe mental distress was only prevalent in teenagers and respondents in their 20s, as students tended to develop stress and severe mental distress. With regard to occupation, working in nursing care and welfare, education and research, and medical and health sectors was associated with stress; however, working in these occupations was not associated with severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms. Unemployment was associated with severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms. All 3 mental health problems were prevalent in part-time workers and those working in entertainment and arts sectors. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, age, occupation, history of psychiatric visits, and stress coping mechanisms were associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their associations with stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms differed. In addition, the actual state of mental health varied according to the respondents occupation. It is necessary to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health not only at the individual level but also at the occupational level.","output":"Demographics Associated With Stress, Severe Mental Distress, and Anxiety Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: Nationwide Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of growing attempts to assess the validity of public reporting, much research has examined the effectiveness of public reporting regarding cost or quality of care.

The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. INTERPRETATION: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections.

The study demonstrates that students were partly prepared for online learning with the remainder of their maturation to it occurring while the quarter progressed. Remote online learning did not seem to impact student learning (grades) in this communications course during the COVID-19 crisis. Looking past the pandemic, educators and leadership at pharmacy schools and colleges may reassuringly continue to sustain online instruction, where deemed necessary, in their didactic curricula.","output":"Readiness, Reception, and Performance of Students in a Communications Course Delivered Amid the Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-associated coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and a large virus pool was identified in wild animals.

Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here, we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)the SARS-CoV-2 receptorshares a high degree of similarity to that of humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to noninoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days postinoculation (p.i.). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 p.i. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a wild animal species susceptible to the virus. IMPORTANCE Given the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of the COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public and animal health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of new wildlife hosts. Our data shows that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Susceptibility of White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Iron-overload cardiomyopathy initially manifests with diastolic dysfunction and can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy if untreated. Previous studies have shown that patients with primary and secondary hemochromatosis can have subclinical left ventricle dysfunction with abnormalities on strain imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between cardiac T2* values and myocardial-wall strain in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) at the time of diagnosis and after a course of venesection treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at 3 T was performed in 19 patients with newly diagnosed HH with elevated serum ferritin levels and repeated after a course of treatment with venesection. Quantitative T2* mapping and strain analysis were performed offline using dedicated relaxometry fitting and feature-tracking software. RESULTS: The majority (84%) of patients had normal baseline myocardial T2* values (mean 19.3 ms, range 8.9 to 31.2 ms), which improved significantly after venesection (mean 24.1 ms, range 11 to 38.1 ms) (P=0.021). Mean global radial strain significantly improved from 25.0 (range: 15.6 to 32.9) to 28.3 (range: 19.8 to 35.8) (P=0.001) and mean global circumferential strain improved, decreasing from -15.7 (range: -11.1 to -19.2) to -17.1 (range: -13.0 to -20.1) (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with HH may have normal T2* values in the presence of subclinical left ventricle dysfunction, which can be detected by abnormal radial and circumferential strain. As strain imaging improves following venesection in HH, it may serve as a useful biomarker to guide treatment.","output":"Cardiac Magnetic Resonance at 3.0 T in Patients With C282Y Homozygous Hereditary Hemochromatosis: Superiority of Radial and Circumferential Strain Over Cardiac T2* Measurements at Baseline and at Post Venesection Follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has broken out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China Due to the highly pathogenic and infectious characteristics, COVID-19 spread across China and later globally and became a severe pandemic To date, there have been no efficacious specialized drugs to treat COVID-19 The China-issued Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by Novel Coronavirus (Trial version 6) added the chloroquine phosphate to the antiviral treatment protocol for infected adults Evidence Acquisition: In this review, government documents and authoritative guidelines on COVID-19 were collected from the official website of organizations related to health and medicine Research articles related to chloroquine and its application for COVID-19 treatment were searched and acquired from the PubMed platform Facts and data related to the use of chloroquine were summarized in several parts","output":"Potential adverse drug reactions of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, its causative virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread and increase the number of fatalities.

Our aim was to explore elements of the challenge that motivate engagement with, and sustained participation in, physical activity for mental health. METHOD: RED January registrants (n= 55,772, female = 45,802; 82%) were invited to take part. Volunteers supplied information on sex, age band and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in the past week. Forty registrants (24 female), recruited in December 2019 using a purposive sampling approach to identify a maximum-variation sample, participated in semi-structured interviews (31 face-to-face) after completing the challenge. The resulting transcripts were thematically analysed, using the Framework method. RESULTS: Two main themes relating to motivation were identified. Pleasure referred to how daily activity promoted physical enjoyment and positive affective states via engaging with the environment, finding mental space and peace, and enjoyable social interactions. Purpose referred to the experiences of engaging with the campaign, and observed changes in health outcomes. These included setting flexible and appropriate goals, measuring and reviewing progress, noting wider biological and behavioural changes, and receiving support from the social media community. Points for consideration were feelings of failure when not achieving self-imposed targets, the unintended facilitation of obsessive exercising, and social media posts that triggered negative thoughts among a minority of participants.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians were uncertain what impact CDK4-6 inhibitor-induced immunosuppression may have on the risk of contracting COVID-19 or the severity of infection. Some clinicians pre-emptively reduced doses, altered schedules, or even withheld treatment, continuing ET alone. There is currently no evidence that CDK4-6 inhibitors increase the risk or severity of COVID-19 infection, although there have reports of protracted illness. We describe our experience of 203 patients receiving CDK4-6 inhibitors during the first wave and demonstrate the safety of continuing treatment during this period. Methods: Epidemiological and clinical data were collected prospectively for patients at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) and one network hospital with a ER-positive HER2-negative ABC that were receiving a CDK4-6 inhibitor between April 1st and June 30th 2020. Results: 200 patients received a CDK4-6 inhibitor in combination with ET, of which of 65/200 fulfilled local criteria to be screened with COVID-19 PCR testing and 6/65 were swab-positive. Two patients required hospital admission but there were no ICU admissions or COVID-19-associated deaths. Only 12 patients (6%) had treatment adjustments in the form of dose reduction (3/12), regime adjustment (2/12), or temporary interruption (7/12). In 9/12 cases this was a prophylactic measure due to additional risk factors;age (n=1), co-morbidities(n=3), patient choice (n=1) or overall concerns (n=4) to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. Results on dispensing &gt;2 cycles at a time, telephone clinics, deferred CT scans and complications relating due to remote monitoring will also be reported. Conclusions: Based on this snapshot during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conclude that continuation of CDK4-6 inhibitors appears safe. This project is helping to drive a UK-wide review of CDK4-6 inhibitor treatment continuation, adjustment during the pandemic, assessing the risk of acquiring clinically severe COVID-19 infection, and subsequent cancer-related outcomes for these patients.

In this prospective study, partners identified gaps in services and targeted and non-targeted delivery areas for implementation of an evidence-based falls prevention intervention addressing the 4Ms of Age-Friendly Health SystemsMobility, Medications, Mentation, and What Matters. Descriptive statistics were calculated for program implementation and participant demographic variables, and paired t-test analysis compared scores for self-assessed general health and falls efficacy prior to and after program participation. Twenty-seven falls prevention classes were implemented, with over half (52%) in targeted areas. A total of 354 adults aged 50 and older participated, with N = 188 participants (53%) completing the program by attending at least five of eight sessions. Of completers, 35% resided in targeted areas. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in falls efficacy by program completers in targeted and non-targeted areas. However, there was no statistically significant difference in self-rated health. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that collaboration to deliver falls prevention training can be effective in reaching at-risk older adults.

I propose and construct a factor-based housing risk index as an additional factor in asset price models that uses the time-varying conditional volatility of housing variables within the U.S. housing sector. The findings show that the proposed housing risk index is economically and theoretically consistent with the risk-return relationship of the conditional Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) of Merton (1973), which predicts an average maximum of 5.6 percent of risk premium in REIT equity return.

Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the endogenous regenerative reserve that maintains the integrity of the vascular endothelium and its restoration in case of damage by pathogenic factors. A decrease in the circulating EPCs is regarded as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in conditions associated with development of endothelial dysfunction, including COVID-19. The exact phenotype of progenitor cells capable of differentiating into endothelial cells has not been determined. In most laboratories antigens CD133+, CD34+, VEGFR-2+ (CD 309) or combination of these are used to identify EPCs. The process of EPCs mobilization and migration is controlled by molecular signals from immune cells located in the damage area. Stromal cell factor 1 (SDF-1), produced by the bone marrow and many other tissues, is an important chemoattractant for EPCs which express its receptors. The results of studies carried out in 2020 indicate that SARS-Cov-2 infects both hematopoietic stem cells, transforming into EPCs, and directly circulating EPCs, causing inflammatory and procoagulant reactions that complicate the COVID-19 course. There is no consensus on the mechanism of EPCs infection with coronavirus C directly through the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor or through an ACE2-independent mechanism. Today there is no effective therapy for COVID-19. The use of the EPCs regenerative potential, and the search for ways to enhance the EPCs mobilization from the depot, and increase their functional activity may become a promising approach to the prevention of severe complications and mortality from COVID-19. ? 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

Consistent with higher ROS expression, the level of cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, was significantly reduced. ALCAR did not have any drastic effect on overall development and heart rate. Polymerase chain reaction-based gene expression array analyses showed no significant change in the expression of 83 genes related to 10 major signaling pathways including: the transforming growth factor  (TGF), Wingless and Int-1 (Wnt), nuclear factor -light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), p53, Notch, Hedgehog, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), oxidative stress, and hypoxia pathways. Our results show that the expression of 83 genes related to these major signaling pathways did not change significantly.","output":"Effects of acetyl L-carnitine on zebrafish embryos: Phenotypic and gene expression studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has exhibited different clinical manifestations amongst various age cohorts. As the immune microenvironment may play a role in clinical progression, it is crucial to examine molecular interactions to gain insight into host response. Therefore, to elucidate any differences in host response related to age, the present study imputed ligand-receptor interactions within the nasopharyngeal immune microenvironment in patients affected with SARS-COV-2. Tissue purities, the proportion of non-immune cells in the tissue sample, of 467 nasopharyngeal transcriptome profiles were estimated using known mRNA expression signatures of stromal/immune cells. Using the purity estimates and bulk tissue expression values, non-negative linear regression was used to estimate average expression of each gene in the stromal/tumor compartments. The inferred expression profiles were annotated with a curated database of ligand-receptor interactions and assumed as reasonable proxies for the law of mass action, allowing for quantification of directional ligand-receptor complex concentrations under equilibrium. It was found that older patients (>60 years) exhibited decreased interactions with receptors selectin L receptor SELL and increased interactions with pro-inflammatory chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CCR1. Younger patients showed increased interactions with various members of the TNF receptor super family (TNFRSF). The interactions were further related to immune cell subtypes, with older patients predicted to have less CD8+ and CD4+ resting T cells but increased neutrophil proportions. Collectively, the results suggest certain ligand-receptor interactions of the nasopharyngeal immune microenvironment are age-associated in response to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Age-associated Ligand-receptor Interactions Imputed from Nasopharyngeal Transcriptomes of COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient with fever and myalgia who did not have COVID-19 but instead had Lyme disease.

The pressure to quickly reorganize educational conferences and convert content to a remote format overwhelmed many programs. This article describes the pilot event of a large-scale, interactive virtual educational conference model designed and implemented by Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM), called ALiEM Connect. APPROACH: The pilot ALiEM Connect event was conceptualized and implemented within a 2-week period in March 2020. The pilot was livestreamed via a combination of Zoom and YouTube and was archived by YouTube. Slack was used as a backchannel to allow interaction with other participants and engagement with the speakers (via moderators who posed questions from the backchannel to the speakers live during the videoconference). OUTCOMES: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was used for program evaluation, showing that 64 U.S. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited emergency medicine residency programs participated in the pilot event, with 1,178 unique users during the event (reach). For effectiveness, 93% (139/149) of trainees reported the pilot as enjoyable and 85% (126/149) reported it was equivalent to or better than their usual academic proceedings. Adoption for ALiEM Connect was fairly good with 64/237 (27%) of invited residency programs registering and participating in the pilot event. Implementation was demonstrated by nearly half of the livestream viewers (47%, 553/1,178) interacting in the backchannel discussion, sending a total of 4,128 messages in the first 4 hours. NEXT STEPS: The final component of the RE-AIM framework, maintenance, will take more time to evaluate. Further study is required to measure the educational impact of events like the ALiEM Connect pilot. The ALiEM Connect model could potentially be used to replace educational conferences that have been cancelled or to implement and/or augment a large-scale, shared curriculum among residency programs in the future.","output":"ALiEM Connect: Large-Scale, Interactive Virtual Residency Programming in Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Could exit exams improve teaching and learning in high schools such that criminal activity drops?

The psychopathological problems were assessed with the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, attachment styles with the Attachment Style Questionnaire, adverse childhood experiences with Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction Scale. RESULTS: At the pre-intervention phase, psychological distress was similar in both groups with no differences in the General Severity Index of the SCL-90 R, and there were no significant differences for secure/insecure attachment, adverse childhood experiences, and life satisfaction. The online counselling intervention during the pandemic was effective in reducing psychological distress scales as depression (p = .008), obsessiveCcompulsive (p = .008), interpersonal sensitivity (p = .005), and anxiety (p = .011), and in the total scale of the SCL-90 R (p = .017).

The symptoms typically present with fever and skin rash, and rapidly progress to multiple organ failures. Vancomycin is a rare drug to cause DRESS syndrome with 23 cases reported to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a case of a 39 year-old man who was treated with vancomycin for osteomyelitis of the foot. The patient subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by rash and acute interstitial nephritis. These symptoms were improved by withdrawal of vancomycin and a pulsed corticosteroid regimen. According to the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Criteria (RegiSCAR) (Kardaun et al, British Journal of Dermatology, 169:1071-1080, 2013), the probability of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was scored as Definite. A literature search of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was also performed and the overall pulmonary involvement was estimated as 5%. To our knowledge, this was the first case reported with pulmonary involvement as the initial symptom.

RNA viruses are frequently targeted by ISGs through recognition of viral replicative intermediates and molecular features associated with viral genomes, or the lack of molecular features associated with host mRNAs. The ISGs reviewed here primarily inhibit viral replication in an RNA-centric manner, working to sense, degrade, or repress expression of viral RNA. This review focuses on dissecting how these ISGs exhibit multiple antiviral mechanisms, often through use of varied co-factors, highlighting the complexity of the type I IFN response. Specifically, these ISGs can mediate antiviral effects through viral RNA degradation, viral translation inhibition, or both. While the OAS/RNase L pathway globally degrades RNA and arrests translation, ISG20 and ZAP employ targeted RNA degradation and translation inhibition to block viral replication. Meanwhile, SHFL targets translation by inhibiting -1 ribosomal frameshifting, which is required by many RNA viruses. Finally, a number of E3 ligases inhibit viral transcription, an attractive antiviral target during the lifecycle of negative-sense RNA viruses which must transcribe their genome prior to translation. Through this review, we aim to provide an updated perspective on how these ISGs work together to form a complex network of antiviral arsenals targeting viral RNA processes.","output":"All About the RNA: Interferon-Stimulated Genes That Interfere With Viral RNA Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Against the backdrop of the COVID pandemic, the scientific and medical communities are working with all deliberate speed with state-of-the-art technologies to develop diagnostic and therapeutic products that can identify, treat, and prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The amount of tobacco and alcohol consumed is calculated based on the subjective information provided by the user. Tobacco exposure can be assessed using the Fagerstr?m Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) and alcohol consumption by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight subjects answered the Fagerstr?m, and AUDIT tests and we studied them as likely screening tools for oral cancer and their correlation with the expression of CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 genes by the RT-qPCR method. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the AUDIT score and CYP1A1 expression between cancer and control groups. Participants in advanced stages, whether due to tumor size or regional metastasis, showed significant differences in the duration of tobacco use, FTCD, AUDIT score, and CYP1A1 expression when compared to patients in early stages. Among subjects without cancer, we found a significant correlation between participant age and GSTP1 expression. Furthermore, the expression of GSTP1 was significantly correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of tobacco use, and FTCD. CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaires designed to evaluate the degree of tobacco and alcohol exposure and dependence combined with gene expression tests can be useful to assess the risk of developing oral cancer.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the prospective association between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID-19 infection, and assess whether such an association differed according to the different levels of circulating and genetically predicted vitamin D. METHODS: This study included 8297 adults who have records of COVID-19 test results from UK Biobank (from 16 March 2020 to 29 June 2020). The use of vitamin D supplements, circulating vitamin D levels, and main covariates were measured at baseline (2006C2010). Genetically predicted vitamin D levels were evaluated by genetic risk score. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, the habitual use of vitamin D supplements was significantly associated with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 infection (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45C0.97; P = 0.034).

Hyaluronic acid clearance was significantly higher in the HyFACS-PV and -PV + HA groups when compared with the others (P < 0.01), demonstrating the efficacy of the PV route to maintain the sinusoidal endothelia. In contrast, bile production and lactate dehydrogenase leakage therein were both significantly improved in HyFACS-HA and -PV + HA (P < 0.01), representing the superiority of the arterial route to attenuate biliary damage. Electron microscopy consistently revealed that sinusoidal ultrastructures were well maintained by portal HyFACS, while microvilli in bile canaliculi were well preserved by arterial flush. As an underlying mechanism, HyFACS significantly lowered oxidative damages, thus improving the glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio in liver tissue. In conclusion, HyFACS significantly protected liver grafts from IRI by ameliorating oxidative damage upon reperfusion in the characteristic manner with its route of administration. Given its safety, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness, end-ischemic HyFACS may be a novel pretransplant conditioning for cold-stored donor organs.","output":"Hydrogen Flush After Cold Storage as a New End-Ischemic Ex Vivo Treatment for Liver Grafts Against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly throughout the world, with nearly every country thus far documenting this infection. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the risk factors for increased mortality in deceased donor kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 at a single center in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study in a single center. During the 17-month ongoing COVID19 pandemic in Iran, there were 153 deceased donor kidney recipients at our center with suspected COVID19 symptoms. Of these patients, 138 had positive COVID-19 tests, and thus a therapeutic regimen was commenced for these patients. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16 software. RESULTS: The patients were predominantly male (83, 60.1%) with a median age of 47.09  13.75 years and a median time since transplant of 51 months (IQR, 1-276 months). Among these patients, 84 (60.8%) had hypertension and 43 (31.2%) had diabetes mellitus. We observed a significant relationship between disease severity and mortality (P < .001). After risk adjustments for age, presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension and blood group type were factors that showed a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Deceased donor kidney transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 experienced less fever as an initial symptom. However, recipients with COVID-19 and an underlying disease had a higher rate of mortality, severity of infection, and progression of disease. Appropriate management of renal complications and vaccinations in deceased donor kidney transplant recipients may help lead to more favorable outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 Infection in Kidney Transplant Recipients From a Single Center in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Breastfeeding is associated with improved maternal and child outcomes. Women with a higher body mass index (BMI), who comprise about 50% of the population, are at increased risk of poorer breastfeeding practices and are a population who would benefit from breastfeeding. METHODS: This protocol is for a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of perinatal breastfeeding support among primiparous women with a BMI >25 kg/m(2), using a previously-tested, multi-component intervention. The primary outcome is any breastfeeding at 3 months. The intervention will support mothers and their partners and spans from late pregnancy to six weeks postpartum. Intervention components include group antenatal breastfeeding education, individual face-to-face education in the immediate postnatal period, professional support to six weeks postpartum and weekly phone calls in the immediate postpartum period from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). The intervention will target attitudes towards breastfeeding, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and subjective norms around infant feeding with the aim to normalise the behaviour. RESULTS: We anticipate that the intervention will be well-accepted and feasible to carry out within four maternity units in the East of Ireland. Furthermore, essential formative qualitative work has been conducted to inform the intervention design and to ensure that it is contextually appropriate. CONCLUSION: The proposed intervention will be invaluable to policy-makers in providing insights into what specific interventions are effective in improving breastfeeding rates for women with a raised BMI.","output":"Latch On: A protocol for a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of perinatal support to improve breastfeeding outcomes in women with a raised BMI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tumor microenvironment is complex with the cancer stem cell (CSC) as a member within its community. This population possesses the capacity to self-renew and to cause cellular heterogeneity of the tumor. CSCs are resistant to conventional anti-proliferative drugs. In order to be curative, it is imperative that CSCs must be eliminated by cancer therapy. A variety of dietary phytochemicals and repositioned drugs can act synergistically with conventional anti-cancer agents. In this review, we advocate the development of a novel approach, namely combination therapy by incorporating both phytochemicals and repositioned drugs to target CSCs. We cover select dietary phytochemicals (curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG, genistein) and repurposed drugs (metformin, niclosamide, thioridazine, chloroquine). Five of the eight (curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG, genistein, metformin) are listed in The Halifax Project, that explores the concept of a low-toxicity broad-spectrum therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms [1].

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out among spine surgeons in Asia Pacific. The questionnaires were focused on the usage, recycling and disposal of PPE. RESULTS Two hundred and twenty-two surgeons from 19 countries participated in the survey. When we sub-analysed the differences between countries, the provision of adequate PPE by hospitals ranged from 37.5% to 100%. The usage of PPE was generally high. The most used PPE were surgical face masks (88.7%), followed by surgical caps (88.3%), gowns (85.6%), sterile gloves (83.3%) and face shields (82.0%). The least used PPE were powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) (23.0%) and shoes/boots (45.0%). The commonly used PPE for surgeries involving COVID-19 positive patients were N95 masks (74.8%), sterile gloves (73.0%), gowns (72.1%), surgical caps (71.6%), face shields (64.4%), goggles (64.0%), shoe covers (58.6%), plastic aprons (45.9%), shoes/boots (45.9%), surgical face masks (36.5%) and PAPRs (21.2%). Most PPE were not recycled. Biohazard bins were the preferred method of disposal for all types of PPE items compared to general waste. CONCLUSIONS The usage of PPE was generally high among most countries especially for surgeries involving COVID-19 positive patients except for Myanmar and Nepal. Overall, the most used PPE were surgical face masks. For surgeries involving COVID-19 positive patients, the most used PPE were N95 masks. Most PPE were not recycled.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both real-world patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across US counties. RESULTS: STAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model.

Although the reported imaging findings of coronavirus infection are variable and non-specific, the most common initial chest radiograph (CXR) and CT findings are ground-glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral predominance and eventually spread to involve both lungs as the disease progresses. These findings can be explained by the immune pathogenesis of coronavirus infection causing diffuse alveolar damage. Although it is insensitive in mild or early coronavirus infection, the CXR remains as the first-line and the most commonly used imaging modality. That is because it is rapid and easily accessible and helpful for monitoring patient progress during treatment. CT is more sensitive to detect early parenchymal lung abnormalities and disease progression, and can provide an alternative diagnosis. In this pictorial review, various coronavirus infection cases are presented to provide imaging spectrums of coronavirus infection and present differences in imaging among them or from other viral infections, and to discuss the role of imaging in viral infection outbreaks.","output":"Imaging findings in coronavirus infections: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the key requirements for successful vaccination via the mucosa is particulate antigen uptake. Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) particles were chosen as well-known model carriers and ovalbumin (OVA) as the model antigen. Aiming at application to the respiratory tract, which allows direct interaction of the formulation with the mucosal immune system, this work focuses on the feasibility of delivering the antigen in a nanoparticulate carrier within a powder capable of pulmonary delivery. Further requirements were adequate antigen encapsulation in order to use the characteristics of the particulate carrier for (tunable) antigen release, and capability of the production process for industrialisation (realisation in industry). For an effective particulate antigen uptake, nanoparticles with a size of around 300 nm were prepared. For this, two production methods for nanoparticles, solvent change precipitation and the double emulsion method, were evaluated with respect to antigen incorporation, transfer to a dry powder formulation, redispersion and antigen release characteristics. A spray drying step was included in the production procedure in order to obtain a respirable powder with an aerodynamic particle size of between 0.5 and 5 m. The dried products were characterised for particle size, dispersibility and aerodynamic behaviour, as well as for immune response and cytotoxicity in cell culture models. It could be shown that the double emulsion method is suitable to prepare nanoparticles (270 nm) and to incorporate the antigen. By modifying the production method to prepare porous particles, it was possible to obtain an acceptable antigen release while maintaining an antigen load of about 10%. By the choice of polyvinyl alcohol as a stabiliser, nanoparticles could be dried and redispersed without further excipients and the production steps were capable of realisation in industry. Aerodynamic characteristics were good with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.3 m upon dispersion from a capsule-based inhaler.","output":"Preparation of Poly-Lactic-Co-Glycolic Acid Nanoparticles in a Dry Powder Formulation for Pulmonary Antigen Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with an increased mortality rate among hospitalized patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current review aimed to evaluate the symptoms, complications, and treatments performed to manage AKI in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase for the relevant scientific literature published up to February 1, 2022. The following keywords were used: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and Acute kidney injury. RESULTS: Forty-four studies with a total number of 114 COVID-19 patients with AKI (Mean age: 53.6 years) were included in our systematic review. The most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 suffering from AKI were the history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Twelve out of the 44 included studies reported a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in this group of patients. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) were the most common pathological evidence. The average length of hospital stay was 19 days, and the average duration of need for mechanical ventilation was 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic review shows that AKI frequently complicates the course of COVID-19 hospitalizations and is associated with increased severity of illness, prolonged duration of hospitalization, and poor prognosis.

Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess factors associated with the development of symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 730 COVID-19 patients (337 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of < 0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. RESULTS: The result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.25, 2.87, p-value = 0.002 for 30C39 years; AOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.73, p-value = 0.028 for 40C49 years and AOR = 4.42, 95% CI = 2.75, 7.12, p-value = 0.0001 for 50 years), sex (AOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.26, 2.45, p-value = 0.001) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.90, 95% CI = 1.92, 7.94, p-value = 0.0001) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Developing a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be associated with exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic.

However, predictors of decreased humoral response in patients after heart transplantation remain elusive. Methods In 68 HT recipients who previously received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG (anti-spike IgG) were quantified (LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay) during routine visits. IgG concentrations at or above 33.8 BAU/ml were considered positive, as defined by the manufacturer. Clinical characteristics including the immunosuppressive regimen were assessed. We performed regression analyses to identify predictors of humoral response. Results Of 68 HT recipients (44 (65%) male, median age 54 years (IQR 41-64), median time since HT 7.4 years (1.7-13.0)), 56 patients (82%) were treated with calcineurin-inhibitors, 35 (51%) with mycophenolate mofetil, 47 (69%) with everolimus, and 33 (49%) with prednisolone. 60 patients (88%) received two doses of an mRNA vaccine (50 patients BNT162b2, 10 mRNA-1273) and 8 patients (12%) two doses of the vector vaccine AZD1222. Two patients (2.9%) reported a prior COVID-19 infection. The median interval between the two vaccine shots was 41.5 days (35.0, 42.0). A positive humoral response 40 days after the second dose was detected in 26 patients (38%). Comparing the two types of vaccines used, antibody positivity rates were not significantly different (p = 0.10). Upon multivariate analysis, older patient age (p=0.006), shorter time since HT (p=0.022), male sex in combination with time since HT (p=0.023 for interaction effect), and use of prednisolone (p<0.001 in a tobit linear regression) were associated with lower log-transformed COVID-19 antibody titers. There was no detectable effect of vaccine type or of other immunosuppressive agents. Conclusion Older age, shorter time since transplantation, and treatment with prednisolone appear to be associated with lower anti-spike IgG concentrations after COVID-19 vaccination in HT patients. Overall humoral response rates were low (38%), regardless of the type of vaccine used or type of non-prednisolone immunosuppressive agent.

Methods: We systematically searched the databases PsyArXiv, PubMed, PsycInfo, Psyndex, PubPsych, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies assessing mental health outcomes (main outcomes) as well as potential risk and protective health behavior (additional outcomes) up to July 2, 2020. Findings: Most of the 80 publications fulfilling the selection criteria reflected the static difference perspective treating sex and gender as dichotomous variables. The focus was on internalizing disorders (especially anxiety and depression) burdening women in particular, while externalizing disorders were neglected. Sex- and gender-specific evaluation of mental healthcare use has also been lacking. With respect to unfavorable health behavior in terms of adherence to prescribed protective measures, men constitute a risk group.

The effect of having an allergic disease on COVID\\\\19 disease severity has been little studied. PURPOSE: In this study, we tried to determine the frequency of allergic diseases in COVID\\\\19 patients and the effect of having an allergic disease on COVID\\\\19 disease severity. DESIGN/METHOD: A retrospective cross\\\\sectional study was conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Patients were contacted by phone and those who approved to participate in the study were questioned about their sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, smoking history, and about their atopic status. Rate of atopic diseases among mild and severe COVID\\\\19 patients and risk estimates for mild disease in atopic and non\\\\atopic COVID\\\\19 patients were calculated. RESULTS: Study population consisted of 235 adults with COVID\\\\19 (mean age, 45.3 years [standard deviation, 15.0 years]; 139 [59.1%] male). Among study population, 16 (6.8%) subjects had one of the three atopic symptoms, which were wheezing, rhinitis, or eczema. Among the subjects with atopic status, four (1.7%) subjects had wheezing, eight (3.4%) had rhinitis, and four (1.7%) had eczema within the last 12 months. Although atopic status is associated with 3.1 times higher odds for mild disease, being atopic or not being atopic was not found to be associated with COVID\\\\19 severity (P = .054).

Methods: A total of 1122 HCW (approximately 25% of the employees) of a large tertiary care hospital in India were recruited for this cross-sectional study. COVID PCR-positive HCW were excluded. Based on their risk-assessment, participants were grouped into three categories. A questionnaire was administered and they were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using the chemiluminescence. Results: The overall seroprevalence among workers was 11.94%, which included 19.85% in COVID units, 11.09% in non-COVID units, and 8% in administrative workers (p=0.007). Antibody prevalence was highest in the department of gastroenterology (11.94%), followed by oncology (10.53%), pathology (10.26%), emergency medicine (7.84%) and critical care medicine (7%). Housekeeping staff, food and beverage staff, lab assistants and technicians had higher seroprevalence rate than doctors and nurses (p < 0.0001). HCW with a history of BCG vaccination in childhood and those who received an adequate prophylactic dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had a lower seroprevalence as compared to those who did not (7.31% vs. 16.8% and 1.30% vs. 11.25% respectively). Conclusion: BCG vaccination, HCQ prophylaxis, and the job profile influence the seroprevalence rate in HCW. Seroprevalence rate and follow-up evaluation of its durability may help hospitals to triage their staff at risk, rationalize their placement, prioritize the use of PPE, thereby potentially reducing the risk.","output":"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 Amongst Health Care Workers in a Tertiary Care Hospital of a Metropolitan City from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The PHARMASCREEN study, adapted from the Australian Cardiovascular Absolute Risk Screening study (CARS), tested the first community pharmacist-delivered screening model for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the UAE. Both PHARMASCREEN and CARS screening models successfully identified at-risk individuals despite differences in healthcare systems, infrastructure, and scope of practice. Comparing pharmacists' experiences of screening delivery in different health systems will help to understand key contextual factors that affect future implementation. OBJECTIVE: To explore and compare the views and experiences of pharmacists participating in the UAE PHARMACSCREEN trial, with those of community pharmacists who participated in the Australian CARS trial. METHODS: In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with pharmacists who delivered the screening programs in Australia (n = 10) and UAE (n = 12) to explore their views and experiences. The interview guide was similar in both studies to ensure consistency and comparability of collected data. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Two common themes emerged: pharmacists' experiences with the screening program, and barriers and facilitators to service delivery. Both groups held very positive views about the screening intervention, particularly referencing the professional satisfaction it generated and broad participant satisfaction with pharmacy-based screening. Despite country and health system differences, pharmacists reported many similar barriers (e.g., staffing levels, pharmacy coordination) and enablers (e.g., implementation support, adequate staffing, point-of-care tests, no cost to patient) to implementation. The context for screening delivery emerged as a key theme for UAE interviews only, where issues such as local population needs, regulatory factors, pharmacist roles and expectations, and training needs were quite prominent. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists' positive experiences with the screening programs is a testimony to the strong emerging evidence supporting pharmacists-delivered screening. Despite differences in health care systems, similar enablers and barriers were identified.

In this work, foam fractionation was employed to remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) from aqueous solution and dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS12) was used as the collector. Since the attachment of strain cells on the bubble surface would impede the reflux of interstitial liquid in the plateau borders (PBs), a novel strategy in strengthening foam drainage was developed through artificially inducing foam evolution. Two gas distributors with different pore diameters had been mounted at the bottom of the column for regulating the radial distribution of bubble size in the foam phase. Experimental results indicated that gas diffuse and bubble coarsening could be significantly promoted by increasing the size difference among the adjacent bubbles. Bubble coalescence contributed to broadening the width of plateau borders, thereby avoiding the borders blockage by strain cells. During bubble coalescence, surfactant molecules would be partially shifted from the surface of small bubble towards that of large bubble due to the molecule density difference. The increase in surface excess of surfactant molecules on gas-liquid interface was conducive to improving foam stability. Under the suitable conditions of air flow rates of gas distributor with 0.125 mm of pore diameter 75 mL/min and gas distributor with 0.425 mm of pore diameter 125 mL/min, BS12 concentration 0.1 g/L, and P. aeruginosa concentration 2.0  104 CFU/mL, the removal percentage and enrichment ratio of P. aeruginosa were 99.6% and 10.6, respectively.

In an effort to improve availability and delivery times, Rwanda launched the use of drones to deliver blood products to remote health facilities. We evaluated the effect of this intervention on blood product delivery times and wastage. METHODS: We studied data from 20 health facilities between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2019, in Rwanda. First, we did a cross-sectional comparison of data on emergency delivery times from the drone operator collected between March 17, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019, with two sources of estimated driving times (Regional Centre for Blood Transfusion estimates and Google Maps). Second, we used interrupted time series analysis and monthly administrative data to assess changes in blood product expirations after the commencement of drone deliveries. FINDINGS: Between March 17, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019, 12a??733 blood product orders were delivered by drones. 5517 (43%) of 12a??733 were emergency orders. The mean drone delivery time was 496 min (95% CI 491 to 502), which was 79 min faster than existing road delivery methods based on estimated driving times (p<00001) and 98 min faster based on Google Maps estimates (p<00001). The decrease in mean delivery time ranged from 3 min to 211 min depending on the distance to the facility and road quality. We also found a decrease of 71 blood unit expirations per month after the start of drone delivery (95% CI -118 to -24), which translated to a 67% reduction at 12 months. INTERPRETATION: We found that drone delivery led to faster delivery times and less blood component wastage in health facilities. Future studies should investigate if these improvements are cost-effective, and whether drone delivery might be effective for other pharmaceutical and health supplies that cannot be easily stored at remote facilities.

Supporting their psychological wellbeing continues, therefore, to be a priority. This rapid review was carried out to establish whether there are any identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst HSCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. MethodsWe undertook a rapid review of the literature following guidelines by the WHO and the COVID-19 Cochrane Collaborations recommendations. We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on health and care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsThe 24 studies included in this review reported data predominantly from China (18 out of 24 included studies) and most sampled urban hospital staff. Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes. ConclusionsThe evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological wellbeing in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed.

Here we consider the evidence on whether the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are ready to meet this challenge as well as targeted metabololipidomics of the resolution-inflammation metabolomes. Specific stereochemical mechanisms in the biosynthesis of SPMs from omega-3 essential fatty acids give rise to unique local-acting lipid mediators. SPMs possess stereochemically defined potent bioactive structures that are high-affinity ligands for cognate G protein-coupled surface receptors that evoke the cellular responses required for efficient resolution of acute inflammation. The SPMs biosynthesized from the major omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are coined Resolvins (resolution phase interaction products; E series and D-series), Protectins and Maresins (macrophage mediators in resolving inflammation). Their biosynthesis and stereochemical assignments are established and confirmed (>1,441 resolvin publications in PubMed.gov) as well as their functional roles on innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells (both lymphocyte T-cell subsets and B-cells). The resolution of a protective acute inflammatory response is governed mainly by phagocytes that actively clear apoptotic cells, debris, blood clots and pathogens. These resolution phase functions of the acute inflammatory response are enhanced by SPMs, which together prepare the inflammatory loci for homeostasis and stimulate tissue regeneration via activating stem cells and the biosynthesis of novel cys-SPMs (e.g. MCTRs, PCTRs and RCTRs). These cys-SPMs also activate regeneration, are organ protective and stimulate resolution of local inflammation. Herein, we review the biosynthesis and functions of the E-series resolvins, namely resolvin E1 (the first n-3 resolvin identified), resolvin E2, resolvin E3 and resolvin E4 biosynthesized from their precursor eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and the critical role of total organic synthesis in confirming SPM complete stereochemistry, establishing their potent functions in resolution of inflammation, and novel structures.

Infection of primary cells derived from the central nervous system (CNS) and liver was examined to analyze the interaction of virus with individual cell types derived from the two principal sites of viral replication in vivo. In glial cell cultures derived from C57BL/6 mice, MHV-A59 produces a productive but nonlytic infection, with no evidence of cell-to-cell fusion. In contrast, in continuously cultured cells, this virus produces a lytic infection with extensive formation of syncytia. The observation of few and delayed syncytia following MHV-A59 infection of hepatocytes more closely resembles infection of glial cells than that of continuously cultured cell lines. For MHV-A59, lack of syncytium formation correlates with lack of cleavage of the fusion glycoprotein, or spike (S) protein. The absence of cell-to-cell fusion following infection of both primary cell types prompted us to examine the cleavage of the spike protein. Cleavage of S protein was below the level of detection by Western blot analysis in MHV-A59-infected hepatocytes and glial cells. Furthermore, no cleavage of this protein was detected in liver homogenates from C57BL/6 mice infected with MHV-A59. Thus, cleavage of the spike protein does not seem to be essential for entry and spread of the virus in vivo, as well as for replication in vitro.","output":"The spike protein of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is not cleaved in primary glial cells and primary hepatocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research and development of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) therapeutic drugs has been undergoing rapid development in recent years in order to achieve the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030.

IgY anti-STAg antibodies presented high avidity and were able to recognize a broad range of parasite antigens, although some marked differences were observed in reactivity profile between antibodies produced in immunized hens and mice. Interestingly, IgY antibodies against Neospora caninum and Eimeria spp. did not react to STAg. We also show that IgY antibodies were suitable to detect T. gondii forms in paraffin-embedded sections and culture cell monolayers.

Potential risk factors, such as age, BMI, having children or not, working in a COVID-19 unit, or smoking were explored. FINDINGS. From May to June 2020, among the 8,960 employees of the University Hospital of Nancy, a serological test was performed in 4,696 HCWs. The average (SD) age was 40.4 (11.4) years, and the sample included 3,926 women (83.6%). Of the 4,696 HCWs, 1,050 were smokers (22.4%). Among them, 2,231 HCWs had a history of COVID-19 symptoms and/or flu-like syndrome (47.5%) and 238 were seropositive (5.1%). Neither gender, sex, BMI, nor having children were associated with a history of positive RT-PCR test or seropositive status. Previous work in a COVID-19 unit was associated with a history of positive RT-PCR test (p=0.045), but not with seroprevalence (p=0.215). As expected, history of COVID-19 clinical manifestations was more frequent in HCWs with positive serology than in HCWs with negative serology (adjusted OR=1.9, 95%CI [1.4-2.5], p<0.001). Less expected, smoking was associated with a reduced risk of seropositivity among HCWs (adjusted OR=0.6, 95%CI [0.4-0.9], p=0.019). INTERPRETATION. HCW are patently exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND: In a 2020 report, clinicians caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic said their healthcare leaders needed to: 'hear me, protect me, prepare me, support me, and care for me'. These words provide an action plan for nurse leaders to communicate, educate and support nurses to practice competently and safely (physically and mentally) in the context of COVID-19. DESIGN: Discursive paper. METHOD: Identification and inclusion of relevant international evidence with clinical discussion. FINDINGS: Nurse leaders can mobilise system and individual level strategies and resources to support nurses to manage pandemic-related issues including: anxiety due to the risk of infection, supporting anxious children, mitigating moral injury; providing safe and quality nursing care for patients with COVID-19 and end-of-life care as needed; supporting relatives who cannot be present with a dying relative and care for grieving relatives and colleagues. We categorise a selection of evidence-based, online sources providing current COVID-19 information, practice updates and resources to develop personalised self-care plans to ease anxiety and support renewal and resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse leaders must ensure adequate PPE supply, upskill nurses to provide safe, quality care for patients with COVID-19 and promote restorative self-care plans.

Symptoms, pulmonary function tests and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were compared across groups and to healthy controls. CT images were quantitatively analyzed using supervised machine-learning to measure regional ground glass opacities (GGO) and image-matching to measure regional air trapping. Comparisons were performed using univariate analyses and multivariate linear regression. Results Of the 100 patients enrolled, 67 were in the ambulatory group. All groups commonly reported cough and dyspnea. Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive physiology in the hospitalized and ICU groups but was normal in the ambulatory group.

A wide spectrum of renal pathologies has been reported from renal biopsies taken from patients with native kidneys following COVID-19 presentation. In comparison, biopsy-proven findings in the setting of kidney transplantation and COVID-19 diagnosis are seldom described. Our study aims to review early reported histological findings of transplant kidney biopsies from patients testing positive for COVID-19. METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of a larger study (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020218048) which reviewed the histopathological findings of kidney biopsies in adults with concurrent COVID-19 infection. A systematic literature search was conducted independently by two authors (HW, VJ) through PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Medline-ProQuest using the following keywords: COVID-19 AND Kidney Biopsy, COVID-19 AND Renal Biopsy, SARS-CoV-2 AND Kidney Biopsy and SARS-CoV-2 AND Renal Biopsy. Articles were screened by three authors (HW, VJ, RC) for relevance and duplicates were removed. The study selection process was carried out as per the PRISMA guideline. In this analysis, we included all research articles reporting biopsies in transplanted kidneys in adults over age > 18 who tested positive with COVID-19 following a PCR swab test. We only included articles published in the English language. All relevant articles published before November 1(st) 2020 were included in this review. Information regarding demographic data, co-morbidities, renal presentation, renal parameters at time of COVID-19 diagnosis, management, need for renal replacement therapy and outcomes were extracted from selected articles. RESULTS: Our review identified 11 cases reporting transplant kidney biopsies in patients with positive COVID-19 status. These 11 cases were reported from 7 articles, which were either single case reports or part of a case series. Mean age of the reported cases was 43.6 years  10.7. Transplant kidney biopsies were taken from 4 female and 7 male patients, where 7 patients were of black ethnicity. The review involved 3 live donor and 6 deceased donor transplanted kidneys, and 2 cases did not report type of kidney transplant received. All of the documented cases presented with acute kidney injury. 9 patients have essential hypertension or hypertension secondary to other co-morbidities. Biopsy findings revealed 2 cases of acute T-cell mediated and antibody mediated rejection, 2 cases of acute tubular injury, 5 cases of either FSGS or collapsing FSGS and 1 report of post-transplant kidney infarction. Acute treatment received involved different regimes. All 11 patients were eventually discharged from hospital, where 2 patients required dialysis following discharge. Table 1 describes data from the extracted cases. CONCLUSION: There are multiple histological pathologies observed amongst transplant kidney biopsies taken from patients admitted following COVID-19 diagnosis. Early results suggest aggressive medical treatment to manage inflammation, transplant rejection and co-morbidities such as hypertension may optimize general and renal-specific outcomes.

Early data from COVID-19 patients as well as previous studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and other respiratory disorders show that the extent of lung fibrosis is associated with a higher mortality, prolonged ventilator dependence, and poorer long-term health prognosis. Current treatments to halt or reverse lung fibrosis are limited; thus, the rapid development of effective antifibrotic therapies is a major global medical need that will continue far beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. Reproducible fibrosis screening assays with high signal-to-noise ratios and disease-relevant readouts such as extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (the hallmark of fibrosis) are integral to any antifibrotic therapeutic development. Therefore, we have established an automated high-throughput and high-content primary screening assay measuring transforming growth factor- (TGF)-induced ECM deposition from primary human lung fibroblasts in a 384-well format. This assay combines longitudinal live cell imaging with multiparametric high-content analysis of ECM deposition. Using this assay, we have screened a library of 2743 small molecules representing approved drugs and late-stage clinical candidates. Confirmed hits were subsequently profiled through a suite of secondary lung fibroblast phenotypic screening assays quantifying cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. In silico target prediction and pathway network analysis were applied to the confirmed hits. We anticipate this suite of assays and data analysis tools will aid the identification of new treatments to mitigate against lung fibrosis associated with COVID-19 and other fibrotic diseases.","output":"Application of a High-Content Screening Assay Utilizing Primary Human Lung Fibroblasts to Identify Antifibrotic Drugs for Rapid Repurposing in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global scenario assessments in support of climate, biodiversity, energy and other international policy deliberations tend to focus on a narrow bandwidth of possibilities: futures that unfold gradually from current patterns and trends This continuity bias downplays the real risks (and opportunities) of structural discontinuity in the evolution of the global social-ecological system The inclination to focus on mathematically tractable representations and conventional futures preferred by decision-makers is understandable, but constrains the scientific imagination and the scope of policy guidance Earlier studies spotlighted discontinuous global futures, thereby revealing a broader spectrum of possibilities and repertoire of actions than found in contemporary scenario analysis The paper revisits three types of futures introduced 25 years ago;examines three truths they convey about the contemporary moment;and points to three courses of action they suggest Contemporary assessments centre on incrementally changing Conventional Worlds, yet varieties of global disruption (Barbarization) and progressive transformation (Great Transition) remain plausible alternatives Corresponding to this triad, three synergistic action prongsreform (incremental policies), remediation (emergency preparedness and prevention), and redesign (deep cultural and institutional change)come into focus Recovering a comprehensive perspective on the global possible would reinvigorate debate on the kind of transformation needed, broaden the action agenda, and stimulate innovative research for illuminating our indeterminate future The COVID-19 pandemic, a concrete illustration of historical discontinuity, underscores the critical importance of emphasizing nonconventional futures in policy assessments","output":"Excluded futures: the continuity bias in scenario assessments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a major cause of mortality worldwide. Advanced age and a number of chronic diseases have been investigated as risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Likewise, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been proposed as a potential risk factor for COVID-19, however, the possible relationship between HIV and COVID-19 has remained difficult to fully elucidate due to a paucity of data. We describe a case series of 11 patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION Between March 20, 2020 and May 5, 2020, 11 patients with HIV were admitted for COVID-19at an underserved community hospital in Brooklyn, NY. . Patients ranged from 39 to 78 years of age. Seven patients were men and four patients were women. Seven patients were African American and four patients were Hispanic. All 11 patients possessed HIV RNA viral loads less than 40 copies/ml. The mean CD4 count was 556 cells/ml (range 171-1123 cells/ml). Nine patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation;five of the six patients died. Two of these five patients were not on ART, prior to admission and two of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome during their hospital course. The mean length of stay was 10.9 days (range 2-21 days). Three of the six survivors were readmitted within 30 days for CHF exacerbation, bacterial pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. All three patients recovered without complications. At six-month follow-up, no mortalities were reported among the six surviving patients. DISCUSSION This case series presents a unique sample of African American and Hispanic patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. This is the first case series to report long term outcomes among minority population. The high mortality rate in this case series (45%) is also notable in comparison to prior research. This elevated mortality rate may reflect an increased burden of comorbidities in HIV patients. Further research is required to reveal if ART therapy reduces risk of poor outcomes, and if so, which regimen may confer protection against COVID-19.","output":"Clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized patients co-infected with covid-19 and hiv: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Forecasting epidemics like COVID-19 is of crucial importance, it will not only help the governments but also, the medical practitioners to know the future trajectory of the spread, which might help them with the best possible treatments, precautionary measures and protections. In this study, the popular autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) will be used to forecast the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered cases, and the number of deaths in Pakistan from COVID-19 spanning June 25, 2020 to July 04, 2020 (10 days ahead forecast). METHODS: To meet the desire objectives, data for this study have been taken from the Ministry of National Health Service of Pakistan's website from February 27, 2020 to June 24, 2020. Two different ARIMA models will be used to obtain the next 10 days ahead point and 95% interval forecast of the cumulative confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Statistical software, RStudio, with \\"forecast\\", \\"ggplot2\\", \\"tseries\\", and \\"seasonal\\" packages have been used for data analysis. RESULTS: The forecasted cumulative confirmed cases, recovered, and the number of deaths up to July 04, 2020 are 231239 with a 95% prediction interval of (219648, 242832), 111616 with a prediction interval of (101063, 122168), and 5043 with a 95% prediction interval of (4791, 5295) respectively. Statistical measures i.e. root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for model accuracy. It is evident from the analysis results that the ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA model is better than the other time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy and hence recommended to be used for forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from this study that the forecasting accuracy of ARIMA models in terms of RMSE, and MAE are better than the other time series models, and therefore could be considered a good forecasting tool in forecasting the spread, recoveries, and deaths from the current outbreak of COVID-19. Besides, this study can also help the decision-makers in developing short-term strategies with regards to the current number of disease occurrences until an appropriate medication is developed.","output":"Forecasting COVID-19 in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated binge behaviors during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy, exploring individual and contextual risk factors.

An online survey investigated binge behaviors both prior and during quarantine. Binge drinking significantly diminished during quarantine, while binge eating episodes did not vary in frequency. However, participants with pre-existent binge eating disorder (BED) reported a worsening in BED symptoms. Lower education, lower SES, job suspension due to lockdown, and higher pandemic-related stress were associated to an increase in binge behaviors during home confinement, whereas living with family was a protective factor. Participants reporting co-occurrent binge behaviors also had significantly higher pandemic-related stress and lower perceived support during home confinement, in comparison with no-binge participants.

The Big Five personality traitsopenness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stabilitywere assessed with the International Personality Item Pool. Students were asked whether they kept up with the COVID-19 news, followed specific governmental rules and recommendations (washing hands more, using public transport less, avoiding larger crowds, and restricting meetings with family/friends), hoarded supplies, felt less secure in public places, or expected financial losses due to the crisis. Logistic regressions adjusted for sociodemographic factors and cognitive abilities revealed that more conscientious (odds ratio (OR) = 1.133) and more agreeable (OR = 1.285) students kept up with the news more. More agreeable students were also more likely to wash their hands more often/intensively (OR = 1.262), use public transport less (OR = 1.182), avoid crowds (OR = 1.320), and restrict meetings with family/friends (OR = 1.410). Other Big Five traits were not associated with these behaviors, except that less emotionally stable individuals tended to use public transport less often (OR = 1.162). Additionally, less emotionally stable students, in particular, more often bought more supplies than usual (OR = 1.322), felt insecure in public spaces (OR = 1.597), and expected financial losses (OR = 1.270). Moreover, less open (OR = 0.876) and more conscientious (OR = 1.235) students more often felt insecure in public spaces, and more extraverted individuals more often expected financial losses (OR = 1.180).

Following successful preclinical studies with mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP), we tested an mRNA-LNP formulation (CV7202). METHODS: In this phase 1, multi-center, controlled study in Belgium and Germany we enrolled 55 healthy 18-40-year-olds to receive intramuscular injections of 5 g (n = 10), 1 g (n = 16), or 2 g (n = 16) CV7202 on Day 1; subsets (n = 8) of 1 g and 2 g groups received second doses on Day 29. Controls (n = 10) received rabies vaccine, Rabipur, on Days 1, 8 and 29. Safety and reactogenicity were assessed up to 28 days post-vaccination using diary cards; immunogenicity was measured as RABV-G-specific neutralizing titers (VNT) by RFFIT and IgG by ELISA. RESULTS: As initially tested doses of 5 g CV7202 elicited unacceptably high reactogenicity we subsequently tested 1 and 2 g doses which were better tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred. Low, dose-dependent VNT responses were detectable from Day 15 and by Day 29%, 31% and 22% of 1, 2 and 5 g groups, respectively, had VNTs &#8805; 05 IU/mL, considered an adequate response by the WHO. After two 1 or 2 g doses all recipients had titers &#8805; 0.5 IU/mL by Day 43. Day 57 GMTs were not significantly lower than those with Rabipur, which elicited adequate responses in all vaccinees after two doses. CV7202-elicited VNT were significantly correlated with RABV-G-specific IgG antibodies (r2 = 0.8319, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Two 1 g or 2 g doses of CV7202 were well tolerated and elicited rabies neutralizing antibody responses that met WHO criteria in all recipients, but 5 g had unacceptable reactogenicity for a prophylactic vaccine.

New tools are needed to distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, the natural history of pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. METHODS: Data from the multi-year, ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study of approximately 3,800 children aged 2C14 years in Managua, Nicaragua, were used to examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measures, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: One-fourth of children who tested dengue-positive did not meet the WHO case definition for suspected dengue. The frequency of signs and symptoms varied by day of illness, dengue status, and disease severity. Multivariable GEE models showed increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test, vomiting, leukopenia, platelets 150,000 cells/mL, poor capillary refill, cold extremities and hypotension. Estimated ORs tended to be higher for signs and symptoms over the course of illness compared to the early phase of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase of illness compared to the entire course of illness.

Methods: This study included 43 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal PCR test who were followed up for AIS, and 70 patients without COVID-19 who were followed up for AIS during the same period from the Konya Numune State Hospital, Turkey. Results: Poor prognosis and mortality were found to be significantly higher in the AIS group with COVID-19 compared with the non-COVID-19 AIS group. In the AIS group with COVID-19, a higher rate of intensive care unit (ICU) need (40% vs. 5%), higher intubation rate (35% vs. 3%) and longer hospital stay (12.9  10.8 vs. 6.6  4.0 days) were observed. In the laboratory examinations, C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, troponin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with AIS who were positive for COVID-19. An increase in D-dimer, ferritin and thrombocytopenia were found to be associated with mortality in the COVID-19 positive AIS group. Conclusion: Patients with AIS and COVID-19 had a higher rate of ICU need, higher intubation rate, longer hospital stay, higher mortality, and poorer prognosis than those without COVID-19. High levels of ferritin, D-dimer and fibrin degradation products were associated with a poor prognosis.

Literature surrounding the mechanisms of TCM therapy for treatment of liver diseases is presented and discussed. We propose that side effects of herbal compounds are often under-appreciated, and that more care should be taken in the prescription of potentially hepatotoxic medicines. Further, to deepen the understanding of TCM mechanisms, new techniques and methodologies must be developed. Future studies will lead to the enhancement of clinical outcomes of TCM.

Most Australian parents support vaccines, but some refuse and are often judged harshly by their community, especially during an outbreak. We sought the perspectives of Australian public health experts on the key issues faced when managing a measles outbreak in an area with high anti-vaccination sentiment. Methods: A measles outbreak scenario formed the basis of a 3-round modified Delphi process to identify key practitioner concerns in relation to parents/carers who dont follow the recommended vaccination schedule. We surveyed a range of professionals in the field: policymakers, infectious disease experts, immunisation program staff, and others involved in delivering childhood vaccinations, to identify key priorities when responding to an outbreak in a community with low vaccination coverage. Results: Findings indicate that responses to measles outbreaks in communities with high anti-vaccination sentiment are motivated by concerns about the potential for a much larger outbreak event. The highest operational priority is to isolate infected children. The two most highly ranked practical issues are mistrust from non-vaccinating members of the local region and combatting misinformation about vaccines. Trying to change minds of such individuals is not a priority during an outbreak, nor is vaccinating their children. Using media and social media to provide information about the outbreak and measures the public can take to limit the spread of the disease was a focus. Conclusions: Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the challenges faced during an outbreak and priorities for communicating with communities where there is a high level of anti-vaccination sentiment. In the context of a global pandemic, the results of this study also have implications for managing public health responses to community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if and when a safe and effective vaccine becomes widely available.","output":"Public Health Practitioner Perspectives on Dealing with Measles Outbreaks in Areas with high Anti-vaccination Sentiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be a rapidly fatal disease.

Since then, it has become a global pandemic. A robust and scalable diagnostics strategy is crucial for containing and monitoring the pandemic. RT-PCR is a known, reliable method for COVID-19 diagnostics, which can differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. However, PCR is location-dependent, time-consuming, and relatively expensive. Thus, there is a need for a more flexible method, which may be produced in an off-the-shelf format and distributed more widely. Paper-based immunoassays can fulfill this function. Here, we present the first steps toward a paper-based test, which can differentiate between different spike proteins of various coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and CoV-HKU1, with negligible cross-reactivity for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E in a single assay, which takes less than 30 min. Furthermore, our test can distinguish between fractions of the same spike protein. This is done by an altered assay design with four test line locations where each antigen builds a unique, identifiable binding pattern. The effect of several factors, such as running media, immunoprobe concentration, and antigen interference, is considered. We find that running media has a significant effect on the final binding pattern where human saliva provides results while human serum leads to the lowest signal quality.","output":"Developing a Paper-Based Antigen Assay to Differentiate between Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pursuing goals is compromised when being confronted with interfering information. In such situations conflict monitoring is important. Theoretical considerations on the neurobiology of response selection and control suggest that auricular transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (atVNS) should modulate conflict monitoring. However, the neurophysiological-functional neuroanatomical underpinnings are still not understood. METHODS AtVNS was applied in a randomized crossover study design (N=45). During atVNS or sham stimulation, conflict monitoring was assessed using a Flanker task. EEG data were recorded and analyzed with focus on theta and alpha band activity. Beamforming was applied to examine functional neuroanatomical correlates of atVNS-induced EEG modulations. Moreover, temporal EEG signal decomposition was applied to examine different coding level in alpha and theta band activity. RESULTS AtVNS compromised conflict monitoring processes, when atVNS was applied at the second appointment in the crossover study design. On a neurophysiological level, atVNS exerted specific effects since only alpha-band activity was modulated. Alpha-band activity was lower in middle and superior prefrontal regions during atVNS stimulation and thus lower when there was also a decline in task performance. The same direction of alpha-band modulations was evident in fractions of the alpha-band activity coding stimulus-related processes, stimulus-response translation processes, and motor response-related processes. CONCLUSIONS The combination of prior task experience and atVNS compromises conflict monitoring processes. This is likely due to reduction of alpha-band associated inhibitory gating process on interfering information in frontal cortices. Future research shall pay considerable attention to boundary conditions affecting the direction of atVNS effects.","output":"Auricular transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation diminishes alpha-band related inhibitory gating processes during conflict monitoring in frontal cortices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a rare but devastating complication of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This study sought to determine whether quantitative hemodynamic assessment using MR angiography can stratify CHS risk. METHODS In this prospective trial, patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were randomly selected for pre- and postoperative quantitative phase-contrast MR angiography (QMRA). Assessment was standardized according to a protocol and included Doppler/duplex sonography, MRI, and/or CT angiography and QMRA of the intra- and extracranial supplying arteries of the brain. Clinical and radiological data were analyzed to identify CHS risk factors. RESULTS Twenty-five of 153 patients who underwent CEA for ICA stenosis were randomly selected for pre- and postoperative QMRA. QMRA data showed a 2.2-fold postoperative increase in blood flow in the operated ICA (p < 0.001) and a 1.3-fold increase in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) (p = 0.01). Four patients had clinically manifested CHS. The mean flow increases in the patients with CHS were significantly higher than in the patients without CHS, both in the ICA and MCA (p < 0.001). Female sex and a low preoperative diastolic blood pressure were the clearest clinical risk factors for CHS, whereas the flow differences and absolute postoperative flow values in the ipsilateral ICA and MCA were identified as potential radiological predictors for CHS. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral ICA and MCA as assessed by QMRA significantly increased after CEA. Higher mean flow differences in ICA and MCA were associated with the development of CHS. QMRA might have the potential to become a noninvasive, operator-independent screening tool for identifying patients at risk for CHS.","output":"Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography as a potential predictor for cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome: a preliminary study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans.

The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of S?o Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students.

We aimed to identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting of an acute COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 6017 years, 15 women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to conventional radiologist interpretation. RESULTS Fifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities. CONCLUSION Chest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well as acuity of care.

Design and Methods In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged 18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs. 66.8pmol/l, -52.7% [95%CI -68.5% to -36.9%]; angiotensin II: 37.7 vs. 92.5pmol/l, -59.2% [95%CI -72.1% to -46.3%]; angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs. 6.6pmol/l, -49.7% [95%CI -59.2% to -40.2%]; angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs. 7.6pmol/l, -64.9% [95%CI -84.5% to -45.3%]). While the plasma renin activity (PRA-S) was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs. 207.9pmol/l, -58.5% [95%CI -71.4% to -45.6%]), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Method: This retrospective observational cohort study was based on the first 100 patients who requested recommendations on the necessity of breaking the lockdown for emergency ophthalmology consultation during the period from March to May 2020. Results: 91 patients completed questionnaires. 49 were directed to emergency consultation and 42 to differed scheduled visits or telemedicine visits. One patient sent for emergency consultation had an overestimated severity and could have been seen later, while two patients initially recommended for a scheduled visit were considered appropriate for emergency consultation. However, these patients management did not suffer as a consequence of the delay. The sensitivity of the algorithm, defined as the number of emergency consultations suggested by the algorithm divided by the total number of emergency consultations deemed appropriate by the practitioners final evaluation, was 96.0%. The specificity of the algorithm, defined as the number of patients recommended for delayed consultation by the algorithm divided by the number of patients deemed clinically appropriate for this approach, was 97.5%.

To compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance strategies in detecting COVID-19 within the homeless shelter population. 2. To assess the participant adherence over time for each surveillance method. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective cluster-randomized study to compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance regimens across eight homeless shelters in the city of Hamilton. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include both residents of, and the staff working within, the homeless shelters. All participants aged 18 or older who consent to the study and are able to collect a swab sample (where relevant) are eligible for the study. The study will take place across eight homeless shelters (four men-only and four women-only) in the City of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR GROUPS: The comparator group will receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing will only be completed in symptomatic participants (i.e. those who fail screening or who seek care for potential COVID-19 related symptoms). The three intervention arms will all receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing of symptomatic participants (as in the comparator group) in addition to one of the following: 1. Once weekly self-collected oral swabs (OS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 2. Once weekly self-collected oral-nares swab (O-NS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 3. Once weekly nurse collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) regardless of symptoms. Participants will follow verbal and written instructions for the collection of OS and O-NS specimens. For OS collection, participants are instructed to first moisten the swab on their tongue, insert the swab between the cheek and the lower gums and rotate the swab three times. This is repeated on the other side. For O-NS collection, after oral collection, the swab is inserted comfortably (about 2-3 cm) into one nostril, parallel to the floor and turned three times, then repeated in the other nostril. NPS specimens were collected by the nurse following standard of care procedure. All swabs were placed into a viral inactivation medium and transported to the laboratory for COVID-19 testing. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from specimens and then amplified by RT-PCR for the UTR and Envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the human RNase P gene, which is used as a sample adequacy marker. MAIN OUTCOMES: 1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: COVID-19 detection rate, i.e. the number of new positive cases over the study period of 8 weeks in each arm of the study. 2. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Qualitative assessment of study enrollment over 8 weeks. Percentage of participants who performed 50% or more of the weekly swabs in the intervention arms in the 8 week study period. RANDOMIZATION: We will use a computer-generated random assignment list to randomize the shelters to one of four interventions. Shelters were stratified by gender, and the simple randomization scheme was applied within each stratum. The randomization scheme was created using WinPEPI. BLINDING: This is an open-label study in which neither participants nor assessors are blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): Since we are including our total sample frame, a sample size estimation at the cluster level is not required. However, if we succeed to enroll 50 participants per shelter from 8 shelters (n=400), and the detection rate is 3 times higher in the intervention groups (0.15) than in the comparator groups (0.05), we will have 90% power to detect a statistically significant and clinically important difference at a type I error rate of alpha=0.05 (one tailed), assuming an intraclass correlation of ~0.008. These computations were done using WinPEPI, and informed by conservative estimates from other studies on respiratory illness in the homeless (see Full protocol). TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 3.0. Recruitment began on April 17, 2020 and is ongoing. Due to low numbers of COVID cases in the community and shelter system during the initial study period, the trial was extended.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Observational cohort studies that reported either the risk of all-cause mortality, incidence of non-fatal cardiovascular events (CVE) or progression of kidney disease among adults with established CKD who have NAFLD compared with those without. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers extracted data and assessed bias independently. RESULTS Of 2604 records identified, 3 studies were included (UK (n=852), South Korea (n=1525) and USA (n=1413)). All were judged to have a low or moderate risk of bias. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. Two studies examined the influence of NAFLD on all-cause mortality. One reported a significant positive association for NAFLD with all-cause mortality for individuals with CKD (p<0.05) (cardiovascular-related mortality p=ns), which was lost following adjustment for metabolic risk factors; the second reported no effect in adjusted and unadjusted models. The latter was the only study to report outcomes for non-fatal CVEs and observed NAFLD to be an independent risk factor for this (propensity-matched HR=2.00, p=0.02). Two studies examined CKD progression; in one adjusted rate of percentage decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate per year was found to be increased in those with NAFLD (p=0.002), whereas the other found no significant difference.

Reference is made to previously known effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, it will be shown how long-term treatment should be further developed in order to improve patient quality of life. Functional impairment of the kidney has severe effects on the entire organism due to contamination of the blood with urophanic substances (uremia). In addition, patients are affected by side effects that can occur in connection with drug therapy, dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Patients and their relatives are exposed to great psychological stress. Also, infections with SARS-CoV?2 can impair kidney function and worsen the prognosis of a pre-existing disease. The holistic care of patients with chronic kidney disease must consider not only medical care but also psychological and psychosocial aspects. Nephrology and psychonephrology must be further developed hand-in-hand to improve the medical care and quality of life of affected patients.","output":"Langfristige k?rperliche und psychische Folgen chronischer Nierenerkrankungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The renin-angiotensin system plays a very critical role in hypertension, diabetes, and kidney and heart diseases The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system results in the prevention of progression of renal and cardiac damage There have been controversial hypotheses raised regarding the safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) We present the case series of four patients (2 men and 2 women;1 Caucasian and 3 African Americans;two survived and two died) with confirmed COVID-19, presenting with respiratory symptoms and acute kidney injury, who have been on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers Membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been implicated as the gateway for viral entry into the human cell in causing the infection The factors contributing to acute kidney injury are diuretics, iodinated contrast administration, hemodynamic instability apart from ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers The ACE inhibitors and ARBs were stopped in these patients due to acute kidney injury We also discussed the role of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in patients with COVID-19 infection along with pathogenesis","output":"Acute Kidney Injury in a Case Series of Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019): Role of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The study intended to understand the effect of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on western Indian elderly care homes, which are also called as old age homes.

The female Lpr mice developed a greater number of mediastinal fat-associated lymphoid clusters (MFALCs) and inflammatory lung lesions compared to the male mice. However, the effect of Dex, an immunosuppressive drug, on both lung lesions and the development of MFALCs in Lpr mice has not been identified yet. Therefore, in this study, we compared the development of lung lesions and MFALCs in female Lpr mice that received either saline (saline group SG) or dexamethasone (dexamethasone group DG) in drinking water as a daily dose along with weekly intraperitoneal injections for 10 weeks. Compared to the SG group, the DG group showed a significant reduction in the levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies, the size of MFALCs, the degree of lung injury, the area of high endothelial venules (HEVs), and the number of proliferating and immune cells in both MFALCs and the lungs. A significant positive correlation was observed between the size of MFALCs and the cellular aggregation in the lungs of Lpr mice. Therefore, this study confirmed the ameliorative effect of Dex on the development of lung injury and MFALCs via their regressive effect on both immune cells proliferative activity and the development of HEVs. Furthermore, the reprogramming of MFALCs by targeting immune cells and HEVs may provide a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune-disease-associated lung injury.","output":"The Ameliorative Effect of Dexamethasone on the Development of Autoimmune Lung Injury and Mediastinal Fat-Associated Lymphoid Clusters in an Autoimmune Disease Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ferret coronaviruses (FRCoVs) exist as an enteric and a systemic pathotype, of which the latter is highly lethal to ferrets.

Undocumented migrants (UDMs) are likely to experience inequalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They rely on the informal market for work and housing and are usually not entitled to a healthcare insurance. However, they are not represented in the COVID-19 registrations or surveys. In order to advise the policymakers and healthcare professionals on how to tailor the preventive activities in handling a pandemic, including vaccination strategy, to the needs of this group, an insight into their experiences is needed. In our qualitative study, two focus group discussions were held with 14 UDMs, recruited through a snowball technique. The UDMs perceived the COVID-19 as a threat. Their precarious position affected their perceived vulnerability, which motivated them to seek information on and comply with preventive measures and testing. However, structural barriers decreased their self-efficacy and opportunity to comply. The COVID-19 measures impacted the lives of UDMs on essential domains, resulting in job, food, and housing insecurity, and increased barriers in access to healthcare. An intersectoral approach addressing health communication, access to healthcare, and social support, as well as legal rights for safe employment, is needed to alleviate the impact of the measures on UDMs. Copyright ? 2022 van den Muijsenbergh, Torensma, Skowronek, de Lange and Stronks.","output":"Undocumented Domestic Workers and Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Qualitative Study on the Impact of Preventive Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The switch from intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) to real-time (rt) CGM could improve glycemic management in suboptimal controlled type 1 diabetes patients, but long-term study is lacking.

Biofilms have been implicated in the development of infections such as dental caries and hardware infections. Biofilms form on endotracheal tubes (ETT) and can impact airway resistance. The lifecycle of a biofilm has four stages. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the stage of biofilm on the ETT and development of pneumonia. METHODS Thirty-two ETT were analyzed for biofilms and staged. Staging was performed by a microbiologist blinded to all patient information. Data included development of pneumonia, duration of intubation, comorbidities, and microbiology. Pneumonia was defined as presence of fever, WBC >12 K or <4 K, infiltrate on chest X-ray, and purulent sputum with +lower airway culture (bronchoalveolar lavage or brush). Statistics were performed by a biostatistician; p < 0.05 defined significance. RESULTS There were 11 women and 21 men with a mean age of 50 years. Mean intensive care unit days were 13 (standard deviation  9.9) and mean length of intubation was 7.4 days (standard deviation  5.0). Half (16 of 32) the patients developed pneumonia while intubated. Eight of 10 patients with a stage IV biofilm had pneumonia. There was a relationship between increasing biofilm stage with the incidence of pneumonia (p < 0.05). Stage IV biofilms were associated with pneumonia (p < 0.02). There was no relationship to duration of intubation, patient age or hospital stay and biofilm stage.

Athletes and their entourage experience this uncertainty as stressful. Sport psychology practitioners (SPPs) are in a key position to support athletes in coping with these unforeseeable stressors. However, SPPs are similarly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneously have to cope with stress. Salutogenesis, which describes how to manage stress and to stay well, provides a theoretical approach to how to cope with uncertainty. The salutogenetic approach aims at strengthening individuals' sense of coherence (SoC) and consists of three components, namely comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. Although it is known that the SoC can be enhanced via psychological skills training, so far, this approach has not been systematically applied to the elite sport context. Athletes have been advised to see SPPs for help;thus, the question of how SPPs handle the time of uncertainty while supporting others emerges. The aim of this contribution was to outline how the salutogenetic approach can be applied to strengthening SPPs' SoC via a single-day four-part workshop. Additionally, we applied the workshop to N = 26 volleyball coaches and evaluated the workshop's effects on participants' psychological aspects [i.e., the Sense of Coherence-Leipziger short version (SoC-L9), resilience (RS-13): coping with uncertainty, affective response, and stress via semantic differentials] and the workshop's quality ratings (i.e., Quality Questionnaire for Sport Psychological Coaching, QS-17). The evaluation provides results that show a positive impact on a descriptive level of the participants' SoC, uncertainty, affect, and stress perception;however, the results show no significant main effect of time [F(8, 10) = 1.04, p = 0.467, eta p 2 = 0.454].

Thus, we outline how this workshop might help strengthen SPPs' SoC and at the same time empower them to strengthen their athletes' SoC. Overall, we add a theoretical (i.e., salutogenesis in sports) and a practical perspective (i.e., coping techniques based on salutogenesis) on how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic for SPPS, athletes, and their support network.","output":"Development of a Salutogenesis Workshop for SPPs to Help Them, Their Athletes, and the Athlete's Entourage Better Cope With Uncertainty During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases has rapidly increased all over the world. Specific information about immunity in non-survivors with COVID-19 is scarce. This study aimed to analyse the clinical characteristics and abnormal immunity of the confirmed COVID-19 non-survivors. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 125 patients with COVID-19 who were died between January 13 and March 4, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A total of 414 randomly recruited patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from the same hospital during the same period served as control. The demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings at admission, and treatment used in these patients were collected. The immunity-related risk factors associated with in-hospital death were tested by logistic regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Non-survivors (70 years, IQR: 61.5-80) were significantly older than survivors (54 years, IQR: 37-65) (P < 0.001). 56.8% of non-survivors was male. Nearly half of the patients (44.9%) had chronic medical illness. In non-survivors, hypertension (49.6%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes (20.0%) and coronary heart disease (16.0%). The common signs and symptoms at admission of non-survivors were fever (88%), followed by cough (64.8%), dyspnea (62.4%), fatigue (62.4%) and chest tightness (58.4%). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had higher white blood cell (WBC) count (7.85 vs 5.07  109/L), more elevated neutrophil count (6.41 vs 3.08  109/L), smaller lymphocyte count (0.69 vs 1.20  109/L) and lower platelet count (172 vs 211  109/L), raised concentrations of procalcitonin (0.21 vs 0.06 ng/mL) and CRP (70.5 vs 7.2 mg/L) (P < 0.001). This was accompanied with significantly decreased levels of CD3+ T cells (277 vs 814 cells/l), CD4+ T cells (172 vs 473 cells/l), CD8+ T cells (84 vs 262.5 cells/l, P < 0.001), CD19+ T cells (88 vs 141 cells/l) and CD16+ 56+ T cells (79 vs 128.5 cells/l) (P < 0.001). The concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig) G (13.30 vs 11.95 g/L), IgA (2.54 vs 2.21 g/L), and IgE (71.30 vs 42.25 IU/ml) were increased, whereas the levels of complement proteins (C)3 (0.89 vs 0.99 g/L) and C4 (0.22 vs 0.24 g/L) were decreased in non-survivors when compared with survivors (all P < 0.05). The non-survivors presented lower levels of oximetry saturation (90 vs 97%) at rest and lactate (2.40 vs 1.90 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). Old age, comorbidity of malignant tumor, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4+ T cells, decreased C3, and low oximetry saturation were the risk factors of death in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The frequency of CD4+ T cells positively correlated with the numbers of lymphocytes (r = 0.787) and the level of oximetry saturation (r = 0.295), Whereas CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with age (r =-0.323) and the numbers of neutrophils (r = - 0.244) (all P < 0.001).

Despite its large-scale adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensive analyses of patients' perspectives and hurdles are lacking. Materials and Methods We conducted an anonymized telephonic survey of consecutive neurosurgical patients who availed telemedicine services at our institute, using a validated, structured questionnaire. To prevent bias, interviewers were not involved in the study design/analyses. Patients' perception of usefulness and performance of teleconsultation was graded on a 5-point Likert scale. Results Of the 330 patients who availed teleconsultation services, 231 (70%) completed the survey. Even though 91% of the respondents had access to a smartphone, only 10% received a video-based teleconsult. As per respondents, the challenges included poor network (7%), suboptimal communication/discussion (5.6%), lack of physical examination (6%), and misinterpretation of prescription by pharmacists/patients (6%). The majority of the respondents (58%) either agreed/strongly agreed that teleconsultation helped them tide over the medical exigency during the lockdown; however, the clinical diagnosis did not influence this response (P = 0.21). The vast majority of the respondents felt that teleconsultation is beneficial (97%), as it minimizes their exposure to COVID-19. One-third of the patients preferred this service over physical visits and 60% agreed to its continuation till resumption of routine care. Access to video-teleconsultation was the chief suggestion in 39 of 74 suggestions received. Conclusions Telemedicine in neurosurgery offers favorable patient satisfaction during this pandemic and may be a satisfactory alternative to physical outpatient services in the future.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors assessed data of encounters and intravitreal injections from March 16th to May 8th 2020, at different offices specializing in retina in the United States. All three practices are located in COVID-19 hot spot zones. One practice was in an academic setting, one practice was in a private multispecialty setting, and one practice was a solo private vitreo-retina practice. All practices were focused on emergent/urgent care, and the results were compared to preCOVID-19 weekly averages. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the number of encounters and injections was revealed in all three centers involved in this review. There was a decrease of 87% in encounters (156 patients were seen only) and a decrease of 58% (126 patients) in intravitreal injections in Weill Cornell Medical College in NYC and a decline of 59% (569 patients) in encounters and a decrease of 64% (280 patients) of intravitreal injections at the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. The decline at Miami Ocular Oncology & Retina in Miami was 37% (1198 patients) in the encounters and 30% (867 patients) in the injections.

Epidemic models are being increasingly used for generating forecasts of the spatial-temporal progression of epidemics at different spatial scales and for assessing the likely impact of different intervention strategies. However, the management and analysis of simulation ensembles stemming from large-scale computational models pose challenges, particularly when dealing with multiple interdependent parameters, spanning multiple layers and geospatial frames, affected by complex dynamic processes operating at different resolutions. METHODS: We describe and illustrate with examples a novel epidemic simulation data management system, epiDMS, that was developed to address the challenges that arise from the need to generate, search, visualize, and analyze, in a scalable manner, large volumes of epidemic simulation ensembles and observations during the progression of an epidemic. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: epiDMS is a publicly available system that facilitates management and analysis of large epidemic simulation ensembles. epiDMS aims to fill an important hole in decision-making during healthcare emergencies by enabling critical services with significant economic and health impact.","output":"epiDMS: Data Management and Analytics for Decision-Making From Epidemic Spread Simulation Ensembles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 is posing a serious threat to global health, the emerging mutation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, for example, N501Y substitution, is one of the major challenges against control of the pandemic. Characterizing the relationship between mutation activities and the risk of severe clinical outcomes is of public health importance for informing the healthcare decision-making process. Using a likelihood-based approach, we developed a statistical framework to reconstruct a time-varying and variant-specific case fatality ratio (CFR), and to estimate changes in CFR associated with a single mutation empirically. For illustration, the statistical framework is implemented to the COVID-19 surveillance data in the United Kingdom (UK). The reconstructed instantaneous CFR gradually increased from 1.0% in September to 2.2% in November 2020 and stabilized at this level thereafter, which monitors the mortality risk of COVID-19 on a real-time basis. We identified a link between the SARS-CoV-2 mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 mortality risk at population scale, and found that the 501Y variants may slightly but not significantly increase 18% of fatality risk than the preceding 501N variants. We found no statistically significant evidence of change in COVID-19 mortality risk associated with 501Y variants, and highlighted the real-time estimating potentials of the modelling framework.","output":"Inferring the Association between the Risk of COVID-19 Case Fatality and N501Y Substitution in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses at the Seoul Medical Center in South Korea are testing patients to see whether they have contracted Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","output":"South Korea tackles virus outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Working at home has become a frequent work arrangement following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Compressive headaches secondary to PPE use including N95 masks have been reported. We aim to describe subtypes of headache related to PPE use in our hospital in Casablanca and working condition factors associated with it. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers in frontline at Cheikh khalifa International University Hospital, using an online questionnaire. We collected demographic data, comorbidities and previous headaches history. Data about working conditions during pandemic, type and duration of PPE use were described. We calculated the prevalence of De Novo or an aggravated headache among healthcare workers. We studied correlations between PPE related headaches and working conditions and trends in PPE use during the pandemic. Finally, we described the overall discomfort related to PPE use. Results A total of 155 healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. The N95 masks were the most used type (95.5%) associated with an eye protection in 61.3%. The overall prevalence of headache related to PPE was 62%. It was experienced De Novo in 32.9%, while it was an aggravation of pre-existing headache in 29%. Working more than 8 hours per shift during the pandemic was correlated to De novo headache (p = 0.008). The profession of doctor and working more than 12 hours per shift were correlated to aggravated headache (p = 0.02, p = 0.023). Healthcare workers experienced moderate discomfort, blurred vision and reduced concentration. They judged their professional performance mildly reduced by the use of PPE. Conclusion The increased use of PPE, especially high filtrating masks during the COVID-19 outbreak is responsible for generating headaches in healthcare workers on frontline either De novo or as an aggravation of pre-existing one. Working conditions have the greater impact on generating these types of headaches more than any pre-existing comorbidity.

Novel strategies to suppress immune evasion are in urgent need. We aimed to identify potential compounds to target T cell exhaustion and increase response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between tumors with different immune evasion potential by comparing the transcriptome data. DEGs were then analyzed in the Connectivity Map (CMap) platform to identify potential compounds to increase response to ICIs. Gene set enrichment analysis, LDH release assay, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and Co-IP were performed to explore the potential mechanisms in vitro. Patients derived organoids and humanized xenograft mouse model were utilized to validate the finding ex vivo and in vivo. We identified 25 potential compounds that may play critical roles in regulating tumor immune evasion.

The Indian contribution to global suicide deaths is alarming; the social construct of India is unique, and so are the problems and challenges. This study aims to describe the social background, demographic parameters and correlate the clinical profile and outcomes of all patients presenting with an attempted or completed suicide. Materials and methods The present study is a hospital-based prospective observational study conducted by the Department of Emergency Medicine at RL Jalappa Hospital and Research Centre, a rural tertiary-care center in Karnataka, India, from June 2020 to February 2021. After stabilizing the patient, a detailed socio-demographic history was recorded. Details of the suicide attempt and findings of the clinical examination were noted. Results The final study sample consisted of 89 patients who presented to the emergency room (ER). Fifty-three patients were female, and thirty-six were males; the average age of the sample was 28.4  11 years. A higher proportion of men who completed pre-university education (p= 0.0005, c(2)= 11.98) or had a graduate degree (p= 0.009, c(2)= 6.71) attempted suicide. Amongst all women who attempted suicide, 73.6% (n=39) were married at the time of the event (p= 0.0006, c(2)= 11.79). Poisoning (n=59) was the most common method of attempting suicide. We also observed that it was primarily men who attempted suicide when under the influence of alcohol (p= 0.006, c(2)= 7.57). The most common reason for attempting suicide was familial disharmony, including domestic violence. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9/15 and less at the time of presentation resulted in a mortality rate of 28.6%, whereas patients with a GCS score of 10 and above had a mortality rate of 6.1% (p= 0.04, c(2)= 4.14). Discussion Marriage appears to be less protective for Indian women than Indian men. Poisoning was the most common method of attempted suicide in our study, followed by tablet overdose. The reason for the above could be ease of access to household poisons. Insecticides have been a preferred method in the Indian population over the years. Aluminum phosphide poisoning, a common constituent of rodenticides, is associated with a high mortality rate. However, in the West, firearm-related incidents have the highest mortality. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), India, data showed that adult males succumb majorly to romantic relations, unemployment, and failure in examinations. The use of alcohol was more in the illiterate and unskilled workers; however, high school educated persons and students used alcohol intentionally to facilitate suicide. Lower Glasgow Coma Scale values are associated with higher fatality; however, some studies found that Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score (APACHE) II scores are better mortality indicators. Conclusion Besides the presentation and GCS score, cognizance of the lethality of different methods in attempting suicide provides clues in anticipating the patient's clinical course. The social patterns of suicide must be considered while designing awareness campaigns and focused outreach programs to decrease suicides. A strict policy must be made and enforced to limit the availability of household poisons.","output":"Patients With Suicidal Patterns in the Emergency Room: A Clinical and Social Reflection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This months Under the Lens discusses a few of the growing number of recent molecular simulation studies that have made substantial contributions towards our mechanistic understanding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Simulations of the spike: molecular dynamics and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A longitudinal study, from 2018 to 2021, identified impacts on the nutritional and functional status of older adults when face-to-face activities at a social assistance center in Mexico were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the lockdown, all hospitals in Italy had to suspend non-urgent clinical activities. The prolonged suspension of elective activities could have caused a series of problems. METHODS: A new ad hoc protocol was designed. Single-day fast-imaging protocol with regadenoson-stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin imaging was preferred. Patients were contacted by phone 4 days before the test and answered to a questionnaire which will be repeated on the day of the exam. Body temperature <37.5 degrees C and no Covid-19 symptoms were necessary to enter the unit. Patients wore surgical mask and gloves. Social distancing was maintained throughout the examination. Healthcare professionals wore a personal protective equipment. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were studied from April 7 to May 15, 2020, before the publication of the recommendations from ASNC and SNMMI. None of the patients experienced complications. Follow-up of patients discharged was carried by phone. No Covid-19 infection symptoms were reported.

Moreover, Studyholism is predicted by a negative interpretation style in non-social situations, while a positive interpretation style predicts Study Engagement in social and non-social situations. Hence, Studyholism and social anxiety are two different diagnoses, even if social anxiety might fuel Studyholism.

The pandemic was a complete surprise for the world and national communities  a surprise not so much medical or epidemiological as social. Already at the beginning of the pandemic, there was an opposition of two approaches to its probable social consequences. Some experts believed that it would change the society radically and irreversibly, would transform social institutions and change everyday life, and the world will never be the same. Others argued that the new social practices would not affect the deepest foundations of the established social order which would be later restored in its pre-coronavirus form [10].

RESULTS: Surgical smoke or plume contains potentially toxic chemicals, some of which are carcinogens. Plume may also contain live virus, notably Human Papilloma and Hepatitis B, though any possible viral transmission is limited to a few case reports. Despite identifying COVID-19 ribonucleic acid fragments in various body tissues and fluids there are no current reports of COVID-19 transmission. Although plume is rapidly removed from the atmosphere in modern operating rooms, it is still inhaled by the operative team. Mitigation should include ensuring diathermy devices have evacuators while plume extraction should be standard for laparoscopic procedures. Consideration needs to be given to the potential to compromise the operating field of view, or the noise of the extractor impairing communication. There is an increasing range of suitable products on the market. The future includes pendant systems built into the operating room.

An effective time-course strategy for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial given that the global vaccine supply will still be limited in some countries/regions in the near future and that mutant strains have emerged and will continue to spread worldwide. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission have played major roles in the COVID-19 pandemic, which can only be properly described as a typical non-Markovian process. However, the prioritization of vaccines in the non-Markovian framework still lacks sufficient research, and the underlying mechanism of the time-course vaccine allocation optimization has not yet been uncovered. In this paper, based on an age-stratified compartmental model calibrated through clinical and epidemiological data, we propose optimal vaccination strategies (OVS) through steady-state prediction in the non-Markovian framework. This OVS outperforms other empirical vaccine prioritization approaches in minimizing cumulative infections, cumulative deaths, or years of life lost caused by the pandemic. We found that there exists a fast decline in the prevention efficiency of vaccination if vaccines are solely administered to a selected age group, which indicates that the widely adopted strategy to continuously vaccinate high-risk group is not optimal. Through mathematical analysis of the model, we reveal that dynamic vaccine allocations to combinations of different age groups is necessary to achieve optimal vaccine prioritization. Our work not only provides meaningful references for vaccination in countries currently lacking vaccines and for vaccine allocation strategies to prevent mutant strains in the future, but also reveals the mechanism of dynamic vaccine allocation optimization, forming a theoretical and modelling framework empirically applicable to the optimal time-course prioritization.","output":"Mechanism of optimal time-course COVID-19 vaccine prioritization based on non-Markovian steady-state prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing demand for care services has been challenging academics by broadening their research lines in the international scientific community although in different pace. In fact, the theories and debates on care, which date back to the 1980s in the United States, have developed much more recently in Europe, where publications only appeared in late 1990s. This phenomenon has also elicited a growing interest in Latin America from late 2000s, where research has been conducted in different countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. On the other hand, although comparative studies are frequent, they cover mostly European countries. Nevertheless, Latin America is a social space where professional care has expanded dramatically over the past 20 years. However, unlike Japan, in the US and European countries, such expansion took place in a context of heterogeneous and poorly structured markets, which challenge not only academics but also decision makers.

This review seeks to shed more light on the workings of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, which is an intracellular innate immunity pattern recognition receptor and sensor of changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment, and focus on its role in hematopoieisis. RECENT FINDINGS Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) are exposed to several external mediators of innate immunity. Moreover, since hemato/lymphopoietic cells develop from a common stem cell, their behavior and fate are coregulated by intracellular innate immunity pathways. Therefore, the Nlrp3 inflammasome is functional both in immune cells and in HSPCs and affects hematopoiesis in either a positive or negative way, depending on its activity level. Specifically, while a physiological level of activation regulates the trafficking of HSPCs and most likely maintains their pool in the bone marrow, hyperactivation may lead to irreversible cell damage by pyroptosis and HSPC senescence and contribute to the origination of myelodysplasia and hematopoietic malignancies. SUMMARY Modulation of the level of Nrp3 inflammasome activation will enable improvements in HSPC mobilization, homing, and engraftment strategies. It may also control pathological activation of this protein complex during HSPC senescence, graft-versus-host disease, the induction of cytokine storms, and the development of hematopoietic malignancies.","output":"The Nlrp3 inflammasome - the evolving story of its positive and negative effects on hematopoiesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Identifying factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers (HCWs) may help health systems optimize SARS-CoV-2 infection control strategies Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Northwestern HCW SARS-CoV-2 Serology Cohort Study We used the Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay to determine seropositivity Logistic regression models (adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, health care delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status Results: A total of 6510 HCWs, including 1794 nurses and 904 non-patient-facing administrators, participated The majority were women (79 6%), 74 9% were White, 9 7% were Asian, 7 3% were Hispanic, and 3 1% were non-Hispanic Black The crude prevalence of seropositivity was 4 8% (95% CI, 4 6%-5 2%) Seropositivity varied by race/ethnicity as well as age, ranging from 4 2% to 9 6% Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9 3% of HCWs, 15 0% (95% CI, 12 2%-18 1%) of whom were seropositive;those with family members diagnosed with COVID-19 had a seropositivity rate of 54% (95% CI, 44 2%-65 2%) Support service workers (10 4%;95% CI, 4 6%-19 4%), medical assistants (10 1%;95% CI, 5 5%-16 6%), and nurses (7 6%;95% CI, 6 4%-9 0%) had significantly higher seropositivity rates than administrators (referent;3 3%;95% CI, 2 3%-4 4%) However, after adjustment, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher odds (odds ratio, 1 9;95% CI, 1 3-2 9) of seropositivity Exposure to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy and hemodialysis was significantly associated with 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively Conclusions: HCWs are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection from longer-duration exposures to people infected with SARS-CoV-2 within health care settings and their communities of residence","output":"Seroprevalence and Correlates of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Health Care Workers in Chicago"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein microarray that consists of virulence-associated proteins of Yersinia pestis is used to compare antibody profiles elicited by the wild-type and quorum sensing (QS) mutant strain of this bacterium to define the immunogens that are impacted by QS.

Innovative avenues for treatment are highly warranted.

These pathways are complex in nature, intimately associated with autophagy that can maintain circadian rhythm, and have an intricate relationship that can lead to beneficial outcomes that may offer neuroprotection, metabolic homeostasis, and prevention of cognitive loss. However, biological clocks and alterations in circadian rhythm also have the potential to lead to devastating effects involving tumorigenesis in conjunction with pathways involving Wnt that oversee angiogenesis and stem cell proliferation.

The data were analyzed by codes \\"diarrhea\\", \\"dyspnea\\", \\"fever\\" and \\"general discomfort\\" that were used as predictor variables, and their relationship with hospital admissions and ICU admissions. RESULTS A total of 831,943 calls were received at the CLM emergency call center through 112, with a maximum on March 13, 2020 with 10,582 calls. On COVID line, a total of 208,803 calls were received in that period, with a maximum on March 15 with 23,744.

These changes affected skills\\\\based training, as schools of pharmacy were forced to transition traditionally in\\\\person assessments to a remote setting. The purpose of this article is to describe the experience of pharmacy skills lab coordinators when transitioning summative skills\\\\based assessments (SSBA). METHODS: A web\\\\based survey instrument administered through Qualtrics(XM) was sent to all institutions in the Big Ten Academic Alliance\\\\Performance Based Assessment Collaborative. Only one member from each institution completed the survey on behalf of the institution. The survey consisted of four sections: changes made to skills evaluated; changes made to the delivery of those evaluations; challenges to and strategies used by the skills lab program when switching to remote learning; and recommendations for incorporating remote learning within future SSBAs. Survey respondents were invited to participate in an optional unstructured interview regarding survey answers. RESULTS: Nine of ten invited institutions responded to the survey. Of the nine respondents, three participated in the post\\\\survey interview. Overall, 79.5% (93/117) of skills planned to be assessed were assessed with or without modification, with 8.5% (93/117) of skills canceled and 10.3% (12/117) of skills assessments postponed. The most common challenges mentioned were the lack of preparation time, inability to assess certain skills virtually, and student barriers. The most common recommendations made were to prioritize lab components and incorporate flexibility in planning and scheduling. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that most skills were still assessed during the Spring 2020 semester.

However, there are few such investigations and analysis in rural areas of China. This study aims to determine the association between the risk of contracting diarrhea and knowledge and practices of personal hygiene and school sanitation among rural students as well as provide a scientific basis for preventing the spread of diarrhea and other infectious diseases. A stratified cluster sampling method was used to randomly select 12 rural primary schools in each of 5 counties where the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Plus Program has been implemented. The counties are located in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, Chongqing municipality, Guizhou province, Yunnan province, and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. A single fourth-grade class was randomly chosen from each of the 60 schools for observation and a questionnaire survey. The study involved a total of 2330 students. The logistic regression method was adopted to determine the factors contributing to diarrhea in rural students. The results show that male students accounted for 49.40% (n = 1151) of the 2330 research subjects; the average age of the students was 9.9  0.3 years. Approximately 33.09% of the students suffered from diarrhea in the three months leading up to the survey. The odds ratios (ORs) of students who did not know that diarrhea can be prevented by washing fruits before eating them raw and not drinking untreated water (OR: 1.303, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.063, 1.597) and that the disease can be prevented by washing hands before meals and after going to the toilet (OR: 1.522, 95% CI: 1.207, 1.920) were higher than those who knew the above stated facts. Students who have drunk untreated water at school (OR: 1.584, 95% CI: 1.268, 1.978), have drunk untreated water at home (OR: 1.643, 95% CI: 1.319, 2.048), and did not wash hands before every meal (OR: 1.490, 95% CI: 1.120, 1.983) were at a higher risk of contracting diarrhea than those who drank treated water at school and at home and washed their hands before every meal. Diarrhea was more likely to affect students who attended schools with unclean and poorly maintained toilets (OR: 1.586, 95% CI: 1.261, 1.995) or toilets with flies (OR: 1.383, 95% CI: 1.114, 1.717) and without adequate drinking water facilities (OR: 1.407, 95% CI: 1.009, 1.962). The knowledge of methods to maintain personal hygiene, general hygiene practices, and school sanitation are the three major risk factors that account for the spread of diarrhea among rural students from five western provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) of China. Therefore, to prevent such diseases and maintain health, it is important to provide students with health education, help them develop good hygiene habits, ensure the provision of clean water at schools, and improve the overall school environments.","output":"Knowledge, Practice of Personal Hygiene, School Sanitation, and Risk Factors of Contracting Diarrhea among Rural Students from Five Western Provinces in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, have improved the outcome of many malignancies, but serious immune-related cardiovascular adverse events have been observed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed general practitioners working lives; adding potential pressures from avoiding infection and addressing pent-up demand for care, but also changing processes such as rapidly taking up remote consultations. To date, there has been a focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of hospital clinicians. No registered systematic reviews currently focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners. Aims and objectives To synthesise the current international evidence base exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners, and which factors are associated with their reported mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Methods In this paper we report a systematic review protocol, following PRISMA guidance. In our search strategy we will identify primary research studies or systematic reviews exploring the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo and Medrxiv) and Google Scholar. We will hand-search reference lists and grey literature. Two reviewers will undertake all stages including study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, with arbitration by a third reviewer where necessary. We will use standardised quality assessment tools to ensure transparency and reduce bias in quality assessment. Depending on the quality of included studies, we may undertake a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies from narrative synthesis that are rated as low quality using the checklists.

Although nasopharyngeal swabs are the most commonly utilized samples for based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection, collecting these specimens requires healthcare workers and necessitates the use of personal protective equipment as it presents a nosocomial transmission risk. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed Covid-19. METHODS: We performed a cohort study to validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Saliva samples of the patients were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In May 2020, 28 asymptomatic and 25 mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 37 years (range 4-70). None of the patients had a fever on presentation. Among 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the nasopharyngeal sample, the real-time RT-PCR was positive in the saliva specimens in 48 (90.56%) patients. The mean cycle threshold (CT) values for nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens (27.80  3.44 and 30.64  2.83, respectively) were significantly correlated between the two sample types (p = .016). The mean CT values of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27.18  3.53 and 30.24  3.29 vs. 28.36  3.31 and 30.98  2.39, respectively) were not significantly different (p = .236 and p = .733, respectively).

Therefore, identification of factors in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that are associated with cancer progression may represent novel therapeutic targets. Recent studies have highlighted a previously unappreciated role for the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on T cells and their effects on cell survival and proliferation. TLRs can bind exogenous molecules derived from pathogens as well as endogenous self-ligands released from damaged cells. Recent reports demonstrate that TLR engagement on primary mouse or human T cells enhances proliferation and/or cell survival. The mechanisms by which TLR stimulation on T cells influences these parameters and the different T-cell subsets that are affected by TLR stimulation are currently under investigation. Furthermore, neither the biological importance of stimulating TLRs on neoplastic T cells nor the prevalence of TLR expression in T-cell malignancies have yet to be characterized. Based on published reports and compelling preliminary data, we propose that the activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway in neoplastic T cells contributes to disease progression by reducing cell death and enhancing cell division.

For this purpose, guanidinium bearing poly (HPMA-s-GPMA) copolymer and MPA-CdTe@CdS quantum dots (QDs) was employed in conjunction with As3+ specific aptamer. This protocol utilizes the quenching phenomena displayed by QDs due to the competitive binding of As3+ ions and cationic copolymer to the aptamer. In particular, the As3+ bind to the specific aptamer, leaving poly (HPMA-s-GPMA) freely available for its electrostatic intercations with QDs, which quenches the fluorescent signal. Contrarily, in the absence of As3+ ions, the aptamer can electrostatically bind to poly (HPMA-s-GPMA); making copolymer inactive to affect the fluorescence signal of the QDs. The efficiency of the proposed fluorescence nanoprobe was further tested using linear calibration curves. The obtained data in the range of 0.01-100 nM showed excellent specificity for As3+ ions with the limit of detection (LOD) of 246.77 pM.

METHODS: Using Poisson regression and regularized linear regression (elastic net), we evaluated the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 mortality rates in Chicago through July 22 (2514 deaths across 795 populated census tracts). RESULTS: Black residents (31% of the population) accounted for 42% of COVID-19 deaths. Deaths among Hispanic/Latino residents occurred at a younger age (63 years, compared to 71 for white residents). Regarding residential setting, 52% of deaths among white residents occurred inside nursing homes, compared to 35% of deaths among Black residents and 17% among Hispanic/Latino residents. Higher COVID-19 mortality was seen in neighborhoods with heightened barriers to social distancing and low health insurance coverage. Neighborhoods with a higher percentage of white and Asian residents had lower COVID-19 mortality. The associations differed by race, suggesting that neighborhood context may be most tightly linked to COVID-19 mortality among white residents.

Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organizations Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. RESULTS: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination.

In addition, although often the target audience for requirement acquisition at the initial mHealth app design stage, it is a common challenge for them to fully conceptualize their needs for mHealth services that help self-manage chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a novel co-design approach with the initial requirements for mHealth services proposed by clinicians based on their experiences in guiding patients to self-manage chronic conditions. A design case is presented to illustrate our innovative approach to designing an mHealth app that supports the self-management of patients with obesity in their preparation for elective surgery. METHODS: We adopted a clinician-led co-design approach. The co-design approach consisted of the following four cyclic phases: understanding user needs, identifying an applicable underlying theory, integrating the theory into the prototype design, and evaluating and refining the prototype mHealth services with patients. Expert panel discussions, a literature review, intervention mapping, and patient focus group discussions were conducted in these four phases. RESULTS: In stage 1, the expert panel proposed the following three common user needs: motivational, educational, and supportive needs. In stage 2, the team selected the Social Cognitive Theory to guide the app design. In stage 3, the team designed and developed the key functions of the mHealth app, including automatic push notifications; web-based resources; goal setting and monitoring; and interactive health-related exchanges that encourage physical activity, healthy eating, psychological preparation, and a positive outlook for elective surgery. Push notifications were designed in response to a patients risk level, as informed by the persons response to a baseline health survey. In stage 4, the prototype mHealth app was used to capture further requirements from patients in the two focus group discussions. Focus group participants affirmed the potential benefits of the app and suggested more requirements for the function, presentation, and personalization needs. The app was improved based on these suggestions. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports an innovative co-design approach that was used to leverage the clinical experiences of clinicians to produce the initial prototype app and the approach taken to allow patients to effectively voice their needs and expectations for the mHealth app in a focus group discussion. This approach can be generalized to the design of any mHealth service that aims to support the patient self-management of chronic conditions.","output":"A Clinician-Led, Experience-Based Co-Design Approach for Developing mHealth Services to Support the Patient Self-management of Chronic Conditions: Development Study and Design Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Dermoscopy is an integrative part of clinical dermatologic examination.

COVID-19 presented a number of challenges for expatriate faculty at the university in terms of teaching, research, and service. Many of these challenges were similar to challenges of the domestic and international faculty employed at established universities in Western contexts. Expatriate faculty also faced some unique challenges in their work determined by the characteristics of their students, the nature of the university, and their location outside their home country. These unique challenges created additional psychological stress and load, which should be taken into consideration and properly addressed by the administration of international universities to maintain the facultys organizational commitment and the ability to deliver high-quality teaching, research, and service. ? 2022 selection and editorial matter, Chris R.

This article explores how mainstream print media covered the COVID-19 pandemic during this time of crisis. The news media play a key role in keeping the public informed during such health crises and potentially shape citizens' perceptions of the pandemic. Drawing on a content analysis of 681 front-page news stories across eleven English-language publications, we found that nearly half of the stories used an alarmist narrative, more than half of the stories had a negative tone, and most publications reported in an episodic rather than thematic manner. Most of the stories focused on impacts of the pandemic and included high levels of sensationalism. In addition, despite the alarmist and negative nature of the reporting, most of the front-page reports did not provide information about ways to limit the spread of the virus or attempt to counter misinformation about the pandemic, raising key issues about the roles and responsibilities of the South African media during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that South African newspaper coverage of COVID-19 was largely negative, possibly to attract audience attention and increase market share, but that this alarmist coverage left little possibility for citizens' individual agency and self-efficacy in navigating the pandemic.","output":"South African newspaper coverage of COVID-19: A content analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A. SUMMARY OF CONFERENCE1. Introduction1.1. BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has caused shocks not only in the health aspect but also in all aspects of the global community?s life. It has significant effect in all sectors of the economy, including the agricultural sector. However, the agricultural sector, including the plantation sub-sector, is a sector that has been able to survive and even shows positive growth. On the other hand, the agricultural commodities from the plantation sector have been significant in job opportunities and export earnings. Major plantation crops such as oil palm, coconut, sago palm, rubber, coffee, cacao, tea, pepper, clove, medicinal plants, and sugarcane may continue their significant contribution to the economy of many tropical countries. These countries will still dominate as the world?s leading producers of those plantations, at least soon. Plantation and agricultural sectors are labor-intensive. As these sectors are steadily expanding, a reliable workforce requirement has become one of the major issues resulting in huge dependency on capacity development to fulfill the rising need.The 2nd International Conference on Sustainable Plantation (ICSP) was virtually-held in collaboration between the Faculty of Agriculture, IPB University with Indonesian Center for Estate Crops Research and Development (ICECRD), The Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (IAARD), with involving the Indonesian Palmae Crops Research Institute (IPCRI), Indonesian Industrial and Beverage Crops Research Institute (IIBCRI), Indonesian Spice and Medicinal Crops Research Institute (ISMCRI), and Indonesian Sweetener and Fiber Crops ResearchList of Table, Images, Paper Publication, Funding Acknowledgements, Special Acknowledgements, List Of Committee, Organizing Committee are available in this pdf.","output":"The 2nd International Conference on Sustainable Plantation (ICSP): Improving Added Value of Plantation Crops through Sustainable Plantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids would be an appropriate adjunct therapy for alleviating the inflammatory response and clinical manifestation in hospitalized patients with covid-19 disease. Methods: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial in Amir-Alam hospital in Tehran. Thirty adult men and women diagnosed with covid-19 were allocated to either control group (receiving Hydroxychloroquine) or intervention group (receiving Hydroxychloroquine plus 2 grams of DHA+EPA) for 2 weeks. Primary outcome of the intervention including CRP, ESR as well as clinical symptoms including body pain, fatigue, appetite and olfactory and secondary outcomes including liver enzymes were determined at the baseline and after omega-3 supplementation. Clinical signs were measured using self-reported questionnaires. There were commercial kits for determination of CRP and liver enzymes concentrations in the serum of patients. For determination of ESR automated hematology analyzer was applied. Results: In comparison to control group, patients receiving omega-3 indicated favorable changes in all clinical symptoms except for olfactory ((p<0.001 for body pain and fatigue, p= 0.03 for appetite and p=0.21 for olfactory). Reducing effects of omega-3 supplementation compared to control group were also observed in the levels of ESR and CRP after treatment (p<0.001 for CRP and p=0.02 for ESR). However, no between group differences in the liver enzymes serum concentrations were observed after supplementation (p>0.05).

A survey from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) showed that at least 500 doctors have been infected across Maharashtra, with Mumbai doctors making it to the top of the list. The most infected are the resident doctors working in government hospitals. A few doctors also have lost their lives while working in this pandemic. The delicate balance between duty, altruism and fear for oneself and others often causes conflict and feelings of helplessness and dissonance in many health care personnel with a fear to resume back the duty, especially after being a COVID victim. There have been hardly any studies yet, related to understanding the emotional and general well being of COVID-19 positive health care workers who have recovered and resumed their duties. Aims and Objectives: To study in post COVID-19 recovered resident doctors and interns the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, sleep changes, general well-being, perceptions of their COVID experience and association of general wellbeing with anxiety, depression and sleep changes. Methods: The study was conducted after institutional ethics committee permission and online informed consent from the participants which included medical interns and resident doctors of our institute. A Google form with questions and scales pertaining to the aims of the study (Patient Health Questionnaire, Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale, Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale and Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire) was sent on the Google link to the 150 interns and resident doctors via whatsapp who had recovered from COVID 19 infection. Their details were taken from hospital database with Dean permission. Results: 79 responded to the link with the mean duration of COVID infection being 16.1  8.59 days. 64 participants were hospitalized and 18 participants had lung parenchymal involvement. 28 participants had depressive symptoms on the patient health questionnaire. Only 4 participants experienced anxiety as per Zung self rating anxiety scale. 69 participants had greater well being with scores higher than 40 on the Warwick Edinburgh mental well being scale. 8 participants had sleep related issues affecting their work. A negative correlation of general well being was seen with depression, anxiety and insomnia which was highly significant. The most distressing of COVID experiences were being isolated in a room, transmitting disease to near and dear ones and possibility of a serious complication. Re infection, workload followed by use of PPE was the major concern.Many described their COVID experience as boring, depressing with feelings of loneliness.

Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis because it is associated with health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA). Method: The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 6,829 respondents. Data was analysed using chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Over one-quarter of South Africans could not access contraception and more than every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospital as source of contraception. Female South Africans (OR=0.89 CI:0.7487-1.0719) and those aged 65 years above (OR=0.67 CI:0.4485-0.9988) were 33% and 11% respectively less likely to have access to contraception. The preferred sources of contraception were associated with the selected demographic and economic variables at P<0.05. Conclusions: Findings from the study suggests strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic.

The present study aims to determine how the presence in urban parks was reflected on social media during the pandemic period of 2020. We examined Instagram posts associated with a sample of eight urban parks in Bucharest, Romania and also the entire history of Google reviews between January and August 2020. The selection of parks was made according to their size, location in Bucharest, previous reported number of visitors and profile of attractiveness. Results revealed that the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic and the first initiation of the lockdowns strongly affected the recreation and leisure activities that people performed almost daily in the parks of Bucharest. Reviews and comments of the population were not that focused on the pandemic even after the restrictions were lifted, but they evidenced the positive and negative aspects of each park.

In severe cases, it affects intraoperative renal arterial anastomosis and increases the risk of postanastomosis complications. At present, safe and efficient vascular replacement methods are relatively limited. In the 2 renal transplant cases at our center, described here, the donors' iliac arteries were unavailable. We therefore attempted to replace the recipients' diseased external iliac artery with the donors' inferior vena cava and then performed an end-to-side grafting with the attachment in arterial reconstruction. One patient received a single kidney transplantation, while the other received a dual kidney transplantation. Antiplatelet/anticoagulation drug application was avoided, and both patients were observed for more than 6 months. Stable renal graft function was achieved without any vascular complications. During this study, all procedures were in compliance with the Helsinki Congress and the Declaration of Istanbul. For end-stage renal disease patients with severe iliac atherosclerosis who are waiting for kidney transplantation, a donor's vena cava graft could potentially be a promising replacement option to restore external iliac artery patency and reconstruct renal blood flow, without the necessity of harvesting a recipient's autologous vessels or looking for costly artificial ones.","output":"Reconstruction of a Transplant Recipient's External Iliac Artery Using Donor's Inferior Vena Cava in Renal Transplantation: 2 Case Reports."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report a clinical case of a patient with a compatible HRCT scan and two negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA upper respiratory tract specimens but with a confirmed viral infection by BAL (19 days after symptom onset).

This highly infectious disease is associated with respiratory failure unusual in other coronavirus infections. Mounting evidence link the accelerated progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients to the hyper-inflammatory state termed as the cytokine storm involving major systemic perturbations. These include iron dysregulation manifested as hyperferritinemia associated with disease severity. Iron dysregulation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes oxidative stress. The mitochondria are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis. In addition, the mitochondria may circulate cell-free in non-nucleated platelets, in extracellular vesicles and mitochondrial DNA is found in the extracellular space. The heightened inflammatory/oxidative state may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to platelet damage and apoptosis. The interaction of dysfunctional platelets with coagulation cascades aggravates clotting events and thrombus formation. Furthermore, mitochondrial oxidative stress may contribute to microbiota dysbiosis, altering coagulation pathways and fueling the inflammatory/oxidative response leading to the vicious cycle of events. Here, we discuss various cellular and systemic incidents caused by SARS-CoV-2 that may critically impact intra and extracellular mitochondrial function, and contribute to the progression and severity of the disease.

An increased sense of community is often seen in times of crisis or disaster, but it is unclear whether this is the case in the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of the current study were to assess whether generalized trust increased in an early pandemic phase compared to pre-pandemic levels, and whether trust was lower in individuals who felt particularly threatened or burdened in the pandemic. We compared levels of generalized trust in a population-representative Norwegian sample (n = 1,041) with pre-pandemic levels from the European Social Survey (ESS). Age- and gender-adjusted expected scores were compared to observed scores, using weighted data. Secondly, we tested whether indicators of pandemic-related strain, perceived health risks, or pandemic-related worry were associated with a lower level of generalized trust. This cross-sectional study was conducted in an early opening-up phase (May, 2020). The observed levels of generalized trust in an early pandemic phase did not differ significantly from expected levels based on pre-pandemic measures. Higher trust was found among individuals who reported personal experience with the COVID-19 disease (tested positive, admitted to hospital, or lost someone to the disease). Pandemic-related worry and a high perceived health threat were both associated with a lower level of generalized trust. These results indicate that personal experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic could influence trust in others, although this link may be context-dependent. Generalized trust is considered to be an important asset in society, and promote health and well-being.

In this study, we investigated the role of the internal 0.13-kb region in MHV RNA replication. Overall sequences of the 0.13-kb regions from various MHV strains were similar to each other, with nucleotide substitutions in some strains; MHV-A59 was exceptional, with three nucleotide deletions. Computer-based secondary-structure analysis of the 0.13-kb region in the positive strand revealed that most of the MHV strains formed the same or a similar main stem-loop structure, whereas only MHV-A59 formed a smaller main stem-loop structure. The RNA secondary structures in the negative strands were much less uniform among the MHV strains. A series of DI RNAs that contained MHV-JHM-derived 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences plus internal 0.13-kb regions derived from various MHV strains were constructed. Most of these DI RNAs replicated in MHV-infected cells, except that MRP-A59, with a 0.13-kb region derived from MHV-A59, failed to replicate. Interestingly, replication of MRP-A59 was temperature dependent; it occurred at 39.5 degrees C but not at 37 or 35 degrees C, whereas a DI RNA with an MHV-JHM-derived 0.13-kb region replicated at all three temperatures. At 37 degrees C, synthesis of MRP-A59 negative-strand RNA was detected in MHV-infected and MRP-A59 RNA-transfected cells. Another DI RNA with the internal 0.13-kb region deleted also synthesized negative-strand RNA in MHV-infected cells. MRP-A59-transfected cells were shifted from 39.5 to 37 degrees C at 5.5 h postinfection, a time when most MHV negative-strand RNAs have already accumulated; after the shift, MRP-A59 positive-strand RNA synthesis ceased. The minimum sequence required for maintenance of the positive-strand major stem-loop structure and biological function of the MHV-JHM 0.13-kb region was about 57 nucleotides. Function was lost in the 50-nucleotide sequence that formed a positive-strand stem-loop structure identical to that of MHV-A59.

We performed a systematic review to examine the reasons why older persons visit the ED in Singapore. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase and Scopus from January 2000 to December 2021 for studies reporting on ED utilisation by older adults in Singapore, and included studies that investigated determinants of ED utilisation. Statistically significant determinants and their effect sizes were extracted. Determinants of ED utilisation were organised using Andersen and Newman's model. Quality of studies was evaluated using Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. RESULTS The search yielded 138 articles, of which 7 were used for analysis. Among the significant individual determinants were predisposing (staying in public rental housing, religiosity, loneliness, poorer coping), enabling (caregiver distress from behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia) and health factors (multimorbidity in patients with dementia, frailty, primary care visit in last 6 months, better treatment adherence). The 7 included studies are of moderate quality and none of them employed conceptual frameworks to organise determinants of ED utilisation. CONCLUSION The major determinants of ED utilisation by older adults in Singapore were largely individual factors. Evaluation of societal determinants of ED utilisation was lacking in the included studies.

This limits the high acquisition rates needed to resolve dynamic flow changes and to optimally filter out large pulsatile oscillations and prevents the use of large source-detector separations ([Formula: see text]), which are needed to achieve adequate brain sensitivity in most adult subjects. Aim: To substantially improve SNR, we have built a DCS device that operates at 1064 nm and uses superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD). Approach: We compared the performances of the SNSPD-DCS in humans with respect to a typical DCS system operating at 850 nm and using silicon single-photon avalanche diode detectors. Results: At a 25-mm separation, we detected [Formula: see text] times more photons and achieved an SNR gain of [Formula: see text] on the forehead of 11 subjects using the SNSPD-DCS as compared to typical DCS. At this separation, the SNSPD-DCS is able to detect a clean pulsatile flow signal at 20 Hz in all subjects.

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate service users perceptions of MySurgery, including its perceived acceptability, the potential barriers and facilitators to accessing and using its content, and ideas about how to facilitate its effective implementation. The secondary aim is to analyze how the intended use of the app might differ for diverse patients, including seldom-heard groups. Methods: We implemented a diversity approach to recruit participants from a range of backgrounds with previous experience of surgery. We aimed to achieve representation from seldom-heard groups, including those from a Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) background;those with a disability;and those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBT+) community. A total of 3 focus groups were conducted across a 2-month period, during which a semistructured protocol was followed to elicit a rich discussion around the app. The focus groups were audio recorded, and thematic analysis was carried out. Results: In total, 22 individuals participated in the focus groups. A total of 50% (n=11) of the participants were from a BAME background, 59% (n=13) had a disability, and 36% (n=8) were from the LGBT+ community. There was a strong degree of support for the MySurgery app. The majority of participants agreed that it was acceptable and appropriate in terms of content and usability, and that it would help to educate patients about how to become involved in improving safety. The checklist-like format was popular. There was rich discussion around the accessibility and inclusivity of MySurgery. Specific user groups were identified who might face barriers in accessing the app or acting on its advice, such as those with visual impairments or learning difficulties and those who preferred to take a more passive role (eg, some individuals because of their cultural background or personality type). The app could be improved by signposting further specialty-specific information and incorporating a calendar and notes section. With regard to implementation, it was agreed that use of the app should be signposted before the preoperative appointment and that training and education should be provided for clinicians to increase awareness and buy-in. Communication about the app should clarify its scientific basis in plain English and should stress that its use is optional. Conclusions: MySurgery was endorsed as a powerful tool for enhancing patient empowerment and facilitating the direct involvement of patients and their caregivers in maintaining patient safety. The diversity approach allowed for a better understanding of the needs of different population groups and highlighted opportunities for increasing accessibility and involvement in the app.","output":"A Smartphone App Designed to Empower Patients to Contribute Toward Safer Surgical Care: Qualitative Evaluation of Diverse Public and Patient Perceptions Using Focus Groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the entire world prepares and begins to roll out COVID\\\\19 vaccines, the Philippines is still reeling from the consequences of the Dengvaxia controversy in 2016.

In particular, we focus on the peak number of critically infected nodes (PCIN), determining the maximum workload of intensive healthcare units that should be kept low when managing an epidemic. As a realistic model and simulation method, we developed a continuous-time Markov chain model, and an open-source available efficient simulation software based on Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). Virus propagation is compared on random graph models featuring a selected range of complex network topologies: Erd?s-Rnyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barabsi-Albert and complete graph (Clique). Continuous-time Markov chains are used to simulate the infection process. The simulation was performed in networks with 200 nodes and different numbers of edges. In addition, we study age- and gender-determined and weighted characteristics of nodes on the PCIN as well as the correlation of macroscopic graph characteristics such as the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length. The analysis used the data of the demographic distribution of Ukraine as of 2020 and data on mortality from COVID-19 in Ukraine, as of December 16, 2020. It is proved that the deterministic characteristics slightly lower values of critically infected, in small networks for the used dataset. The simulations show that the increase of the average shortest path length is significant on the reduction of the PCIN, whereas other characteristics such as clustering and age distribution, are of lesser importance. ? 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive gold standard to detect fatty liver, we demonstrate a low-cost and portable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) approach with circumferential abdominal electrodes for liver conductivity measurements. Methods and Results: A finite element model (FEM) was established to simulate decremental liver conductivity in response to incremental liver lipid content. To validate the FEM simulation, we performed EIT imaging on an ex vivo porcine liver in a non-conductive tank with 32 circumferentially-embedded electrodes, demonstrating a high-resolution output given a priori information on location and geometry. To further examine EIT capacity in fatty liver detection, we performed EIT measurements in age- and gender-matched New Zealand White rabbits (3 on normal, 3 on high-fat diets). Liver conductivity values were significantly distinct following the high-fat diet (p = 0.003 vs. normal diet, n=3), accompanied by histopathological evidence of hepatic fat accumulation. We further assessed EIT imaging in human subjects with MRI quantification for fat volume fraction based on Dixon procedures, demonstrating average liver conductivity of 0.331 S/m for subjects with low Body-Mass Index (BMI < 25 kg/m2) and 0.286 S/m for high BMI (> 25 kg/m2).

Standardization based on the world age pyramid revealed considerable differences in age distribution among countries; the proportion of people aged <60 years was higher in Latin America and the United States than in Canada or Western Europe. The standardized proportion of people aged <60 years among persons who died of COVID-19 is strongly correlated to the existence of universal quality medical coverage (r=-0.92, p<0.01).

We were able to generate counts, descriptive statistics, and build a multivariate, iterative regression model without centralizing individual-level data. RESULTS: Our public website contains answers to various clinical questions, a web form for users to ask questions in natural language, and a list of items that are currently pending responses. The results show, for example, that patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, within the year before admission, had lower unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates. We also showed that, when adjusted for, age, sex, and ethnicity were not significantly associated with mortality. We demonstrated that it is possible to answer questions about COVID-19 using EHR data from systems that have different policies and must follow various regulations, without moving data out of their health systems. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We present an alternative or a complement to centralized COVID-19 registries of EHR data. We can use multivariate distributed logistic regression on observations recorded in the process of care to generate results without transferring individual-level data outside the health systems.","output":"Privacy-protecting, reliable response data discovery using COVID-19 patient observations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires high influenza vaccination rates for the chronically ill in order to avoid additional strain on the health care system. Despite clear evidence of the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccination, vaccination coverage has internationally remained at inadequate levels in recent years. The general practitioner is of central importance for the care of this population. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate various measures in general practice to increase seasonal influenza vaccination rates for the chronically ill, taking into account various international health systems. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and ERIC as well as manually in trial registers and literature lists. Only randomized controlled studies were taken into account. The methodology was defined in advance in a study protocol and published (PROSPERO CRD42018114163). RESULTS: A total of 14 studies within the framework of a national health service (United Kingdom), a state (Australia) and social (Switzerland) health insurance system and a private health care system (USA) were included in our review. Analog patient reminders and automated physician reminders as well as changes in professional roles have led to a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates, but only in the private health care system. In the national health service, none of the interventions we analyzed achieved a significant increase in vaccination rates, although the National Health Service in the United Kingdom documented relatively good basic influenza vaccination rates before the studies were carried out, regardless of the intervention. Good results were achieved in the social and state health insurance systems of Switzerland and Australia by training events for practice teams and SMS reminders. CONCLUSIONS: In Germany, training events for medical teams and centrally organized invitation and monitoring systems might improve vaccination rates among the chronically ill. That the federal government pays for the vaccination costs seems to ensure a good basic influenza vaccination coverage for indicated patients in various health systems.","output":"[Vaccination against influenza: International inventory and perspectives for Germany]./ Impfen gegen Influenza - Internationale Bestandsaufnahme und Perspektiven fr Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic expanded its geographic distribution through the movement of humans and caused subsequent local outbreaks. Hence, it is essential to investigate how human mobility and travel ban affect the transmission and spatial spread while minimizing the impact on social activities and national economics. METHODS: We developed a mobility network model for spatial epidemics, explicitly taking into account time-varying inter-province and inner-province population flows, spatial heterogeneity in terms of disease transmission, as well as the impact of media reports. The model is applied to study the epidemic of the dynamic network of 30 provinces of mainland China. The model was calibrated using the publicly available incidence and movement data. RESULTS: We estimated that the second outbreak occurred approximately on February 24, 2020, and the cumulative number of cases as of March 15, 2020, increased by 290.1% (95% CI: (255.3%, 324.9%)) without a travel ban in mainland China (excluding Hubei and Tibet). We found that intra-province travel contributes more to the increase of cumulative number of cases than inter-province travel. CONCLUSION: Our quantitative and qualitative research results suggest that the strict travel ban has successfully prevented a severe secondary outbreak in mainland China, which provides solutions for many countries and regions experiencing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"Evaluating the impact of the travel ban within mainland China on the epidemic of the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foreign language instruction has moved from face-to-face to online learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the extent to which Foreign Language Classroom Enjoyment (FLCE), Foreign Language Speaking Anxiety (FLSA) and demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, and course grades) are linked to English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' Willingness to Communicate (WTC) in English under two conditions: online learning and conventional (face-to-face) learning. The study sample consisted of 106 Saudi undergraduate EFL learners. The research instrument was an online questionnaire. The data were analysed quantitatively through t-tests, Pearson correlational tests, and a hierarchical regression analysis. The research findings indicated that: (1) higher levels of WTC were found in the online learning context than in the face-to-face context;(2) FLCE was a positive predictor, while FLSA was a negative predictor, of WTC in the online and face-to-face learning contexts;(3) a high course grade seemed to be a positive predictor of EFL learners' WTC only in the online learning context. These findings imply that utilizing online-based learning, particularly in the context of developing speaking skills, may foster EFL learners' communication in the foreign language. Therefore, it is recommended that language teachers should support their students in practicing L2 communication during online classes in a more supportive atmosphere. ?

HA cleavage activation is required for virus-endosome membrane fusion and the subsequent release of the influenza virus genome into the cytoplasm. Previous studies have determined that HA cleavage is most likely driven by either membrane-bound or extracellular trypsin-like proteases that reside in the respiratory tract. However, there is still uncertainty regarding which proteases are critical for HA cleavage in vivo. Therefore, further investigation of HA cleavage activation is needed in order to gain insight into the critical proteases involved. Matriptase is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family that is highly expressed in a membrane-bound form throughout the respiratory tract. One feature of matriptase is that, once activated, the catalytic domain is secreted into the extracellular space and so serves as a functional extracellular protease. In this study, we have determined that the secreted, catalytic domain of matriptase has the ability to cleave and activate HA from the influenza virus H1 subtype but not the H2 and H3 subtypes. Furthermore, matriptase selectively cleaved the HA of particular strains within the H1 subtype, revealing both subtype and H1 strain specificity. Matriptase was also found to activate thrombolytic zymogens that have been shown to cleave and activate the influenza virus HA. Our data demonstrate that matriptase has the ability to cleave HA directly or indirectly by activating HA-cleaving zymogens.","output":"Cleavage activation of the human-adapted influenza virus subtypes by matriptase reveals both subtype and strain specificities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the increasing prevalence and burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease and false-negative results in routine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, additional diagnostic methods are needed to diagnose active cases of this disease.

Scanning electron microscopy imaging confirmed the successful deposition of GO at the electrode surface. Catalytic properties of graphene oxide were exposed while being compared with those of bare GCE. The resultant modification of GCE with GO enhanced the electroactive surface area by 50% in comparison to the bare one. At both electrodes, i.e., GO/GCE and Hg(Ag)FE, the TFV response was used to examine and optimize the influence of square-wave excitation parameters, i.e., square wave frequency, step potential and amplitude, and supporting electrolyte composition and its pH. Broad selectivity studies were performed with miscellaneous interfering agents influence, including ascorbic acid, selected saccharides and aminoacids, metal ions, non-opioid analgesic metamizole, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug omeprazole, and several drugs used along with TFV treatment. The linear concentration range for TFV determination at GO/GCE and Hg(Ag)FE was found to be 0.3-30.0 mol L-1 and 0.5-7.0 mol L-1, respectively.

Clinicians are investigating the use of VNS for heart failure management, and this work aims to correlate cardiac measures with vagal fiber activity. Results By recording vagal activity during VNS in rats and using regression analysis, we found that cardiac activity across all animals was best correlated to the activation of a specific vagal fiber group. With conduction velocities ranging from 5 to 10 m/s, these fibers are classified as B fibers (using the Erlanger-Gasser system) and correspond to vagal parasympathetic efferents. Conclusions B fiber activation can serve as a standardized, objective measure of stimulus dose across all subjects.

The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. RESULTS: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.","output":"Microbiological study of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) and the usefulness of analytical and clinical parameters in its identification (VIRAE study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The extent to which these interventions are successful in stopping the spread have not been characterized in countries with distinct socioeconomic groups. We compared the effects of a partial lockdown on disease transmission among Kuwaitis (P(1)) and non-Kuwaitis (P(2)) living in Kuwait. METHODS: We fit a modified metapopulation SEIR transmission model to reported cases stratified by two groups to estimate the impact of a partial lockdown on the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text] ). We estimated the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text] ) for the transmission in each group and simulated the potential trajectories of an outbreak from the first recorded case of community transmission until 12 days after the partial lockdown. We estimated [Formula: see text] values of both groups before and after the partial curfew, simulated the effect of these values on the epidemic curves and explored a range of cross-transmission scenarios. RESULTS: We estimate [Formula: see text] at 108 (95% CI: 100C126) for P(1) and 236 (203C271) for P(2). On March 22nd, [Formula: see text] for P(1) and P(2) are estimated at 119 (104C134) and 175 (126C211) respectively. After the partial curfew had taken effect, [Formula: see text] for P(1) dropped modestly to 105 (082C126) but almost doubled for P(2) to 289 (230C370). Our simulated epidemic trajectories show that the partial curfew measure greatly reduced and delayed the height of the peak in P(1), yet significantly elevated and hastened the peak in P(2). Modest cross-transmission between P(1) and P(2) greatly elevated the height of the peak in P(1) and brought it forward in time closer to the peak of P(2). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate and quantify how the same lockdown intervention can accentuate disease transmission in some subpopulations while potentially controlling it in others. Any such control may further become compromised in the presence of cross-transmission between subpopulations.

Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. METHODS: We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms \\"suicide\\" and \\"cause of death\\", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). FINDINGS: We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 081 [95% CI 072-091]); Alberta, Canada (080 [068-093]); British Columbia, Canada (076 [066-087]); Chile (085 [078-094]); Leipzig, Germany (049 [032-074]); Japan (094 [091-096]); New Zealand (079 [068-091]); South Korea (094 [092-097]); California, USA (090 [085-095]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (079 [067-093]); Texas (four counties), USA (082 [068-098]); and Ecuador (074 [067-082]). INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold. FUNDING: None.","output":"Suicide trends in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: an interrupted time-series analysis of preliminary data from 21 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A previous study had reported that patients with osteomyelitis (OM) appeared to be more likely to develop hypocalcemia before and after surgery. Calcium sulfate (CS) is frequently used as a local antibiotic vehicle in the treatment of OM, which may also affect serum calcium level. However, whether changes of serum calcium level are caused by OM and/or local use of calcium sulfate remains unclear. Also, platelet (PLT) count plays a crucial predictive role in periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs), but its role in assisted diagnosis of OM is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum calcium level and PLT count may be helpful in assisted diagnosis of PTOM. METHODS: Between January 2013 and December 2018, we analyzed 468 consecutive patients (392 males and 76 females), including 170 patients with posttraumatic OM (PTOM), 130 patients with aseptic bone nonunion (ABN), and 168 patients recovered from fractures with requirement of implant removal set as controls. Preoperative serological levels of calcium, phosphorus, and PLT were detected, and comparisons were conducted among the above three groups. Additionally, correlations and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were displayed to test whether calcium level and PLT can differentiate patients with ABN and PTOM. RESULTS: Outcomes showed that the incidences of asymptomatic hypocalcemia (PTOM vs. ABN vs. controls = 22.94% vs. 6.92% vs. 8.82%, (2) = 21.098, P < 0.001) and thrombocytosis (PTOM vs. ABN vs. controls = 35.3% vs. 13.84% vs. 12.35%, (2) = 28.512, P < 0.001) were highest in PTOM patients. Besides, the mean serological levels of phosphorus in PTOM and ABN patients were significantly higher than those in the controls (P = 0.007). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC curve outcomes revealed that, with the combination of serum calcium level with PLT count, the predictive role was acceptable (AUC 0.730, P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.681-0.780). Also, serological levels of calcium of 2.225 mmol/L and PLT count of 246.5  10(9)/L were identified as the optimal cut-off values to distinguish patients with and without PTOM. However, age- and gender-related differences in serum calcium levels (age, P = 0.056; gender, P = 0.978) and PLT count (age, P = 0.363; gender, P = 0.799) were not found to be statistically significant in any groups. In addition, no significant correlations were identified between serum calcium level and PLT count (R = 0.010, P = 0.839). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic hypocalcemia and thrombocytosis appeared to be more frequent in this cohort with PTOM. Serological levels of calcium and PLT count may be useful biomarkers in screening patients suspected of PTOM.","output":"Serum Calcium Level Combined with Platelet Count May Be Useful Indicators for Assisted Diagnosis of Extremity Posttraumatic Osteomyelitis: A Comparative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic prompted governments to take immediate actions and launch a bundle of relief mechanisms to hold up companies and workers. This study analyzes the role of accounting information and regulation in supporting policy-makers in the wake of a systemic crisis in two ways: first, by clarifying how accounting information enables an in-depth appreciation of the key issues facing corporations (e.g. profitability and equity depletion, alongside liquidity), thus paving the way for the design of relief mechanisms;second, by discussing the benefits and risks of temporary changes to accounting rules perused by governments. Towards these aims, we analyze the effects of the recent health crisis on profitability and equity shortfalls for a large sample of 580,874 privately-held Italian firms;our findings suggest that the number of distressed firms - whose equity falls below legal requirements - increase from 11% in 2019 to 26% in 2020, absent any government interventions. Altogether these firms employ almost 1.4 millions of employees and have total exposure towards the financial system, net of short term assets, equal to  65 billions. We then forecast the effects of four relief mechanisms introduced by the Italian government to mitigate losses and equity depletions and find that the interventions offer a safety net for about 24% of firms otherwise in distress. Last, the study contributes to the debate on the role of accounting information and regulation in the wake of systemic crisis by (a) highlighting and discussing the effects of temporary changes to accounting rules on the informativeness and transparency of financial statements, and (b) suggesting alternative ways to modify accounting rules to avoid large corporate losses and equity depletions yet ensuring forward looking informativeness of financial statements once the crisis tapers.","output":"COVID-19, Public Policies and Corporate Survival: The Role of Accounting Information and Regulation in the Wake of a Systemic Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is typically associated with severe respiratory distress and has claimed more than 525,000 lives already. The most fearful aspect is the unavailability of any concrete guidelines and treatment or protective strategies for reducing mortality or morbidity caused by this virus. Repurposing of drugs, antivirals, convalescent plasma and neutralizing antibodies are being considered for treatment but are still questionable in lieu of the conflicting data, study design and induction of secondary infections. Stem cell therapy has seen substantial advancements over the past decade for the treatment of various diseases including pulmonary disorders with severe complications similar to COVID-19. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received particular attention as a potential therapeutic modality for SARS-CoV2 infection due to their ability to inhibit cytokine storm, a hallmark of severe COVID-19. MSCs secretion of trophic factors and extracellular vesicles mediated intercellular signaling are considered as principal contributing factors for tissue recovery. Although, recent preliminary studies have established the safety and efficacy of these cells without any severe secondary complications in the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection, the rational use of MSCs on a large scale would still require additional relevant clinical investigations and validation of postulated mechanisms of these cells.

In this study, we examine if 360 videos can promote increased engagement over standard two-dimensional (2D) videos among medical students learning anatomy. We enrolled 39 fourth-year medical students to watch two four-minute videos of anatomy lab exercises in a 360 three-dimensional format using an immersive headset or in a 2D format on a laptop computer. Every two minutes, students were asked to rate their engagement from 0-100. Following the videos, they reported their degree of agreement with 14 statements related to engagement, practicality, and interest in the technology. While watching the videos, the average engagement reported by the 360 video group was higher at each time point than the engagement reported by the two-dimensional group. Further, the engagement remained high in the 360 group through the six- and eight-minute timepoints. In the post-video survey, the 360 group reported a statistically significantly higher average engagement in seven of eight measures on the assessment. A 360 video was rated as more practical and interesting than a two-dimensional video. No significant difference existed in the perceived ease of learning. Overall, the use of 360 video may improve engagement for short videos used in medical education.

Health care workers were at highest risk of infection. The purpose of this study, which was based on Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB), was to determine the extent to which personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control influence nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. After the SARS outbreak, a total of 750 staff nurses (response rate 90%) at one hospital completed a questionnaire assessing their intention to provide care to SARS patients. Overall, 42.7% of nurses had a positive intention to provide care to SARS patients, and 25.4% of nurses would volunteer to care for SARS patients. Four factors explaining 35% of the variance in nurses' intention to care for SARS patients were self-efficacy ( = 0.39, p < 0.001), attitude ( = 0.25, p < 0.001), years of working in the study hospital ( = ?0.15, p < 0.001), and receiving resources from the hospital ( = 0.13, p < 0.001). Two factors explaining 15% of the variance in nurses' volunteering to care for SARS patients were intention ( = 0.31, p < 0.001) and attitude ( = 0.15, p < 0.001). The final model shows that the variables of the TPB contributed significantly to the explanation of a portion of variance in nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients.

Design: Cross-sectional, correlational survey study. Methods: Registered nurses were surveyed in September 2020 about their experiences during the first peak month of COVID-19 using the new, validated, COVID-19 Moral Distress Scale for Nurses. Nurses' mental health was measured by recently experienced symptoms. Analyses included descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Outcome variables were moral distress and mental health. Explanatory variables were frequency of COVID-19 patients, leadership communication and personal protective equipment/cleaning supplies access. The sample comprised 307 nurses (43% response rate) from two academic medical centres. Results: Many respondents had difficulty accessing personal protective equipment. Most nurses reported that hospital leadership communication was transparent, effective and timely. The most distressing situations were the transmission risk to nurses' family members, caring for patients without family members present, and caring for patients dying without family or clergy present. These occurred occasionally with moderate distress. Nurses reported 2.5 days each in the past week of feeling anxiety, withdrawn and having difficulty sleeping. Moral distress decreased with effective communication and access to personal protective equipment. Moral distress was associated with longer-term mental health. Conclusion: Pandemic patient care situations are the greatest sources of nurses' moral distress. Effective leadership communication, fewer COVID-19 patients, and access to protective equipment decrease moral distress, which influences longer-term mental health. Impact: Little was known about the impact of COVID-19 on nurses' moral distress. We found that nurses' moral distress was associated with the volume of care for infected patients, access to personal protective equipment, and communication from leaders. We found that moral distress was associated with longer-term mental health.

The analysis considered the incidence of COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization and the implementation date of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) reported by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. RESULTS: In each of the seven included countries, the average IPP was lower in 2020 than in 2010-2019 (P < 0.01), with the largest difference being 31.1% (95% confidence interval 28.4-33.7%). In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and South Africa, higher IPPs were observed during epidemiological weeks 4-16 in 2020 compared with the same weeks in 2010-2019. The IPP increased after NPIs were implemented in Argentina and South Africa, but started to decline in Bolivia, Chile, Madagascar and Paraguay before NPI implementation.

This review sets out to describe the specific approach, diagnosis and management of cats with spinal cord disease and to outline the most common diseases responsible. Patient group Patients of either gender and all ages and breeds can be affected by spinal cord disease. Evidence base Many diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats, which include fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy, intervertebral disc disease, exogenous spinal cord trauma, spinal cord lymphosarcoma and feline infectious peritonitis, are well described in the literature. Many of these descriptions, however, have been based on case reports or series.

SARS-CoV-2 directly infects and damages vascular endothelial cells, which leads to microvascular dysfunction and promotes a procoagulant state. Dipyridamole (DP) acts as a reversible phosphodiesterase inhibitor and is used mainly as an antiplatelet agent. It is hypothetised that it has possible activities in COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY We report our retrospective, real-world results of DP added to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the treatment of 462 clinically diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We compared anticoagulation with and without DP addition with no administration of anticoagulation in the same time frame. The primary outcome was proven or highly suspected coagulopathy within 30 days of hospitalization. RESULTS Definitive coagulopathy has been diagnosed in 3 (3.5%) of 85 LMWH administered patients and 7 (2.13%) of 328 DP + LMWH received patients (P=0.456). Five cases with definitive coagulopathy were not initiated any anticoagulation at the time of the event. The multivariate analysis showed that DP addition to the anticoagulant approach did not have any impact on the risk of demonstrated coagulopathy and highly-suspected coagulopathy. CONCLUSION We think that our clinical experience is valuable in showing the real-life results of DP + LMWH treatment in COVID-19. This approach did not affect the coagulopathy rate. Our data did also not document an additive effect of DP in the COVID-19 outcome. Prospective controlled trials would give more convincing results regarding the role of DP in COVID-19 endothelial dysfunction and clinical outcome.","output":"Dipyridamole does not have any additive effect on the prevention of COVID-19 coagulopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Exercise therapy is the most recommended treatment for chronic low back pain (LBP). Effect sizes for exercises are usually small to moderate and could be due to the heterogeneity of people presenting with LBP. Thus, if patients could be better matched to exercise based on individual factors, then the effects of treatment could be greater. A recently published study provided evidence of better outcomes when patients are matched to the appropriate exercise type. The study demonstrated that a 15-item questionnaire, the Lumbar Spine Instability Questionnaire (LSIQ), could identify patients who responded best to one of the two exercise approaches for LBP (motor control and graded activity). The primary aim of the current study isill be to evaluate whether preidentified baseline characteristics, including the LSIQ, can modify the response to two of the most common exercise therapies for non-specific LBP. Secondary aims include an economic evaluations with a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants (n=414) will be recruited by primary care professionals and randomised (1:1) to receive motor control exercises or graded activity. Participants will undergo 12 sessions of exercise therapy over an 8-week period. The primary outcome will be physical function at 2 months using the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes will be pain intensity, function and quality of life measured at 2, 6 and 12 months.

Accumulating evidence suggests exposure to greenspace may reduce the risk of COVID-19 mortality. Greenspace exposure enhances immune functioning, reduces inflammation, and replenishes gut microbiota may protect against the risk of mortality among those with COVID-19. However, previous studies often fail to distinguish the health effect of different types of greenspace, explore the dose-response association and optimal buffer distance, and consider the spatial dynamics of population distribution and geographic locations of greenspace. This study examined the associations among ratio of different types of greenspaces, population- weighted exposure to different types of greenspaces, and COVID-19 mortality rates using a negative binomial generalized linear mixed effects model across 3,025 counties, adjusted for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, policy and regulation, behavioral, and environmental factors. The population-weighted measure gave proportionally greater weight to greenspace near areas of higher population density. Exposure to forest and pasture was negatively associated with COVID-19 mortality rates, while developed open space has insignificant or positive associations with mortality rates. Forest outside park has the largest effect size across all buffer distances, followed by forest inside park. The optimal exposure buffer distance is 1km for forest outside park, with 1 unit of increase in exposure associated with a 9.9% decrease in mortality rates (95% confidence interval: 6.9% -12.8%). The optimal exposure buffer distance of forest inside park is 400m, with 1 unit of increase in exposure, associated with a 4.7% decrease in mortality rates (95% confidence interval: 2.4% - 6.9%).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of early postoperative seizures (EPS) in dogs with brain tumors, identify specific risk factors for EPS, and determine if EPS affects outcome. ANIMALS: Eighty-eight dogs that underwent 125 intracranial surgeries for diagnosis and treatment of rostrotentorial brain tumors. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. All patients with a diagnosis of rostrotentorial brain tumor from 2006 to 2020 were included. Early postoperative seizures were diagnosed by observation of seizure activity within 14 days of neurosurgery. Previously diagnosed structural epilepsy, perioperative anticonvulsant drug (ACD) use, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tumor characteristics were evaluated. Outcome measures included neurologic and nonneurologic complications, duration of hospitalization, and survival to discharge. RESULTS: Dogs with rostrotentorial brain tumors had EPS after 16/125 (12.8%) neurosurgical procedures (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-19%). Presence of previous structural epilepsy was not associated with EPS risk (P = 1). Perioperative ACD use also was not associated with EPS (P = .06). Dogs with EPS had longer hospitalization (P < .001), were more likely to have neurologic complications postsurgery (P = .01), and were less likely to survive to discharge (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: It is difficult to predict which dogs are at risk of EPS because the presence of previous structural epilepsy and the use of perioperative ACDs was not associated with EPS. However, seizures in the early postoperative period are clinically important because affected dogs had prolonged hospitalization, more neurologic complications, and decreased short-term survival.","output":"Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for early postoperative seizures in dogs with rostrotentorial brain tumors after intracranial surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]other organs such as the liver are commonly affected Since the very beginning of the pandemic, abnormalities in the liver blood tests (LBT) have been described in patients with COVID-19 First of all, as mentioned before, the pathogenesis of the liver damage by the SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown In this setting, the biochemical and histhopathological findings reported are still insufficient to provide insight about the exact mechanisms of the hepatic injury [ ]there is an absence of prospective, studies with pathological assessment at the diagnosis and after remission of the infection","output":"Abnormal liver blood tests among hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The traditional educational models have been challenged by the appearance of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, which made online education an imperative almost everywhere in order to ensure a minimized health risk for population through social distancing while continuing the educational and administrative activities of educational facilities.

New studies have described the production and dissemination of sprays during simulated dental procedures, but findings lack generalizability beyond their measurements setting. This study aims to describe the fundamental mechanisms associated with spray production from rotary dental instrumentation with particular focus on what are currently considered high-risk components-namely, the production of small droplets that may remain suspended in the room environment for extended periods and the dispersal of high-velocity droplets resulting in formites at distant surfaces. Procedural sprays were parametrically studied with variables including rotation speed, burr-to-tooth contact, and coolant premisting modified and visualized using high-speed imaging and broadband or monochromatic laser light-sheet illumination. Droplet velocities were estimated and probability density maps for all laser illuminated sprays generated. The impact of varying the coolant parameters on heating during instrumentation was considered. Complex structured sprays were produced by water-cooled rotary instruments, which, in the worst case of an air turbine, included droplet projection speeds in excess of 12 m/s and the formation of millions of small droplets that may remain suspended. Elimination of premisting (mixing of coolant water and air prior to burr contact) resulted in a significant reduction in small droplets, but radial atomization may still occur and is modified by burr-to-tooth contact. Spatial probability distribution mapping identified a threshold for rotation speeds for radial atomization between 80,000 and 100,000 rpm. In this operatory mode, cutting efficiency is reduced but sufficient coolant effectiveness appears to be maintained. Multiple mechanisms for atomization of fluids from rotatory instrumentation exist, but parameters can be controlled to modify key spray characteristics during the current crisis.","output":"Mechanisms of Atomization from Rotary Dental Instruments and Its Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medicine is critical to our everyday lives and to the well-being of individuals of all ages and backgrounds. With the beginning of the Corona pandemic and a rise in Corona virus infection cases, the use of medications to prevent and recover from infection has increased, as well as to treat illness consequences, has grown. The effectiveness of medicines is greatly influenced by the expiration date. In this paper, a system for pharmacy or medical store's information storage system was developed and enhanced by automatically monitoring the validity of medications on a periodic basis and sending expiry reports to medicine authorities through e-mail to warn them that a medicine is approaching expiration.

Conventional confirmatory testing include skin tests and, for a few drugs, quantification of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. However, none of these tests are absolutely predictive for the clinical outcome, and can yield false-negative and false-positive results. We performed a proof-of-concept study to assess whether a mast cell activation test could improve diagnosis of IgE-mediated chlorhexidine hypersensitivity, a common cause of perioperative anaphylaxis. METHODS: Human mast cells were generated from CD34+ progenitor cells and sensitised with patients' sera to become IgE+ human mast cells (dMCIgE+), and then incubated with chlorhexidine to assess degranulation. We compared the diagnostic performance of this mast cell activation test with serum from patients with and without positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine. RESULTS: In dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine showed drug-specific and concentration-dependent degranulation upon stimulation with chlorhexidine, determined by surface upregulation of the degranulation marker CD63. In contrast, dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a negative skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine were unresponsive in the mast cell activation test. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the mast cell activation test can be used to diagnose IgE/Fc?RI-dependent immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions. It also shows potential to assess the clinical relevance of drug-specific IgE antibodies in their ability to elicit mast cell degranulation, and therefore discriminate between allergy and sensitisation. Extended studies are required to verify whether this technique can be used in other causes of perioperative anaphylaxis.","output":"Mast cell activation test in chlorhexidine allergy: a proof of concept"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of social distancing measures (e.g., school closures) by governments worldwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has affected millions of children and their families. However, the consequences of such measures on the wellbeing of children with special educational needs (SEN) and their caregivers are not fully understood. The present study examined the socioemotional wellbeing and daily habits of children between 5 and 12 years old with SEN during the first national COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. Participants were 995 caregivers between 18 and 61 years old living in the United Kingdom who completed a 20 -min electronic survey on child and family wellbeing distributed via social networks between July and August 2020. The findings showed that children with SEN were more likely to experience more emotional and behavioral difficulties during the lockdown than children without SEN. Children with SEN but without mental health difficulties did not have more behavior difficulties during the lockdown than children without SEN. There was a significant increase in screen time and decrease in sleep time for children with and without SEN during the lockdown, but children with SEN were using screens more often than children without SEN both before and during the lockdown. Finally, caregivers with children with SEN reported more difficulty with the confinement than caregivers with children without SEN, but caregiver and child poor mental health were likely to explain the difference. The findings show that the wellbeing of children with SEN was more likely to be negatively affected by the lockdown than the wellbeing of children without SEN.

Rapid detection of the virus is crucial for controlling its spread through a population. COVID-19 is currently detected by nucleic acid-based tests and serological tests. However, these methods have limitations such as the requirement of high-cost reagents, false negative results and being time consuming. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), which is a powerful technique that enhances the Raman signals of molecules using plasmonic nanostructures, can overcome these disadvantages. In this study, we developed a virus-infected cell model and analyzed this model by SERS combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 via polyethyleneimine (PEI). Non-plasmid transfected HEK293 cells were used as the control group. Cellular uptake was optimized with green fluorescence protein (GFP) plasmids and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The transfection efficiency was found to be around 60%. The expression of M, N, and E proteins was demonstrated by western blotting. The SERS spectra of the total proteins of transfected cells were obtained using a gold nanoparticle-based SERS substrate. Proteins of the transfected cells have peak positions at 646, 680, 713, 768, 780, 953, 1014, 1046, 1213, 1243, 1424, 2102, and 2124 cm-1. To reveal spectral differences between plasmid transfected cells and non-transfected control cells, PCA was applied to the spectra.

We put forward three tendencies of family firms in their ability to deal with strategic change. First, familiness creates an overemphasis on the cognition of gradual change triggers but limits the cognition of radical change triggers. Second, familiness creates a tendency to inappropriately scope and dimension strategic change in radical change episodes to protect the value of legacy resources.

METHODS: Analysis of validated self-administered questionnaires, radiological characteristics and treatment strategies of PA was performed. RESULTS: Of the 221 sent questionnaires, 146 could be used for statistical analysis, 50% of which were completed by women. Among responders, 58.9% had pain: 30.1% migraine, 15.7% pain with NC and 13.1% other types of pain. Migraine was more common in patients with PA than in the general population (30.1% vs. 21.3%, p = .010) and attacks received appropriate treatment for less than 20% of these patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic migraine was much higher than in the general population (6.8% vs. 2.2%, p = .003). Neuropathic pain was also more frequent in PA patients than in the general population (15.8% vs. 6.9%, p < .001). Neuropathic pain was most often located in the extremities and was frequently described as an 'electric shock', 'numbness', or 'pins-and-needles'. Multivariate analyses linked migraine to younger age, anxiety, pain with NC, and a visible tumour on MRI, regardless of its invasiveness or secretory nature. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine headaches and neuropathic pain are more frequent and disabling in PA patients than in the general population. Both types of pain are comorbid in PA patients and are poorly treated. Migraine is associated with the presence of a tumour. Thus, biological mechanisms of this relationship need to be characterized to design optimal treatments for these individuals. SIGNIFICANCE: Migraine headaches and neuropathic pain are more common in PA patients than in the general population and are generally poorly treated. A systematic screening for migraine should be done by physicians in daily practice to provide adequate therapeutics.","output":"Characteristics of pain in patients with pituitary adenomas: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the whole world and has now been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) Although the mortality rate of this virus is low, it is especially potent against people with underlying systemic conditions Dentistry is a profession where the doctor, as well as the dental staff, works in close vicinity to the patient's mouth Dental education has two core components;didactic and clinical training (including patient care) Dental education has been interrupted in the past due to certain events (Arab Spring and SARS outbreak) Currently, the pandemic of COVID-19 has disrupted dental education globally as most of the dental schools and universities in the world have closed amidst the COVID-19 outbreak Teledentistry is a subspecialty of telemedicine that helps in the provision of educational activities, advice, and diagnosis about treatment over a distance with the help of technology like video conferencing The current overview summarizes the potential role of teledentistry in continuing the dental educational process in terms of delivery of didactic components, clinical training, and patient care It can be concluded that with modern updated devices and tools, teledentistry can be an effective way to prevent disruption of dental education and it can be utilized in continuing the dental educational process in this critical time of the COVID-19 outbreak","output":"COVID-19 outbreak, disruption of dental education, and the role of teledentistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preprints promote the open and fast communication of non-peer reviewed work.

Radiology educators have had to rapidly adapt to a new, virtual educational landscape. We describe our experience restructuring a Trauma and Emergency Radiology Elective to an online format and present survey data obtained from students who completed the course. METHODS: This elective is a 4-week course offered to third and fourth year medical students at a large Level 1 Trauma Center. Changes to the traditional rotation included assigning an increased number of self-study educational resources, independent review of unknown cases using a virtual workstation, and online interactive conferences. At the conclusion of each block, students were asked to complete post-course feedback surveys. RESULTS: Thirteen students enrolled in this online course; 92% submitted post-course surveys. Students strongly agreed that the course was clinically relevant, with accessible, engaging material (average score, 4.92/5), and 91.7% of students were very likely to recommend this rotation to others. Students reported improved post-course confidence in ordering and interpreting imaging studies. A majority (60%) of students who had previously taken an on-site course would have preferred a course that combined traditional and online learning elements. CONCLUSIONS: The success of our online rotation highlights the merits of self-directed learning and flipped-classroom techniques.

Predominantly, student-led health interventions were free clinics servicing socially disadvantaged communities in the USA. A 2015 systematic review identified that students value these student-run clinics and reported skill and knowledge attainment from participating. Previous research has reported on patient satisfaction outcomes, but less frequently about the clinical outcomes patients accrue from these student-delivered services. As cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, this review aimed to explore the effectiveness of student-led health interventions through examining their impact on objective clinical outcomes, using the case of patients at risk of, or with, cardiovascular disease. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in eight electronic databases to identify student-led health interventions conducted on adults with a cardiovascular disease risk factor or established cardiovascular disease, and a clinical outcome of interest. Through double-blinded screening and data extraction, sixteen studies were identified for synthesis. RESULTS The majority of student-led health interventions for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease demonstrated a positive impact on patient health. Statistically significant changes amongst patients at risk of cardiovascular disease appeared to be associated with student-led individualised intervention or group-based interventions amongst patients with diabetes or those who are overweight or obese. The evidence was of moderate quality, as included studies lacked a control group for comparison and detail to enable the intervention to be replicated. CONCLUSIONS Future research applying a student-led health intervention through a randomised control trial, with rigorous reporting of both student and patient interventions and outcomes, are required to further understand the effectiveness of this alternative service delivery model.","output":"Effect of student-led health interventions on patient outcomes for those with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the implementation of the Covid-19 vaccination, the issue of consent was widely commented upon.

In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10 percent penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population.

Findings: For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low- and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption.

However, these relations are in fact two-sided and involve modifications of both the virus and host genomes. Mutations that accumulate in the populations of viruses and hosts may provide them advantages such as the ability to overcome defense barriers of host cells or to create more efficient barriers to deal with the attack of the viral agent. One of the most common ways of reinforcing anti-viral barriers is the horizontal transfer of viral genes into the host genome. Within the host genome, these genes may be modified and extensively expressed to compete with viral copies and inhibit the synthesis of their products or modulate their functions in other ways.

Whether this decrease is associated with more severe MI, e.g. MI-CS, is unknown. We aimed to examine the association of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and incidence of acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock (MI-CS). Methods On March 11, 2020, the Danish government announced national lock-down. Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients hospitalized with MI-CS. Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used to compare MI-CS before and after March 11 in 2015-2019 and in 2020. Results We identified 11,769 patients with MI of whom 696 (5.9%) had cardiogenic shock in 2015-2019. In 2020, 2,132 MI patients were identified of whom 119 had cardiogenic shock (5.6%). The IR per 100,000 person years before March 11 in 2015-2019 was 9.2 (95% CI: 8.3-10.2) and after 8.9 (95% CI: 8.0-9.9). In 2020, the IR was 7.5 (95% CI: 5.8-9.7) before March 11 and 7.7 (95% CI: 6.0-9.9) after. The IRRs comparing the 2020-period with the 2015-2019 period before and after March 11 (lockdown) were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.59-1.12) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.57-1.32), respectively. The IRR comparing the 2020-period during and before lockdown was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.74-1.41). No difference in 7-day mortality or in-hospital management was observed between study periods. Conclusion We could not identify a significant association of the national lockdown on the incidence of MI-CS, along with similar in-hospital management and mortality in patients with MI-CS.","output":"Incidence of acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock during corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Due to the novelty of COVID-19 there is lack of evidence-based recommendations regarding the mechanical ventilation of these patients.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the observed low incidence of perinatal infection could be related to a low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV2, ACE2, in the fetal-placental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non-infected pregnancies across gestation. METHODS: Discovery study. Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. Five cases of medical termination of pregnancy performed at between 15 and 38 weeks' in healthy women. Paraffin-embedded tissues (kidneys, brain, lungs, intestinal tract, heart). Matching tissues from 8-year-old children (N=4) were tested as controls. Seven placentas including those of the 5 cases, 1 of a 7-week miscarriage and 1 of a symptomatic SARS-COV2 pregnancy at 34 weeks. Tissues' sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2. Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. It was barely detectable in lungs at 15 weeks' and not found thereafter. In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks' onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother's SARS-CoV2 placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring on the risk of congenital malformation. Clinical follow-up of infected pregnant women and their children are needed to validate these observations. This article is protected by copyright.

Distinct modeling constructs have triggered varied ways of detecting such changes, almost every one of which gives in to certain shortcomings. Parametric models based on time series objects, for instance, work well under distributional assumptions or when change detection in specific properties - such as mean, variance, trend, etc. are of interest. Others rely heavily on the \\"at most one change-point\\" assumption, and implementing binary segmentation to discover subsequent changes comes at a hefty computational cost. This work offers an alternative that remains both versatile and untethered to such stifling constraints. Detection is done through a sequence of tests with variations to certain trend permuted statistics. We study non-stationary Hawkes patterns which, with an underlying stochastic intensity, imply a natural branching process structure. Our proposals are shown to estimate changes efficiently in both the immigrant and the offspring intensity without sounding too many false positives. Comparisons with established competitors reveal smaller Hausdorff-based estimation errors, desirable inferential properties such as asymptotic consistency and narrower bootstrapped margins.

We retrace our lived experience from the beginning of the pandemic in the spring (from our vantage points in the UK and Canada) and the associated 'pivot online' enacted in education around the world, through to the autumn of 2020, when we appeared to be transitioning into a so-called 'new normal' of the mid-pandemic. As digital education practitioners, who are also educators. researchers, and also simply as humans and friends living through a global pandemic, we had turned to each other initially for support in terms of work, wellness, and sharing news, information and sense-making, during which we began to consider researching under-examined dimensions of the evolving situation. The experiences and issues we reference are drawn from our own work, as well as from our responses to popular narratives advanced by key voices who have encouraged certain interpretations of the pandemic and its educational effects. Using Schon's (1983) reflection-in-action lens, we examine these experiences and narratives of pandemic pedagogy through the frame of our multiple identities. In particular, from our perspective as researchers and advocates of open education, we noted calls for openness (such as the use of open educational resources) in response to the online pivot, which did not appear to be cutting through the noise of the sudden deluge of information, advice and broadly negative coverage of online teaching. However, through our reflective narrative and synthesis, we offer an alternative interpretation, which is that openness was nonetheless flourishing, but that the 'pivot open' was to practices rather than resources. Open exchange, community building and support amongst educators were apparent in multiple contexts. While pandemic profiteering has highlighted the need for open resources and infrastructures, and we anticipate this case continuing to be made more strongly as we emerge from the emergency, it is the turn to open practices which has met the immediate needs of educators and learners through community, interactions. sharing and care.","output":"Pivoting Open?

However, there are limited data on the association between the presence of neurological manifestations on hospital admission, disease severity, and outcomes. We sought to investigate this correlation to help understand the disease burden. METHODS: We delivered a multi-center retrospective study of positive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Clinical presentation, laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were reported. Our findings of interest were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 502 patients with a mean age of 60.83  15.5 years, of them 71 patients (14.14%) presented with altered mental status, these patients showed higher odds of ICU admission (OR = 2.06, 95%CI = 1.18 to 3.59, p = 0.01), mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.28, 95%CI = 1.86 to 5.78, p < 0.001), prolonged (>4 days) mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.35, 95%CI = 1.89 to 10, p = 0.001), acute kidney injury (OR = 2.18, 95%CI = 1.28 to 3.74, p = 0.004), and mortality (HR = 2.82, 95%CI = 1.49 to 5.29, p = 0.01).

Most centers use laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis (LAC/EA). A totally laparoscopic colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis (TLC/IA) has been proposed. The purpose of our study is to compare these two techniques. METHODS A series of 52 patients undergoing LLC for left-sided colon cancer was retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-three patients underwent TLC/IA, and 19 underwent LAC/EA. The following data were collected: gender, age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class, operation duration, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, postoperative course (duration of stay, time to first flatus), number of excised lymph nodes, readmission, and reoperation rates. Data were prospectively recorded in a colorectal cancer database and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The only demographic parameter that differed significantly between the groups was age (64.2  12.4 years for the TLC/IA group, vs. 72.7  2.1 years for LAC/EA, p = 0.0116). The mini-laparotomy incision was significantly shorter in the TLC/IA than in the LAC/EA group (5.8  0.9 vs. 8.2  0.9 cm, respectively, p < 0.00001). Hospital stay duration was shorter in the TLC/IA group (4.2  1.2 vs. 6.3  1.9, p = 0.0001). The average number of harvested lymph nodes did not differ significantly between the groups (12.9  5.7 in TLC/IA vs. 11.2  4.2 in LAC/EA, p = 0.2546). No significant differences between the groups were observed in any other perioperative or surgical outcome parameters. CONCLUSIONS TLC/IA in LLC for the treatment of left colon cancer is technically feasible and can be performed with a low complication rate, favorable cosmetics, and possibly shorter hospital stay, without significantly lengthening operative duration or compromising oncologic radicality principles. Although further prospective randomized studies are needed to determine its role and limitations, we encourage using it as an alternative to LAC/EA in LLC.","output":"Totally laparoscopic versus laparoscopic-assisted left colectomy for cancer: a retrospective review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes the use of two-dimensional context-free grammars (2DCFGs) for layout analysis of PDF documents.

Various Solidago-canadensis-L.-derived biochars prepared through pyrolysis from 400 to 600 C were applied to coastal saline-alkali soil samples to optimise the biochar pyrolysis temperature and investigate its actual ecological responses. All biochars reduced the soil bulk density and exchangeable sodium stress and increased soil water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter content. Principal-component-analysis results showed that pyrolysis temperature played an important role in the potential application of biochars to improve the coastal saline-alkali soil, mainly contributed to ameliorating exchangeable sodium stress and decreasing biochar-soluble toxic compounds. Furthermore, soil bulk density and organic matter, as well as carboxylic acids, phenolic acids and amines of biochar were major driving factors for bacterial community composition. Compared to low-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed below 550 C), which showed higher toxicity for Brassica chinensis L. growth due to the higher content of carboxylic acids, phenols and amines, high-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed at or above 550 C) possessed less amounts of these toxic functional groups, more beneficial soil bacteria and healthier for plant growth.

Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine concurrently and those treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine for less than 7 days were excluded. Time to negative conversion of viral RNA, time to clinical improvement, and safety outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks of follow-up. Results: Of 65 patients (mean age, 64.3 years; 25 men [38.5%]), 31 were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and 34 were treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median duration of symptoms before treatment was 7 days and 26 patients (40%) required oxygen support at baseline. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had a significantly shorter time to negative conversion of viral RNA than those treated with hydroxychloroquine (median, 21 days vs. 28 days).

METHODS Public health officials in LMICs were sent a web-based survey to provide information on barriers and activities to initiating, expanding, or maintaining national influenza vaccination programs. The survey primarily included Likert-scale questions asking respondents to rank barriers and activities in five categories. RESULTS Of 109 eligible countries, 62% participated. Barriers to influenza vaccination programs included lack of data on cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination programs (87%) and on influenza disease burden (84%), competing health priorities (80%), lack of public perceived risk from influenza (79%), need for better risk communication tools (77%), lack of financial support for influenza vaccine programs (75%), a requirement to use only WHO-prequalified vaccines (62%), and young children require two vaccine doses (60%). Activities for advancing influenza vaccination programs included educating healthcare workers (97%) and decision-makers (91%) on the benefits of influenza vaccination, better estimates of influenza disease burden (91%) and cost of influenza vaccination programs (89%), simplifying vaccine introduction by focusing on selected high-risk groups (82%), developing tools to prioritize target populations (80%), improving availability of influenza diagnostic testing (79%), and developing collaborations with neighboring countries for vaccine procurement (74%) and regulatory approval (73%).

Favorable clinical outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 2 at 90 days. Propensity score matching was performed for different treatment strategies. RESULTS Patients' mean age was 65  11 years and 118 were male (69%). The median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 15 (interquartile range 8). In 59% of the patients (n = 101), the antegrade strategy (first stenting, then thrombectomy) was -performed, in 41% (n = 70) retrograde treatment (first thrombectomy, then stenting). Successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b) was achieved in 128 patients (75%). Fifty-nine patients (39%) showed a favorable clinical outcome after 90 days. After propensity score matching, data of 100 patients could be analyzed. Analysis revealed that the retrograde strategy yielded a significantly higher rate of successful reperfusion compared to the antegrade strategy (92 vs. 56%; p < 0.001). The rate of favorable clinical outcome after 90 days (mRS 2) was consistently higher (44 vs. 30%; p < 0.05) in the retrograde strategy group. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy prior to acute CAS in TO is a predictive factor for favorable clinical outcome at 90 days.","output":"Order of Treatment Matters in Ischemic Stroke: Mechanical Thrombectomy First, Then Carotid Artery Stenting for Tandem Lesions of the Anterior Circulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Verpleegkundig specialist Nienke Ipenburg en antropoloog Ginny Mooy zijn betrokken bij het Red Team, dat de Nederlandse overheid tegenspraak wil bieden bij het coronacrisisbeleid.

This study aimed to investigate the association between the change in laboratory markers during the three days after pneumonia diagnosis and severe respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data of 23 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, admitted to the Kumamoto City Hospital between February and April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients, eight patients received mechanical ventilation (MV) (MV group), and the remaining 15 comprised the non-MV group. The levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin (Alb) decreased in the MV group during the three days after pneumonia diagnosis more than in the non-MV group (median Hb: -1.40 vs. -0.10 g/dL, P = 0.015; median Alb: -0.85 vs. -0.30 g/dL, P = 0.020). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the decrease in Hb was associated with receiving MV care (odds ratio: 0.313, 95% confidence interval: 0.100C0.976, P = 0.045). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the optimal cut-off value for the decrease in Hb level was -1.25 g/dL, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.867 and 0.750, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in Hb level during the short period after pneumonia diagnosis might be a predictor of worsening pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Decrease in Hemoglobin Level Predicts Increased Risk for Severe Respiratory Failure in COVID-19 Patients with Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the distribution of household consumption, income and savings from 2019 through the end of 2020 using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and other data. This is the first work to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic well-being using nationally representative consumption data. We find that low percentiles of the consumption distribution see pre-pandemic growth and little change with the onset of the pandemic. On the other hand, higher percentiles of the consumption distribution do not increase before the pandemic and fall in 2020. Leveraging the rich demographics of our microdata, we find the most pronounced decline for high-educated families near the top of the consumption distribution and seniors in the top half of the distribution. The decrease in the top half is less evident for non-Whites. These patterns for consumption are different than those for income, particularly in the upper part of the distribution. Liquid assets increase in the upper half of the distribution, consistent with the divergence between the upper half of the income and consumption distributions. Our results suggest that the policy response to the pandemic averted a decrease in consumption for the most materially disadvantaged families, while changes in aggregate consumption accord with the observed patterns in the top of the consumption distribution. The changes for various types of consumption, and the distribution of those changes across the material resource distribution, are consistent with reductions in travel to workwhich were large for those with greater material advantageand restrictions on outlets for consumption.","output":"Changes in the Distribution of Economic Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Nationally Representative Consumption Data (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution in India during COVID-19 lockdown, which imposed on 25th March to 31st May 2020, has brought a significant improvement in air quality The present paper mainly focuses on the scenario of air pollution level (PM2 5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and O3) across 57 urban agglomerations (UAs) of India during lockdown For analysis, India has been divided into six regions - Northern, Western, Central, Southern, Eastern and North-Eastern Various spatial statistical modelling of composite air quality index (CAQI) have been utilised to examine the spatial pattern of air pollution level The result shows that concentration of all air pollutants decreased significantly (except O3) during lockdown The maximum decrease is the concentration of NO2 (40%) followed by PM2 5 (32%), PM10 (24%) and SO2 (18%) Among 57 UA's, only five - Panipat (1 00), Ghaziabad (0 76), Delhi (0 74), Gurugram (0 72) and Varanasi (0 71) had least improvement in air pollution level considering entire lockdown period The outcome of this study has an immense scope to understand the regional scenario of air pollution level and to implement effective strategies for environmental sustainability","output":"Regional scenario of air pollution in lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from major urban agglomerations of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The residential real estate market is very important because most peoples wealth is in this sector, and it is an indicator of the economy. Real estate market data in general and market transaction data, in particular, are inherently spatiotemporal as each transaction has a location and time. Therefore, exploratory spatiotemporal methods can extract unique locational and temporal insight from property transaction data, but this type of data are usually unavailable or not sufficiently geocoded to implement spatiotemporal methods. In this article, exploratory spatiotemporal methods, including a space-time cube, were used to analyze the residential real estate market at small area scale in the Dublin Metropolitan Area over the last decade. The spatial patterns show that some neighborhoods are experiencing change, including gentrification and recent development. The extracted spatiotemporal patterns from the data show different urban areas have had varying responses during national and global crises such as the economic crisis in 2008C2011, the Brexit decision in 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also suggests that Dublin is experiencing intraurban displacement of residential property transactions to the west of Dublin city, and we are predicting increasing spatial inequality and segregation in the future. The findings of this innovative and exploratory data-driven approach are supported by other work in the field regarding Dublin and other international cities. The article shows that the space-time cube can be used as complementary evidence for different fields of urban studies, urban planning, urban economics, real estate valuations, intraurban analytics, and monitoring sociospatial changes at small areas, and to understand residential property transactions in cities. Moreover, the exploratory spatiotemporal analyses of data have a high potential to highlight spatial structures of the city and relevant underlying processes. The value and necessity of open access to geocoded spatiotemporal property transaction data in social research are also highlighted. ? 2021 by the authors.

Methods: A prevalence-based and human capital approach was used to estimate the total excess costs of PTSD in 2018 from insurance claims data, academic literature, and governmental publications. Excess direct health care costs (pharmacy, medical), direct non-health care costs (research and training, substance use, psychotherapy, homelessness, disability), and indirect costs (unemployment, productivity loss, caregiving, premature mortality) associated with PTSD were compared between adults with PTSD and adults without PTSD, or the general population if information was not available for adults without PTSD. Results: The total excess economic burden of PTSD in the US was estimated at $232.2 billion for 2018 ($19,630 per individual with PTSD). Total excess costs were $189.5 billion (81.6%) in the civilian population and $42.7 billion (18.4%) in the military population, corresponding to $18,640 and $25,684 per individual with PTSD in the civilian and military populations, respectively. In the civilian population, the excess burden was driven by direct health care ($66.0 billion) and unemployment ($42.7 billion) costs. In the military population, the excess burden was driven by disability ($17.8 billion) and direct health care ($10.1 billion) costs. Conclusions: The economic burden of PTSD goes beyond direct health care costs and has been found to rival costs for other costly mental health conditions. Increased awareness of PTSD, development of more effective therapies, and expansion of evidence-based interventions may be warranted to reduce the large clinical and economic burden of PTSD.","output":"The Economic Burden of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the United States From a Societal Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with disabilities, especially those living in low- and middle-income countries, experience significant challenges in accessing healthcare services and support.

ABSTRACT: Sexual health concerns, both physical and psychological, are common and represent an unmet need among women with and surviving cancer. Sexual challenges and conditions negatively impact body image, satisfaction, relationships, well-being, and quality of life, yet are widely reported to be under-recognized and undertreated. To guide clinical care and future research on sexual function in women with cancer, we performed a scoping review of interventions for sexual health concerns, including sexual function, body image, genitourinary symptoms, and hot flashes. Relevant publications between 2005 and 2020 were identified by searching PubMed with a combination of medical subject headings and keywords. Articles were included if they focused on the aforementioned topics, were primary research publications, and included female cancer survivors. Studies focusing on women receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer were also included. A total of 91 investigations conducted in the US and abroad were reviewed. Most commonly, interventions included a component of psychoeducation, although pharmacologic, exercise, and other approaches have been evaluated. Many studies have focused on survivors of breast or gynecologic cancer, among other sampling and methodological limitations.

The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. LIMITATIONS: Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women.

Here, we explored the potential role of cross-reactive immunity acquired from pediatric vaccinations and exposure to common human pathogens in the protection and pathology of COVID-19. To that end, we sought for peptide matches to SARS-CoV-2 (identity &#8805; 80%, in at least eight residues) in the proteomes of 25 human pathogens and in vaccine antigens, and subsequently predicted their T and B cell reactivity to identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. We found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against COVID-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and several herpesviruses are also poor or null sources of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, discarding that immunological memory against these viruses can have any general protective or pathological role in COVID-19. In contrast, we found combination vaccines for treating diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis infectious diseases (DTP vaccine) to be significant sources of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. DTP cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2 include numerous CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes with broad population protection coverage and potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several DTP vaccinations, including three-four doses the first year of life and one at 4-6 years of age. Moreover, a low antigenic Tdap dose is also given at ages 9-14.

BACKGROUND CVH has an increased risk of postoperative infection. CVH repair with synthetic or biologic meshes has reported chronic biomaterial infections and high hernia recurrence rates. METHODS Patients with a contaminated or clean-contaminated operative field and a hernia defect at least 9 cm had a biosynthetic mesh (open, sublay, retrorectus, or intraperitoneal) repair with fascial closure (n = 104). Endpoints included overall Kaplan-Meier estimates for hernia recurrence and postoperative wound infection rates at 24 months, and the EQ-5D and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12).

RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 58 years, body mass index of 28 kg/m, 77% had contaminated wounds, and 84% completed 24-months follow-up. Concomitant procedures included fistula takedown (n = 24) or removal of infected previously placed mesh (n = 29). Hernia recurrence rate was 17% (n = 16). At the time of CVH repair, intraperitoneal placement of the biosynthetic mesh significantly increased the risk of recurrences (P  0.04).

The primary aim of this study is to assess the influence of the COVID-19 national lockdown in Poland on the short-term outcomes and intraoperative course of bariatric patients in a high volume IFSO certified bariatric center. MATERIAL & METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 158 bariatric surgery patients, who underwent bariatric procedures either prior to or after the first national lockdown in Poland. The patients were categorized as pre-lockdown group and the post-lockdown group, each comprising of 79 patients. RESULTS: The post-lockdown group had significantly lower operative weight (105.76 vs 114.25, p = 0.012) and BMI (36.99 vs 39.93, p = 0.005) compared to pre-lockdown group. The primary length of stay was significantly longer in the post-lockdown group (3.04 vs 2.44, p = 0.001). The post-lockdown group had significantly lower mean CCI score (1.90 vs 6.67, p = 0.046) and less short-term readmissions post-discharge (0 vs 8.86, p = 0.007) than pre-lockdown group. CONCLUSION: The post-lockdown group was found to have lower body weight and BMI on the day of the operation than those operated prior to the lockdown. These findings are conflicting to previous research assessing weight changes during lockdowns. Since the qualification criteria and order of operations were similar and pre-defined for both groups, possible explanations for these findings are higher patient motivation due to COVID-19 fears and longer preparation period due to elective surgery postponement. We encourage bariatric centers globally to assess the effect of national lockdowns on the patient profiles as well as the psychological and behavioral impact on the bariatric cohort.","output":"Influence of polish national COVID-19 lockdown on the patient characteristics and outcomes of bariatric surgery at a high-volume centerA cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Considerable advocacy, funding, training, and technical support have been provided to South Asian countries to strengthen One Health (OH) collaborative approaches for controlling diseases with global human pandemic potential since the early 2000s. It is essential that the OH approach continues to be strengthened given South Asia is a hot spot for emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases. The objectives of this article are to describe OH research and training and capacity building activities and the important developments in government support for OH in these countries to identify current achievements and gaps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A landscape analysis of OH research, training, and government support in South Asia was generated by searching peer-reviewed and grey literature for OH research publications and reports, a questionnaire survey of people potentially engaged in OH research in South Asia and the authors professional networks. RESULTS: Only a small proportion of zoonotic disease research conducted in South Asia can be described as truly OH, with a significant lack of OH policy-relevant research. A small number of multisectoral OH research and OH capacity building programmes were conducted in the region. The governments of Bangladesh and Bhutan have established operational OH strategies, with variable progress institutionalising OH in other countries. Identified gaps were a lack of useful scientific information and of a collaborative culture for formulating and implementing integrated zoonotic disease control policies and the need for ongoing support for transdisciplinary OH research and policy-relevant capacity building programmes. DISCUSSION: Overall we found a very small number of truly OH research and capacity building programmes in South Asia. Even though significant progress has been made in institutionalising OH in some South Asian countries, further behavioural, attitudinal, and institutional changes are required to strengthen OH research and training and implementation of sustainably effective integrated zoonotic disease control policies.","output":"One Health research and training and government support for One Health in South Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the late 2019 - early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread all over the world, including in Africa The Giant of Africa - Nigeria - registered the first case of infection in February, and in March the government already took a number of anti-crisis measures, including the closure of all airports for international flights and the suspension of the issuance of visas to citizens of many countries In addition, on March 30, entry into Abuja, Lagos, and another 12 major cities, as well as interstate travel, was severely restricted;all offices and enterprises were closed, except for those of strategic importance;mass events and even walking on the street without a mask and unless in emergency were prohibited Unlike Arab countries, which tightened measures to combat the pandemic only after the deaths of hundreds of citizens, the Nigerian authorities did not await for the virus to take a foothold They began to act after the very first death, despite the small total number of infected As a result, the spread of the COVID-19 in the densely populated country of 200 million people was slower than in South Africa and countries of North Africa Owing to the experience gained in 2014 during the Ebola epidemic, which at the time affected several countries in West Africa, Nigeria was better than many other African countries prepared for the outbreak of the novel coronavirus In early May, despite the continued increase in the number of infected, the government had to ease the regime of self-isolation due to the threat of political destabilization and economic recession, falling incomes of citizens against the backdrop of the frozen economy, rising unemployment and, as a result, growing dissatisfaction with safety measures on the part of Nigerians, whose deplorable financial situation exorcised from their minds the threat the virus  ܧߧ 2019 - ߧѧѧݧ 2020 ԧ ӧ֧ ާڧ ӧѧڧݧ ڧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19  ?ѧڧܧѧߧܧ ԧڧԧѧߧ? - ڧԧ֧ڧ ֧ӧ ڧߧڧڧӧѧߧߧ ӧڧݧ  ֧ӧѧݧ,  ا  ާѧ ѧӧڧ֧ݧӧ ڧߧݧ  ѧߧڧܧڧ٧ڧߧ ާ֧, ٧ӧݧڧӧڧ ڧާ٧ڧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ݧѧԧէѧ , ݧ֧ߧߧާ  2014  ӧ ӧ֧ާ ڧէ֧ާڧ ݧڧѧէܧ ҧݧ, ӧѧڧӧ֧ ԧէ ߧ֧ܧݧܧ ѧ ѧѧէߧ ڧܧ, ڧԧ֧ڧ ܧѧ٧ѧݧѧ ݧ, ֧ ާߧԧڧ էԧڧ ѧڧܧѧߧܧڧ ԧէѧӧ, էԧӧݧ֧ߧߧ  ڧէ֧ާڧ ܧߧѧӧڧ","output":"COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria: challenges and forecasts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO. Since then, efforts have been made to increase our knowledge of the disease. The convalescent plasma (CP) donation involves a series of criteria for donor eligibility, such as pre-donation and serological tests. Currently, the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood and the usefulness of serological tests is unclear (Long, et al. Nature Medicine, 2020). Based on donor eligibility, one can better assess the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 from post-infection candidates. This is an observational, prospective study, without intervention. From 06/26/2020 to 07/31/2020, serological data of candidates for CP donation were collected. Recovered COVID-19 patients who had been previously tested were interviewed. RT-PCR and serological test (chemiluminescence immunoassays) for SARS-CoV-2 were carried out to verify their eligibility for CP collection. The data were related to the time of the onset of symptoms and the collection of the material. Subjects with non-detectable RT-PCR and reagent IgG were considered eligible. Reference values were IgM > 1.2 AU/mL and IgG > 1.4 AU/mL. The characteristics of the candidates are summarized in Table 1. Of 234 interviewed subjects, 70 were screened for pre-collection tests, 49 were male. The average age was 36 (20 - 57). After serological screening, 44/70 (62.8%) were considered eligible for CP donation. The reasons for ineligibility were: 17/70 (24.3%) non-reagent IgG, 4/70 (5.7%) with detectable RT-PCR and 5/70 (7.1%) due to reasons in clinical screening. The median between the onset of symptoms and the serology sample collection was 32.5 (21 - 77) days, (IQR 28.75 to 37.25). Those who were more likely to be eligible to donate were the subjects who had a longer time interval between the symptoms onset and the sample collection (p <0.012). Although viral clearance in the upper airways is expected from the 10th day of symptom onset, only 50% of patients will have an undetectable test (?z?rmez, et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2020). In our sample, 5.7% (4/70) of the subjects had detectable RT-PCR, which can represent residual viral genome and not active infection. We observed that 20% of the subjects samples were non-reagent. Those who were tested up to the 21st of the onset of symptoms might not have had seroconversion yet. For those tested after the 28th day, we can infer that the antibodies had already been cleared. Some authors state that patients who had mild infections may react with less antibodies (?z?rmez, et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2020), which could explain this fact. Likewise, it was not possible to relate serological titers to the severity of the disease, as this was not one of the selection criteria.In 40/70 donors (57.2%) IgM remained above 1.2 AU / mL after the 21st day of symptom onset. Interestingly, 2 of these had only reagent IgM after the 36th day of symptom onset. Most subjects who had reagent IgM after the 21st of symptoms also had reagent IgG. We inferred that they were in a vigorous convalescence phase. In addition, 75.7% of the subjects presented reagent IgG regardless of the date of onset of symptoms. Most of them had both reagent IgM and IgG. Only one donor's (1.4%) IgM and IgG were non-reagent 21 days after the onset of symptoms. As we did not collect serial samples, we could not verify the average amount of days for seroconversion to take place. Some authors recommend that the single collection should occur at least 21 days after the onset of symptoms, so seroconversion is observed (Deeks, et al., Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020). In our sample, 4 donors (5%) collected the samples on the 21st day after the symptom onset. Of these, 3 had seroconversion, 2 with IgM and IgG, 1 with IgG and 1 with reagent IgM. The values suggest that the subjects who could donate CP were those that presented a longer time interval between the onset of symptoms and the blood sample collection, in comparison to those who could not (p=0,012 and 0,409, respectively). The median of days between symptom onset and serology testing was also higher in the non-eligible group. Besides, the eligible group had a higher average concentration of IgM and IgG compared to the non-eligible one. In conclusion, regarding the serological criteria, about 25% of the studied population could not donate CP. Although a single serology sample collection after the 21st day of symptom onset is recommended, only 1 candidate did not show seroconversion.

In severe cases, life-threatening airway obstruction may occur. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the incidence and severity of VCP among patients who underwent thoracic cardiovascular surgery and to identify possible risk factors. DESIGN Single-centre retrospective review of adult patients. SETTING Osaka University Hospital, Suita, Japan, from January 2013 to August 2015. PATIENTS We included 688 patients in the final analysis. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected from medical records. Patients with preoperative VCP or tracheostomy prior to extubation were excluded. The VCP severity in relation to functional recovery was graded using the following categories: absent; mild, remission at 6 months; moderate, partial or persistent VCP at 6 months; or severe, airway obstruction after extubation requiring reintubation. An otolaryngologist diagnosed all VCP cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The incidence and severity of VCP after extubation. RESULTS The incidence (number) of VCP was 4.7% (32), with those of mild, moderate and severe VCP being 1.7% (12), 1.5% (10) and 1.5% (10), respectively. The ICU stay was significantly longer in patients with severe VCP than in patients without VCP [12.5 days (interquartile range 5.5 to 25.5) vs. 3 days (interquartile range 2 to 5), P = 0.0002]. In our multivariable analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus [odds ratio (OR) 1.853, P = 0.009], intubation period (OR per 24 h 1.136, P = 0.014), ascending aortic arch surgery with brachiocephalic artery reconstruction (OR 8.708, P < 0.001) and ventricular assist device implantation (OR 3.460, P = 0.005) were independent predictors for VCP. CONCLUSION The identification of these risk factors may facilitate screening for VCP before extubation and possibly help anaesthesia personnel to be prepared to treat VCP-related airway obstruction should it occur.","output":"Perioperative factors related to the severity of vocal cord paralysis after thoracic cardiovascular surgery: A retrospective review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis comorbidity with chronic diseases including diabetes, HIV and chronic kidney disease is of rising concern. In particular, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) comorbidity with end\\\\stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with up to 52.5\\\\fold increased risk of TB reactivation to active tuberculosis infection (ATBI). The immunological mechanisms driving this significant rise in TB reactivation are poorly understood. To contribute to this understanding, we performed a comprehensive assessment of soluble and cellular immune features amongst a unique cohort of patients comorbid with ESKD and LTBI. METHODS: We assessed the plasma and cellular immune profiles from patients with and without ESKD and/or LTBI (N = 40). We characterised antibody glycosylation, serum complement and cytokine levels. We also assessed classical and non\\\\classical monocytes and T cells with flow cytometry. Using a systems\\\\based approach, we identified key immunological features that discriminate between the different disease states. RESULTS: Individuals with ESKD exhibited a highly inflammatory plasma profile and an activated cellular state compared with those without ESKD, including higher levels of inflammatory antibody Fc glycosylation structures and activated CX3CR1(+) monocytes that correlate with increased inflammatory plasma cytokines. Similar elevated inflammatory signatures were also observed in ESKD(+)/LTBI(+) compared with ESKD(?)/LTBI(+), suggesting that ESKD induces an overwhelming inflammatory immune state. In contrast, no significant inflammatory differences were observed when comparing LTBI(+) and LTBI(?) individuals. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the highly inflammatory state induced by ESKD.

Methods: By 15 February 2020, 60 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had been admitted to Nanjing Second Hospital. We analyzed the clinical features of different age segments infected with COVID-19 prospectively, including epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics;treatment, clinical outcomes, and prognosis of this cohort of patients. Results: The cohort comprised 29 male and 31 female patients (median age = 46.18 years old (range: 18C97). Fifty-five (91.7%) patients had a clear epidemiological contact history. The average incubation period was 7.92 days. The most common clinical manifestations were fever (85%) and cough (75%). Peripheral white blood cell counts were mostly normal at admission, 7 days, and 14 days, with no differences among patients of different ages. The lymphocyte counts of all patients were in the normal range on admission, and after 7 days and 14 days of treatment;however, the lymphocyte count in > 65-year-old patients was less than that in the < 40 and 40C65-year-old groups after 7 and 14 days of treatment ( P < 0.05, respectively). At admission, the CD4 T lymphocyte count was within the normal range;however, the CD4 T lymphocyte count in >65-year-old group was less than that in the < 40 and 40C65-years-old groups after 14 days of treatment. The CD4 T lymphocyte counts were 723.46  243.82/ml (< 40), 640.00  242.30/ml (40C65), and 399.88  256.16/ml (> 65) ( P =0.0075).

Participants who have been involved in tracheal intubations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were included anonymously after obtaining their informed consent. The primary outcome was the preferred airway device for tracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included the variations in clinical practice including the preferred video laryngoscope, plans for difficult airway management, and personal protective equipment.RESULTS?? 1125 physicians completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 40,9%. Most participants worked in public hospitals and were anesthesiologists.The preferred device for intubation was the video laryngoscope (5.1/6), with the type of device in decreasing order as follows: Glidescope, C-MAC, Airtraq, McGrath and King Vision. The most frequently used device for intubation was the video laryngoscope (70,5%), using them in descending order as follow: the Airtraq, C-MAC, Glidescope, McGrath and King Vision.Discomfort of intubating wearing personal protective equipment and the frequency of breaching a security step was statistically significant, increasing the risk of cross infection between patients and physicians.

To address this gap, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Gujarat, India, during its first epidemic wave and shed light on virus spread in one of the pandemics hardest-hit regions. By integrating regional case data and 434 whole virus genome sequences sampled across 20 districts from March to July 2020, we reconstructed the epidemic dynamics and spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Gujarat, India. Our findings revealed that global and regional connectivity, along with population density, were significant drivers of the Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The three most populous districts in Gujarat accounted [~]84% of total cases during the first wave. Moreover, we detected over 100 virus lineage introductions, which were primarily associated with international travel. Within Gujarat, virus dissemination occurred predominantly from densely populated regions to geographically proximate locations with low-population density.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many teams to review how they provide care to their patients. Due to attempting to reduce the spead of COVID-19, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service within the Northern Health and Social Care Trust largely switched to telephone reviews instead of face-to-face reviews for non-urgent outpatient appointments from March 2020 onwards. The aim of this audit was to establish whether or not service users found telephone reviews to be as useful and therapeutic as the previous standard face-to-face reviews.MethodA questionnaire was used to assess opinions on telephone reviews. Those who were answering the questions were asked to rate their answers on the following scale: not at all, a little, somewhat or a great deal. There was an any other comments section at the end where service users could give detailed opinions on how successful they thought telephone reviews were. A sample of twenty patients was involved. This cohort of twenty patients was a mixture of ten ADHD reviews and ten medication reviews. The audit was conducted by one person and this was done via the telephone.ResultFor questions one to four (which will be fully outlined in the poster), the most popular category chosen was somewhat and this indicates that the majority of patients found telephone reviews somewhat better than face-to-face appointments. For question five (which was- Overall, was the help you received good?), 80% of service users stated that the help that they received was a great deal better than the help that they had received at previous face-to-face appointments. Lastly, for question six (which was- If a friend or family member needed similar help, would you recommend that they are phoned by our service?), 80% of service users said that they would recommend our service a great deal to family members or friends.ConclusionGenerally the feedback was positive for the telephone reviews. However, some still outlined a preference for face-to-face reviews. There may have been bias in this audit as it was the same doctor who did the telephone reviews as conducted the audit. To conclude, telemedicine is likely to become more popular in the future especially as the Coronavirus pandemic is still currently a worldwide problem therefore it is important to explore how service users feel about this as a way of communicating with the clinicians who are treating them.","output":"An audit comparing telephone reviews to standard face-to-face consultations within child and adolescent mental health services at Massereene House"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As its name suggests, critical infrastructure is just that C critical.

All patients developed a small, lateralised, self-healing fistula at the site of the deltopectoral flap 3-point junction. This did not require any intervention, or impact on adjuvant treatment. Functional outcomes were favourable, with all patients achieving oral diet. One patient required gastrostomy diet supplementation, and one patient required stricture dilatation. Of the patients able to receive a speech valve (n=4), all achieved intelligible speech. Two patients could not receive a speech valve due to the inferior extent of the tumour resection, and trachea-oesophageal puncture has been delayed in 2 patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Dual flap reconstruction of circumferential pharyngeal defects represents a simple, effective option for a complex reconstructive problem. The predictable operative recovery and favourable functional outcomes indicate that the use of both a deltopectoral flap and a second flap is a robust reconstructive solution.","output":"Deltopectoral flap reconstruction of the posterior pharyngeal wall -- a simple and functional solution to the reconstruction of circumferential laryngopharyngeal defects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: When prescriptions are being processed in pharmacies and an activity occurs that requires the return to a previous procedural step to correct the process, this is known as rework' (1). This may include labelling errors or the incorrect dispensing of medications, and ultimately adds to pharmacists' workload. Given that increasing community pharmacists' workload negatively affects their job satisfaction, well-being, and patient care, it is vital that rework is minimised in everyday practice. To date, little is known regarding the prevalence of this rework phenomenon in community pharmacies or how this might be prevented. Aim: To evaluate the cause and frequency of prescription rework in community pharmacies. Methods: A data collection form was created for community pharmacists to self-record the instances and causes of prescription rework occurring in their workplace across a two-week period. After piloting the form with two pharmacists in different pharmacies, community pharmacists in Ireland were invited to participate in the study using convenience sampling and snowballing. Only participating pharmacists were aware of when data collection was occurring in their pharmacy to minimise the Hawthorne effect with other staff (2). Descriptive statistics were used to describe rework frequency according to the different causes, as well as the pharmacist and pharmacy characteristics. Results: Eight participating pharmacists were recruited (four male and four female;median 4 years' post-qualification experience) from five independent pharmacies and three chain pharmacies. In total, 325 reworks were recorded across 65 days between June 2021 and August 2021. Rework was recorded on 92.9% of the study days, with an average of 5 reworks/day - whereby the average per pharmacist ranged from 1.82 to 15 reworks/day. The data collection form's pre-specified rework categories captured 91.7% of reworks, with the remainder assigned as other'. The three most frequent rework categories were those due to labelling errors (22.8%), prepared prescriptions which required opening and repackaging (15.1%), and medication owed to patients (13.9%). The people involved in reworks included: pharmacists alone (33.5%), technicians alone (20.3%), pharmacists and technicians (14.8%), pharmacists and patients (10.2%), and pharmacists and prescribers (4%). Conclusion: This study shows that rework happens regularly in community pharmacies and has provided an insight into the causes of rework in this setting. While individual pharmacist and pharmacy characteristics may have influenced rework frequency, it was not possible to conclusively establish these associations with the small sample size, due to the difficulty of recruiting pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are valuable as they highlight areas where pharmacy staff can reduce rework and will help inform strategies to minimise this in future - thus reducing workload and facilitating more time for staff to focus on providing care to patients in community pharmacies.","output":"Determining the Cause and Frequency of Prescription Reworks in Community Pharmacies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Producing or sharing Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) is a serious crime fought vigorously by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). When an LEA seizes a computer from a potential producer or consumer of CSEM, they need to analyze the suspect's hard disk's files looking for pieces of evidence. However, a manual inspection of the file content looking for CSEM is a time-consuming task. In most cases, it is unfeasible in the amount of time available for the Spanish police using a search warrant. Instead of analyzing its content, another approach that can be used to speed up the process is to identify CSEM by analyzing the file names and their absolute paths. The main challenge for this task lies behind dealing with short text distorted deliberately by the owners of this material using obfuscated words and user-defined naming patterns. This paper presents and compares two approaches based on short text classification to identify CSEM files. The first one employs two independent supervised classifiers, one for the file name and the other for the path, and their outputs are later on fused into a single score. Conversely, the second approach uses only the file name classifier to iterate over the file's absolute path. Both approaches operate at the character n-grams level, while binary and orthographic features enrich the file name representation, and a binary Logistic Regression model is used for classification. The presented file classifier achieved an average class recall of 0.98. This solution could be integrated into forensic tools and services to support Law Enforcement Agencies to identify CSEM without tackling every file's visual content, which is computationally much more highly demanding.","output":"Short Text Classification Approach to Identify Child Sexual Exploitation Material"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rages across the world, killing hundreds of thousands and infecting millions, researchers are racing against time to elucidate the viral genome.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development; if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not differ between virus genera, but does vary with host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. This is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their bat origins. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","output":"Intra-genome variability in the dinucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pendidikan pada masa pandemi memberikan pengalaman berbeda bagi pendidik maupun siswa.

This study investigated the feasibility and outcome of performing localized sigmoidectomy in its entirety via NOTES. METHODS A survival study of five male minipigs (mean weight, 30 kg) was conducted. After anesthesia, a gastrotomy was created by a per os double-channel endoscope, and full peritoneoscopy was performed. A Berci needle then was inserted transparietally to allow maintenance and monitoring of the pneumoperitoneum. Using a transanal probe to facilitate intestinal retraction, the mesentery was dissected with instruments worked through the channels of the transgastric endoscope. The anvil of a circular stapler then was passed per anum into the colon above the point of intended transection. A penetrating transrectal trocar was placed to allow entry of a linear stapler into the peritoneum through a colotomy, and the sigmoid was cross-stapled proximally. The strut of the anvil then was snugged into a colotomy made at this staple line. The specimen was delivered via the anus by a \\"pull-through\\" technique. The distal sigmoidal margin was cross-stapled extracorporeally, ensuring that the colotomy was included within the specimen. Retrograde passage of the circular stapler head per anus allowed colocolonic reanastomosis by its mating with the anvil already in situ. The gastrotomy was closed with a previously validated prosthesis. Postoperatively, all the animals were recovered and monitored for well-being during convalescence. Endoscopy (gastroscopy and sigmoidoscopy), laparoscopy, and laparotomy were performed on postoperative day 14 as follow-up measures. RESULTS Each operation was satisfactorily completed. The mean operative time was 76 min (range, 44-95 min). All the animals prospered postoperatively. Follow-up examination showed full healing of all anastomoses and gastrotomy sites. There was no evidence of luminal stricturing, peritonitis, or intraabdominal sepsis in any animal.

Adult-onset Stills disease (AOSD) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by life-threatening complications. Systemic hyperinflammation and cytokine storm play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and AOSD. We aimed to compare the similarities and differences focusing on ferritin and cytokine levels between severe COVID-19 and active AOSD. A literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to collect the levels of cytokine including IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-, IL-10, and ferritin in severe COVID-19 patients. After extracting available data of indicators of interest, we acquired these statistics with a single-arm meta-analysis. Furthermore, a comparison was conducted between 52 patients with active AOSD in our center and severe COVID-19 patients from databases. The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in severe COVID-19 compared with those in active AOSD. There were no significant differences on the cytokine of IL-1 and TNF-. Fold changes of IL-18 were defined as the mean expression level ratio of severe COVID-19 to healthy controls in the COVID-19 study and active AOSD to healthy controls in our study, individually. Although the fold change of IL-18 in patients with AOSD was significantly higher than patients with severe COVID-19 (fold change: 594.00 vs 2.17), there was no statistical comparability. In addition, the level of ferritin was higher in active AOSD in comparison with severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that severe COVID-19 and active AOSD have differences in cytokine panel and ferritin level, indicating the pathogenic role of ferritin in overwhelming inflammation.

Despite some advances in drug treatments of medical complications in the later stages of the disease, the pandemic's death toll is tragic, as no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is currently available. By using a systems approach, we identify the host-encoded pathway, which provides ribonucleotides to viral RNA synthesis, as a possible target. We show that methotrexate, an FDA-approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.","output":"Methotrexate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus replication \\"in vitro\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering routine clinical care.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Participants were 513 pancreatic cancer cases and 1020 matched controls. Concentrations of 22 POPs were measured in plasma collected at baseline. RESULTS: Some associations were observed at higher concentrations of p, p-DDT, trans-nonachlor, -hexachlorocyclohexane and the sum of six organochlorine pesticides and of 16 POPs. The odds ratio (OR) for the upper quartile of trans-nonachlor was 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.26; P for trend = 0.025). Associations were stronger in the groups predefined as most valid (participants having fasted >6 h, with microscopic diagnostic confirmation, normal weight, and never smokers), and as most relevant (follow-up 10 years). Among participants having fasted >6 h, the ORs were relevant for 10 of 11 exposures. Higher ORs were also observed among cases with microscopic confirmation than in cases with a clinical diagnosis, and among normal-weight participants than in the rest of participants. Among participants with a follow-up 10 years, estimates were higher than in participants with a shorter follow-up (for trans-nonachlor: OR = 2.14, 1.01 to 4.53, P for trend = 0.035). Overall, trans-nonachlor, three PCBs and the two sums of POPs were the exposures most clearly associated with pancreatic cancer risk.

Fatal cases of measles in Sri Lanka are rare after implementation of the National Immunization Programme in 1984. Thereafter 0.1% case fatality rate was observed during October 1999CJune 2000 which is a very low figure compared to other regional countries. Immunization guidelines were further revised in 2001, 2011 and in 2012 when additional immunization was recommended to age group 4C21 years; who are likely to have inadequate immunization, in order to achieve elimination of Measles by 2020. However, in 2013C2014, 4690 cases were reported and the majority were children less than 1 year of age. The occurrence in adults is hard to retrieve in published epidemiological reports, however had been 38% (out of 1008 patients) in the 3rd quarter of 2013. During this outbreak 73/101 (72%) reported from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka had been more than 12 years of age with 50% being more than 29 years. 14 Sri lankan adult patients [median age 32 years (range 25C48)] who presented sporadically from June 2014 to March 2016, with confirmed measles infection were enrolled retrospectively after informed consent. Details with regards to their clinical presentation, immunization and other relevant areas were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire or using patient management records. RESULTS: The patients presented with high fever, headache, severe body aches, sore throat, dry cough, intense tearing, red eyes and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy over 3C5 days duration. Later they developed discrete maculopapular rash helping the diagnosis. They had a variable degree of leucopenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia and derangements in the liver functions mimicking any other acute febrile illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, leptospirosis or Zika virus infection. CONCLUSION: At least a 3C5 day delay in the diagnosis was observed (even after the appearance of the rash in some patients), due to non-awareness of its occurrence, unfamiliarity of measles in adults, non-specific nature of the illness and non-availability of rapid diagnostics, risking transmission to the immune-compromised or non-immune staff or patients. Identification of the source of infection in these sporadic adult cases and their virologic surveillance and molecular epidemiology will be important to interrupt the transmission and to achieve the targeted elimination of measles from Sri Lanka by 2020.","output":"Sporadic cases of adult measles: a research article"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores functional and structural resilience in outcomes-based public service partnerships.

However, the effect of DCT on pandemic mitigation remains to be demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: To estimate key populations and performance indicators along the exposure notification cascade of the SwissCovid DCT app in a clearly defined regional and temporal context. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study was based on a simulation informed by measured data from issued quarantine recommendations and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results after DCT exposure notifications in the canton of Zurich. A stochastic model was developed to re-create the DCT notification cascade for Zurich. Population sizes at each cascade step were estimated using triangulation based on publicly available administrative and observational research data for the study duration from September 1 to October 31, 2020. The resultant estimates were checked for internal consistency and consistency with upstream or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic sampling from data-informed parameter distributions was performed to explore the robustness of results. Subsequently, key performance indicators were evaluated to assess the potential contribution of DCT compared with manual contact tracing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receiving a voluntary quarantine recommendation and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result after exposure notification. RESULTS: In September 2020, 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in Zurich, 324 of whom received and entered an upload authorization code. This code triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 (95% simulation interval [SI], 932-2586) proximity contacts and led to 722 information hotline calls, with an estimated 170 callers (95% SI, 154-186) receiving a quarantine recommendation. An estimated 939 (95% SI, 720-1127) notified app users underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 30 (95% SI, 23-36) had positive results after an app notification. Key indicator evaluations revealed that the DCT app triggered quarantine recommendations for the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. For every 10.9 (95% SI, 7.6-15.6) upload authorization codes entered in the app, 1 contact had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 after app notification. Longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrated bottlenecks in the notification cascade, because capacity limits were reached owing to an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in October 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation study of the notification cascade of the SwissCovid DCT app, receipt of exposure notifications was associated with quarantine recommendations and identification of SARS-CoV-2Cpositive cases. These findings in notified proximity contacts reflect important intermediary steps toward transmission prevention.","output":"A Data-Driven Simulation of the Exposure Notification Cascade for Digital Contact Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in Zurich, Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world continues to grapple with the devastating effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The CC bioresorption rate was assessed using morphometric analysis to determine the internal and external capsule thickness, inflammatory reaction degree, presence of neovessels, and endothelial cell layer. Results: A total of 27 VGs were explanted from 25 patients because of infection (n = 5; 18.5%), thrombosis (n = 7; 25.9%), stenosis (n = 2; 7.4%), rupture (n = 4; 14.8%), aneurysmal degeneration (n = 3; 11.1%), revascularization (n = 4; 14.8%), or another cause (n = 2; 7.4%), with a median implantation duration of 291 days (interquartile range [IQR], 48-911 days). VGs with remaining CC (n = 7; 26%) had been explanted earlier than had those without (n = 20; 74%; 1 day [IQR, 1-45 days] vs 516 days [IQR, 79-2018 days]; P = .001).

Methods: Implementation of a diabetes co-management service under the direction of the University of North Carolina division of endocrinology was initiated in July 2019.

Conclusion: Automatic consults for COVID-19 patients ensure that patients with serious illness receive specialized diabetes care. Transitioning to virtual care models does not limit the glycemic outcomes of inpatient diabetes care and should be employed to reduce patient and provider exposure in the setting of COVID-19.

Most of these deaths occur on hospital wards after the surgery itself. We aimed to assess whether enhanced postoperative surveillance of adult surgical patients at high risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality in Africa could reduce 30-day in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a two-arm, open-label, cluster-randomised trial of hospitals (clusters) across Africa. Hospitals were eligible if they provided surgery with an overnight postoperative admission. Hospitals were randomly assigned through minimisation in recruitment blocks (1:1) to provide patients with either a package of enhanced postoperative surveillance interventions (admitting the patient to higher care ward, increasing the frequency of postoperative nursing observations, assigning the patient to a bed in view of the nursing station, allowing family members to stay in the ward, and placing a postoperative surveillance guide at the bedside) for those at high risk (ie, with African Surgical Outcomes Study Surgical Risk Calculator scores 10) and usual care for those at low risk (intervention group), or for all patients to receive usual postoperative care (control group). Health-care providers and participants were not masked, but data assessors were. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality of patients at low and high risk, measured at the participant level. All analyses were done as allocated (by cluster) in all patients with available data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03853824. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2019, and July 27, 2020, 594 eligible hospitals indicated a desire to participate across 33 African countries; 332 (56%) were able to recruit participants and were included in analyses. We allocated 160 hospitals (13 275 patients) to provide enhanced postoperative surveillance and 172 hospitals (15 617 patients) to provide standard care. The mean age of participants was 371 years (SD 155) and 20 039 (694%) of 28 892 patients were women. 30-day in-hospital mortality occurred in 169 (13%) of 12 970 patients with mortality data in the intervention group and in 193 (13%) of 15 242 patients with mortality data in the control group (relative risk 096, 95% CI 069C133; p=079). 45 (02%) of 22 031 patients at low risk and 309 (56%) of 5500 patients at high risk died. No harms associated with either intervention were reported. INTERPRETATION: This intervention package did not decrease 30-day in-hospital mortality among surgical patients in Africa at high risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality. Further research is needed to develop interventions that prevent death from surgical complications in resource-limited hospitals across Africa.

Although most psychiatric disorders have highly overlapping genetic and pathogenic backgrounds, most studies investigating the impact of the pandemic have examined only single psychiatric disorders. It is necessary to examine longitudinal trajectories of factors that modulate psychiatric states across multiple dimensions. About 2274 Japanese citizens participated in online surveys presented in December 2019 (before the pandemic), August 2020, Dec 2020, and April 2021. These surveys included nine questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. Multidimensional psychiatric time-series data were then decomposed into four principal components. We used generalized linear models to identify modulating factors for the effects of the pandemic on these components. The four principal components can be interpreted as a general psychiatric burden, social withdrawal, alcohol-related problems, and depression/anxiety. Principal components associated with general psychiatric burden and depression/anxiety peaked during the initial phase of the pandemic. They were further exacerbated by the economic burden the pandemic imposed. In contrast, principal components associated with social withdrawal showed a delayed peak, with human relationships as an important risk modulating factor. In addition, being female was a risk factor shared across all components. Our results show that COVID-19 has imposed a large and varied burden on the Japanese population since the commencement of the pandemic. Although components related to the general psychiatric burden remained elevated, peak intensities differed between components related to depression/anxiety and those related to social withdrawal.

A total of 51 BCS were studied over an 18-week period and had an objective registration of day-to-day sedentary time, physical activity, and sleep. Both subsamples received weekly or fortnight personal feedback. Data were analysed considering four key periods, according to the COVID-19 emergency steps. Results: Statistical analysis showed an additive effect for sedentary time and a multiplicative effect both for light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities. The E(?) group had a high overall sedentary time and a different trend of light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities, with a reduction from the 1st to the 2nd periods (national and personal restrictions), showing a significant rise just at the end of the national restrictions. Conclusions: The use of an activity tracker and its accompanying app, with the reception of weekly tailored advice and supervised online physical exercise sessions, can elicit proper physical activity recomposition in BCS in the COVID-19 era.","output":"Effects of Activity Tracker-Based Counselling and Live-Web Exercise on Breast Cancer Survivors during Italy COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With increased litigation and media attention around the consent process it is vital we ensure patients understand what their operation entails prior to surgery. North Bristol Trust has recently started using EIDO consent leaflets; currently used in 50% of NHS hospitals . Our aim was to calculate how many patients received EIDO healthcare consent leaflets and whether this affected their experience of the consent process. METHOD: Questionnaires made up of Likert scale and open ended questions were distributed to patients undergoing Upper GI surgery on the day of their operation. The questionnaire explored whether patients received an EIDO leaflet pre-operatively, their understanding of the risks and benefits and their satisfaction with the consent process. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare responses from the included patients. RESULTS: 12 patients received EIDO leaflets during their pre-operative consultation, six did not. Compared with those that did not, patients who received a leaflet had a better understanding of the risks (p = 0.002), benefits (p = 0.008) and details of the operation (p = 0.005) and were happier with the consent process (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Including EIDO leaflets in the consent process helps ensure patients making an informed decision and improves the smooth running of theatre lists. We are currently introducing EIDO consent leaflets throughout general surgery for emergency operations and when sending out dates of elective operations. We aim to review the use of these leaflets as the consent process becomes increasingly difficult due to COVID 19 and the lack of face to face interaction.","output":"P96 Project Consent: Introducing EIDO leaflets to improve patient experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJD) in COVID-19 confirmed patients before and after adjustments for risk factors such as fibromyalgia, nocturnal bruxism, and anxiety disorders. METHODS: The i2b2 database was used to query searches of patient records at University of Florida Health Centers. Queries were submitted for the number of total hospital patients, TMJD cases, COVID-19 cases, and TMJD with COVID-19 cases from December 2019 to July 2021. Additional searches excluded fibromyalgia, nocturnal bruxism, and anxiety to examine their prevalence as risk factors. RESULTS: Out of the 548,646 total hospital patients, 86 had a diagnosis of both COVID-19 and TMJD, 14,836 had only COVID-19, and 1,856 had only TMJD. The odds ratio (OR) for having TMJD with COVID-19 was 1.7, with around 80% of TMJD occurring in young adult females. Excluding fibromyalgia and nocturnal bruxism did not change the OR. Anxiety was present in 37% of COVID-19 with TMJD cases and exclusion of this population significantly diminished the odds ratio to 1.08. These results demonstrate a correlation between COVID-19 and TMJD that dissolves when adjusting for stress. Thus, anxiety is a significant factor in the prevalence of TMJD in COVID-19 patients. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: COVID-19 positive patients demonstrate an increased risk of developing TMJD, with a correlation to stress and anxiety that should be addressed during treatment.","output":"Increased occurrence of temporomandibular joint disorders in COVID-19 confirmed patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, first in China and then also in Italy, brought to the attention the problem of the saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Almost all previous reports showed that in ICU less than half of patients were treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and the rest of them with non-invasive respiratory support. This highlighted the role of respiratory intensive care units (RICUs), where patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure can be treated with non-invasive respiratory support, avoiding ICU admission. In this report, we describe baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of 97 patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 admitted to the RICU of the Policlinico of Bari from March 11(th) to May 31(st) 2020. In our population, most of the subjects were male (72%), non-smokers (76%), with a mean age of 69.6514 years. Ninety-one percent of patients presented at least one comorbidity and 60% had more than two comorbidities. At admission, 40% of patients showed PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio between 100 and 200 and 17% showed Pa0(2)/FiO(2) ratio <100. Mean Pa0(2)/FiO(2) ratio at admission was 186.480. These patients were treated with non-invasive respiratory support 40% with CPAP, 38% with BPAP, 3% with HFNC, 11% with standard oxygen therapy or with IMV through tracheostomy (patients in step down from ICU, 8%). Patients discharged to general ward (GW) were 51%, 30% were transferred to ICU and 19% died. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few described experiences of patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 treated outside the ICU, in a RICU. Outcomes of our patients, characterized by several risk factors for disease progression, were satisfactory compared with other experiences regarding patients treated with non-invasive respiratory support in ICU. The strategical allocation of our RICU, between ED and ICU, might have positively influenced clinical outcomes of our patients.","output":"Baseline characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) in Southern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with an asparagine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 501 (N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) show enhanced infectivity compared to wild-type, resulting in an altered pandemic situation in affected areas. These SARS-Cov-2 variants comprise the two Alpha variants (B.1.1.7, United Kingdom and B.1.1.7 with the additional E484K mutation), the Beta variant (B.1.351, South Africa), and the Gamma variant (P.1, Brazil). Understanding the binding modalities between these viral variants and the host cell receptor ACE2 allows to depict changes, but also common motifs of virus-host cell interaction. The trimeric spike protein expressed at the viral surface contains the RBD that forms the molecular interface with ACE2. All the above-mentioned variants carry between one and three amino acid exchanges within the interface-forming region of the RBD, thereby altering the binding interface with ACE2. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and decomposition of intermolecular contacts between the RBD and ACE2, we identified phenylalanine 486, glutamine 498, threonine 500, and tyrosine 505 as important interface-forming residues across viral variants. However, especially the N501Y exchange increased contact formation for this residue and also induced some local conformational changes. Comparing here, the in silico generated B.1.1.7 RBD-ACE2 complex with the now available experimentally solved structure reveals very similar behavior during MD simulation. We demonstrate, how computational methods can help to identify differences in conformation as well as contact formation for newly emerging viral variants. Altogether, we provide extensive data on all N501Y expressing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with respect to their interaction with ACE2 and how this induces reshaping of the RBD-ACE2 interface.","output":"Computational decomposition reveals reshaping of the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interface among viral variants expressing the N501Y mutation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human societies are collective brains. People within every society have cultural brainsbrains that have evolved to selectively seek out adaptive knowledge and socially transmit solutions. Innovations emerge at a population level through the transmission of serendipitous mistakes, incremental improvements and novel recombinations. The rate of innovation through these mechanisms is a function of (1) a society's size and interconnectedness (sociality), which affects the number of models available for learning; (2) fidelity of information transmission, which affects how much information is lost during social learning; and (3) cultural trait diversity, which affects the range of possible solutions available for recombination. In general, and perhaps surprisingly, all three levers can increase and harm innovation by creating challenges around coordination, conformity and communication. Here, we focus on the paradox of diversitythat cultural trait diversity offers the largest potential for empowering innovation, but also poses difficult challenges at both an organizational and societal level. We introduce cultural evolvability as a framework for tackling these challenges, with implications for entrepreneurship, polarization and a nuanced understanding of the effects of diversity.

However, to date, quantitative research that has investigated the strategies online groomers employ to gain their victim's trust is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To this end, the main aim of this study was to distinguish and measure different strategies of the online grooming process by developing and examining the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Online Grooming Questionnaire (MOGQ). We also analyzed the prevalence of different strategies of online grooming among a sample of minors and their associations with grooming outcomes (i.e., online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The sample consisted of 1704 participants between 12 and 15 years of age (864 girls; Mage = 13.77, SD = 1.13). METHODS: Examination of the structure of the MOGQ was accomplished using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). For this purpose, the sample was randomly divided into two subsamples. RESULTS: EFA and CFA showed a structure composed of five factors, including Use of Deception, Gift giving, Study of victim's environment, Sexualization, and Aggression. Second, the analysis of the relationship of online grooming with grooming outcomes (online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety) provided evidence for the concurrent validity of the instrument. Finally, the prevalence of grooming strategies within the sample ranged between 7% for aggression to 18% for interest in the victim's environment. Overall grooming strategies were more prevalent for girls than boys and increased with age. CONCLUSION: Distinguishing between different strategies of online grooming is recommended in order to advance research and the prevention of this type of child abuse.","output":"Unraveling cyber sexual abuse of minors: Psychometrics properties of the Multidimensional Online Grooming Questionnaire and prevalence by sex and age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND China is ranked 42nd on the Global Terrorism Index (2019), a scoring system of terrorist activities. While China has a relatively low terrorism risk, events globally have wide-ranging repercussions for future attacks, putting first responders and emergency health workers at risk. This study aims to provide the epidemiological context for the past decade detailing the unique injury types responders are likely to encounter and to develop training programs utilizing these data. METHODS The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks in China between the years 2008-2018. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD's Codebook. Ambiguous events, as defined by the GTD's Codebook, were excluded. English language grey literature was searched to ensure no events meeting these criteria were missed. A focused search of online English language newspaper articles was also performed for any terrorist events between 2008-2018. RESULTS One-hundred and eight terrorist events occurred in the study time period. Of the 108 incidents, forty-seven (43.5%) involved Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite (E/B/D) only, with an average fatality count of 2.9 and injury count of 7.5 per event. Twenty-seven (25.0%) used bladed or blunt weapons in melees with an average fatality count of 9.7 and an injury count of 8.8 per event. Five (4.6%) involved incendiary weapons with an average fatality count of 2.4 and an injury count of 7.2 per event. Two used only chemical weapons (1.8%) with no recorded deaths and an injury count of 27.0 per event. Two events had unknown weapon types (1.8%) with one recorded death and no injury count. One event used a firearm (0.9%) and led to one death and no injuries. One event used a vehicle (0.9%), which also led to one death and no recorded injuries. Twenty-three attacks used a mix of weapons (21.2%) with an average fatality count of 17.1 and an injury count of 12.0 per event. CONCLUSIONS One-hundred and eight terrorist attacks were recorded between 2008-2018 on Chinese soil using well-understood modalities. This resulted in a total of 809 recorded fatalities with 956 non-fatal injuries. The most commonly chosen methodology was E/B/D, followed by melees and the use of bladed weapons.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate demographical, clinical, and microbiological factors which could favor the presence of influenza viral RNA in the stools of patients with laboratory\\\\confirmed influenza infection. METHODS: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) patients were enrolled by general practitioners (GP) during two winter seasons (2014\\\\2016). Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens, and clinical data were collected. Samples were tested for 12 respiratory pathogen groups (nasopharyngeal and stool specimens) and for 12 enteric pathogens (stool specimens). RESULTS: Among the 331 patients with ARI enrolled by GP, 114 (34.4%) presented influenza infection. Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 21% (24/114) of the 114 stool specimens analyzed. Hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI)) [1.7\\\\33.7], P = .02), age between 45 and 64 years (aOR = 4.8 [1.7\\\\14.5], P = .01), consumption of raw shellfish and/or mollusks (aOR = 16.7 [3.6\\\\90.9], P = .00), and use of antibiotics (aOR = 6.4 [2.1\\\\19.8], P = .006) or antiviral treatment (aOR = 7.4 [1.9\\\\29], P = .01) were significantly associated with an increased odds of the detection of influenza RNA in stools.

Participants and Setting14392 participants were recruited from 24 testing facilities across Bangladesh between June, and November 2020. All participants had a previously confirmed positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and reported persistent symptoms and difficulties in performing daily activities. Main Outcome MeasuresParticipants who consented, were contacted by face-to-face interview, and were interviewed regarding LCS, and restriction of activities of daily living using Post COVID-19 functional scale. Cardio-respiratory parameters were also measured. ResultsAmong 2198 participants, the prevalence of LCS at 12 weeks was 16.1%. Overall, eight LCS were identified and in descending order of prominence are: fatigue, pain, dyspnea, cough, anosmia, appetite loss, headache, and chest pain. COVID survivors experienced between 1 to 5 LCS with an overall duration period of 21.8 {+/-} 5.2 weeks. SEM predicted the length of LCS to be related to younger age, female gender, rural residence, prior functional limitation and smoking. ConclusionIn this cohort of survivors, at 31 weeks post diagnosis, the prevalence of LCS was 16.1%.

Using a mixed methods approach, including an online text analysis tool, we demonstrate that document title and structure, word frequencies, word choice, and website presentation did not provide a balanced account of the complexity and uncertainty surrounding school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite available scientific guidance and practical evidence-based advice on how to manage infection risks when reopening schools, the CDC Statement was intentionally overriding possible parent and public health concerns.

METHODS: A prospective case series included all staff on-site involved in the Football Club World Cup. The tournament was conducted within bubbles. All personnel travelling to the tournament were required to be in possession of a negative RT-PCR test within 72 hours of arrival and subjected to a testing schedule during the tournament. Each location was assigned a COVID-19 protocol enforcement officer to ensure adherence to regular testing, hygiene measures, physical distancing and daily symptom reporting (via ScribePro app). RESULTS: The study involved 70 recruited staff with a combined 1321 test days on the symptom checker app. The mean number of days completed on the symptom checker app was 18.87 days (range: 7C28). Of the five questions asked as part of the daily symptom checker, only one was answered positively (0.015%). This individual was isolated, assessed within 20 min and tested. The initial diagnosis was likely a non-COVID-19-related viral illness. Further testing returned three negative tests during the remainder of the tournament. CONCLUSIONS: There was no person-to-staff transmission of COVID-19 during the tournament within our sample.

While prior acupuncture studies are promising as an alternative opioid-sparing approach to pain reduction, successful conduct of a multi-center pilot study is needed to prepare for a future definitive randomized control trial (RCT). METHODS: Acupuncture in the Emergency Department for Pain Management (ACUITY) is funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. The objectives are to: conduct a multi-center feasibility RCT, examine feasibility of data collection, develop/deploy a manualized acupuncture intervention and assess feasibility/implementation (barrier/facilitators) in 3 EDs affiliated with the BraveNet Practice Based Research Network. Adults presenting to a recruiting ED with acute non-emergent pain (e.g., musculoskeletal, back, pelvic, noncardiac chest, abdominal, flank or head) of 4 on a 0-10-point Numeric Rating Scale will be eligible. ED participants (n = 165) will be equally randomized to Acupuncture or Usual Care. At pre-, post-, and discharge time-points, patients will self-assess pain and anxiety using the Numeric Rating Scale. Pain, anxiety, post-ED opioid use and adverse events will be assessed at 1 and 4 weeks. Opioid utilization in the ED and discharge prescriptions will be extracted from patients electronic medical records. Acupuncture recipients will asked to participate in a brief qualitative interview about 3 weeks after their discharge. ED providers and staff will also be interviewed about their general perspectives/experiences related to acupuncture in the ED and implementation of acupuncture in ACUITY. RESULTS: Recruitment began on 5/3/21. As of 12/7/21: 84 patients have enrolled, the responsive acupuncture intervention has been developed and deployed, and 26 qualitative interviews have been conducted.

As we show, each form of eventfulness constructs a different temporal landscape, populated by different actors and actions, entailing different stances towards the future and different kinds of projects.

The most common pathological hallmark of these age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of specific proteins, including amyloid beta (A), tau, -synuclein (-syn), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) peptides, in the intra- and extracellular spaces of selected brain regions. Whereas it remains controversial whether these accumulations are pathogenic or merely a byproduct of disease, the majority of therapeutic research has focused on clearing protein aggregates. Immunotherapies have garnered particular attention for their ability to target specific protein strains and conformations as well as promote clearance. Immunotherapies can also be neuroprotective: by neutralizing extracellular protein aggregates, they reduce spread, synaptic damage, and neuroinflammation.

We aimed to categorically test the efficacy and fit of potential N95 respirator substitutes using protocols that can be replicated in university laboratories. SETTING: Academic medical centre with occupational health-supervised fit testing along with laboratory studies. PARTICIPANTS: Seven adult volunteers who passed quantitative fit testing for small-sized (n=2) and regular-sized (n=5) commercial N95 respirators. METHODS: Five open-source potential N95 respirator substitutes were evaluated and compared with commercial National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 respirators as controls. Fit testing using the 7-minute standardised Occupational Safety and Health Administration fit test was performed. In addition, protocols that can be performed in university laboratories for materials testing (filtration efficiency, air resistance and fluid resistance) were developed to evaluate alternate filtration materials. RESULTS: Among five open-source, improvised substitutes evaluated in this study, only one (which included a commercial elastomeric mask and commercial HEPA filter) passed a standard quantitative fit test. The four alternative materials evaluated for filtration efficiency (67%C89%) failed to meet the 95% threshold at a face velocity (7.6 cm/s) equivalent to that of a NIOSH particle filtration test for the control N95 FFR. In addition, for all but one material, the small surface area of two 3D-printed substitutes resulted in air resistance that was above the maximum in the NIOSH standard.

The model is based on the infection multiplier, R0, defined as the number of people infected by each infectious person. The infection rate increases exponentially when R0 >1.0; it remains constant at R0 = 1.0 and decreases for R0 < 1.0. R0 is determined by population behavior (frequency and proximity of interactions) and the ease by which a victim is infected by an infectious person (virulence of the virus). It is reduced by herd immunity when a large fraction of the population acquires immunity by vaccination or by recovering from infection. The daily death rates in the U.S. and northern Europe exhibited peaks in April/May 2020 and Dec. 2020/Jan. 2021 with more a modest rate during the summer of 2020 and a gradually decreasing rate since Jan. 2021. The model produces this type of oscillatory response if it assumes that the populations R0 responds to information reported about the pandemic, but with a delay between infections and resulting behavioral adjustments. Oscillatory behavior is typical of a control loop with delay in its feedback. The analysis concludes thatO_QDGiven the history of R0 the model predicts the development of pandemic deaths. However, since R0 is determined by the populations behavior, control of the pandemic in democracies depends primarily on preparation and the persuasive power of political and scientific authorities. Data for S. Korea and New Zealand demonstrate the effectiveness of such methods. For each death in the U.S. about 169 persons were infected, but fewer than half of them were identified as cases. The pandemic was prolonged in the U.S. because the population chose to keep R0 near 1.0 by relaxing restrictions once the death rate subsided. Initial values of R0 as high as 5.0 were observed, leading to infections doubling about every 2 days. If unabated, the resulting exponential growth increases the infected population by a factor of about 5000 before the death from the first infections is recorded. Arrival from Italy probably initiated the pandemic in the eastern U.S., but, by the time the first death was recorded the number of domestic infections exceeded by far those that were imported. Import restrictions beyond this point are ineffective except in delaying the arrival of more virulent mutations. If no social restrictions had been adopted, approximately 1.6 million deaths would have resulted in the U.S. The vaccine, although developed and deployed at record speed, was too late to ameliorate this result.

This review aims to systematically combine and evaluate the available literature of the prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with AECOPD, detected by PCR. METHODS: An electronic search strategy was performed on PubMed and Embase and reference lists were screened for eligible studies. Cross-sectional, prospective studies and case-control studies were included. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of respiratory viruses (adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, EBV, hMPV, influenza, parainfluenza, rhino-/enterovirus, RSV) in respiratory secretions of patients during an AECOPD. Secondary outcomes were the odds of the presence of the viruses in different respiratory secretions and the odds of the presence of viruses in upper and lower respiratory tract (URT/LRT) samples. RESULTS: Nineteen studies with 1728 patients were included. Rhino-/enteroviruses (16.39%), RSV (9.90%) and influenza (7.83%) were the most prevalent viruses detected with lower detection rates of coronaviruses (4.08%) and parainfluenza (3.35%). Adenovirus (2.07%), hMPV (2.78%) and bocaviruses (0.56%) appear to be rare causative agents of AECOPD. Definitive conclusions regarding the role of EBV cannot be made. Seven of the eight analyzed viruses had a higher prevalence in LRT samples. Coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the URT.

This GEV distribution is then used to calculate the reporting delays of incomplete data points. The calculation of the daily value of $R_t$ between the end of February and the end of October showed a similar course of the reproductive rate compared to the nationwide figures.

DESIGN: In a cross-sectional analytic sample of 524 foreign-born Asian adults, aged 18 years and older, we conducted multivariable logistic regression and multivariable negative binomial regression to examine associations between discrimination and HRQOL. Furthermore, potential effect modification was tested by gender, ethnicity, and social support. RESULTS: Associations were found between everyday racial discrimination and days of poor physical health (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 1.05), mental health (IRR = 1.03), and activity limitation (IRR = 1.05). Stronger significant associations were observed between major racial discrimination and days of poor physical health (IRR = 1.21), mental health (IRR = 1.16), and activity limitation (IRR = 1.53), adjusting for all covariates. Racial discrimination was not associated with poor self-rated health. In addition, gender significantly modified the relationship between continuous racial discrimination and activity limitation days with associations of greater magnitude among men, while social support significantly modified the association between categorized major racial discrimination and physically unhealthy days. When stratified, the association was only significant among those with low social support (IRR = 3.04; 95% CI: 1.60, 5.79) as opposed to high social support. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the association between racial discrimination and worse HRQOL among Asian Americans, which can inform future interventions, especially among men and those with low social support, aimed at improving the quality of life in this population.

We focused on the period from the 1880s through the 1920s, when the first wave of widespread and sustained antivaccination activism in this country occurred. During this era, activists used the language of liberty and freedom most prominently in opposition to compulsory vaccination laws, which the activists alleged violated their constitutionally protected rights. Critics attacked vaccination with liberty-based arguments even when it was not mandatory, and they used the language of freedom expansively to encompass individuals' freedom to choose their health and medical practices, freedom to raise their children as they saw fit, and freedom from the quasicoercive influence of scientific and medical experts and elite institutions. Evidence suggests that in recent years, vaccine refusal has increasingly been framed as a civil right. We argue that this framing has always lain at the heart of resistance to vaccination and that it may prove consequential for the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.

Based on their structural and functional properties, they employ various strategies to modulate lung barrier function and to impair host defense in order to promote infection. Although in general, these toxins target common cellular signaling pathways and host compartments, toxin- and cell-specific effects have also been reported. Toxins can affect resident pulmonary cells involved in alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and barrier function through impairing vectorial Na+ transport and through cytoskeletal collapse, as such, destroying cell-cell adhesions. The resulting loss of alveolar-capillary barrier integrity and fluid clearance capacity will induce capillary leak and foster edema formation, which will in turn impair gas exchange and endanger the survival of the host. Toxins modulate or neutralize protective host cell mechanisms of both the innate and adaptive immunity response during chronic infection. In particular, toxins can either recruit or kill central players of the lung's innate immune responses to pathogenic attacks, i.e., alveolar macrophages (AMs) and neutrophils. Pulmonary disorders resulting from these toxin actions include, e.g., acute lung injury (ALI), the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), and severe pneumonia. When acute infection converts to persistence, i.e., colonization and chronic infection, lung diseases, such as bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) can arise.

Nevertheless, these vaccines are far from perfect where their efficiency ranges from 65 to 90%; therefore, vaccines are not the one only solution to overcome this situation, and apart from administration of vaccines, the scientific community is at quest for finding alternative solutions to incumber SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56C has been recommended to inactivate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. METHODS: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2, particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times, and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT. RESULTS: Our study showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. CONCLUSION: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.","output":"Potential False-Negative Nucleic Acid Testing Results for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 from Thermal Inactivation of Samples with Low Viral Loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 infection is associated with D-dimer elevations, high rates of thrombus formation, and poor clinical outcomes. We sought to determine if empiric therapeutic anticoagulation (AC) affected survival in COVID-19 patients compared to standard prophylactic AC. Methods Retrospective analysis of 402 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 15 and May 31, 2020 was performed. Clinical outcomes were compared between 152 patients treated with therapeutic AC to 250 patients on prophylactic AC. An elastic net logistic regression was designed to first identify the important variables affecting mortality. These variables were then included as covariates to AC in standard multivariate logistic regression models studying the effect of AC on death. Nonparametric survival analysis was conducted, and Kaplan Meier curves were constructed. Results Increased mortality was associated with therapeutic AC [OR 3.42 (2.06, 5.67)]. The log-rank test was statistically significant at p = 0.001 showing higher mortality for patients treated with therapeutic AC compared to prophylactic AC. Subset analysis of critically ill and intubated patients had similar survival curves regardless of AC dose. The log-rank test was not significant even with Prentice modification. For non-ICU patients, the log rank test favoring prophylactic AC disappeared when the analysis was stratified by D-dimer level less or greater than 3 ug/mL. Approximately 9% of patients receiving therapeutic AC experienced clinically significant bleeding or thrombocytopenia, versus 3% in those receiving prophylactic AC. Conclusions In our cohort, therapeutic anticoagulation provided no mortality benefit over thromboprophylaxis, independent of co-morbidities or disease severity.

Hence, it is necessary to study the effects of land use for oil palm and the linkage between each impact for a holistic understanding. Besides, the consideration of various impact aspects in terms of a nexus is necessary for suggesting appropriate practices or zoning, because a single impact evaluation may not be comprehensive. Therefore, this study assessed the land use impacts from oil palm plantations in the five regions of Thailand. The land use impacts studied were greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, soil quality, and biodiversity. The assessment indicated the southern region to be the most suitable for further expansion of oil palm plantations, which is consistent with the government recommendation. However, if the expansion of oil palm in other regions is necessary, the central region is recommended because of available irrigation supply and better soil fertility compared to other regions. This study found that the land use impacts resulted from unsuitable management of oil palm plantations in the past. The increase of greenhouse gas emissions was mainly due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers for soil quality improvement and water pumping from irrigation water consumption. Meanwhile, the deficiency of water availability led to the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems.

Therefore, various modes/routes of NO-delivery are now being tested in different clinical trials for safer, faster, and more effective interventions against ischemic insults. Intravenous (IV) infusion of S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the major endogenous molecular pool of NO, has been reported to protect against mechanical cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR); however, it has been never tested in any kind of clinically relevant thromboembolic stroke models with or without comorbidities and in combination with the thrombolytic reperfusion therapy. Moreover, IV-effects of higher dose of GSNO following IR-injury have been contradicted to augment stroke injury. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that nebulization of low-dose GSNO will not alter blood pressure (BP) and will mitigate stroke injury in diabetic mice via enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2). GSNO-nebulization (200 g/kgbwt) did not alter BP, but augmented the restoration of CBF, improved behavioral outcomes and reduced stroke injury. Moreover, GSNO-nebulization increased early reoxygenation of brain tissue/PbtO2 as measured at 6.5 h post-stroke following thrombolytic reperfusion, and enervated unwanted effects of late thrombolysis in diabetic stroke. We conclude that the GSNO-nebulization is safe and effective for enhancing collateral microvascular perfusion in the early hours following stroke. Hence, nebulized-GSNO therapy has the potential to be developed and translated into an affordable field therapy against ischemic events including strokes, particularly in developing countries with limited healthcare infrastructure.","output":"Nebulization of Low-Dose S-Nitrosoglutathione in Diabetic Stroke Enhances Benefits of Reperfusion and Prevents Post-Thrombolysis Hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In 2012, a Dog circovirus (DogCV) was discovered in the USA, which was followed by further descriptions of the virus in the USA, Italy and Germany. The present study is the first to examine the prevalence of DogCV in faeces of dogs from Germany and other European countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS Faecal samples from 184 dogs with diarrhoea and from 82 clinically healthy dogs (control group) were analysed for the presence of DogCV by PCR. Furthermore, the detection of parvovirus, coronavirus, Giardia and Cryptosporidium was performed in all samples. RESULTS In the group of dogs with diarrhoea the prevalence of DogCV was 20.1% (37/184), in the healthy control group it was 7.3% (6/82). Therefore, the virus could be detected significantly more frequently in dogs with diarrhoea. The detection frequency of DogCV is comparable with those of the other tested pathogens. In approximately 50% of the DogCV-positive dogs, infections with other enteropathogenic organisms were diagnosed. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The role of co-infection in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear, but there appears to be an association between co-infection and disease severity. Evidence of DogCV in clinically healthy dogs appears important for the epidemiology and raises questions about its pathogenicity. Further studies are needed to clarify questions regarding the pathogenesis, causal relevance and possible interference by other diarrhoeal pathogens. Nevertheless, the results of this study are an important indication that DogCV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with diarrhoea.","output":"[Prevalence of Dog circovirus in healthy and diarrhoeic dogs]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Saudi Arabia is one of the countries facing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The pharmacist is an important stakeholder in the healthcare system who plays a crucial role in avoiding AMR and implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used in this study. The online questionnaire collected data regarding the enablers that have helped in preparing pharmacists to handle AMR and the barriers faced by pharmacy personnel in handling AMR, as well as the strategies used to overcome the identified barriers. RESULTS: A total of 109 participants were included in the study. Just under two thirds (62.4%) of participants were female and the majority (70.6%) worked as pharmacists. Just under half (41.7%) had between 6 and 10 years of work experience. Three quarters (74.3%) had antimicrobial stewardship in place and around the same number (73.4%) were involved in handling infectious disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists have found that preparatory items/tasks, pharmacy college curriculum, pharmacy rotation, years of experience and self-education related to AMR handling to be natural, with a mean of 3.2. The participants found all the barriers C insufficient background, in site education and training, limited time, limited CPD activities, limited educational tools and no free access to relevant clinical journals C to be relevant, with a mean of 4.05.

Although both live-attenuated and killed-inactivated vaccines against the virus have been available for a decade, PRRSV is still a major problem in the swine industry worldwide. To explore the possibility of producing single-round infectious PRRSV replicon particles as a potential vaccine strategy, we have now generated two necessary components: 1) a stable cell line (BHK/Sinrepl9/PRRSV-N) that constitutively expresses the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus and 2) a PRRSV replicon vector (pBAC/PRRSV/Replicon-AN) with a 177-nucleotide deletion, removing the 3-half portion of ORF7 in the viral genome, from which the self-replicating propagation-defective replicon RNAs were synthesized in vitro by SP6 polymerase run-off transcription. Transfection of this replicon RNA into N protein-expressing BHK-21 cells led to the secretion of infectious particles that packaged the replicon RNA, albeit with a low production efficiency of 0.4  10(2) to 1.1  10(2) infectious units/ml; the produced particles had only single-round infectivity with no cell-to-cell spread. This trans-complementation system for PRRSV provides a useful platform for studies to define the packaging signals and motifs present within the viral genome and N protein, respectively, and to develop viral replicon-based antiviral vaccines that will stop the infection and spread of this pathogen.","output":"Packaging of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replicon RNA by a stable cell line expressing its nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing public-health pandemic worldwide.

Initial reports from the early weeks of lockdown in the UK and worldwide suggested that uptake could fall putting children at risk from multiple other infectious diseases. In Scotland and England, enhanced surveillance of national data for childhood immunisations was established to inform and rapidly assess the impact of the pandemic on infant and preschool immunisation uptake rates. Methods and findingsWe undertook an observational study using routinely collected data for the year prior to the pandemic (2019), and immediately before, during and after the first period of the UK lockdown in 2020. Data were obtained for Scotland from the Public Health Scotland \\"COVID19 wider impacts on the health care system\\" dashboard (https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/) and for England from ImmForm. Five vaccinations delivered at different ages were evaluated; three doses of the 6-in-1 DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine and two doses of MMR. Uptake in the periods in 2020 compared to that in the baseline year of 2019 using binary logistic regression analysis. For Scotland, we analysed timely uptake of immunisations, defined as uptake within four weeks of the child becoming eligible by age for each immunisation and data were also analysed by geographical region and indices of deprivation. For both Scotland and England, we assessed whether immunisations were up to date at approximately 6 months (all doses 6-in-1) and 16-18 months (first MMR) of age. We found that uptake rates within four weeks of eligibility in Scotland for all the five vaccine visits were higher during the 2020 lockdown period than in 2019. The difference ranged from 1.3% for the first dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine (95.3 vs 94%, OR 1.28, CI 1.18-1.39) to 14.3% for the second MMR dose (66.1 vs 51.8 %, OR 1.8, CI 1.74-1.87). Significant increases in uptake were seen across all deprivation levels, though, for MMR, there was evidence of greater improvement for children living in the least deprived areas. In England, fewer children who had been due to receive their immunisations during the lockdown period were up to date at 6 months (6-in-1) or 18 months (first dose MMR). The fall in percentage uptake ranged from 0.5% for first 6-in1 (95.8 vs 96.3%, OR 0.89, CI 0.86-0.91) to 2.1% for third 6-in-1 (86.6 vs 88.7%, OR 0.82, CI 0.81-0.83). ConclusionsThis study suggests that the national lockdown in Scotland was associated with a positive effect on timely childhood immunisation uptake, however in England a lower percentage of children were up to date at 6 and 18 months. Reason for the improve uptake in Scotland may include active measures taken to promote immunisation at local and national level during this period. Promoting immunisation uptake and addressing potential vaccine hesitancy is particularly important given the ongoing pandemic and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","output":"Uptake of infant and pre-school immunisations in Scotland and England during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study of routinely collected data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine available for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also uses its receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to engage the host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), facilitating subsequent viral entry. Here we report the immunogenicity and vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS2-RBD)-based recombinant proteins. Immunization with SARS2-RBD recombinant proteins potently induced a multi-functional antibody response in mice. The resulting antisera could efficiently block the interaction between SARS2-RBD and ACE2, inhibit S-mediated cell-cell fusion, and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the anti-RBD sera also exhibited cross binding, ACE2-blockade, and neutralization effects towards SARS-CoV. More importantly, we found that the anti-RBD sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry or authentic virus infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for developing RBD-based subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV2.","output":"Immunization with the receptorCbinding domain of SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV without antibody-dependent enhancement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our melancholy time, rather than grieving for the death of Society, or picking through its bones and squabbling about scraps of its carcass, we should, in a dialectical spirit celebrate the hope of a resurrection of the body politic, and the assimilating, unifying and vivifying spirit of Society, and thereby strive to realize the promise of Sociology.

This exploratory qualitative study evaluates alternatives to the nebulizer and hoods for performing qualitative fit testing. Methods: Four devices were trialled to replace the test kit nebulizer. Two enclosures were tested for their ability to replace the test hood. Three researchers evaluated promising replacements under multiple mask fit conditions to assess functionality and accuracy. Results: The aroma diffuser and smaller enclosures allowed participants to perform qualitative fit tests quickly and with high accuracy. Discussion & Conclusion: Aroma diffusers show significant promise in their ability to allow individuals to quickly, easily, and inexpensively perform qualitative fit testing.

Method: We assessed 103 (54 women, 49 men) participants online in three periods of the epidemic curve: time 1 (T1; first cases of community transmission; March 20 to 25, 2020), time 2 (T2; acceleration; April 15 to 20, 2020) and time 3 (T3; continued acceleration; June 25 to 30, 2020). The criteria adopted for calculating prevalence and incidence was identifying participants with scores two standard deviations above the mean compared to normative data. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), depression was measured using the Filgueiras Depression Index (FDI), and anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Subscale (STAI-S). Results: Initially, 89% of individuals were free of severe stress, anxiety, and depression, which dropped to 35% by T3. Prevalence of stress increased from 1.9% (95% CI [0.5, 6.8]) at T1 to 7.8% (95% CI [4.0, 14.6]) at T2, and 28.2% (95% CI [20.4, 37.5]) at T3. Depression prevalence increased from 0% (95% CI [0, 3.6]) at T1 to 23.3% (95% CI [16.2, 32.3]) at T2 and 25.2% (95% CI [17.8, 34.4]) at T3. The prevalence of severe anxiety-state symptoms increased from 10.7% (95% CI [6.1, 18.1]) at T1 to 11.7% (95% CI [6.8, 19.3]) at T2 and 45.6% (95% CI [36.3, 55.2]) at T3. Stress incidence increased by 7.8% (95% CI = [4, 14.6]) from time 1 to time 2, 23.3% (95% CI [16.2, 32.3]) from time 2 to time 3, and 26.2% (95% CI [18.7, 35.5]) from time 1 to time 3. Depression incidence increased by 23.3% (95% CI [16.2, 32.3]) from T1 to T2, 15.5 (95% CI [9.8, 23.8]) T2 to T3, and 25.2% (95% CI [17.8, 34.4]) from T1 to T3. Anxiety incidence increased by 9.7% (95% CI [5.4, 17]) from T1 to T2, 39.8% (95%CI [30.9, 49.5]) from T2 to T3, and 35.9% (95% CI [27.3, 45.5]) from T1 to T3. The severity of stress significantly increased from 16.1{+/-}8.7 at T1 to 23.5{+/-}8.4 at T2, and 30.3{+/-}6.0 at T3. Depression severity significantly increased from 48.5{+/-}20.5 at T1 to 64.7{+/-}30.2 at T2, and 75.9{+/-}26.1 at T3. Anxiety increased from 49.0{+/-}13.4 at T1 to 53.5{+/-}12.5 at T2 and 62.3{+/-}13.4 at T3. Females and individuals without comorbidities that increased COVID-19 lethality had higher anxiety scores than males and individuals with comorbidities. Age was inversely associated with mental health outcomes at baseline. Conclusion: The prevalence and severity of stress, depression, and anxiety significantly increased throughout the course of the pandemic. Anxiety seems to be sensitive to gender and risk status, where females and individuals without pre-existing comorbidities had higher anxiety by the final collection point.

BACKGROUND: Survivorship of critical illness has been identified as a challenge for the 21st Century. Whilst the use of the term 'survivorship' is now common in critical care, it has been borrowed from the cancer literature where the discourse on what survivorship means in a cancer context is ongoing and remains largely descriptive. In the absence of a theoretical understanding, the term 'survivorship' is often used in critical illness in a generic way, limiting our understanding of what survivorship is. The current COVID-19 pandemic adds to an urgency of understanding what intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship might mean, given the emerging long-term consequences of this patient cohort. We set out to explore how survivorship after critical illness is being conceptualised and what the implications might be for clinical practice and research. DESIGN: Integrated systematic literature review. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. PRISMA guidelines were followed and a PRISMA checklist for reporting systematic reviews completed. RESULTS: The three main themes around which the reviewed studies were organised are: (a) healthcare system; (b) ICU survivors' families; and (c) ICU survivor's identity. These three themes feed into an overarching core theme of 'ICU Survivorship Experiences'. These themes map our current knowledge of what happens when a patient survives a critical illness and where we are in understanding ICU survivorship. CONCLUSION: We mapped in this systematic review the different pieces of the jigsaw that emerge following critical illness to understand and see the bigger picture of what happens after patients survive critical illness. It is evident that existing research has mapped these connections, but what we have not managed to do yet is defining what survivorship is theoretically. We offer a preliminary definition of survivorship as a process but are aware that this definition needs to be developed further with patients and families.","output":"Theorising survivorship after intensive care: A systematic review of patient and family experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supply chains for many agricultural products have an hour-glass shape;in between a sizable number of farmers and consumers is a smaller number of processors. The concentrated nature of the meat processing sectors in the United States implies that disruption of the processing capacity of any one plant, from accident, weather, or as recently witnessed C worker illnesses from a pandemic C has the potential to lead to system-wide disruptions. We explore the extent to which a less concentrated meat processing sector would be less vulnerable to the risks of temporary plant shutdowns. We calibrate an economic model to match the actual horizontal structure of the U.S. beef packing sector and conduct counter-factual simulations. With Cournot competition among heterogeneous packing plants, the model determines how industry output and producer and consumer welfare vary with the odds of exogenous plant shutdowns under different horizontal structures. We find that increasing odds of shutdown results in a widening of the farm-to-retail price spread even as packer profits fall, regardless of the structure. Results indicate that the extent to which a more diffuse packing sector performs better in ensuring a given level of output, and thus food security, depends on the exogenous risk of shutdown and the level of output desired;no horizontal structure dominates. These results illustrate the consequences of policies and industry efforts aimed at increasing the resilience of the food supply chain and highlight that there are no easy solutions to improving the short-run resilience by changing the horizontal concentration of meat packing.","output":"Concentration and Resilience in the U.S. Meat Supply Chains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discovery campaigns against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beginning to target the viral RNA genome1, 2.

Future increases in healthcare spending will be restricted, given that 10% of the country's gross domestic product is spent on healthcare and the fact that there is a workforce shortage. Dutch healthcare consists of a curative sector (mostly hospitals) and nursing care at home. The two entities have separate national budgets (25 bn + 20 bn respectively) AIM: In a proof of concept, we explored a new hospital-at-home model combining hospital cure and nursing home care budgets. This study tests the feasibility of (1) providing hospital care at home, (2) combining financial budgets, (3) increasing workforces by combining teams and (4) improving perspectives and increasing patient and staff satisfaction. RESULTS We tested the feasibility of combining the budgets of a teaching hospital and home care group for cardiology. The budgets were sufficient to hire three nurse practitioners who were trained to work together with 12 home care cardiovascular nurses to provide care in a hospital-at-home setting, including intravenous treatment. Subsequently, the hospital-at-home programme for endocarditis and heart failure treatment was developed and a virtual ward was built within the e?patient record. CONCLUSION The current model demonstrates a proof of concept for a hospital-at-home programme providing hospital-level curative care at home by merging hospital and home care nursing staff and budgets.

This study investigates the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities in non-survivors of COVID-19 in a virtopsy framework. METHODS In this prospective, monocentric, case series study, consecutive patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria benefited from an early postmortem structural brain MRI: death <24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest computerized tomographic (CT) scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. RESULTS Among the 62 patients who died from COVID-19 from 31/03/2020 to 24/04/2020 at our institution, 19 decedents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Parenchymal brain abnormalities were observed in 4 decedents: subcortical micro- and macro-bleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, one decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (one decedent). Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality was observed. CONCLUSIONS Postmortem brain MRI demonstrates hemorrhagic and PRES-related brain lesions in non-survivors of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory impairment seems to be limited to olfactory bulbs. Brainstem MRI findings do not support a brain-related contribution to respiratory distress in COVID-19.","output":"Early postmortem brain MRI findings in COVID-19 non-survivors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Published data on the first 5,000 coronavirus patients to receive plasma shows promise in the United States However, delivering convalescent plasma therapies in low- and even middle-income countries is both difficult and costly Here we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of antisera raised in animals that may allow poorer countries to control the devastating effects of COVID-19","output":"Animal derived antibodies should be considered alongside convalescent human plasma to deliver treatments for COVID-19 [version 1;peer review: 1 approved]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This note comments on the questionable approach and claims made in Study of mixed-mode oscillations in a nonlinear cardiovascular system [Nonlinear Dyn, doi: 10.1007/s11071-020-05612-8].

Therefore, we compared the efficacy of candidate vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the peak levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies across candidate vaccines. Data were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) since the outcome was assessed via different metrics and methods across the studies. Results: Data obtained from 836 healthy adult vaccine recipients were extracted from 11 studies. BBIBP-CorV, AZD1222, BNT162b2, New Crown COVID-19, and Sputnik V induced a very large effect on the level of neutralizing antibodies (SMD > 1.3); CoVLP, CoronaVac, NVX-CoV2373, and Ad5-nCoV induced a large effect (SMD > 0.8 to 1.3); and Ad26.COV2.S induced a medium effect (SMD > 0.5 to 0.8). BBIBP-CorV and AZD122 were more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad5CnCoV, mRNA-1237, CoronaVac, NVXCCoV2373, CoVLP, and New Crown COVID-19; New Crown COVID-19 was more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad5CnCoV, and mRNA-1237; CoronaVac was more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S and Ad5CnCoV; and Sputnik V and BNT162b2 were more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S. In recipients aged 60 years, AZD1222, BBIBP-CorV, and mRNA-1237 were the most effective candidate vaccines. Conclusion: All the candidate vaccines induced significant levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, but only AZD1222 and mRNA-1237 were certainly tested in patients aged 70 years.

Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents a computation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network.

A layer of epithelial cells bound together via intercellular junction proteins maintains intestinal barrier integrity. Based on a tight equilibrium between cell extrusion and cell restitution, the renewal of the epithelium (epithelial turnover) permits the preservation of cell numbers. As the last step within the epithelial turnover, cell shedding occurs due to the pressure of cell division and migration from the base of the crypt. During this process, redistribution of tight junction proteins enables the sealing of the epithelial gap left by the extruded cell, and thereby maintains barrier function. Disturbance in cell shedding can create transient gaps (leaky gut) or cell accumulation in the epithelial layer. In fact, numerous studies have described the association between dysregulated cell shedding and infection, inflammation, and cancer; thus epithelial cell extrusion is considered a key defense mechanism. In the gastrointestinal tract, altered cell shedding has been observed in mouse models of intestinal inflammation and appears as a potential cause of barrier loss in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the relevance of this process, there are many unanswered questions regarding cell shedding. The investigation of those mechanisms controlling cell extrusion in the gut will definitely contribute to our understanding of intestinal homeostasis. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge about intestinal cell shedding under both physiological and pathological circumstances.","output":"Impact of Epithelial Cell Shedding on Intestinal Homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has become an unprecedented health crisis, the uncertainty and anxiety that citizens may experience can increase their dependence on information Therefore, accurate and updated information regarding health protection must be transmitted Objectives: Identify the resources published for citizenship about COVID-19 on the websites of public health institutions Methods: It is a descriptive cross-sectional study The websites of public health institutions that included information sections on COVID-19 intended for citizens were analyzed Results: The information published, between February and May 2020, from a total of 24 websites in Spanish was analyzed The most important categories that included information on COVID-19 were handwashing, prevention of contagion and the use of masks, with 96%, 92% and 88% respectively of the information analyzed Conclusions: The websites analyzed contain electronic informational material on COVID-19 in prevention and protection In addition, social networks play a fundamental role in the dissemination of information","output":"Analysis of information on COVID-19 on websites of public health organizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spreads to humans via zoonotic transmission from camels. MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs), which also includes viruses isolated from bats and hedgehogs. A large portion of the betaCoV genome consists of two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into polyproteins. These are cleaved by viral proteases to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) which compose the viral replication-transcription complex. We investigated the evolution of ORF1a and ORF1b in lineage C betaCoVs. Results indicated widespread positive selection, acting mostly on ORF1a. The proportion of positively selected sites in ORF1a was much higher than that previously reported for the surface-exposed spike protein. Selected sites were unevenly distributed, with nsp3 representing the preferential target. Several pairs of coevolving sites were also detected, possibly indicating epistatic interactions; most of these were located in nsp3. Adaptive evolution at nsp3 is ongoing in MERS-CoV strains, and two selected sites (G720 and R911) were detected in the protease domain. While position 720 is variable in camel-derived viruses, suggesting that the selective event does not represent a specific adaptation to humans, the R911C substitution was observed only in human-derived MERS-CoV isolates, including the viral strain responsible for the recent South Korean outbreak. It will be extremely important to assess whether these changes affect host range or other viral phenotypes. More generally, data herein indicate that CoV nsp3 represents a major selection target and that nsp3 sequencing should be envisaged in monitoring programs and field surveys. IMPORTANCE Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans via an intermediate host. This clearly highlights the potential for coronavirus host shifting and the relevance of understanding the molecular events underlying the adaptation to new host species. We investigated the evolution of ORF1a and ORF1b in lineage C betaCoVs and in 87 sequenced MERS-CoV isolates. Results indicated widespread positive selection, stronger in ORF1a than in ORF1b. Several selected sites were found to be located in functionally relevant protein regions, and some of them corresponded to functional mutations in other coronaviruses. The proportion of selected sites we identified in ORF1a is much higher than that for the surface-exposed spike protein. This observation suggests that adaptive evolution in ORF1a might contribute to host shifts or immune evasion. Data herein also indicate that genetic diversity at nonstructural proteins should be taken into account when antiviral compounds are developed.","output":"Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins in Lineage C Betacoronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA structural elements occur in numerous single stranded (+)-sense RNA viruses. The stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3' UTR in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as anti-viral agents.IMPORTANCEThe highly conserved stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is found in the genomes of many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Multiple studies have shown that ATTR-CM was present in 10-15% of all cases with severe AS. The purpose of this quality improvement project is to raise awareness of ATTR-CM in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe AS amongst the healthcare providers and patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all TAVR cases performed at our institution in 2019 (Total cases 87). We screened for the presence of predefined high-risk features for ATTR-CM based on prior literature (Presence of diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram, low voltage-mass ratio, low limb lead voltage on EKG, arrhythmia/bundle branch block, or systemic symptoms of amyloidosis). We subsequently contacted the patients to discuss our clinical suspicion of ATTR-CM and offered clinical referral to a cardiac amyloid specialist. Results: Of the total of 87 patients who underwent TAVR in 2019, 12 patients were deceased at chart review. We have identified 50 patients (66.7%) who had high-risk features of ATTR-CM. A total of 17 patients (34% of 50 patients) agreed to be referred to cardiac amyloid specialist. Six patients (12%) were tested with 99m Technetium Pyrophosphate imaging, and all were negative for ATTR-CM. Eleven patients (22%) are still pending testing. Six patients did not wish for referral due to personal reasons. We were not able to reach 15 patients via phone (30%). In addition, we have found additional 12 patients who were deceased (Total mortality count of 24, 27.5%) in two years. Conclusion: Our project has increased awareness within structural cardiologists as we have implemented a prospective screening process within our institution. While we expected to diagnose ATTR-CM in 10% of severe AS who underwent TAVR, we had multiple difficulties contacting them, coordinating referrals due to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher 2-year mortality. We are hypothesizing whether the higher 2-year mortality is secondary to undetected ATTR-CM.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO(2) and PaCO(2), pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

For this, a questionnaire was developed to capture the perception attributed to occupational health and safety. This questionnaire was made available online, via institutional email. The work was carried out at a Portuguese public university. 275 students (80.2% of the expected) enrolled in 17 undergraduate courses (those that are not related to engineering) answered the questionnaire. For statistical analysis, courses were grouped into clusters (N = 10) according to pre-established criteria. As results it was noticed that: (1) in relation to curricular preferences, cluster 3 presented better indicators about the importance of Safety and Health at Work, while cluster 5 presented the worst indicators of importance;(2) in cluster 7, 100% of respondents stated that safety is of utmost importance and in return, only 40% stated the same in cluster 4. It is concluded that there is a difference between the perception of the importance given to Safety and Health at Work among the studied clusters.

METHODS: A prospective, multicentre, randomized phase II study was conducted in male and female patients aged 18-70 years with hypovolemic shock having systolic BP &#8804; 90 mmHg. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control or centhaquine group. The control group received 100 ml of normal saline infusion over 1 h, while the centhaquine group received 0.01 mg/kg of centhaquine in 100 ml normal saline infusion over 1 h. Every patient received standard of care (SOC) and was followed for 28 days. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included, and 45 completed the trial: 22 in the control group and 23 in the centhaquine group. The demographics of patients in both groups were comparable. No adverse event related to centhaquine was recorded in the 28-day observation period. The baseline, Injury Scoring System score, haemoglobin, and haematocrit were similar in both groups. However, 91% of the patients in the centhaquine group needed major surgery, whereas only 68% in the control group (p = 0.0526). Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 0/23 in the centhaquine group and 2/22 in the control group. The percent time in ICU and ventilator support was less in the centhaquine group than in the control group. The total amount of vasopressors needed in the first 48 h of resuscitation was lower in the centhaquine group than in the control group (3.12  2.18 vs. 9.39  4.28 mg).

The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has relied on nucleic acid testing; however, it has some limitations, such as low throughput and high rates of false negatives. Tests of higher sensitivity are needed to effectively identify infected patients. Methods: This study has developed fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassays to determine IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. The assay performance has been evaluated at 10 hospitals. Clinical specificity was evaluated by measuring 972 hospitalized patients and 586 donors of a normal population. Clinical sensitivity was assessed on 513 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Results: The assays demonstrated satisfied assay precision with coefficient of variation of less than 4.45%. Inactivation of specimen did not affect assay measurement. SARS-CoV-2 IgM showed clinical specificity of 97.33 and 99.49% for hospitalized patients and the normal population respectively, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG showed clinical specificity of 97.43 and 99.15% respectively.

Continued research can shed light on potential longer-term impacts. An online survey of U.S. parents with 4- to 8-year-old children (n = 1000) was administered in October 2020. The survey examined parent-reported impacts of COVID-19 on lifestyle (e.g., work, child-care, grocery shopping), as well as current family food acquisition and eating behaviors (e.g., cooking, restaurant use). Descriptive statistics were calculated, incorporating sampling weights based on sociodemographics. In terms of COVID-19 impacts, parents reported increases in working from home, decreased work hours, and increased child care and instruction, with most children attending school or receiving care at home. Parents reported increased home cooking and online grocery shopping; only 33% reported increased take-out or delivery from restaurants. About half of parents reported that their child dined at restaurants, 62% reported getting take-out, and 57% reported delivery from restaurants at least 2-3 times per month. About half viewed dining at restaurants as safe, while take-out and delivery were seen as safe by around three-quarters. Approximately two-thirds reported recent food insecurity.

However, it still is critical to map the digital health care landscape including the key elements that define it as an ecosystem. Particularly, knowing the perspectives of citizens on this digital transformation is an important angle to capture. In this review we aim to analyze the relevant studies to identify how DH is understood and experienced by Australian citizens and what they may require from DH platforms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping literature review was conducted across several electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, OVID, PubMed, Scopus, IEEE, Science Direct, SAGE), as well as grey literature. Additionally, citation mining was conducted to identify further relevant studies. Identified studies were subjected to eligibility criteria and the final set of articles was independently reviewed, analyzed, discussed and interpreted by three reviewers. RESULTS: Of 3811 articles, 98 articles met the inclusion criteria with research-based articlesCas opposed to review articles or white papersC comprising the largest proportion (72%) of the selected literature. The qualitative analysis of the literature revealed five key elements that capture the essence of the digital health ecosystem interventions from the viewpoint of the Australian citizens. The identified elements were consumer/user, health care, technology, use and usability, data and information. These elements were further found to be associated with 127 subcategories. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to analyze and synthesize the relevant literature on DH ecosystems from the citizens perspective. Through the lens of two research questions, this study defines the key components that were found crucial to understanding citizens experiences with DH. This understanding lays a strong foundation for designing and fostering DH ecosystem.

Following activation of the UK pandemic response, our institution began planning for admission of COVID-19 patients to the neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU) to support the local critical care network which risked being rapidly overwhelmed by the high number of cases. This report will detail our experience of repurposing a neuro-ICU for the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 while retaining capacity for urgent neurosurgical and neurology admissions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective process analysis of the repurposing of a quaternary level neuro-ICU during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We retrieved demographic data, diagnosis, and outcomes from the electronic health care records of all patients admitted to the ICU between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Processes for increase in surge capacity, reduction in ICU demand, and staff redeployment and rapid training are reported. RESULTS: Over a 10-day period, total ICU capacity was increased by 21.7% (from 23 to 28 beds) while the capacity to provide mechanical ventilation was increased by 77% (from 13 to 23 beds). There were 30 ICU admissions of 29 COVID-19 patients between March 1 and April 30, 2020; median (range) length of ICU stay was 9.9 (1.3 to 32) days, duration of mechanical ventilation 11 (1 to 27) days, and ICU mortality rate 41.4%. There was a 44% reduction in urgent neurosurgical and neurology admissions compared with the same period in 2019.

Poor access to food often co-occurs with drug use and contributes to associated sequelae, such as risks for HIV and diabetes. The objective of this study was to examine factors associated with adequate food access among PWID in a rural Appalachian community. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were used to collect data among PWID aged 18 and older in Cabell County, West Virginia. Frequency of hunger and sociodemographic, structural and drug use characteristics were measured. Adequate food access was defined as reporting never going to bed hungry at night in the past six months. Pearsons (2) and t-tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with food access. RESULTS: Only 71 individuals (17%) reported never going to bed hungry at night in the past six months. Adjusted odds of having adequate food access were higher among PWID who completed high school (aOR 2.94; P = 0.010) and usually used drugs alone (aOR 1.97; P = 0.025), and lower among PWID who were female (aOR 0.51; P = 0.037), experienced homelessness (aOR 0.23, P < 0.001), were recently arrested (aOR 0.50 P = 0.047), and engaged in receptive sharing of injection equipment (aOR 0.52, P = 0.035).

Symptoms, causes, and differences with the term dementia were central queries for persons interested in AD. No notable overall correlation between SVI and measures of disease burden was found due to competing results. Sub-group analyses, however, showed that these correlations may be influenced by socioeconomic development, with strong negative significant associations observed in lower middle-income countries.

Biological properties of caspases and reactive oxygen species were assessed in T cells treated by COVID-19 pooled plasma. RESULTS Mitochondria apoptosis of peripheral T cells were identified in COVID-19 adult patient samples, but not in the children. Furthermore, increased TNF- and IL-6 in COVID-19 plasma induced mitochondria apoptosis and caused DNA damage by elevating reactive oxygen species levels of the adult T cells. However, the child T cells showed tolerance to mitochondrial apoptosis due to mitochondria autophagy. Activation of autophagy could decrease apoptotic sensitivity of the adult T cells to plasma from COVID-19 patients.

Questions related to infection rates and mechanisms, the possibility of reinfection, and potential therapeutic approaches require us not only to use the experimental models previously employed for the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses but also to generate new models to respond to urgent questions. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the different experimental models used in the study of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 both in different cell lines that have enabled identification of the virus action mechanisms and in animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, ferrets, and primates) inoculated with the virus. Specifically, we reviewed models used to assess the presence and effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS, including neural cell lines, animal models such as mouse hepatitis virus CoV (especially the 59 strain), and the use of brain organoids.

Hyperuricemia occurs due to decreased excretion of uric acid, increased synthesis of uric acid, or a combination of both mechanisms. There is growing evidence that hyperuricemia is associated with a decline of renal function. Purpose: This study is aimed at investigating the effects of the novel compound on lowering the serum uric acid level and alleviating renal inflammation induced by high uric acid in hyperuricemic mice. Methods: Hyperuricemic mice model was induced by potassium oxonate and used to evaluate the effects of the novel compound named FxUD. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the related biochemical markers. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was applied to observe pathological changes. The mRNA expression levels were tested by qRT-PCR. The protein levels were determined by Western blot. In parallel, human proximal renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) derived from normal kidney was used to further validate the anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Results: FxUD administration significantly decreased serum uric acid levels, restored the kidney function parameters, and improved the renal pathological injury. Meanwhile, treatment with FxUD effectively inhibited serum and liver xanthine oxidase (XOD) levels. Reversed expression alterations of renal inflammatory cytokines, urate transporter 1 (URAT1) and glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) were observed in hyperuricemic mice. Western blot results illustrated FxUD down-regulated protein levels of inflammasome components. Further studies showed that FxUD inhibited the activation of NF-B signaling pathway in the kidney of hyperuricemic mice. In parallel, the anti-inflammatory effect of FxUD was also confirmed in HK-2. Conclusion: Our study reveals that FxUD exhibits the anti-hyperuricemic and anti-inflammatory effects through regulating hepatic XOD and renal urate reabsorption transporters, and suppressing NF-B/NLRP3 pathway in hyperuricemia. The results provide the evidence that FxUD may be potential for the treatment of hyperuricemia with kidney inflammation.","output":"Pharmacological Basis for Use of a Novel Compound in Hyperuricemia: Anti-Hyperuricemic and Anti-Inflammatory Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that genetic predisposition may influence the susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and disease outcomes. A recent study has suggested that the deletion allele (D allele) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients. Moreover, the ACE D allele has been shown to be more prevalent in patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a previous study. Thus, we have investigated the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the progression to ARDS or requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. METHOD: One hundred and forty genetically unrelated Chinese SARS patients and 326 healthy volunteers were recruited. The ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: There is no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and the allelic frequencies of the ACE I/D polymorphism between the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects. Moreover, there is also no evidence that ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the progression to ARDS or the requirement of intensive care in the SARS patients. In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care. CONCLUSION: The ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection.","output":"Absence of association between angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphism and development of adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a case control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between 9 December 2021 and 15 March 2022, 2,653 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 33 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (1,030), in wild (1,489) and in captive birds (133). The outbreaks in poultry were mainly reported by France (609), where two spatiotemporal clusters have been identified since October 2021, followed by Italy (131), Hungary (73) and Poland (53); those reporting countries accounted together for 12.8 of the 17.5 million birds that were culled in the HPAI affected poultry establishments in this reporting period. The majority of the detections in wild birds were reported by Germany (767), the Netherlands (293), the UK (118) and Denmark (74). HPAI A(H5) was detected in a wide range of host species in wild birds, indicating an increasing and changing risk for virus incursion into poultry farms. The observed persistence and continuous circulation of HPAI viruses in migratory and resident wild birds will continue to pose a risk for the poultry industry in Europe for the coming months. This requires the definition and the rapid implementation of suitable and sustainable HPAI mitigation strategies such as appropriate biosecurity measures, surveillance plans and early detection measures in the different poultry production systems.

The estimated effect of ivermectin indicated mortality benefits (pooled odds ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.42, n = 1255), with some evidence against the hypothesis of 'no significant difference' at the current sample size. CONCLUSION: We observed a preliminary beneficial effect on mortality associated with ivermectin use in patients with COVID-19 that warrants further clinical evidence in appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials.","output":"The association between the use of ivermectin and mortality in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to examine how anxiety related to different styles of coping during the COVID-19 pandemic and how these relationships were moderated by the cultural orientations of individualism/collectivism and a person's sense of meaning in life. A sample of 849 participants from Georgia completed an online survey during the final stage of lockdown. To measure the main variables, we used the State Anxiety Inventory, the Horizontal and Vertical Individualism and Collectivism Scale, the Meaning of Life Questionnaire, the COVID-19 Worry Scale, and the Ways of Coping Scale tailored to COVID-19 pandemic. The latter measured rational coping via the subscales of information accessing/processing and action-planning coping, and affective coping - via the subscales of passive-submissive and avoidant coping. Results suggested that anxiety positively predicted both affective coping styles and negatively predicted the action-planning coping style, while COVID-19 worry predicted all coping styles;presence of meaning in life positively predicted both rational coping styles and negatively predicted the avoidant coping style, while search for meaning positively predicted all coping styles;individualism negatively predicted the passive-submissive style and positively predicted the action-planning style, whereas collectivism predicted all coping styles;furthermore, individualism and collectivism moderated the link between anxiety and the passive-submissive coping style, presence of meaning in life moderated the link between anxiety and avoidant coping style, while search for meaning in life moderated the link between anxiety and the action-planning coping style. Overall, the findings enrich the cultural transactional theory of stress and coping, and generate insights for the culture-sensitive approach to the meaning in life.

For efficient processing and storage, the moisture content of palm kernel must be reduced to an optimal level by drying. This study aimed to see how drying influenced the physical structure and physicochemical properties of palm kernel and oil. Before and after drying, the free fatty acid (FFA), colors, fatty acid composition, FTIR, thermal property, and structure of palm kernel were investigated. RESULTS: Results show that drying significantly (p < 0.05) reduced FFA, and colors of palm kernel oil. The drying also significantly affects (p < 0.05) composition of some fatty acids in palm kernel oil such as capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid. However, drying did not affect palm kernel's and palm kernel oil's functional groups and thermal properties. After drying, structural damage of palm kernel was observed. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, the quality of kernel oil may be maintained after drying, and it can even be improved based on lower FFA content. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: REUMAVID is a cross-sectional study using an online survey developed by an international multidisciplinary patient-led collaboration across seven European countries targeting unselected patients with RMDs. Healthcare access, daily activities, disease activity and function, well-being (WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), health status, anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and access to information were evaluated. Data were collected in April-July 2020 (first phase). RESULTS: Data from the first phase included 1800 patients with 15 different RMDs (37.2% axial spondyloarthritis, 29.2% rheumatoid arthritis, 17.2% osteoarthritis and others). Mean age was 53, 80% female and 49% had undertaken university studies. During the beginning of the pandemic, 58.4% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled and 45.6% reported not having received any information relating to the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their RMDs, with the main source being patient organisations (27.6%).Regarding habits, 24.6% increased smoking, 18.2% raised their alcohol consumption, and 45.6% were unable to continue exercising. Self-reported disease activity was high (5.32.7) and 75.6% reported elevated pain.

We compared the incidence, causes, and outcomes of ventilator-associated events (VAEs) in ventilated patients with and without Covid-19. Methods We retrospectively identified all VAEs in adult patients on mechanical ventilation in two academic and two community hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts from 2017-2020. We compared VAE incidence between March 1-August 31 in each year (to correspond to the timeframe of the pandemic in 2020). We reviewed the charts of 200 randomly selected patients with VAEs (100 with Covid-19 and 100 without) to determine reasons for intubation and conditions precipitating VAEs. Results From 2017 through 2020 there were 236, 221, 291, and 458 VAEs during each 6-month period. Of the 458 VAEs during 2020, 224 were amongst patients with Covid-19 and 234 without. The mean incidence of VAEs per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation trended higher in 2020 compared to prior years (8.0 vs 5.4, p=.09, Figure 1) but the rate of VAEs per 1000 ventilator-days was similar (19.6 vs 19.0, p=.56, Figure 1). The distribution of VAC and IVAC-plus was similar in Covid-19 vs non-Covid-19 patients. Mean age was also similar but male sex (72% vs 60%, p=.01), hypertension (59% vs. 50%, p=.02) and diabetes (50% vs. 19%, p&lt;.01) were more common amongst Covid-19 patients. Median duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in VAE patients with Covid-19 (21 vs 13 days, p&lt;.01) but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (32% vs 39%, P=.14). On medical record review, the most common reason for intubation in Covid-19 patients with VAEs was Covid-19 pneumonia (91%), whereas non-Covid-19 patients with VAEs were most commonly intubated for surgery (26%), altered mental status (26%), and cardiac arrest (9%). The most common conditions precipitating VAEs in Covid-19 were ARDS (53%), pneumonia (22%), and atelectasis (11%) versus pneumonia (31%), pulmonary edema (23%) and atelectasis (20%) in patients without Covid-19. Conclusions VAEs were more frequent on a per-episode basis during Covid-19 compared to the same months in pre-Covid-19 years but rates per 1000 ventilator-days were similar, reflecting the longer duration of mechanical ventilation in Covid-19 patients. Progressive ARDS accounted for over half of VAEs in Covid-19 patients, whereas pulmonary edema, atelectasis and pneumonia were the most common triggers in patients without Covid-19. These findings provide insight into the natural history of Covid-19 in ventilated patients and may inform strategies to mitigate complications in this population.","output":"Incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of ventilator associated events during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moving within the second wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, dental education delivery has been profoundly affected by this crisis, so has the structure, evaluation, and future of dental education.

This crisis appears to be a tipping point that produced confusion in dental teaching especially clinical sciences. Although medical institutions immediately started to adapt to the unexpected COVID-19 crisis, dental and oral health educational services are profoundly impaired due to the dental team's propinquity to the patient and the aerosols generated during routine dental therapeutic procedures.

They require the additional attention, expertise, and adherence counseling that occurs in multidisciplinary lipid clinics (MDLCs). We conducted a program evaluation of the first year of a newly implemented MDLC utilizing the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework to provide empirical data not only on program effectiveness, but also on components important to local sustainability and future generalizability. METHODS: The purpose of the MDLC is to increase the uptake of guideline-based care for lipid conditions. Established in 2019, the MDLC provides care via a centralized clinic location within the healthcare system. Primary care providers and cardiologists were invited to refer individuals with lipid conditions. Using a pre/post-study design, we evaluated the implementation outcomes from the MDLC using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: In 2019, 420 referrals were made to the MDLC (reach). Referrals were made by 19% (148) of the 796 active cardiology and primary care providers, with an average of 35 patient referrals per month in 2019 (SD 12) (adoption). The MDLC saw 83 patients in 2019 (reach). Additionally, 50% (41/82) had at least one follow-up MDLC visit, and 12% (10/82) had two or more follow-up visits in 2019 (implementation). In patients seen by the MDLC, we found an improved diagnosis of specific lipid conditions (FH (familial hypercholesterolemia), hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia), increased prescribing of evidence-based therapies, high rates of medication prior authorization approvals, and significant reductions in lipid levels by lipid condition subgroup (effectiveness). Over time, the operations team decided to transition from in-person follow-up to telehealth appointments to increase capacity and sustain the clinic (maintenance). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited reach and adoption of the MDLC, we found a large intervention effect that included improved diagnosis, increased prescribing of guideline-recommended treatments, and clinically significant reduction of lipid levels. Attention to factors including solutions to decrease the large burden of unseen referrals, discussion of the appropriate number and duration of visits, and sustainability of the clinic model could aid in enhancing the success of the MDLC and improving outcomes for more patients throughout the system.","output":"Evaluation of a multidisciplinary lipid clinic to improve the care of individuals with severe lipid conditions: a RE-AIM framework analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have presented in the current analytic research the generating formulae and results of direct mathematical modelling of non-classical trends for COVID-19s evolution in world which, nevertheless, can be divided into two types: (1) the general trends for European countries such as Germany presented by the curve of modified sigmoid-type with up-inclination of the upper limit of saturation (at the end of first wave of pandemic) as well as for other cases of key countries that suffered from pandemic such as USA, India, Brazil, Russia (we conclude that the same type of coronavirus pandemic is valid for most of the countries in world with similar scenarios of the same type for general trends); (2) non-classical general trends for Middle East countries (such as Iran), with the appropriate bulge on graphical plots at the beginning of first wave of pandemic.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, OpenGrey, LILACS, and Medline, and search of scientific meeting abstracts and trial registers to April 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials comparing PSA screening with usual care in men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer. DATA EXTRACTION At least two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of eligible studies. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including selection of outcomes important to patients. We used a random effects model to obtain pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) and, when feasible, conducted subgroup analyses (defined a priori) based on age, frequency of screening, family history, ethnicity, and socioeconomic level, as well as a sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. RESULTS Five randomised controlled trials, enrolling 721 718 men, were included. Studies varied with respect to screening frequency and intervals, PSA thresholds for biopsy, and risk of bias. When considering the whole body of evidence, screening probably has no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; moderate certainty) and may have no effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.96, 0.85 to 1.08; low certainty). Sensitivity analysis of studies at lower risk of bias (n=1) also demonstrates that screening seems to have no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 1.0, 0.98 to 1.02; moderate certainty) but may have a small effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.79, 0.69 to 0.91; moderate certainty). This corresponds to one less death from prostate cancer per 1000 men screened over 10 years. Direct comparative data on biopsy and treatment related complications from the included trials were limited. Using modelling, we estimated that for every 1000 men screened, approximately 1, 3, and 25 more men would be hospitalised for sepsis, require pads for urinary incontinence, and report erectile dysfunction, respectively. CONCLUSIONS At best, screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in disease-specific mortality over 10 years but has does not affect overall mortality. Clinicians and patients considering PSA based screening need to weigh these benefits against the potential short and long term harms of screening, including complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment, as well as the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 by itself is not an indication for cesarean section. Different publications demonstrated the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery. Although SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a certain neurotropism, neuraxial block was not associated with neurological damage in COVID-19 parturients, and seems as safe and effective as in normal situations. It permits to avoid a general anesthesia in case of intrapartum cesarean section. Epidural failure is a concern: it may lead to a general anesthesia in case of emergency cesarean section. Local protocols and well-trained anesthesiologists will be helpful. COVID-19 patients require special circuits and every step (transfer to and from theatre, recovery, analgesia, and so on) should be planned in advance. For cesarean section under general anesthesia, personal protection equipment must be enhanced. Postoperative analgesia with neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, or regional blocks are recommended. COVID-19 and pregnancy increase the risk of thrombosis, so thromboprophylaxis has to be considered and protocolized.

METHODS Twenty-four GP offices were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group (12 offices each). In the experimental group, GPs and nurse practitioners implemented an oral care protocol. No extra attention was given to oral health in the control group. The primary outcome parameter was oral health-related quality of life (QoL) assessed with the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile at baseline and 1 year later. Other outcomes were self-reported oral health complaints and general health-related QoL (36-item Short Form Health Survey). RESULTS Of 764 patients with type 2 diabetes, 543 (71.1%) completed the 1-year follow-up.

It can therefore be argued that housing policy is critically linked to health policy. However, the extent to which this linkage is understood and addressed in public policies is limited and highly diverse across and within countries. This analysis seeks to describe the linkages between housing policies and health and well-being using examples from three countries at different levels of the wealth spectrum: Singapore, the UK, and Kenya. We conducted a comparative policy analysis across three country contexts (Singapore, the UK, and Kenya) to document the extent to which housing policies address health and well-being, highlighting commonalities and differences among them. To guide our analysis, we used the United Nations (UN) definition of adequate housing as it offers a broad framework to analyze the impact of housing on health and well-being. The anatomy of housing policies has a strong correlation to the provision of adequate housing across Singapore, the UK, and Kenya, especially for vulnerable groups. The paper demonstrates that contextual factors including population composition (i.e., aging versus youthful), political ideologies, legal frameworks (i.e., welfare versus market-based provision of housing), and presence (or absence) of adequate, quality, timely, reliable, robust data systems for decision-making, which are taken up by stakeholders/state, have strong implications of the type of housing policies developed and implemented, in turn directly and indirectly impacting the overall health and well-being of populations. This analysis demonstrates the value of viewing housing policies as public health policies that could significantly impact the health and well-being of populations, especially vulnerable groups.

This study aims to apply machine learning (ML) to predict the requirement for oxygen-based treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the first phase, demographic information, symptoms, and patients background were extracted from the databases of two local hospitals in Iran, and preprocessing actions were applied. In the second step, the related features were selected. Lastly, five ML models including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), XGBoost, C5.0, and neural networks (NNs) were implemented and compared based on their accuracy and capability. Among the variables related to the patients background, consuming opium due to the high rate of opium users in Iran was considered in the models. Of the 398 patients included in the study, 112 (28.14%) received oxygen-based treatment. Shortness of breath (71.42%), fever (62.5%), and cough (59.82%) had the highest frequency in patients with oxygen requirements. The most important variables for prediction were shortness of breath, cough, age, and fever. For opioid-addicted patients, in addition to the high mortality rate (23.07%), the rate of oxygen-based treatment was twice as high as non-addicted patients. XGBoost and LR obtained the highest area under the curve with values of 88.7% and 88.3%, respectively. For accuracy, LR and NNs achieved the best and same accuracy (86.42%).

METHODS Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. RESULTS The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. RECOMMENDATIONS Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield.

There are theories that the oral cavity provides a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry and persistence which may be a risk for prolonged virus shedding. However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed. The underlying concept for this hypothesis was developed by the critical observation of a clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 patient.

This systematic review builds upon the work of Brearly and colleagues' (2017) meta-analysis and provides an updated review of the literature, with special emphasis on test-level validity data.Method: Using similar methodology as Brearly and colleagues (2017) three internet databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO) were searched for relevant articles published since 2016. Studies with older adults (aged 65+) who underwent face-to-face and TNP assessments in a counterbalanced cross-over design were included. After review, 10 articles were retained. Combined with nine articles from Brearly's analysis, a total of 19 studies were included in the systematic review.Results: Retained studies included samples from 5 different countries, various ethnic/cultural backgrounds, and diverse diagnostic populations. Test-level analysis suggests there are cognitive screeners (MMSE, MoCA), language tests (BNT, Letter Fluency), attention/working memory tasks (Digit Span Total), and memory tests (HVLT-R) with strong support for TNP validity. Other measures are promising but lack sufficient support at this time.

The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high infectivity. Herd immunity is attained when a critical proportion of the population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently needed. Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials (phase 1 to 4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine development.","output":"Current scenario of COVID-19 vaccinations and immune response along with antibody titer in vaccinated inhabitants of different countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people However, the relationship between COVID-19 and acute cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) is unclear AIMS: We aimed to characterize the incidence, risk factors, clinical-radiological manifestations and outcome of COVID-19-associated stroke METHODS: Three medical databases were systematically reviewed for published articles on acute CVD in COVID-19 (December 2019-September 2020) The review protocol was previously registered (PROSPERO ID=CRD42020185476) Data were extracted from articles reporting i35 stroke cases in COVID-19 We complied with the PRISMA guidelines, and used the NewcastleaOttawa Scale to assess data quality Data were pooled using a random-effects model SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Of 2,277 initially identified articles, 61 (2 7%) were entered in the meta-analysis Out of 108,571 patients with COVID-19, acute CVD occurred in 1 4% (95%CI: 1 0-1 9) The most common manifestation was acute ischemic stroke (87 4%);intracerebral haemorrhage was less common (11 6%) Patients with COVID-19 developing acute CVD, compared to those who did not, were older (pooled median difference=4 8 years;95%CI:1 7-22 4), more likely to have hypertension (OR=7 35;95%CI:1 94-27 87), diabetes mellitus (OR=5 56;95%CI:3 34-9 24), coronary artery disease (OR=3 12;95%CI:1 61-6 02), and severe infection (OR=5 10;95%CI:2 72-9 54) Compared to individuals who experienced a stroke without the infection, patients with COVID-19 and stroke were younger (pooled median difference=-6 0 years;95%CI:-12 3 to -1 4), had higher NIHSS (pooled median difference=5;95%CI:3-9), higher frequency of large vessel occlusion (OR=2 73;95%CI:1 63-4 57), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (OR=5 21;95% CI:3 43-7 90) CONCLUSIONS: Acute CVD is not uncommon in COVID-19, especially in those whom are severely infected and have pre-existing vascular risk factors The pattern of large vessel occlusion and multi-territory infarcts suggest that cerebral thrombosis and/or thromboembolism could be possible causative pathways for the disease","output":"EXPRESS: Stroke in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In December 2019, cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in Hubei, China The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly but details on epidemi","output":"Dynamics of the Latest 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Epidemic in China: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, universities closed to face-to-face learning, shifting entirely to online instruction midway through the spring 2020 semester.

We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons. Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).

Importantly, this early protective capacity of MVA vaccination completely depends on virus-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses. We used MVA vaccination in the mousepox challenge model using ECTV infection to investigate the previously unknown factors required to elicit rapid protective T cell immunity in normal C57BL/6 mice and in mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR(-/-)). We found a minimal dose of 10(5) PFU of MVA vaccine fully sufficient to allow robust protection against lethal mousepox, as assessed by the absence of disease symptoms and failure to detect ECTV in organs from vaccinated animals. Moreover, MVA immunization at low dosage also protected IFNAR(-/-) mice, indicating efficient activation of cellular immunity even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. When monitoring for virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in mice vaccinated with the minimal protective dose of MVA, we found significantly enhanced levels of antigen-specific T cells in animals that were MVA vaccinated and ECTV challenged compared to mice that were only vaccinated. The initial priming of naive CD8(+) T cells by MVA immunization appears to be highly efficient and, even at low doses, mediates a rapid in vivo burst of pathogen-specific T cells upon challenge. Our findings define striking requirements for protective emergency immunization against severe systemic infections with orthopoxviruses. IMPORTANCE We demonstrate that single-shot low-dose immunizations with vaccinia virus MVA can rapidly induce T cell-mediated protective immunity against lethal orthopoxvirus infections. Our data provide new evidence for an efficient protective capacity of vaccination with replication-deficient MVA. These data are of important practical relevance for public health, as the effectiveness of a safety-tested, next-generation smallpox vaccine based on MVA is still debated. Furthermore, producing sufficient amounts of vaccine is expected to be a major challenge should an outbreak occur. Moreover, prevention of other infections may require rapidly protective immunization; hence, MVA could be an extremely useful vaccine for delivering heterologous T cell antigens, particularly for infectious diseases that fit a scenario of emergency vaccination.","output":"Rapid expansion of CD8+ T cells in wild-type and type I interferon receptor-deficient mice correlates with protection after low-dose emergency immunization with modified vaccinia virus Ankara."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several societal issues could be mitigated by reducing global consumption of meat and animal products (MAP). In three randomized, controlled experiments ([Formula: see text] to 574), we evaluated the effects of a documentary that presents health, environmental, and animal welfare motivations for reducing MAP consumption. Study 1 assessed the documentarys effectiveness at reducing reported MAP consumption after 12 days. This study used methodological innovations to minimize social desirability bias, a widespread limitation of past research. Study 2 investigated discrepancies between the results of Study 1 and those of previous studies by further examining the role of social desirability bias. Study 3 assessed the documentarys effectiveness in a new population anticipated to be more responsive and upon enhancing the intervention content. We found that the documentary did not decrease reported MAP consumption when potential social desirability bias was minimized (Studies 1 and 3). The documentary also did not affect consumption among participants whose demographics suggested they might be more receptive (Study 3). However, the documentary did substantially increase intentions to reduce consumption, consistent with past studies (Studies 2 and 3). Overall, we conclude that some past studies of similar interventions may have overestimated effects due to methodological biases.

During the first wave of the pandemic, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Canada and USA presented an early spread, a heavy COVID-19 burden, and low initial public health response until lockdowns. In a context when testing was limited, we calculated the basic reproduction number (R0) in 63 regions from the growth in regional death counts. After adjusting for population density, early spread of the epidemic, and age structure, temperature and humidity were negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. A reduction of mean absolute humidity by 1 g/m3 was associated with a 0.15-unit increase of R0. Below 10 C, a temperature reduction of 1 C was associated with a 0.16-unit increase of R0. Our results confirm a dependency of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility to weather conditions in the absence of control measures during the first wave. The transition from summer to winter, corresponding to drop in temperature associated with an overall decrease in absolute humidity, likely contributed to the intensification of the second wave in north-west hemisphere countries.

This study aimed to develop and validate a multimodal screening tool that aids in predicting the disease confirmation in emergency situations and patients with OHCA during a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter observational study of adult patients with OHCA in Daegu, Korea. To identify the potential predictors that could be used in screening tools in the emergency department, we applied logistic regression to data collected from March 1 to March 14. The prediction performance of the screening variables was then assessed and validated on the data of patients with OHCA who were treated between February 19 and March 31, 2020. General patient characteristics and hematological findings of the COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive groups were compared. We also evaluated confirmation test criteria as predictors for COVID-19 positivity in patients with OHCA. RESULTS: Advanced age, body temperature, and abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) revealed significant predictive ability in the derivation cohort. Of the 184 adult patients with OHCA identified in the validation cohort, 80 patients were included in the analysis. Notably, 9 patients were positive and 71 were negative on the COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Five patients (55.6%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a fever before OHCA, and 12 (16.9%) of the COVID-19-negative group had a fever before OHCA (P = 0.018). Eight patients (88.9%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a CXR indicating pneumonic infiltration. Of the criteria for predicting COVID-19, fever or an abnormal CXR had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 65.4 ??100) and a specificity of 22.5% (95% CI: 13.5 ??34.0). CONCLUSION: The screening tools that combined fever or abnormal CXR had a good discriminatory ability for COVID-19 infection in adult patients with OHCA. Therefore, during the COVID-19 outbreak period, it is recommended to suspect COVID-19 infection and perform COVID-19 test if patients present with a history of fever or show abnormal findings in postmortem CXR.","output":"Confirmation of COVID-19 in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients and Postmortem Management in the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appearance of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV?2) poses challenges in ophthalmology particularly for eye banks.

Here we investigate the experience of people, or parents of children with a diagnosed mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder (MRCD) in the management of their disease. The work complements ongoing projects around implementation of consensus recommendations for management of people with MRCD. People with or caring for a child with a formally diagnosed MRCD were invited to take part in an hour-long focus group held via videoconference. Questions elicited experiences of receiving management advice or information specific to their MRCD in four areas drawn from the consensus recommendations: diet and supplements, exercise, access to social services, and mental health. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive coding. RESULTS: Focus groups were conducted with 20 participants from five Australian states in JuneCSeptember 2020. Fourteen adults with a MRCD (three of whom also had a child with a MRCD), and six who cared for a child with a MRCD took part. The overarching finding was that of the need for ongoing negotiation to access the advice and service required to manage their condition. The nature of these negotiations varied across contexts but mostly related to joint decision-making, and more commonly, the need to advocate for their care with non-specialist services (e.g., dieticians, schools). The effort required for this self-advocacy was a prominent theme. While most participants reported receiving adequate advice around supplements, and to a lesser extent diet and exercise, the majority reported no formal advice around mental health or practical assistance accessing social services. CONCLUSION: These focus groups have revealed several gaps in the system for people with a MRCD, interacting with care providers after diagnosis. Focus group participants had to negotiate with a range of different stakeholders in order to secure appropriate advice or services. Notable was the gap in appropriate generalist services (e.g., dieticians) with sufficient knowledge of MRCD to support people with their day-to-day challenges.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compared the prediction performance with several more traditional machine learning algorithms, such as the regression tree, support vector regression, and random forest regression, and deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM and Bi-LSTM. Our proposed ensemble deep learning approach outperformed the compared models in forecasting exchange rates in terms of prediction error. However, the performance of the model significantly varied during non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods across currencies, indicating the essential role of prediction models in periods of highly volatile foreign currency markets.

Here, we evaluate the suitability of DBS for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by comparing several antibody responses between paired plasma and DBS from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We found that DBS not only reflected plasma antibody binding by ELISA and epitope profiles using phage-display, but also yielded SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers that highly correlated with paired plasma. Neutralization measurement was further streamlined by adapting assays to a high-throughput 384-well format.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether CRS is associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. METHODS: Altogether, 219,959 adult patients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral) were identified in this nested case-control study with propensity score matching. Data on SARS-CoV-2 test results and COVID-19 worsened outcomes (ie, the need for oxygen therapy, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation, and death) were obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea. RESULTS: In this matched cohort, 380 of 12,217 patients with CRS (3.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with 310 patients without CRS (2.5%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42). Moreover, 60 of 286 COVID-19 patients with CRS (21.0%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes, compared with 38 without CRS (13.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.71). Subgroup analysis identified that CRS patients with an absence of nasal polyps, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, or nonatopic type had a greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRS, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, the absence of nasal polyps, or nonatopic type was associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in the Korean nationwide cohort.

Additional 87 NPA specimens were collected from healthy children for routine examination on the physical examination center, and the clinical data were collected. Multiplex PCR was applied to detect 16 kinds of viruses from NPA and CSF. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was applied to detect 13 viruses from CSF and to analyze the clinical data of positive cases. RESULT There were 209 samples (59.9%) of the 349 NPA specimens were positive for viruses, which included 117 cases positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 60 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 20 for influenza virus A (Inf A), 10 for adenovirus (ADV), 6 for parainfluenza virus type 3(PIV-3), 6 for human Boca virus (HBoV), 5 for influenza virus C(Inf C), 4 for parainfluenza virus type 4(PIV-4), 4 for human coronavirus-HKU1/OC43, 3 for influenza virus B (Inf B), 3 for WU Polyomavirus (WUPyV), 2 parainfluenza virus type 1(PIV-1), 2 human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and 1 human coronavirus-NL63/229E.

DESIGN Multisite pragmatic randomized clinical trial. SETTING Three hospitals in North Carolina from January 2019 to March 2020. PATIENTS Eligible patients hospitalized for suspected sepsis and deemed high-risk for mortality or readmission by validated internal risk models. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive usual care alone (i.e., routine transition support, outpatient care; n = 342) or additional Sepsis Transition And Recovery support (n = 349). The 30-day intervention involved a multicomponent transition service led by a nurse navigator through telephone and electronic health record communication to facilitate best practice postsepsis care strategies during and after hospitalization including: postdischarge medication review, evaluation for new impairments or symptoms, monitoring comorbidities, and palliative care approach when appropriate. Clinical oversight was provided by a Hospital Medicine Transition Services team. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was a composite of mortality or hospital readmission at 30 days. Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate marginal and conditional odds ratios (adjusted for prognostic covariates: age, comorbidity, and organ dysfunction at enrollment). Among 691 randomized patients (mean age = 63.7  15.1 yr; 52% female), a lower percentage of patients in the Sepsis Transition And Recovery group experienced the primary outcome compared with the usual care group (28.7% vs 33.3%; risk difference, 4.7%; odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.58-1.11; adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98).

Aiming at investigating precarious settlements in Amazon, this study is guided by the following questions: For the Brazilian Amazon region, is it possible to identify areas of precarious settlements by combining geoprocessing and remote sensing techniques? Are there different typologies of precarious settlements distinguishable by their spatial arrangements? Thus, we developed a methodology for identifying precarious settlements and subsequently classifying them into urban fabric typologies (UFT), choosing the cities of Altamira, Camet, and Marab as study sites. Our classification model utilized geographic objects-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and data mining of spectral data from WPM sensor images from the CBERS-4A satellite, jointly with texture metrics, context metrics, biophysical index, voluntary geographical information, and neighborhood relationships. With the C5.0 decision tree algorithm we carried out variable selection and classification of these geographic objects. Our estimated models show accuracy above 90% when applied to the study sites. Additionally, we described Amazonian UFT in six types to be identified.

In scenarios with higher positivity rates and a greater impact of the infection on health and the use of health resources, these results could be up to ten times higher (130.24 per test performed or 69,565.59 per positive detected). Conclusion: In the context of COVID-19, preventive actions carried out by the private sector to safeguard industrial production also have concomitant public benefits in the form of savings in healthcare costs. Thus, governmental bodies need to recognize the value of implementing such strategies in private settings and facilitate them through, for example, subsidies.","output":"Impact of Mass Workplace COVID-19 Rapid Testing on Health and Healthcare Resource Savings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite considerable improvements in vaccination coverage over the last decade, half of the worlds unvaccinated and undervaccinated children are located in Africa. The role of institutional trust in explaining vaccination gaps has been highlighted in several qualitative reports but so far has only been quantified in a small number of high-income countries. METHODS: We matched information on child vaccination status from the Demographic Health Surveys with information on institutional trust from the Afrobarometer surveys at the subnational level. A total of 166 953 children from 41 surveys administered in 22 African countries covering 216 subnational regions were used. Based on a principal component analysis, we constructed an institutional mistrust index that combined the level of mistrust in the head of state, parliament, electoral system, courts and local government. Associations between institutional mistrust and child vaccination uptake were assessed with multivariable fixed effects logistic regressions that controlled for time-invariant subnational region characteristics and various child, caregiver, household and community characteristics. RESULTS: A 1 SD increase in the institutional mistrust index was associated with a 10% (95% CI of ORs: 1.03 to 1.18) increase in the likelihood that a child had not received any of eight basic vaccines and with a 6% decrease in the likelihood a child had received all of the basic vaccines (95% CI: 0.92 to 0.97). Institutional mistrust was negatively associated with the likelihood that a child had received each of the eight basic vaccinations (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Child vaccination rates in Africa are considerably lower in areas in which the local population displays high levels of mistrust towards local authorities. Institutional mistrust is an important dimension of vaccine hesitancy, considered as one of the most important threats to global health. Empowering local authorities with resources and communication strategies to address institutional mistrust may be needed to close the remaining vaccination gaps in Africa.","output":"Institutional mistrust and child vaccination coverage in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ARTIC Network provides a common resource of PCR primer sequences and recommendations for amplifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses. ImportanceARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations. In this report, we compare the results of sequencing a matched set of samples with the V3 and V4 primer sets. We find that adoption of the ARTIC V4 primer set is critical for accurate sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The absence of metadata describing the primer scheme used will negatively impact the downstream use of publicly available SARS-Cov-2 sequencing reads and assembled genomes.","output":"Analysis of the ARTIC version 3 and version 4 SARS-CoV-2 primers and their impact on the detection of the G142D amino acid substitution in the spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There has been a substantial scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE) in several countries during the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Nurses in Indonesia also experience a shortage of PPE as the number of COVID-19 patients in Indonesia continues to increase. There is no accurate data yet regarding the exact number of PPE scarcity for nurses. AIM: This study aimed to describe the availability of PPE and adverse consequences long-term used off the PPE and examine the relationship between shortage PPE and nurse behavior response in Indonesia. METHODS: An online-based survey was used to collect data on the nurse, regardless of their discipline, training background, or degree of experience, who are directly involved in managing COVID-19 patients. In this study, a total of 211 questionnaires were gathered. The survey was conducted using the Google form. This study employs univariate and bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Most of the mask N95 provision reaches up to 80%. The second is the hazmat (71%) and the lowest in the gloves (30%). Around 71% of respondents generally resist removing their PPE until the shift is complete. Then, 62% of the respondents are ready to propose to the leaders of the PPE, and 51% show that they are modifying the PPE. Nasal blisters are the most prevalent type of injury sustained by nurses while wearing PPE (86%), followed by headaches and dehydration. This study found that most respondents (60.7%) with insufficient PPE had a positive behavior reaction, whereas just 18% had a poor behavior reaction.

Triterpenoids, a group of bioactive phytochemicals, have been tested for antibiofilm activity against model biofilm forming bacteria in recent times. In this context, glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA), representing three categorically distinct groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, are targeted for profiling their impact on Vibrio cholerae C6709 biofilms. The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. Albeit total extracellular proteolytic activity remained unaffected by the triterpenoids, GRA treatment resulted in considerable reduction of extracellular gelatinase activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated potential interaction with cyclic di-GMP sensor VpsT, autoinducer-2 sensor kinase LuxP-LuxQ and transcriptional activator HapR, component of complex quorum sensing networks modulating biofilm formation.

Other violent conflicts that have plagued the country are religious conflicts in Kano, Bauchi, Kaduna, Kafanchan, Zaria, Jos, Maiduguri, and many other places. Blood-letting in the name of religion in these and other places in Nigeria has left thousands dead and wounded. Destruction of property in the course of religious violence in Nigeria has also wreaked economic calamity on the country.

She had been treated with 42 doses of denosumab between August 2013 and March 2020 and 8 months after her last dose of denosumab developed symptomatic hypercalcemia. Parathyroid hormone levels were suppressed, and active malignancy was excluded based on biochemical and radiological testing. She required treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates on three separate occasions in order to achieve long-term normalization of her hypercalcemia.

However, it has certain disadvantages which may be overcome by gargling. The primary objective of this study was to assess agreement between gargle lavage and swab as an appropriate respiratory sample for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective was to assess the patient acceptability of the two sampling methods. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study done at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India, on 50 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Paired swab (NPS and OPS) and gargle samples were taken within 72 h of their diagnosis. Samples were processed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Post-sample collection, a 10-point scale was administered to assess the level of discomfort with either of the collection methods. Results: All gargle samples were positive and comparable to their corresponding swab samples irrespective of the symptoms and duration of illness. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for gargle samples were slightly higher but comparable to those of swabs. Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the two methods. Majority (72%) of the patients reported moderate-to-severe discomfort with swab collection in comparison to 24 per cent reporting only mild discomfort with gargle collection. Interpretation & conclusions: Our preliminary results show that the gargle lavage may be a viable alternative to swabs for sample collection for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Adoption of gargle lavage for sample collection will have a significant impact as it will enable easy self-collection, relieve healthcare workers and also lead to substantial cost savings by reducing the need for swabs and personal protective equipment.","output":"Gargle lavage as a viable alternative to swab for detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundGenomic surveillance is essential for monitoring the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is the starting point for SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing. However, testing rates in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are low (mean = 27 tests/100,000 people/day) and global testing rates are falling in the post-crisis phase of the pandemic, leading to spatiotemporal biases in sample collection. Various public health agencies and academic groups have produced recommendations on sample sizes and sequencing strategies for effective genomic surveillance. However, these recommendations assume very high volumes of diagnostic testing that are currently well beyond reach in most LMICs. MethodsTo investigate how testing rates, sequencing strategies and the degree of spatiotemporal bias in sample collection impact variant detection and monitoring outcomes, we used an individual-based model to simulate COVID-19 epidemics in a prototypical LMIC. Within the model, we simulated a range of testing rates, accounted for likely testing demand and applied various genomic surveillance strategies, including sentinel surveillance. FindingsDiagnostic testing rates play a substantially larger role in monitoring the prevalence and emergence of new variants than the proportion of samples sequenced. To enable timely detection and monitoring of emerging variants, programs should achieve average testing rates of at least 100 tests/100,000 people/day and sequence 5-10% of test-positive specimens, which may be accomplished through sentinel or other routine surveillance systems. Under realistic assumptions, this averages to [~]10 samples for sequencing/1,000,000 people/week. InterpretationFor countries where testing capacities are low and sample collection is spatiotemporally biased, surveillance programs should prioritize investments in wider access to diagnostic testing to enable more representative sampling, ahead of simply increasing quantities of sequenced samples.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGenomic sequencing has been an integral part of the COVID-19 pandemic response, critical to monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and identifying novel variants of interest and variants of concern (VOCs). As of March 2022, more than 10 million unique sequences had been submitted to GISAID. However, SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been disproportionately submitted from high-income countries (HICs), with large surveillance gaps existing in most LMICs. To strengthen genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, previous studies focused on estimating a minimal number of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests to reflex for sequencing for effective variant detection and monitoring. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar using combinations of search terms (i.e., \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"diagnostic\\", \\"genomic surveillance\\", \\"sequencing\\", \\"LIC\\", \\"LMIC\\") and critically considered published articles and preprints that studied or reviewed SARS-CoV-2 testing and genomic surveillance, especially in the LMIC context. We also reviewed SARS-CoV-2 sequencing recommendations published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We reviewed all studies and the latest recommendations published in English up to February 2022. We found that prevailing recommendations for estimating sequencing sample size to identify or monitor the prevalence of new variants assume that COVID-19 testing is performed at high rates per capita and in high absolute numbers, such that the sequenced samples are largely representative of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viral diversity. This is, however, not the case in many countries, particularly in many LMICs, and can vary dramatically depending on the epidemiological situation. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study that quantitatively estimates the joint impact of COVID-19 testing rates and sequencing strategies on SARS-CoV-2 variant detection and monitoring. We developed an individual-based COVID-19 transmission model that was specifically designed to simulate VOC emergence in LMICs under a wide range of test availability and sampling strategies for sequencing. We showed that given the current average COVID-19 testing rate of 27 tests per 100,000 people per day across LMICs, the sequencing sample size recommendations for early variant detection from WHO/ECDC and other academic groups would likely result in delayed detection of a new VOC until it had spread through a substantial portion of the population. We quantitatively demonstrated that increasing COVID-19 testing rates to at least 100 tests per 100,000 people per day, including through sentinel surveillance sites, and sampling as broadly as possible, yields far earlier VOC detection and greater accuracy of variant prevalence estimates than simply increasing the proportion of samples to be sequenced. Implications of the available evidenceSpatiotemporal representativeness of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples being sequenced, which can be accomplished by increasing diagnostic testing rates, and widening the geographic coverage from where samples are collected, as well as shortening sequencing turnaround time are the key features of an effective genomic surveillance program aimed at detection and monitoring of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Only once these areas have been strengthened does increasing the volume of sequenced samples have significant impact.","output":"Low testing rates limit the ability of genomic surveillance programs to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ischemic heart disease is currently a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.

We examined the impacts of TLTs on future graft function using our histological TLT maturity stages and the association between TLTs and Banff pathologic scores. We also analyzed the risk factors for the development of TLTs Methods: Serial protocol biopsy samples (0-hour, 1-, 6-, and 12-months) without rejection were retrospectively analyzed from 214 patients who underwent living donor kidney transplantation. TLTs were defined as lymphocyte aggregates with signs of proliferation and their stages were determined by the absence (stage I) or presence (stage II) of follicular dendritic cells. Results: Only 4% of patients exhibited TLTs at the 0-hour biopsy. Prevalence increased to almost 50% at the 1-month biopsy and then slightly further for 12 months. The proportion of advanced stage II TLTs increased gradually, reaching 19% at the 12-month biopsy. Presence of stage II TLTs was associated with higher risk of renal function decline after transplantation compared to patients with no TLT or stage I TLTs. Stage II TLTs were associated with more severe tubulitis and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy at 12 months and predicted poorer graft function independently from the degree of interstitial inflammation. Pre-transplantation rituximab treatment dramatically attenuated the development of stage II TLTs. Conclusions: TLTs are commonly found in clinically stable transplanted kidneys.

While this clinical spectrum is well documented, its immunologic underpinnings are less clear. We have therefore, initiated studies of the B cell responses as they would participate in both early effector responses and in the initiation of memory formation. In terms of effector responses, we were particularly interested in the engagement and clinical correlates of the extra-follicular pathway (EF), we recently described in flaring SLE. In this systemic autoimmune disease, the EF pathway is initiated by newly activated naive B cell (aN) leading to large expansion of autoantibody-producing antibody-secreting cells through the generation of an epigenetically primed B cell precursor which are double negative (DN) for naive (IgD) and memory markers (CD27) and lacking expression of CXCR5 and CD21 (DN2). These highly activated D2 cells are also distinguished by high expression of CD11c and T-bet and are TLR7-driven. Both, TLR7-stimulation which is triggered by ssRNA and the central role played by their murine counterparts (typically characterized as Age-Associated B cells), in viral clearance, strongly supported the hypothesis that DN2 cells and the global EF pathway could be prominently engaged in COVID-19 patients. Also of note, EF B cell activation is particularly prominent in SLE patients of African-American ancestry, a population disproportionately represented in severe COVID-19. In this study we find that critically-ill patients with COVID-19 robustly upregulate constituents of the extrafollicular pathway, produce enormous numbers of antibody secreting cells, and lose unique transitional B cell populations that correlate with positive prognosis. This patient cluster associates tightly with biomarkers of poor outcomes and exhibits high rates of mortality. Thus, this B cell phenotype might serve as an immunological marker of severe COVID infection at early stages and could therefore identify a patient subset likely to benefit from targeted immunomodulatory therapy aimed at alleviating disease burden.","output":"Critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients display lupus-like hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the rapid evolution of the Aerosol Box, originally designed by Dr Hsien Yung Lai, Mennonite Christian Hospital, Taiwan [1].

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to infect and damage ciliated epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. In alveoli, gas exchange occurs across an epithelial-endothelial barrier that ties respiration to endothelial cell (EC) regulation of edema, coagulation and inflammation. How SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates vascular functions to cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients remains an enigma focused on dysregulated EC responses. Whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects functions of the endothelium remains to be resolved and critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that primary human ECs lack ACE2 receptors at protein and RNA levels, and that SARS-CoV-2 is incapable of directly infecting ECs derived from pulmonary, cardiac, brain, umbilical vein or kidney tissues. In contrast, pulmonary ECs transduced with recombinant ACE2 receptors are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and result in high viral titers (1107/ml), multinucleate syncytia and EC lysis. SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2-expressing ECs elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. The inability of SARS-CoV-2 to directly infect and lyse ECs without ACE2 expression explains the lack of vascular hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients and indicates that the endothelium is not a primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 indirectly activating EC programs that regulate thrombosis and endotheliitis in COVID-19 patients, and focus strategies on therapeutically targeting epithelial and inflammatory responses that activate the endothelium or initiate limited ACE2 independent EC infection. Importance SARS-CoV-2 infects pulmonary epithelial cells through ACE2 receptors and causes ARDS. COVID-19 causes progressive respiratory failure resulting from diffuse alveolar damage and systemic coagulopathy, thrombosis and capillary inflammation that tie alveolar responses to EC dysfunction. This has prompted theories that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects ECs through ACE2 receptors, yet SARS-CoV-2 antigen has not been co-localized with ECs and prior studies indicate that ACE2 co-localizes with alveolar epithelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, not ECs. Here we demonstrate that primary human ECs derived from lung, kidney, heart, brain and umbilical veins require expression of recombinant ACE2 receptors in order to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 lytically infects ACE2-ECs and elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis resulting from indirect EC activation, or infection of a small subset of ECs by an ACE2 independent mechanism, that transform rationales and targets for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Recombinant ACE2 Expression is Required for SARS-CoV-2 to Infect Primary Human Endothelial Cells and Induce Inflammatory and Procoagulative Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, bronchiectasis asthma and COVID-19 are difficult to treat owing to viscous secretions in the airways that evade mucocilliary clearance.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic's magnitude. Findings suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic more rapidly under control.","output":"Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: zoonotic vs. human to human transmission, China, 2019-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection represent a clinical challenge because they encompass a broad neurological spectrum and may occur before the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: In this monocentric retrospective case series, medical records from patients with acute neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from medicine departments of an academic center in Paris area were collected between March 15th and May 15th 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained through specific RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs or based on circulating serum IgG antibodies. Results: Twenty-six patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with neurological disorders: encephalitis (N=8), encephalopathy (N=6), cerebrovascular events (ischemic strokes N=4 and vein thromboses N=2), other central nervous system (CNS) disorders (N=4), and Guillain-Barr syndrome (N=2). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was delayed on average 1.6 days after the onset of neurological disorder, especially in case of encephalitis 3.9 days, encephalopathy 1.0 day, and cerebrovascular event 2.7 days. Conclusions: Our study confirms that COVID-19 can yield a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. Because neurological presentations of COVID-19 often occur a few days before the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection, clinicians should take preventive measures such as patient isolation and masks for any new admission to avoid nosocomial infections.

G6PD-deficient cells experience a high level of oxidative stress and an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator in the regulation of viral replication and inflammatory response. In the current study, the role of G6PD on the inflammatory response was determined in both scramble control and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells upon tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) stimulation. A decreased expression pattern of induced COX-2 and reduced production of downstream PGE(2) occurred upon TNF- stimulation in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control A549 cells. TNF--induced antiviral activity revealed that decreased COX-2 expression enhanced the susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells and was a result of the decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-B. The impaired inflammatory response in G6PD-kd A549 cells was found to be mediated through NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling as elucidated by cell pretreatment with a NOX2-siRNA or NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). In addition, NOX activity with TNF- treatment in G6PD-kd A549 cells was not up-regulated and was coupled with a decrease in NOX subunit expression at the transcriptional level, implying that TNF--mediated NOX signaling requires the participation of G6PD. Together, these data suggest that G6PD deficiency affects the cellular inflammatory response and the decreased TNF--mediated antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells is a result of dysregulated NOX/MAPK/NF-B/COX-2 signaling.","output":"Diminished COX-2/PGE(2)-Mediated Antiviral Response Due to Impaired NOX/MAPK Signaling in G6PD-Knockdown Lung Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and associated with worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of AKI in patients with COVID-19 in a large UK tertiary centre. Methods: : We analysed data of consecutive adults admitted with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 across two sites of a hospital in London, UK, from 1st January to 13th May 2020. Results: Of the 1248 inpatients included, 487 (39%) experienced AKI (51% stage 1, 13% stage 2,and 36% stage 3). The weekly AKI incidence rate gradually increased to peak at week 5 (3.12 cases/100 patient-days), before reducing to its nadir (0.83 cases/100 patient-days) at the end the study period (week 10). Among AKI survivors, 84.0% had recovered renal function to pre-admission levels before discharge and none required on-going renal replacement therapy (RRT). Pre-existing renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 3.05, 95%CI 2.24-4,18;p<0.0001], and inpatient diuretic use (OR 1.79, 95%CI 1.27-2.53;p<0.005) were independently associated with a higher risk for AKI.

Methods: This study was carried out in Zacatecas, Mexico, and it included 705 hospitalized patients with suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data were collected, and the CCI score was calculated online using the calculator from the Sociedad Andaluza de Medicina Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias; the result was evaluated as mortality predictor among the patients with COVID-19. Results: 377 patients were positive for SARS-COV-2. Obesity increased the risk of intubation among the study population (odds ratio (OR) = 2.59; 95 CI: 1.36C4.92; p = 0.003). The CCI values were higher in patients who died because of COVID-19 complications than those observed in patients who survived (p < 0.001). Considering a CCI cutoff > 31.69, the area under the ROC curve was 0.75, with a sensitivity and a specificity of 63.6% and 87.7%, respectively.

METHOD: In this randomised controlled study conducted at a tertiary-care hospital, 66 pregnant women who had nightly PGP were enrolled to receive standard treatment with the mattress and pillow (intervention group, n = 34) or solely standard treatment (control group, n = 32). The primary outcome was change in nightly posterior PGP on a visual analogue scale, VAS from baseline to 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes include nightly anterior PGP, the evening PGP score, estimated sleep duration, number of nightly wake-ups, daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), function (Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire), health-related quality of life, and pain catastrophizing. RESULTS: Forty-four women (67%) completed the treatment. The difference in nightly posterior pain intensity was significantly different in favour of the intervention group (VAS, 16.5 mm (95% CI 1.4:31.6) p = 0.028). Sleep duration increased within both groups (intervention group: 26 min, p = 0.022; control group: 14 min, p = 0.014) and the difference between groups was significant (p = 0.046). In addition, the intervention group indicated a decreased evening PGP intensity (p = 0.008) and fewer nightly wake-ups (p = 0.049). The control group showed a deterioration in function (Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire) (p = 0.018) and an increase in daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale) (p = 0.021) from baseline to 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, significantly lower nightly posterior PGP intensity was noted after the use of a mattress and pillow as an adjunct to standard treatment. Nightly PGP can have adverse effects on various aspects of the health and quality of life of pregnant women, and although the results of this study should be interpreted with caution considering the high drop-out rate and the inadequate statistical power, the findings indicate the potential for the use of such interventions to improve PGP in pregnant women.","output":"Effects of a New Mattress and Pillow and Standard Treatment for Nightly Pelvic Girdle Pain in Pregnant Women: A Randomised Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging diseases of wildlife origin are increasingly spilling over into humans and domestic animals.

LPS induced Tet2 expression in mouse macrophages and human monocytes in vitro, as well as in human alveolar macrophages after bronchial instillation in vivo. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from myeloid Tet2 deficient (Tet2(fl/fl)LysM(Cre)) mice displayed enhanced production of IL-1, IL-6 and CXCL1 upon stimulation with several Toll-like receptor agonists; similar results were obtained with LPS stimulated alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Histone deacetylation was involved in the effect of Tet2 on IL-6 production, whilst methylation at the Il6 promoter was not altered by Tet2 deficiency.

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, public transport operators are experiencing steep declines in demand and fare revenues due to the perceived risk of infection within vehicles and other facilities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of implementing social distancing in public transport in line with epidemiological advice. Social distancing requires effective demand management to keep vehicle occupancy rates under a predefined threshold, both spatially and temporally. We review the literature of five demand management methods enabled by new information and ticketing technologies: (i) inflow control with queueing, (ii) time and space dependent pricing, (iii) capacity reservation with advance booking, (iv) slot auctioning, and (v) tradeable travel permit schemes. Thus the paper collects the relevant literature into a single point of reference, and provides interpretation from the viewpoint of practical applicability during and after the pandemic.","output":"Social distancing in public transport: mobilising new technologies for demand management under the Covid-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility of minimally invasive digestive anastomosis using a modular flexible magnetic anastomotic device made up of a set of two flexible chains of magnetic elements. The assembly possesses a non-deployed linear configuration which allows it to be introduced through a dedicated small-sized applicator into the bowel where it takes the deployed form. A centering suture allows the mating between the two parts to be controlled in order to include the viscerotomy between the two magnetic rings and the connected viscera. METHODS AND PROCEDURES Eight pigs were involved in a 2-week survival experimental study. In five colorectal anastomoses, the proximal device was inserted by a percutaneous endoscopic technique, and the colon was divided below the magnet. The distal magnet was delivered transanally to connect with the proximal magnet. In three jejunojejunostomies, the first magnetic chain was injected in its linear configuration through a small enterotomy. Once delivered, the device self-assembled into a ring shape. A second magnet was injected more distally through the same port. The centering sutures were tied together extracorporeally and, using a knot pusher, magnets were connected. Ex vivo strain testing to determine the compression force delivered by the magnetic device, burst pressure of the anastomosis, and histology were performed. RESULTS Mean operative time including endoscopy was 69.2  21.9 min, and average time to full patency was 5 days for colorectal anastomosis. Operative times for jejunojejunostomies were 125, 80, and 35 min, respectively. The postoperative period was uneventful. Burst pressure of all anastomoses was  110 mmHg. Mean strain force to detach the devices was 6.1  0.98 and 12.88  1.34 N in colorectal and jejunojejunal connections, respectively. Pathology showed a mild-to-moderate inflammation score. CONCLUSIONS The modular magnetic system showed enormous potential to create minimally invasive digestive anastomoses, and may represent an alternative to stapled anastomoses, being easy to deliver, effective, and low cost.","output":"A modular magnetic anastomotic device for minimally invasive digestive anastomosis: proof of concept and preliminary data in the pig model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the introduction of fibula flap as a reconstructive technique, an evolution of indications has been observed.

Despite previous research highlighting the vulnerability of children in these families, they are, as yet, often overlooked in healthcare. Efforts are needed to better support children in families living with ALS, both directly and through strengthening parents in their parental role. This study sought to gain a better understanding of parental and childrens experiences, struggles and support needs in families living with ALS. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 parents with ALS, 13 well parents and 15 children, together representing 17 families. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified relating to (1) ALS-related transformations in families homes, activities, roles and relationships, that trigger (2) distress among families, which, in turn, evokes (3) emotional, psychological, educational and practical support needs. For emotional and practical support, parents and children mainly rely on their own family and social network, whereas they seek educational and psychological support from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that ALS care professionals may foster family adjustment to living with ALS, most notably through encouraging parents to engage in a dialogue with their children about the many transformations, struggles and needs imposed by ALS and teaching them how to start the dialogue.

Attaining this profound understanding is critical for the effective containment and treatment of infections caused by the virus. In this review, we present some possible mechanisms by which psychopathological symptoms emerge following viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS). These proposed mechanisms are based on microbial communication and the induced priming of microglial antibody activation within the CNS through Toll-like receptor signaling. In this process, chronic microglial activation causes increased glutamate release in virally-altered, high-density neuronal structures, thereby modulating cognitive networks and information integration processes. This modulation, in turn, we suggest, affects the accuracy of sensory integration and connectivity of major control networks, such as the default mode network. The chronic activation of immunological responses and neurochemical shifts toward an elevated glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid ratio lead to negative reinforcement learning and suboptimal organismic functioning, for example, maintaining the body in an anxious state, which can later become internalized as trait anxiety. Therefore, we hypothesize that the homeostatic relationship between host, microbiome, and virome, would be decisive in determining the efficiency of subsequent immunological responses, disease susceptibility, and long-term psychopathological effects of diseases that impact the CNS, such as the COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2, Trait Anxiety, and the Microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the most relevant elements contributing to define the One World One Health programme we find epidemics. The reason is that in recent decades, infectious diseases such as HIV/SIDA, SARS and Influenza have shown that we need new approaches and concepts in order to understand how biological emergencies and health alerts deploy new scales of action. Especially relevant has been the case of A(H1N1) influenza. This reached the status of global threat virtually from its onset, triggering an international response with a diffusion, visibility and rapidity unparalleled in previous health alerts. This article maintains that this global condition cannot be explained solely by the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease, such as mortality rate, severe cases, propagation capacity, etc. Resorting to the approach proposed by the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this paper suggests that the action of certain socio-technical operators was what built a heterogeneous network of ideas, concepts and materials that turned the A (H1N1) influenza into a global-scale phenomenon with unprecedented speed. Among these operators, the most important ones were: the speaking position, a discourse about threat, the protocols and guidelines that were used and, lastly, the maps that allowed a real-time monitoring of the influenza. The paper ends with the notion of panorama, as defined by Bruno Latour: a suggestion to describe the common denominator of the aforementioned operators, and a means to foresee the development of global scales for certain health alerts. The paper will conclude by proposing that this type of analysis would allow the One World One Health to understand with greater precision the dynamic of epidemics and thus make its principles of action much more specific as well as its definition of what global health should be.","output":"The global condition of epidemics: Panoramas in A (H1N1) influenza and their consequences for One World One Health programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging coronavirus threatening human health and the economy worldwide.

To address this limitation, we herein report a label-free electrochemical aptamer-based sensor for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by integrating aptamer-based specific recognition with CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated signal amplification. The sensing principle is based on the competitive binding of antigen and the preassembled Cas12a-crRNA complex to the antigen-specific aptamer, resulting in a change in the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a. To further generate an electrochemical signal, a DNA architecture was fabricated by in situ rolling circle amplification on a gold electrode, which serves as a novel substrate for Cas12a. Upon Cas12a-based collateral DNA cleavage, the DNA architecture was degraded, leading to a significant decrease in impedance that can be measured spectroscopically. Using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen as the model, the proposed CRISPR-Cas12a-based electrochemical sensor (CRISPR-E) showed excellent analytical performance for the quantitative detection of nucleocapsid antigen. Since in vitro selection can obtain aptamers selective for many SARS-CoV-2 antigens, the proposed strategy can expand this powerful CRISPR-E system significantly for quantitative monitoring of a wide range of COVID-19 biomarkers.","output":"CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated label-free electrochemical aptamer-based sensor for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with a range of respiratory symptoms.

A rapid and highly sensitive detection and quantification method for TSV and YHV was developed using the GeneAmp? 5700 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green chemistry. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mixture contained a fluorescent dye, SYBR Green, which exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon binding to double strand cDNA. The enhancement of fluorescence was found to be proportional to the initial concentration of the template cDNA. A linear relationship was observed between input plasmid DNA and cycle threshold (C T) values for 106 down to a single copy of both viruses. To control for the variation in sample processing and in reverse transcription reaction among samples, shrimp -actin and elongation factor-1 (EF-1) genes were amplified in parallel with the viral cDNA. The sensitivity and the efficiency of amplification of EF-1 was greater than -actin when compared to TSV and YHV amplification efficiency suggesting that EF-1 is a better internal control for the RT-PCR detection of TSV and YHV. In addition, sample to sample variation in EF-1 C T value was lower than the variation in -actin C T value of the corresponding samples. The specificity of TSV, YHV, EF-1 and -actin amplifications was confirmed by analyzing the dissociation curves of the target amplicon. The C T values of TSV and YHV samples were normalized against EF-1 C T values for determining the absolute copy number from the standard curve of the corresponding virus.

The median score (interquartile range, IQR) of every domain from AGREE II for evidence-based CPGs (EB-CPGs) versus (vs.) consensus-based CPG (CB-CPGs) was 81.94% (75.00C84.72) vs. 58.33% (52.78C68.06) in scope and purpose, 59.72% (38.89C75.00) vs. 36.11% (33.33C36.11) in stakeholder involvement, 64.58% (32.29C71.88) vs. 22.92% (16.67C26.56) in rigor of development, 75.00% (52.78C86.81) vs. 52.78% (50.00C63.89) in clarity of presentation, 40.63% (22.40C62.50) vs. 20.83% (13.54C25.00) in applicability, and 58.33% (50.00C100.00) vs. 50.00% (50.00C77.08) in editorial independence, respectively. The methodological quality of EB-CPGs were significantly superior to the CB-CPGs in the majority of domains (P < 0.05). There was no agreement on diagnosis criteria of COVID-19. But a few guidelines show Remdesivir may be beneficial for the patients, hydroxychloroquine +/C azithromycin may not, and there were more consistent suggestions regarding discharge management. For instance, after discharge, isolation management and health status monitoring may be continued. Conclusions: In general, the methodological quality of EB-CPGs is greater than CB-CPGs. However, it is still required to be further improved. Besides, the consistency of COVID-19 recommendations on topics such as diagnosis criteria is different. Of them, hydroxychloroquine +/C azithromycin may be not beneficial to treat patients with COVID-19, but remdesivir may be a favorable risk-benefit in severe COVID-19 infection; isolation management and health status monitoring after discharge may be still necessary.

The present study is a secondary analysis of the PRactice Of VENTilation in COVID-19 patients (PROVENT-COVID) in 22 intensive care unit hospitals in the Netherlands. Surrogates of impaired ventilation such as the estimated dead space fraction (by Harris-Benedict-VD/VT HB and direct method-VD/VT DIR), ventilatory ratio (VR), and end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio (PETCO2/PaCO2) were used. RESULTS 927 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 related ARDS were included in this study. Surrogates of impaired ventilation were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors at baseline and during the following days of mechanical ventilation (p &lt;0.001). As ARDS severity increased, mortality increased with successive tertiles for VD/VT HB and VD/VT DIR, and VR, and decreased with successive tertiles for PETCO2/PaCO2. Mortality over the first 28 days was higher in patients in the high group of dead space fraction by VD/VT HB (16.4% vs. 12.3%;p = 0.003), but similar in the groups considering the dead space fraction by VD/VT DIR (15.4% vs. 13.3%;p = 0.100), and VR (15.5% vs. 13.2%;p = 0.080) (Figure 2). After adjustment for a base risk model that included chronic comorbidities, ventilation and oxygenation parameters, none of the surrogates of impaired ventilation measured at the start of ventilation or the following days were significantly associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION Surrogate markers for impaired ventilation are abnormal at the start of invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS and worsen during consequent days. Ventilation impairment seems to be more extensive in non-survivors than in survivors, but they do not yield prognostic information when added to a baseline risk model.

Questions that remain to be addressed are the risk of transmission from humans-to-cats and cats-to-humans. Further data on household transmission and data on virus levels in both the environment around infected cats and their exhaled air could be a step towards assessing these risks.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number R0 in cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the introduction of the trivalent vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) more than 20 years ago, measles outbreaks have occurred in Europe, including Italy, due to its underutilization. In Italy mandatory vaccination was established in 2017 (Decree Law 119/2017). This study aimed at evaluating the impact of mandatory vaccination and determining the trend in vaccination coverage for measles and rubella in Italy. We retrieved data from the Annual Status Update, a form sent annually by the Italian National Verification Committee to the Regional Verification Committee for Europe, from 1(st) January 2013 to 31(st) December 2019. Since the beginning of 2013, 14,788 cases of measles have been reported, ranging from 256 (3.9 x 1,000,000) to 5,397 (88.4 x 1,000,000) compared to 259 rubella cases for the same period. From 2013 to 2015, vaccination coverage decreased for the first dose of measles (90.4% to 85.3%) and rubella vaccine (90.3% to 85.2%), but then it increased significantly, reinforced by the Italian Decree Law, reaching 94.4% in 2019. The trend for the second dose showed a decrease from 2013 to 2016 (84.1% to 82.2% for measles and 83.7% to 82.0% for rubella), but then increased significantly and reached 90.2% in 2019 for measles and 90.0% for rubella. The mandatory vaccination law has resulted in a significant increase in vaccination coverage for measles and rubella in Italy, and demonstrates encouraging progress toward the 95% target and the restriction of measles transmission. Special attention should be paid to maintaining and further improving vaccination coverage.","output":"Effect of the mandatory vaccination law on measles and rubella incidence and vaccination coverage in Italy (2013-2019)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A dual immunosensor is reported for the simultaneous determination of two important immunity-related cytokines: BAFF (B cell activation factor) and APRIL (a proliferation-induced signal).

Patients with such complex polyps should be referred promptly to expert centres for adjudication and management. Aims To review patterns of referral and initial management of complex polyps at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH), to identify gaps in care and to identify strategies to address those gaps. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of cases where large (>3cm) colonic polyps were evaluated at TOH, from March 2019-March 2021. Cases were identified using Canadian Institute of Health Information codes. Descriptive statistics were analyzed, and were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. Results 94 consecutive patients with large polyps (mean age 68;56.4% male) were included. The average polyp size was 4.7(4.4C5.1)cm. 45 patients were referred for a known complex polyp while the rest were referred for FIT/FOBT+ (n=20), symptoms or anemia (n=17), surveillance (n=9), or abnormal imaging (n=3). 32 patients were referred from >50km from Ottawa (travelling), and 62 were referred from <50km from Ottawa (local). Of the 45 referrals for known polyp, 20 (44.4%) included photodocumentation of the lesion;33 (73.3%) had a prior biopsy, and 8 (17.8%) were partially removed. Key statistics are summarized in Table 1. All 8 patients referred with a partially removed polyp eventually had a successful endoscopic polypectomy. 10/94 (10.6%) patients required surgical resection: 7 for malignant pathology, and 3 for endoscopic failure. Overall, 3 patients had post-polypectomy bleeding, and 1 patient sustained a full-thickness perforation. As of October 2021, 26/78 (33.3%) patients eligible for a 4C6 month recheck and 36/48 (75%) patients eligible for a 12-month follow-up colonoscopy were overdue. Conclusions This retrospective review highlights significant differences in the management of complex polyps based on patient geography and the need to develop strategies to improve access for patients referred from outside of Ottawa. As expected, COVID had a significant impact on the time to complete removal of polyps, and affected the timely endoscopic follow up of these high-risk patients. Strategies to ensure timely endoscopic follow up of patients after complex polyp removal are needed. Table 1.

Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains an ongoing global pandemic. It is an urgent challenge to clarify the innate recognition mechanism to control this virus. Here we show that retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) sufficiently restrains SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells in a type I/III interferon (IFN)-independent manner. RIG-I recognizes the 3' untranslated region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome via the helicase domains, but not the C-terminal domain. This new mode of RIG-I recognition does not stimulate its ATPase, thereby aborting the activation of the conventional mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein-dependent pathways, which is in accordance with lack of cytokine induction. Nevertheless, the interaction of RIG-I with the viral genome directly abrogates viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediation of the first step of replication. Consistently, genetic ablation of RIG-I allows lung cells to produce viral particles that expressed the viral spike protein. By contrast, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was restored by all-trans retinoic acid treatment through upregulation of RIG-I protein expression in primary lung cells derived from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, our findings demonstrate the distinctive role of RIG-I as a restraining factor in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells.","output":"RIG-I triggers a signaling-abortive anti-SARS-CoV-2 defense in human lung cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of imaging techniques and their increased use in clinical practice have led to a higher detection rate of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

Hence, this reports focuses on the description of a new protocol for the safe management of cytological samples processed by liquid-based cytology (LBC) with an evaluation of the changes in terms of morphology and immunoreactivity. METHODS: From March 11 to April 25, 2020, 414 cytological cases suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 were processed with a new virus-inactivating method suggested by Hologic, Inc, for all LBC specimens. RESULTS: The samples showed an increased amount of fibrin in the background. A slight decrease in cellular size was also observed in comparison with the standard method of preparation. Nonetheless, the nuclear details of the neoplastic cells were well identified, and the immunoreactivity of the majority of those cells was maintained.

This bioactive phytochemical compound is characterized by several proven strong pharmacological actions that may effectively contribute to the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19, with the antiviral activities being the leading ones. Some new studies predicted the possible inhibitory affinities of cordycepin against the principal SARS-CoV-2 protein targets (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, main protease (M(pro)) enzyme, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme) based on the computational approach.

To further characterize these unmet needs, we evaluated patients' experiences regarding the burden of PsA symptoms and disease impacts, and patients' preferences for treatment. METHODS: Patients from ArthritisPower, a rheumatology research registry, completed a web-based survey. Object case best-worst scaling (BWS) was used to evaluate the relative burden of 11 PsA-related symptoms and the relative importance of improvement in nine PsA-related disease impacts. BWS data were analyzed using a random-parameters logit model. Patient demographics, preferences for mode and frequency of therapy, and preferences for methotrexate were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Among the 332 participants, most were White (94%), female (80%), with mean age of 54 years (SD 11.4). In the BWS, joint pain was the most bothersome symptom, followed by other musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. The BWS for disease impacts found that improvements in the ability to perform physical activities were most important, followed by improvements in the ability to function independently, sleep quality, and the ability to perform daily activities. The most burdensome symptoms and desired disease impact improvements were similar in patients regardless of their experience with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The most preferred mode and frequency of treatment administration was oral, once-daily medication (preferred by 38% of respondents), and 74% prioritized therapies that significantly improved joint-related symptoms versus psoriasis-related symptoms. The majority of respondents (65%) preferred PsA treatment regimens that did not include methotrexate.

We investigate the conformation and aggregation of peptide RSAIEDLLFDKV, which is a sequence common to many animal and human coronavirus spike proteins. This sequence is part of a native -helical S2 glycoprotein domain, close to and partly spanning the fusion sequence. This peptide aggregates into -sheet amyloid nanotape structures close to the calculated pI = 4.2, but forms disordered monomers at high and low pH. The -sheet conformation revealed by FTIR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy leads to peptide nanotape structures, imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and probed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The nanotapes comprise arginine-coated bilayers. A Congo red dye UVCvis assay is used to probe the aggregation of the peptide into amyloid structures, which enabled the determination of a critical aggregation concentration (CAC). This peptide also forms hydrogels under precisely defined conditions of pH and concentration, the rheological properties of which were probed. The observation of amyloid formation by a coronavirus spike has relevance to the stability of the spike protein conformation (or its destabilization via pH change), and the peptide may have potential utility as a functional material.

The pandemic is the result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has demonstrated high rates of infectivity leading to great morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. At present, scientists are exploring various approaches to curb this pandemic and alleviate its health consequences, while racing to develop a vaccine. A particularly insidious aspect of COVID-19 is the delayed overactivation of the body's immune system that is manifested as the cytokine storm. This unbridled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can directly or indirectly cause massive organ damage and failure. Systemic vascular endothelial inflammation and thrombocytopenia are potential consequences as well. In the case of COVID-19, the cytokine storm often fits the pattern of the macrophage activation syndrome with lymphocytopenia. The basis for the imbalance between the innate and adaptive immune systems is not clearly defined, but highlights the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages. Here we discuss the potential underlying basis for the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on macrophages, both direct and indirect, and potential therapeutic targets. These include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferons, and CXCL10 (IP-10). Various biopharmaceuticals are being repurposed to target the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the rationale for activating the macrophage alpha 7 nicotinic receptors as a therapeutic target.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the number, type and outcome of radiological investigations for children presenting to hospital with suspected physical abuse (SPA; including abusive head trauma) during the first national COVID-19 enforced lockdown compared with the prelockdown period. DESIGN: Multicentre, retrospective, observational, interrupted time series analysis. SETTING: Eight secondary/tertiary paediatric centres between January 2018 and July 2020 inclusive. PARTICIPANTS: 1587 hospital assessed children undergoing radiographic skeletal surveys (SkS) and head CT imaging performed for SPA/child protection concerns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and severity of fractures identified on SkS; head injury (composed of incidence rates and ratios of skull fracture, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and hypoxic ischaemic injury (HII)) on head CT imaging; and ratio of antemortem and postmortem SkS. RESULTS: 1587 SkS were performed: 1282 (81%) antemortem, 762 (48%) male, and positive findings in 582 (37%). Median patient age was 6 months. There were 1.7 fractures/child prelockdown versus 1.1 fractures/child during lockdown. There was no difference between positive/negative SkS rates, the absolute ratio of antemortem/postmortem SkS or absolute numbers of head injury occurring between January 2018 and February 2020 and the lockdown period AprilCJuly 2020. Likewise, prelockdown incidence and rates of skull fracture 30/244 (12%), ICH 28/220 (13%) and HIE 10/205 (5%) were similar to lockdown, 142/1304 (11%), 171/1152 (15%) and 68/1089 (6%), respectively.

The questions referred to various aspects of the dental care needs of PLWH, together with data on the professional activities of the dentists. After signing the term of informed consent, the dentists were divided into six subgroups according to the time (in years) since completing their bachelors degree in dentistry. The data were presented as descriptive statistics and percentages, and then analyzed using the Kappa test. Most (70.6%; 36 of 51) of the dentists were female, the mean age of the dentists was 32.5 years, and a majority (80.2%) were based in the city of Belem; the mean time since graduation was 8.5 years, with 22 (43.1%) having more than 5 years of professional experience, and 31 (60.8%) having graduated from a private dental college.

The workshop primary outcomes were the rubric score and the time to complete a suture. These were correlated to student characteristics such as sex, year of studies, prior experience in suturing, previous participation in a similar workshop, previous training at home or in a hospital, and an interest in pursuing a surgical career. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was performed. Statistical analysis showed that gender and previous suturing experience did not impact the rubric score of students, nor the time required. The student year of studies, having recently passed the course of General Surgery and having interest to pursue a surgical specialization positively affected the students' score. Surgical peer teaching provided an effective method of teaching of the simple interrupted suturing technique.

Here, we summarize data on the baseline clinical characteristics and routine care available to patients at four clinics in Eastern Uganda as a prelude to a clinical trial. Methods: Between February and August 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients attending four SCD clinics in Mbale, Soroti, Atutur and Ngora, all in Eastern Uganda, the planned sites for an upcoming clinical trial (H-PRIME: ISRCTN15724013). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, diagnostic methods, clinic schedules, the use of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs, clinical complications and patient understanding of SCD were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Data were collected on 1829 patients. Their ages ranged from 0 to 64 years with a median (IQR) of 6 (3-11) years. 49.1% of participants were male. The majority (1151; 62.9%) reported a positive family history for SCD. Approximately half knew that SCD is inherited from both parents but a substantial proportion did not know how SCD is transmitted and small numbers believed that it is acquired by either transfusion or from other people. Only 118/1819 (6.5%) participants had heard about or were using hydroxyurea while 356/1794 (19.8%) reported stigmatization.

We collected 632 valid reports by developing an online questionnaire in China and employing judgement sampling of MSEs with fewer than 50 employees and annual operating income less than RMB 5 million. Then, we analysed the findings with partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results show that COVID-19 significantly impacted most Chinese MSEs and that most Chinese MSEs tend to borrow via IFS, but the amount and period of MSEs willingness to borrow should not be affected by the impacts of COVID-19 on MSEs. Rather, the explanation concerns the greater unfamiliarity or uncertainty concerning IFSs relative to traditional financial instruments.

For better understanding the viral spike (S) protein variations and its potential effects on the interaction with the host immune system and also in vaccine development, the cell epitopes, glycosylation profile and their changes during the global transmission course were characterized and compared with SARS-CoV for their glycosylation profile. We analyzed totally 7,813 sequences screened from 8,897 whole genome sequences on GISAID database up to April 26, and 18 S protein amino acid variations with relatively high frequency (&#8805;10-3) were identified. A total of 228 sequences of variants had multiple variations, of note, most of them harboring the D614G mutation. Among the predicted 69 linear B cell epitopes, 175 discontinuous B cell epitopes and 41 cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes in the viral S protein, we found that the protein structure and its potential function of some sites changed, such as the linear epitope length shortened and discontinuous epitope disappeared of G476S. In addition, we detected 9 predicted N-glycosylation sites and 3 O-glycosylation sites unique to SARS-CoV-2, but no evidently observed variation of the glycan sites so far. Our findings provided an important snapshot of temporal and geographical distributions on SARS-CoV-2 S protein cell epitopes and glycosylation sites, which would be an essential basis for the selection of vaccine candidates.","output":"Variations in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Cell Epitopes and Glycosylation Profiles During Global Transmission Course of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Previous complicated abdominal surgeries such as pancreaticoduodenectomy with large abdominal incisions may keep the surgeons away from major laparoscopic procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study that shows the feasibility of major laparoscopic surgery in a patient with previous pancreaticoduodenectomy. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old female (BMI 27 kg/m2, ASA II), was admitted for anemia. Her medical history included an open pancreaticoduodenectomy four years ago for chronic pancreatitis. She had an abdominal Mercedes incision. Computed tomography and colonoscopy showed a 5-cm cecal mass with a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. We performed a totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and intracorporeal ileotransverse anastomosis. The specimen was extracted through the vagina. The operating time was 500 minutes and the blood loss was 400 ml. The patient was uneventfully discharged on postoperative day four. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic colon surgery can be feasible and safe despite previous extensive abdominal surgeries such as pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Conventional (high-field) MRI scanners are very expensive to purchase, operate and maintain, which limit their use in many developing countries. This study is part of a project that aims at addressing these challenges and is carried out by teams from Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the USA. These are working on developing affordable, portable and low-field MRI scanners to diagnose children in developing countries with hydrocephalus. The challenges faced by the teams are that the low-field MRI scanners currently under development are characterized by low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and long scan times. METHODS We propose an algorithm called adaptive-size dictionary learning algorithm (AS-DLMRI) that integrates information-theoretic criteria (ITC) and Dictionary learning approaches. The result of the integration is an adaptive-size dictionary that is optimal for any input signal. AS-DLMRI may help to reduce the scan time and improve the SNR of the generated images, thereby improving the image quality. RESULTS We compared our proposed algorithm AS-DLMRI with adaptive patch-based algorithm known as DLMRI and non-adaptive CSMRI technique known as LDP. DLMRI and LDP have been used as the baseline algorithms in other related studies. The results of AS-DLMRI are consistently slightly better in terms of PSNR, SNR and HFEN than for DLMRI, and are significantly better than for LDP. Moreover, AS-DLMRI is faster than DLMRI. CONCLUSION Using a dictionary size that is appropriate to the input data could reduce the computational complexity, and also the construction quality since only dictionary atoms that are relevant to the task are included in the dictionary and are used during the reconstruction. However, AS-DLMRI did not completely remove noise during the experiments with the noisy phantom. Our next step in our research is to integrate our proposed algorithm with an image denoising function.","output":"Adaptive-size dictionary learning using information theoretic criteria for image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data in low field magnetic resonance imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the aim of testing the existence or not of homogeneity inside and between three seed germinators made in Brazil, two experiments were carried out using colonial grass seeds.

As such, in densely populated open spaces, it is necessary to adopt strategies to mitigate the risk of infection disease transmission while providing sufficient ventilation air. An example of such strategies is use of physical barriers. In this study, the impact of barrier heights on the spread of aerosol particles is investigated in an open office environment with the well-designed ventilation mode and supply air rate. The risk of infection disease transmission is evaluated using simulation of particle concentration in different locations and subject to a number of source scenarios. It was found that a barrier height of at least 60cm above the desk surface is needed to effectively prevent the transmission of viruses. For workstations within 4m from the outlet, a 70cm height is considered, and with a proper ventilation mode, it is shown that the barriers can reduce the risk of infection by 72%. However, for the workstations further away from the outlet (beyond 4m), the effect of physical barrier cannot be that significant. In summary, this study provides a theoretical analysis for implementing physical barriers, as a low-cost mitigation strategy, subject to various height scenarios and investigation of their effectiveness in reducing the infection transmission probability.","output":"Mitigating COVID-19 Infection Disease Transmission in Indoor Environment Using Physical Barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Rigor and reproducibility are two important cornerstones of medical and scientific advancement. Clinical and translational research (CTR) contains four phases (T1CT4), involving the translation of basic research to humans, then to clinical settings, practice, and the population, with the ultimate goal of improving public health. Here we provide a framework for rigorous and reproducible CTR. METHODS: In this paper we define CTR, provide general and phase-specific recommendations for improving quality and reproducibility of CTR with emphases on study design, data collection and management, analyses and reporting. We present and discuss aspects of rigor and reproducibility following published examples of CTR from the literature, including one example that shows the development path of different treatments that address anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS: It is particularly important to consider robust and unbiased experimental design and methodology for analysis and interpretation for clinical translation studies to ensure reproducibility before taking the next translational step. There are both commonality and differences along the clinical translation research phases in terms of research focuses and considerations regarding study design, implementation, and data analysis approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Sound scientific practices, starting with rigorous study design, transparency, and team efforts can greatly enhance CTR. Investigators from multidisciplinary teams should work along the spectrum of CTR phases, and identify optimal practices for study design, data collection, data analysis, and results reporting to allow timely advances in the relevant field of research.","output":"A framework for clinical and translational research in the era of rigor and reproducibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults of color who experience health disparities are especially vulnerable to health and economic adversity related to COVID-19.

We define green growth by low-carbon output, while we link gray growth to comparative advantages of pollution havens. Green and gray growth models include such predictors as domestic income and foreign direct investment (FDI) together with composite indices for globalization, environmental policy stringency (EPS), industrialization, and control of corruption. Considering non-stationarity, cross-section dependency, endogeneity, and heterogeneity concerns, we employ bootstrap and residual-based cointegration analyses followed by long-run estimations using the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) estimators and causality examination through Dumitrescu-Hurlin and Emirmahmutoglu-Kose tests. The key findings of the study are as follows: (i) income is positively associated with green growth for both IEEs and IDCs, whereas the income-gray growth nexus is negative for IEEs. (ii) Although inward FDI stocks are positively related to green and gray growth of IEEs and outward FDI stocks are negatively associated with green and gray growth of IDCs, these relationships are mediated by EPS. (iii) Globalization encourages both green and gray growth for IDCs. (iv) Even though EPS inhibits green growth and encourage gray growth in IEEs, these direct effects widely depend on the indirect effects of control of corruption. (v) IEEs higher gray growth performance is substantially explained by their increased industrial competitiveness, whereas the link is negative for IDCs. (vi) Control of corruption fosters both green and gray growth in IEEs. Overall, growing gray does not necessarily mean not growing green and vice versa. Globally, the low-carbon benefits of greening countries may be counterbalanced by the environmental costs of graying economies. From a policy perspective, IEEs need to reinforce environmental policies by green efficiency, green industrialization, and anti-corruption plans to decouple economic growth from carbon dioxide emissions.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected substantially this high-risk population group. This present review was done to ascertain whether or not the pandemic has affected the 30-day mortality and outcomes of hip fracture in the elderly. Research Question: Does the coexistence of COVID-19 infection and hip fractures in the elderly increase the mortality rates? Methodology: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using three databases (PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS) to compare the mortality rates between COVID-19 positive/suspect and COVID-19 negative patients. The secondary outcomes included comparison of in-hospital mortality, complication rate and length of hospital stay. Risk of bias assessment was done using the MINORS tool. Results: The present review included 20 studies. Primary outcome: A significantly higher 30 day mortality rate was seen in COVID-19 positive/suspect patients with an Odds ratio of 6.09 (95% CI 4.75-8.59, p < 0.00001).

The tachyzoites of the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii were exposed to different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 g/mL) of BDM, and mortality effect was assessed by flow cytometry. Then, the penetration ability of the tachyzoites was investigated in HeLa and macrophage cell lines. The infectivity of exposed tachyzoites to BDM were also investigated in mice through following up and detecting the etiological factor. The highest percentage of mortality (72.69%) was seen in the tachyzoites exposed to 128 g/mL of the compound. The tachyzoites exposed to 32, 64, and 128 g/mL of BDM began the proliferation in HeLa cells after 48 h, while this proliferation was initiated within 24 h in macrophage cells. All the mice inoculated with the BDM-treated tachyzoites died after 13 days. The mean survival time of the mice receiving tachyzoites exposed to 128 g/mL of BDM was 12.4 days, which was significantly different from the negative control group (p = 0.001).

During the most-restrictive UK lockdown-but not subsequently-socioeconomic status (SES) was positively associated with levels of parent-infant enriching activities. Parents who regard fostering early learning, affection, and attachment as important were more likely to engage in parent-infant enriching activities, yet there was no significant pathway from parental attitudes or SES to CEF via activities. Infant screen use was negatively associated with CEF and Regulation. Screen use fully mediated the effect of SES on CEF, and partially mediated the effect of SES on regulation. Parental attitudes toward early learning, affection, and attachment did not significantly influence screen use. These results indicate that although parental attitudes influence the development of early EFs, interventions targeting attitudes as a means of increasing enriching activities, and thus EF are likely to be less effective than reducing barriers to engaging in enriching activities.","output":"Not all babies are in the same boat: Exploring the effects of socioeconomic status, parental attitudes, and activities during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on early Executive Functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on health and lifestyle factors for older adults in Sydney, Australia.

Antigens common to pathogenic bacteria that induce broad immune responses, such as the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) of the genera Listeria, Mycobacterium, or Streptococcus, whose sequences present more than 95% homology at the N-terminal GAPDH(1?22) peptide, are putative candidates for universal vaccines. Here, we explore vaccine formulations based on dendritic cells (DC) loaded with two molecular forms of Listeria monocytogenes GAPDH (LM-GAPDH), such as mRNA carriers or recombinant proteins, and compare them with the same molecular forms of three other antigens used in experimental vaccines, listeriolysin O of Listeria monocytogeness, Ag85A of Mycobacterium marinum, and pneumolysin of Streptococcus pneumoniae. DC loaded with LM-GAPDH recombinant proteins proved to be the safest and most immunogenic vaccine vectors, followed by mRNA encoding LM-GAPDH conjugated to lipid carriers. In addition, macrophages lacked sufficient safety as vaccines for all LM-GAPDH molecular forms. The ability of DC loaded with LM-GAPDH recombinant proteins to induce non-specific DC activation explains their adjuvant potency and their capacity to trigger strong CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses explains their high immunogenicity. Moreover, their capacity to confer protection in vaccinated mice against challenges with L. monocytogenes, M. marinum, or S. pneumoniae validated their efficiency as cross-reactive vaccines.

In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus\\\\Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\\\\CoV). MERS\\\\CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS\\\\CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus\\\\host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS\\\\CoV. We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS\\\\CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor\\\\B signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit double\\\\stranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages. MERS\\\\CoV strongly inhibits the activation of T cells with downregulation of antigen presentation. In addition, uncontrolled secretion of interferon ?\\\\induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein\\\\1 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells.","output":"Modulation of the immune response by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The primary target of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is epithelial cells in the respiratory and intestinal tract.

Here, these results were confirmed and extended by including a colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2), a lung carcinoma cell line (Calu-3) and Vero E6 cells in our analysis. All three cell types expressed human ACE2 on the apical membrane domain and were infected via this route, as determined with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes containing the S protein of SARS-CoV. In a histological analysis of the respiratory tract, ACE2 was detected in the trachea, main bronchus and alveoli, and occasionally also in the small bronchi.

The aim of this study was to determine risk outcomes from gastric spillage in a rat survival model by measuring local and systemic inflammatory markers, adhesive disease, and morbidity. METHODS We performed a minilaparotomy with needle aspiration of 2 ml of gastric contents mixed with 2 ml of sterile saline (study group, SG) or 4 ml of sterile saline (control group, CG) injected into the peritoneal cavity of 60 male rats. Inflammatory markers (TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-10) were analyzed at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h postoperatively by obtaining plasma levels and peritoneal washings. At necropsy, the peritoneal cavity was examined grossly for adhesions. RESULTS Adhesions were seen more frequently in the SG versus the CG (100% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.014). There was a significant difference in the peritoneal TNFalpha levels in the SG compared with the CG, which peaked 1 h after surgery (p < 0.02). Both peritoneal IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in the SG versus the CG, which peaked 3 h after surgery (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). All peritoneal inflammatory markers returned to undetectable levels at 24 h for both groups. Plasma cytokines were undetectable at all time intervals. CONCLUSION The inflammatory response was found to be a localized and not systemic event, with plasma cytokine levels remaining normal while peritoneal washings revealed a brisk, short-lived localized inflammatory response. There was a significantly higher rate of adhesive disease in the SG compared with the CG; this, however did not translate into a difference in apparent clinical outcome. We conclude that gastric leakage in this NOTES rodent model induces a localized inflammatory response, followed by mild to moderate adhesive disease. This may be important in human NOTES.","output":"The inflammatory response in transgastric surgery: gastric content leak leads to localized inflammatory response and higher adhesive disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Community health centers (CHCs) are federally funded safety-net clinics that provide care to low income and medically underserved persons. The proportion of CHC patients aged 65 doubled in the last ten years, yet little is known about this population. We aim to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the older adult CHC population. DESIGN Cross sectional analysis. SETTING The nationally representative 2014 Health Center Patient Survey. PARTICIPANTS CHC patients 55 years. MEASURES We used descriptive statistics to characterize older adults across demographic and clinical variables. To determine differences by age, we stratified into three groups (55-64, 65-74, 75+ years). We used t-tests and chi-squared to calculate p values and survey weights to make national estimates. RESULTS We included 1875 older adults 55 years, representing over 4.2 million people. Older adults were mostly aged 55-64 (60%), female (51%), and white (60%). The majority (73%) had Medicare or Medicaid and 47% reported fair or poor health. Regardless of age, older adults had an average of three chronic conditions and 0.6 impairments in activities of daily living (ADL). Healthcare utilization was not significantly different across age groups with most taking 5 prescription medications (54%) and one in five reporting 2 emergency department visits or 1 hospitalization in the last year. CONCLUSIONS Adults 55-64 who attend CHCs have similar disease burden as adults 65. As the population of older adults who access CHCs grow, our findings highlight the opportunity to enhance focus on key principles of geriatric medicine, such as measurement of functional impairment for those who are <65 while also addressing underlying health disparities.","output":"National profile of the growing population of older adults who access community health centers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediatric gastroenterologists, family members, and caregivers of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are on alert; they are all focused on implementing prophylactic measures to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, evaluating the risks in each patient, guiding them in their treatment, and keeping IBD in remission.

These strategies included lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of public places. These measures may have affected dietary intake to varying degrees. This study aimed to assess variations in food intake and diet quality among pregnant women according to regional severity and related control measures during the most severe period of COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. METHODS: A total of 3,678 pregnant women from 19 provinces/municipalities in mainland China were analyzed in this nationwide, multi-center study. Food intake data were obtained and assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Diet quality was quantified using the Diet Balance Index for Pregnancy (DBI-P), which included high bound score (HBS, excessive dietary intake), low bound score (LBS, insufficient dietary intake), and diet quality distance (DQD, dietary imbalance). Linear trend tests and multivariable regression analyses were performed to examine the association between food intake, DBI-P and the severity of pandemic. RESULTS: The median daily intake of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy, and nuts decreased (p < 0.05) according to low, moderate, and high severity of the pandemic, while no significant differences in cereals/potatoes, eggs, and fish/shrimp intake. The median daily intake of cereals/potatoes exceeded the recommended ranges, and the daily intake of eggs and fish/shrimp was below recommended ranges regardless of the pandemic severity (p < 0.05). Regarding diet quality, HBS decreased (lower excessive consumption) (p = 0.047) and LBS increased (greater insufficient consumption) (p = 0.046) with increased severity of the pandemic. On multivariable analyses, moderate and high pandemic severity were related to lower HBS risk (OR = 0.687, OR = 0.537) and higher LBS risk ( = 1.517,  = 3.020) when compared to low pandemic severity. CONCLUSIONS: Under more severe COVID-19 pandemic conditions, pregnant women consumed less quality food, characterized by reduced consumption of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy and nuts, while the quality of the foods that pregnant women consumed in excess tended to improve, but the overconsumption of cereals/potatoes was a problem.","output":"Food Intake and Diet Quality of Pregnant Women in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to validate three recent non-refractive devices that target sensory and/or strabismus risk factors for amblyopia. EyeSwift? with eye tracking and PDI Check on autostereoscopic Nintendo 3DS are video games that estimate acuity, binocularity and color. The Rebion blinq assesses foveation by birefringence. METHODS: Students were consented to be screened by each device as if by a school nurse before confirmatory examination with optimized, refined refraction. Results were compared with correlation and Bland Altman plots while screening ability was compared with 2021 AAPOS Guidelines and the strabismus-amblyopia rubric proposed by David Hunter. RESULTS: A total of 77 ethnically diverse students, aged 114 (4C19) years had a 77% prevalence of 2021 risk factors. Near visual acuity, inter-eye difference and stereopsis correlated significantly (p<0.01) for the EyeSwift? (r(2) 0.14, 0.06 and 0.45) and PDI Check (r(2) 0.23, 0.22 and 0.32). The sensitivity/specificity to target 2021-AAPOS: Hunter-rubric for EyeSwift? was 82%/56%: 74%/62%, for PDI Check was 75/64%: 69%/69% and for blinq 75/48%: 82%/39%. Sensitivity/specificity for the seven color-deficient students was 86%/84% for EyeSwift? and 100%/81% for PDI Check. Screening time was 9619 s for PDI Check and 375102 s for EyeSwift but less than 25 s for blinq. CONCLUSION: Reliable near visual acuity, stereo and color testing were obtained from the two binocular and touch screen devices often with minimal coaching of the student. The blinq rapidly gives an estimate of whether both eyes are steadily fixing, and the ProVersion predicted 100% which eye is deviated or amblyopic.

Previous research suggests that one such strategy is avoidance of unfamiliar outgroup members. We thus examined the relationship between dispositional worry about disease and support for COVID-19-related travel bans across three preregistered studies (N = 764) conducted at the outset of the pandemic in the United States and Singapore. Americans higher in Perceived Infectability were more supportive of travel bans, whereas Singaporeans higher in Germ Aversion were more supportive of travel bans. In Study 2, priming saliency of the pandemic increased support for travel bans from high (but not low) pandemic-risk countries. This prime did not increase general xenophobia. These results are consistent with threat-specific perspectives of outgroup avoidance, and provide an ecologically-valid test of the implications of perceived disease threat for policy-related attitudes and decision-making.
