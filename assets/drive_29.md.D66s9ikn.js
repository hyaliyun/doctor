METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational cohort study that used data based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19 tested cases and the history of medical service use in these patients for the past five years. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the rate of ventilator care was compared between the groups. RESULTS: From a total of 7,590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on RAAS inhibitors prescribed within 6 months before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 1,111 patients was prescribed RAAS inhibitors, and 794 patients were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, excluding RAAS inhibitors. In propensity-score matched analysis, 666 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the RAAS inhibitor group showed no significant difference compared with the non-RAAS inhibitor group (14.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.15; p = 0.22). The rate of ventilator care was not significantly different between the two groups (4.4% vs. 4.1%; HR, 1.04; 95%CI, 0.60-1.79; p = 0.89).

Results: Strategies prioritizing primary vaccinations were systematically more effective than strategies prioritizing boosters. Regarding booster strategies targeting different age groups, their effectiveness varied with immunity and virus transmissibility levels. If the waning of immunity affects all adults, people aged 30 to 49 years should be boosted in priority, even for low transmissibility levels. Conclusions: Increasing the primary vaccination coverage should remain a priority.

METHODS: We searched on Google and Pubmed for recently published National and International Recommendations/Guidelines/Position Papers from professional organizations and societies, offering a guidance to physicians on how to safely perform pulmonary function testing during COVID-19 pandemic. We also searched for spirometry manufacturers' operational indications. RESULTS: Indications on spirometry were released by the Chinese Task force, the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society, the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Socit de Pneumologie de Langue Fran?aise, the Spanish Societies (Sociedad Espanola de Neumologia y Cirugia Toracica, Sociedad Espanola de Alergologia e Inmunologia Clinica, Asociacion de Especialistas en Enfermeria del trabajo, Asociacion de Enfermeria Comunitaria), the Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia, the British Thoracic Society/Association for Respiratory Technology & Physiology, the Irish Thoracic Society, the Sociedad Uruguaya de Neumologia, the Italian Thoracic Society and the Italian Respiratory Society, Cleveland Clinic and Nebraska Medical Center. Detailed technical recommendations were found on manufacturers' websites. We found several similarities across available guidelines for safely resuming pulmonary function services, as well as differences in criteria for selecting eligible patients for which spirometry is deemed essential and advice which was not homogenous on room ventilation precautions. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a synthesis of national/international guidelines allowing practicing physicians to adapt and shape the way to organize their outpatient services locally.

We conducted direct observations of nursingdrug administration rounds before and after the MedEyeimplementation. Observers recorded what they observedbeing administered (e.g., drug name, form, strength andquantity) and compared this to what was prescribed. Errorswere classified as either a 'timing' error, 'omission' error or'other' error. We calculated the rate and type of medicationadministration errors (MAEs) before and after the MedEyeimplementation. A sample size calculation suggested thatapproximately 10,000 medication administrations wereneeded. Data collection was reduced due to the COVID 19pandemic and implementation delays.Results: Trained pharmacists or nurses observed a total of1,069 administrations of solid oral dosage forms before and432 after the MedEye intervention was implemented. Thepercentage of MAEs pre-MedEye (69.1%) and post-MedEye(69.9%) remained almost the same. Non-timing errors(combination of 'omission' + 'other' errors) reduced from 51(4.77%) to 11 (2.55%), which had borderline significance(p=0.05) however after adjusting for confounders, significance was lost. We also saw a non-significant reduction in'other' error types (e.g., dose and documentation errors) following the implementation of MedEye from 34 (3.2%) to 7(1.62%). An observer witnessed a nurse dispense the wrongmedication (prednisolone) instead of the intended medication(furosemide) in the post-MedEye period. After receiving a notification from MedEye that an unexpected medication hadbeen dispensed, the nurse corrected the dose thus preventingan error. We also identified one instance where the nurse correctly dispensed a prescribed medication (amlodipine) butthis was mistakenly identified by the MedEye scanner as another prescribed medication (metoclopramide).Conclusions: This is the first evaluation of a novel opticalmedication scanning device, MedEye on the rate of MAEs inone of the largest NHS trusts in England. We found a nonstatistically significant reduction in non-timing error rates.This was notable because incidents within this category e.g.,dose errors, are more likely to be associated with harm compared to timing errors.2 However, further research is neededto investigate the impact of MedEye on a larger sample sizeand range of medications.","output":"The impact of a bedside medication scanning deviceon administration errors in the hospital setting: AProspective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) according to phenotypes of disease and define the prognostic factors for the severe course.

A pharmacokinetic study of LY-CoV555 conducted in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated a mean half-life of 13 days and a clearance of 0.22 ml hour-1 kg-1, consistent with a typical human therapeutic antibody. In a rhesus macaque challenge model, prophylactic doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg reduced viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract in samples collected through study day 6 after viral inoculation.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with IVT were studied. The FDP level was obtained on admission. PH was evaluated 24 h after treatment. The unfavorable outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale >2. The multivariable linear stepwise regression was used to assess independent factors associated with the log-transformed FDP (lgFDP). The receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve analysis was used to determine the predictive value of the FDP level for PH and unfavorable outcome. The logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for PH and unfavorable outcome. The mediation analyses were performed to investigate associations among the FDP level, PH, and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients were included in the final analyses [median age, 73 (63C79) years; 102 (56.4%) males; and the median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, 8 (5C15)]. The lgFDP was independently associated with age (B = 0.011, 95% CI 0.006C0.015, p < 0.001) and the baseline NIHSS score (B = 0.016, 95% CI 0.008C0.025, p < 0.001). The FDP was positively associated with PH [odds ratio (OR) 1.034, 95% CI 1.000C1.069; p = 0.047]. According to the ROC analysis, the best discriminating factor for unfavorable outcome was the FDP 3.085 g/ml. The FDP 3.085 g/ml was an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome (OR 7.086, 95% CI 2.818C17.822; p < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the association of the FDP 3.085 g/ml with unfavorable outcome was not mediated by PH (p = 0.161). CONCLUSION: The admission FDP levels can predict PH and unfavorable outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke after IVT.

Whilst the advantages of routine COVID-19 swabbing are evident, it is important to acknowledge the associated common complications as well as unusual ones such as a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Leak. Methods: We report a case of a 69-year-old female who underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing in preparation for routine elective surgery. At the 8-week follow up the patient complained of a runny nose, which was positive for Beta-2 Transferring thus confirming a CSF leak. The likely area of concern for the CSF leak was in the region of the left fovea ethmoidalis where the bone was extremely thin with a solitary fluid filled air cell. The patient did later report right eye surgery 2 years previously which resulted in postoperative ethmoidal sinusitis managed with antimicrobials. This may have predisposed her to the CSF leak. Results: Nasal swabbing has been shown to be the cause of a CSF leak in a handful of cases, only four thus far have been reported in the literature.

However, correlation analysis makes assumptions about the nature of the involved random variables (cardinality) and their relationship (linearity) that may not be applicable to ordinal scores such as the ISS. Moreover, using correlation as a sole evaluation criterion neglects the dynamic properties of these aggregation functions scores. METHODS: We analyze the domain and ordinal properties of the ISS comparatively to arbitrary linear and cubic aggregation functions. Moreover, we investigate the axiomatic properties of the ISS as a multicriteria aggregation procedure. Finally, we use a queuing simulation with various empirical distributions of Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) grades reported in the literature, to evaluate the queuing performance of the three aggregation functions. RESULTS: We show that the assumptions required for the computation of Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients are not applicable to the analysis of the association between the ISS and mortality. We suggest the use of Mutual Information, a information-theoretic statistic that is able to assess general dependence rather than a specialized, linear view based on curve-fitting. Using this metric on the same data set as the seminal study that introduced the ISS, we show that the sum of cubes conveys more information on mortality than the ISS. Moreover, we highlight some unintended, undesirable axiomatic properties of the ISS that can lead to bias in its use as a patient triage criterion. Lastly, our queuing simulation highlights the sensitivity of the queuing performance of different aggregation procedures to the underlying distribution of AIS grades among patients. CONCLUSIONS: Viewing the ISS, and other possible aggregation functions for multiple AIS scores, as mere operational indicators of the priority of care, rather than cardinal measures of the response of the human body to multiple injuries (as was conjectured in the seminal study introducing the ISS) offers a perspective for their construction and evaluation on more robust grounds than the correlation coefficient. In this regard, Mutual Information appears as a more appropriate measure for the study of the association between injury severity and mortality, and queuing simulations as an actionable way to adapt the choice of an aggregation function to the underlying distribution of AIS scores.","output":"The injury severity score: an operations perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to visualize the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic over the first 90 days, through the principal component analysis approach of dimensionality reduction. METHODS: This study used data from the Global COVID-19 Index provided by PEMANDU Associates.

Correlation matrices were computed to reveal the association between the variables at three time points: day-30, day-60 and day-90. Three separate principal component analyses were computed for similar time points, and several standardized plots were produced. RESULTS: Confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 showed positive but weak correlation with stringency and GNI per capita. Through principal component analysis, the first two principal components captured close to 70% of the variance of the data. The first component can be viewed as the severity of the COVID-19 surge in countries, whereas the second component largely corresponded to population density, followed by GNI per capita of countries. Multivariate visualization of the two dominating principal components provided a standardized comparison of the situation in the161 countries, performed on day-30, day-60 and day-90 since the first confirmed cases in countries worldwide.

In the present study, we re-examined the role of Btk in B cells and myeloid cells during pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis in mice. The antibacterial defense of Btk(-/-) mice was severely impaired during pneumococcal pneumosepsis and restoration of natural antibody production in Btk(-/-) mice by transgenic expression of Btk specifically in B cells did not suffice to protect against infection. Btk(-/-) mice with reinforced Btk expression in MhcII(+) cells, including B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, showed improved antibacterial defense as compared to Btk(-/-) mice. Bacterial outgrowth in Lysmcre-Btk(fl)/Y mice was unaltered despite a reduced capacity of Btk-deficient alveolar macrophages to respond to pneumococci.

The total effect of maternal social support on anxiety was ?2.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): ?4.40 ~ ?1.44, p < .001), the direct effect was ?1.44 (95% CI: ?2.74 ~ ?0.35, p < .05) and the indirect effect was ?1.19 (95% CI: ?2.49 ~ ?0.51, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The third trimester pregnant women had a high level of social support, a medium level of risk perception to COVID-19 and were susceptible to anxiety.

It has led to more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths across 219 countries as of 11 November 2020, according to WHO statistics. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are similar. They are highly pathogenic and threaten public health, impair the economy, and inflict long-term impacts on society. No drug or vaccine has been approved as a treatment for these viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral measures have been hampered by the insufficient understanding of how the human body responds to viral infections at the cellular and molecular levels. RESULTS: In this study, journal articles and transcriptomic and proteomic data surveying coronavirus infections were collected. Response genes and proteins were then identified by differential analyses comparing gene/protein levels between infected and control samples. Finally, the H2V database was created to contain the human genes and proteins that respond to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: H2V provides molecular information about the human response to infection. It can be a powerful tool to discover cellular pathways and processes relevant for viral pathogenesis to identify potential drug targets. It is expected to accelerate the process of antiviral agent development and to inform preparations for potential future coronavirus-related emergencies.

We report outcomes after carotid artery stenting (CAS) based on aspirin and P2Y12 assays. METHODS We retrospectively identified patients who had aspirin and P2Y12 assays at the time of stenting. Aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) were started 7-10 days pre-intervention. If not possible, aspirin (650 mg) and clopidogrel (600 mg) loading doses were given pre-intervention. Assays were checked on postoperative day 0/1. Outcomes included neurological ischemic sequela at 30 days, 1 and 2 years, as well as 30 day death/hemorrhage/myocardial infarction. RESULTS 449 patients were included. Mean P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values were higher in patients with an ipsilateral ischemic event (stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)) or stroke (alone) at 1 and 2 years than in patients with no events: ischemic event versus no event at 1 year, 252 vs 202 (p=0.008); stroke versus no stroke at 1 year, 252 versus 203(p=0.029); ischemic event versus no event at 2 years, 244 vs 203 (p=0.047); stroke versus no stroke at 2 years, 243 versus 203 (p=0.082). Ischemic event free survival (stroke/TIA, p=0.0268) and overall survival (p=0.0291) post-CAS were longer in patients with PRU 198 compared with an initial threshold of PRU 237. Mean PRU values were higher in patients who died from all causes at 30 days than in survivors (p=0.031). No correlation was found between lower PRU values and hemorrhage.

Method: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Participants (N = 699) between the ages of 18 and 73 (M = 27.79; SD = 12.68) completed both the FCV-19S and the Hospital, Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS). We performed descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 349), confirmatory (n = 350), and scale reliability analyses. Results: The results confirmed the factor structure of the original scale as well as the scale's goodness-of-fit indices and good internal consistency (&#945; = .91, &#969; = .98). The correlations between the Spanish FCV-19S and the HADS support the scale's validity, especially for the subdimension of anxiety. Conclusions: The Spanish version of the FCV-19S appears to be a valid measure for the assessment of fear in an adult population. The present study moves research forward by providing a confirmatory analysis of the gender variable's influence on the factor analysis. The FCV-19S-Spanish provides a valid brief measure to evaluate fear of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results also revealed that fear was higher among women than among men, which is important as it suggests that more attention needs to be paid to assessing and treating women's fear.

At the same time, the I7L proteinase exemplifies several interesting challenges from the rational drug design perspective. In the absence of a published I7L X-ray structure, we have built a detailed 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site (S2CS2 pocket) based on exceptionally high structural conservation of this site in proteases of the ULP family. The accuracy and limitations of this model were assessed through comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs, as well as energy based conformational modeling. The 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site was used to perform covalent docking and VLS of a comprehensive library of about 230,000 available ketone and aldehyde compounds. Out of 456 predicted ligands, 97 inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity were confirmed in biochemical assays (20% overall hit rate). These experimental results both validate our I7L ligand binding model and provide initial leads for rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors. Thus, fragments predicted to bind in the prime portion of the active site can be combined with fragments on non-prime side to yield compounds with improved activity and specificity.","output":"Discovery of small molecule inhibitors of ubiquitin-like poxvirus proteinase I7L using homology modeling and covalent docking approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine all aspects affecting the functioning of the system and the most important factors in its assessment through a systematic review during 1990 to 2017.

Philanthropists have invested millions in shipping ventilators to low-resource settings, and agencies such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank are prioritizing the purchase of ventilators. While we recognize the humanitarian nature of these efforts, merely shipping ventilators to low-resource environments may not improve outcomes of patients and could potentially cause harm. An ecosystem of considerable technological and human resources is required to support the usage of ventilators within intensive care settings. Medical-grade oxygen supplies, reliable electricity, bioengineering support, and consumables are all needed for ventilators to save lives. However, most ICUs in resource-poor settings do not have access to these resources. Patients on ventilators require continuous monitoring from physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists skilled in critical care. Health care workers in many low-resource settings are already exceedingly overburdened, and pulling these essential human resources away from other critical patient needs could reduce the overall quality of patient care.

Published literature primarily offers a retrospective view of experience, with few studies examining and understanding the individual lived experience of practitioners prospectively. This study explores paramedics' lived experience of emergency preparedness and applies that learning. METHODS: Thirteen paramedics were recruited through purposive sampling. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews explored their individual experiences of emergency preparedness, in line with the idiographic focus of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS: Through data analysis, the following superordinate themes were identified for further discussion: self-determination, control, and experience-based practice. Participants appeared to value their role and the unpredictable environment in which they worked. Personal resilience, an area that they suggested is not covered effectively within individual preparation, was viewed as important. The participants articulated that risk, threat, uncertainty, safety, trust, and control were important concepts within individual preparedness. These paramedics valued practice-based knowledge and education as credible and transferrable to their clinical work. CONCLUSION: Evidence from this study suggests that standard emergency preparedness, with the focus at organizational level, is not sufficient for the individual workers or for an overall effective response.

Although a recent report indicated favorable responses to the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra in eight patients with COVID-19 secondary HLH diagnosed using the HScore calculation, others have suggested that the diagnosis of secondary HLH is uncommon and that the use of the HScore has limited value in guiding immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19. Here, we provide additional perspective on this important controversy based upon comparisons between 14 COVID-19 cytokine storm patients and 10 secondary HLH patients seen immediately prior to the pandemic. We hypothesize that identification of HLH may relate to the severity or timing of cytokine release and suggest distinguishing between cytokine release syndrome and secondary HLH, reserving the latter term for cases fulfilling diagnostic criteria.","output":"Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis versus cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Auditors' skills and ways of working must adapt to constantly changing conditions in the workplace, and the COVID-19 pandemic has brought further complexity.

This study aims to assess the association between different tobacco use patterns and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, self-reported infection and social distancing behaviors in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: Data come from the first wave of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) COVID-19 survey, comprising four birth cohorts (N = 13,077, aged 20C63 years) surveyed between 2 to 31 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (symptoms, testing, diagnosis and social distancing behaviors) were compared across different product user groups (non-users, exclusive cigarette users, exclusive e-cigarettes users and dual use) using CochranCMantelCHaenszel 2 test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore associations between COVID-19-related outcomes and different smoking patterns. Results: Across all four cohorts, 12.6% and 4.9% of the respondents were current exclusive cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively, with approximately 3% of the respondents being dual users. Significant differences in prevalence were observed between different tobacco use patterns and COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.02), self-reported infection (p = 0.04) and social distancing behaviors (p < 0.001). Current cigarette and e-cigarette dual use was associated with 2.15-fold higher odds for reporting COVID-19 infection (aOR = 2.15; CI [1.15C4.05]).

Conclusions: Each of these causal components, in its place, leads to some degrees of psychological disorders and subsequent consequences and complications. Finally, here we reviewed, summarized the previous research findings on how to prevent and manage this type of psychological disorder, and made comparisons.","output":"Phobia and Fear of COVID-19: origins, complications and management, a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has been accompanied by severe psychological pressure on the entire population. However, little is known about how this pandemic could affect the more vulnerable population with severe mental illness. AIMS: To explore adolescent psychiatric inpatients perceptions, emotional reactions and needs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with nine psychiatric inpatients aged 12C17 years. Through open-ended questions, interviewers initiated five themes: (a) knowledge about coronavirus pandemic, (b) changes in everyday routine due to the pandemic, (c) adolescents feelings about the pandemic, (d) adolescents positive thoughts and behaviors, and (e) how the social environment can help adolescents deal with the pandemic-related situation. A thematic analysis was conducted using line-by-line open coding. RESULTS: Regarding their knowledge of the impact of the current pandemic, almost all adolescents focused on information about the nature of coronavirus and on existing crisis management practices. Almost all patients identified predominantly negative changes due to the quarantine state, including restrictions on both social life and personal freedom as well as excessive contact with family members during home isolation. As far as their emotions were concerned, adolescents did acknowledge anxiety about self-harm and harming their loved ones as well as mood swings within the family nucleus; anxiety was also manifested about the unknown and the management of the pandemic in other countries. Avoidance of thought rumination about the coronavirus and its consequences, positive thinking and looking towards the future were reported as constructive strategies for coping with challenging emotions. Additionally, a sense of belongingness seems to have been playing a pivotal role in the adolescents coping strategies. Trust in the authorities and the community was another quite noteworthy point that emerged during the interviews. Lastly, our findings indicated adolescents benefit from receiving balanced health messaging coupled with balanced thinking within their social and family environment. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced comprehension of possible mediating psychological pathways is needed to help clinicians, researchers, and decision-makers to avert the deterioration of mental disorders and overall functioning, as well as additional stress-related disorders.

The making of effective hand sanitiser products should follow the recommended formulations, but the high demand worldwide for such affordable products could have made them a candidate for counterfeiting, thus deserving forensic determination and profiling for source determination or supply chain tracing. In this study, determination and discrimination of hand sanitisers was carried out by employing attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. Fifty commercially available hand sanitisers were obtained from the market and analysed. ATR-FTIR profiles of each sanitiser were compared and decomposed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Physical observation enabled the discrimination of seven samples based on their respective colours, the presence of beads and their colours, and the physical forms of formulations. Subsequently, eight distinct patterns were observed through visual comparison of ATR-FTIR profiles of the remaining 43 samples. An initial unsupervised exploratory PCA model indicated the separation of two main groups with ATR-FTIR profiles similar to those of ethanol and isopropanol, respectively. The PCA score-LDA model provided good predictions, with a 100% correct classification into eight different groups.

RESULTS: There was a marked decrease in AECOPD admissions in 2020, with a 54.2% drop in admissions (n = 119 in 2020 vs. n = 259 in 2019). There was no significant difference in patient demographics or medical comorbidities. In 2020, there was a significantly lower number of patients with AECOPD who received nebulised medications during admission (60.4% in 2020 vs. 84.9% in 2019; p  0.001). There were also significantly lower numbers of AECOPD patients admitted in 2020 who received controlled oxygen via venturi masks (69.0% in 2020 vs. 84.5% in 2019; p = 0.006). There was a significant increase in inpatient mortality in 2020 (19.3% [n = 23] and 8.4% [n = 22] for 2020 and 2019, respectively, p = 0.003). Year was found to be the best predictor of mortality outcome (p = 0.001). The lack of use of SABA pre-admission treatment (p = 0.002), active malignancy (p = 0.003), and increased length of hospital stay (p = 0.046) were also found to be predictors of mortality for AECOPD patients; however, these parameters were unchanged between 2019 and 2020 and therefore could not account for the increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in the number of admissions with AECOPD in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared to 2019. The year 2020 proved to be a significant predictor for inpatient mortality, with a significant increase in mortality in 2020. The decrease in nebuliser and controlled oxygen treatment noted in the study period did not prove to be a significant predictor of mortality when corrected for other variables.

Targeting the main protease (M(pro), 3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is a justified approach for drug development because this enzyme plays a significant role in the viral replication and transcription. The available crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) determined in the presence of different ligands and inhibitors-like compounds provide a platform for the quick development of selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). In this study, we utilized the structural information of co-crystallized SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) for the structure-guided drug discovery approach to finding high-affinity inhibitors from the PubChem database. The screened compounds were selected on the basis of their physicochemical properties, drug-likeliness, and strength of affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Finally, we have identified 6-Deaminosinefungin (PubChem ID: 10428963) and UNII-O9H5KY11SV (PubChem ID: 71481120) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) which may be further exploited in drug development to address SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Both compounds are structural analogs of known antiviral compounds, having considerable protease inhibitory potential with improved pharmacological properties.

METHODS: Between April 21(st) and 27(th) 2020, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study targeting the full population of Ischgl (n = 1867), of which 79% could be included (n = 1473, incl. 214 children), was performed. For each individual, the study involved a SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibody testing and structured questionnaires. A mathematical model was used to help understand the influence of the determined seroprevalence on virus transmission. RESULTS: The seroprevalence was 42.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 39.8C44.7). Individuals under 18 showed a significantly lower seroprevalence of 27.1% (95% CI 21.3-33.6) than adults (45%; 95% CI 42.2C47.7; OR of 0.455, 95% CI 0.356C0.682, p < 0.001). Of the seropositive individuals, 83.7% had not been diagnosed to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection previously. The clinical course was generally mild. Over the previous two months, two COVID-19-related deaths had been recorded, corresponding to an infection fatality rate of 0.25% (95% CI 0.03C0.91). Only 8 (0.5 %) individuals were newly diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this study. CONCLUSIONS: Ischgl was hit early and hard by SARS-CoV-2 leading to a high local seroprevalence of 42.4%, which was lower in individuals below the age of 18 than in adults. Mathematical modeling suggests that a drastic decline of newly infected individuals in Ischgl by the end of April occurred due to the dual impact from the non-pharmacological interventions and a high immunization of the Ischgl population.","output":"High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and adults in the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to be associated with thrombotic events like ischemic stroke.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical and imaging data from 262 cases of confirmed viral pneumonia in 20 hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from March 1, 2015 to March 15, 2020. According to the virus responsible for the pneumonia, the pneumonias were divided into non-COVID-19 (141 cases) and COVID-19 (121 cases). The non-COVID-19 pneumonias comprised cytomegalovirus (CMV) (31 cases), influenza A virus (82 cases), and influenza B virus (20 cases). The differences in the basic clinical characteristics, lesion distribution, location and imaging signs among the four viral pneumonias were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Fever and cough were the most common clinical symptoms of the four viral pneumonias. Compared with the COVID-19 patients, the non-COVID-19 patients had higher proportions of fatigue, sore throat, expectorant and chest tightness (all P<0.000). In addition, in the CMV pneumonia patients, the proportions of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and leukopenia were high (all PP<0.000). Comparison of the imaging findings of the four viral pneumonias showed that the pulmonary lesions of COVID-19 were more likely to occur in the peripheral and lower lobes of both lungs, whereas those of CMV pneumonia were diffusely distributed. Compared with the non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to present as ground-glass opacity, intralobular interstitial thickening, vascular thickening and halo sign (all PP<0.05). In addition, in the early stage of COVID-19, extensive consolidation, fibrous stripes, subpleural lines, crazy-paving pattern, tree-in-bud, mediastinal lymphadenectasis, pleural thickening and pleural effusion were rare (all PP<0.05).

How these profound changes have affected sexuality, contraception and voluntary terminations of pregnancy is still largely undescribed. The main objective of this study was therefore to find out whether the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown affected the demand for legal abortion. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study period was divided into three phases: the pre-pandemic (January and February 2020); lockdown (March and April); and post-lockdown (May and June). The number and characteristics of women requesting pregnancy termination each month during that time were compared with the stats for the same months in the preceding three years (2017-2019). RESULTS Immediately after national lockdown, the number of voluntary abortions markedly declined (-40.45%). The effect was more evident in women below 20 years of age (-66.67%), employed versus unemployed women (-42.71% vs. -21.05), and non-Italian versus Italian citizens (-53.01 vs. -32.85). No difference was found in the mean time from request to execution of the procedure, or in the type of the procedure used. CONCLUSION(S) National lockdown reduced the number of unwanted pregnancies, especially in younger women. The Italian health service's response to the demand appears to have been unaffected by the pandemic. However, as the demand for abortion is still high, probably due to unplanned pregnancies among cohabitants within a stable relationship, contraception guidance should be improved among women traditionally deemed low-risk in terms of sexual behaviour.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on voluntary terminations of pregnancy in an Italian metropolitan area."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The passive immunization of patients with SARS-CoV2 with convalescent plasma (CP) is theoretically beneficial in patients with end-stage renal disease who are immunosuppressed and unable to mount an adequate immune response.

METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in consecutive 68 moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV2 infected patients who were on maintenance hemodialysis or with acute worsening of chronic kidney disease which required initiation of hemodialysis. Patients who received CP were compared with those who did not. The primary outcome was death during hospitalization. Clinical characteristics, duration of hospitalization and inflammatory parameters were compared between the two groups. A subgroup analysis was done to find whether early initiation of plasma was associated with better outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (44%) in the plasma group and 14 (45%) patients in the control group died during hospitalization (p = 0.95). The median duration of hospitalization was 9 (6-14) days in the plasma group and 9 (6-16) in the control group (p = 0.60). There was no difference in mortality or duration of hospitalization with respect to early initiation of CP (p = 0.29). Fistula thrombosis occurred in two patients (11.1%) in the plasma group.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, our department had to minimize patientCstaff contact in the THA pathway. First, telephone consultations were implemented instead of an outpatient clinic visit and subsequently preoperative patient education was discontinued. This enabled us to compare patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction among 3 fast-track pathways. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected data from patients treated for hip osteoarthritis with THA at G?dstrup Hospital between 2018 and 2021. The patients had experienced 1 of 3 pathways and were interviewed via telephone between 2 and 6 months after discharge. We analyzed the influence of patient pathway on patient-reported pain and mobility level, self-perceived complications, and compliance using logistic regression. We then compared the pathways effect on patient satisfaction both for the total sample and for the patients who experienced complications. RESULTS: The amount of patientCstaff contact in the patient pathway did not have any influence on patientreported outcomes or the probability of self-perceived complications. For the full sample, patientCstaff contact had no statistically significant influence on patient satisfaction either, but for the subgroup of patients experiencing complications, the pathways with less patientCstaff contact reduced satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was primarily related to pain and mobility outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that reducing patientCstaff contact in fast-track THA can be done without influencing mobility and pain outcomes, but the overall satisfaction among patients with self-perceived complications will be negatively affected.","output":"Reducing patientCstaff contact in fast-track total hip arthroplasty has no effect on patient-reported outcomes, but decreases satisfaction amongst patients with self-perceived complications: analysis of 211 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant amount of effort had been put into developing techniques that predict the number of infections under various assumptions about the public policy and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

From an agricultural perspective, their accumulation in crops from contaminated soil threatens food security and quality, leading to many diseases in humans. The Cucurbitaceae family can accumulate high concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants in their aerial parts. The Cucurbitaceae family contains major latex-like proteins (MLPs) as transporting factors for hydrophobic pollutants. MLP genes are expressed in the roots in which the MLPs bind hydrophobic pollutants. MLPs transport these hydrophobic pollutants to the aerial parts of the plant through the xylem vessels. As a result, hydrophobic pollutant contamination occurs in the Cucurbitaceae family. In this study, we suppressed the expression of MLP genes in the roots and reduced the amounts of MLPs with pesticide treatments. First, the fungicides Benlate and Daconil that deceased the hydrophobic pollutant, perylene, concentration in the xylem sap of zucchini plants were selected.

Unanchored (or free) polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) has been shown to regulate IFN-I responses. However, few unanchored poly-Ub interactors are known. To identify factors regulated by unanchored poly-Ub in a physiological setting, we developed an approach to isolate unanchored poly-Ub from lung tissue. We identified the RNA helicase DHX16 as a potential pattern recognition receptor (PRR). Silencing of DHX16 in cells and in vivo diminished IFN-I responses against influenza virus. These effects extended to members of other virus families, including Zika and SARS-CoV-2. DHX16-dependent IFN-I production requires RIG-I and unanchored K48-poly-Ub synthesized by the E3-Ub ligase TRIM6. DHX16 recognizes a signal in influenza RNA segments that undergo splicing and requires its RNA helicase motif for direct, high-affinity interactions with specific viral RNAs.

Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection induces the up-regulation and activation of Tim-3 in macrophages which in turn recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47 to the zinc finger domain of NF90 and initiated a proteasome-dependent degradation of the NF90 via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys297. Targeted inactivation of the Tim-3 enhances the NF90 downstream SGs formation by selectively increasing the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a, the expression of SGs markers G3BP1 and TIA-1, and protected mice from lethal VSV challenge.

METHODS: The dataset included of 1229 COVID-19 positive patients, and additional 214 inpatients, COVID-19 positive as well as infected with mucormycosis. We used logistic regression, decision tree and random forest and the extreme gradient boosting algorithm. All our models were evaluated with 5-fold validation to derive a reliable estimate of the model error. RESULTS: The logistic regression, XGBoost and random forest performed equally well with AUROC 95.0, 94.0, and 94.0 respectively.

In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st(,) 2020 to October 30th(,) 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 4311 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 242 were fully analysed. Most studies were done on Asian (46.52%) and European (27.39%) countries. Most of them used compartmental models (namely SIR and SEIR) (46.1%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (31.8%) while few used artificial intelligence (6.7%), Bayesian approach (4.7%), Network models (2.3%) and Agent-based models (1.3%). For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75% of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95% CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7% of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70% of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rho = - 0.56, p = 0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, some were relatively accurate and precise while other not.","output":"On the reliability of predictions on Covid-19 dynamics: A systematic and critical review of modelling techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biotin carboxylase (BC) activity is shared among biotin-dependent carboxylases and catalyzes the Mg-ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin using bicarbonate as the CO(2) donor. BC has been studied extensively over the years by structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis analyses. Here we report three new crystal structures of Escherichia coli BC at up to 1.9 ? resolution, complexed with different ligands. Two structures are wild-type BC in complex with two ADP molecules and two Ca(2+) ions or two ADP molecules and one Mg(2+) ion. One ADP molecule is in the position normally taken by the ATP substrate, whereas the other ADP molecule occupies the binding sites of bicarbonate and biotin. One Ca(2+) ion and the Mg(2+) ion are associated with the ADP molecule in the active site, and the other Ca(2+) ion is coordinated by Glu-87, Glu-288, and Asn-290. Our kinetic studies confirm that ATP shows substrate inhibition and that this inhibition is competitive against bicarbonate. The third structure is on the R16E mutant in complex with bicarbonate and Mg-ADP. Arg-16 is located near the dimer interface. The R16E mutant has only a 2-fold loss in catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the mutation significantly destabilized the dimer, although the presence of substrates can induce dimer formation. The binding modes of bicarbonate and Mg-ADP are essentially the same as those to the wild-type enzyme. However, the mutation greatly disrupted the dimer interface and caused a large re-organization of the dimer.

RESULTS: HTE was assessed according to age and clusters (based on 12 baseline characteristics) using a Bayesian hierarchical models. DEX was associated with lower 90-day mortality compared to usual care in patients > 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.83 [95% credible interval [CrI] 0.68C1.00], with 97.7% probability of reduced mortality across broad categories of illness severity.

According to the multivariate analysis, females had lower odds of a positive result from the NPS test (aOR 0.75, 95%CI 0.66-0.85) and of having a severe infection (aOR 0.46, 95%CI 0.37-0.57) than did their male counterparts. These differences were greater with decreasing age in both sexes. In addition, females aged 60 years receiving HT (N=2153, 47.6%) had a 46% lower probability of having a positive NPS test (aOR 0.54, 95%CI 0.36-0.80) than their same-aged peers who had never used HT; there were no differences in the younger age groups with respect to HT status. Conclusion: Female sex was associated with an age-dependent lower risk of having a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than their male counterparts. Age seemed to modify the relationship between HT status and infection: while the two were not related among younger participants, it was negative in the older ones. Future prospective studies are needed to elucidate the potential protective role sex hormones may play.

METHODS: We analyzed statewide data from 280,177 COVID-19 cases from various health care facilities during March 04CDecember 31, 2020. Each COVID-19 case was reported using the standardized Case Report Form (CRF), which collected information on demographic characteristics, symptoms, hospitalization, and death. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the associations between socio-demographics and disease severity, hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Among a total of 280,177 COVID-19 cases, 5.2% (14,451) were hospitalized and 1.9% (5,308) died. Older adults, males, and Black individuals had higher odds for hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (Ps<0.0001). Particularly, individuals residing in rural areas experienced a high risk of death (OR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.25). Regarding disease severity, older adults (OR: 1.06, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.10) and Hispanic or Latino patients (OR: 2.06; 95%CI: 1.95, 2.18), had higher odds of experiencing moderate/severe symptoms, while male and Asian patients, compared to White patients, had lower odds of experiencing moderate/severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: As the first statewide population-based study using data from multiple healthcare systems with a long follow-up period in the US, we provide a more generalizable picture of COVID-19 symptoms and clinical outcomes.

To illustrate how ecological studies and results could be biased, we conducted an ecological study of COVID-19 outcomes and the distance to Brussels using European country-level data. We found that, the distance was negatively correlated with COVID-19 outcomes; every 100 km away from Brussels was associated with approximately 6% to 17% reductions (all P<0.01) in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Europe. Without cautions, such results could be interpreted as the closer to the Europe Union headquarters, the higher risk of COVID-19 in Europe. However, these results are more likely to reflect the differences in the timing of and the responding to the outbreak, etc. between European countries, rather than the 'effect' of the distance to Brussels itself. Associations observed at the group level have limitations to reflect individual-level associations - the so-called ecological fallacy.

Using a panel of 37 convalescent COVID-19 human serum samples, we showed that the magnitude and specificity of responses varied across individuals, independent of their reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs). These data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will elicit primary humoral immune responses in na?ve individuals and variable responses in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the limited cross-coronavirus reactivities in humans, serum samples from 96 dogs and 10 cats showed SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific responses focused on nonCS1 proteins. The correlation of this response with those to other coronaviruses suggests that the antibodies are cross-reactive and generated to endemic viruses within these hosts, which must be considered in seroepidemiologic studies.

Next, the assay was optimized for kinetically balanced conditions and miniaturized, while achieving a robust assay (Z factor > 0.8) and a significant assay window (signal-to-background ratio > 200). Screening 10,240 small molecules from a diverse library revealed candidate inhibitors, which were counterscreened for NSP14 selectivity and RNA intercalation. The assay methodology described here will enable, for the first time, a label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity to accelerate drug discovery efforts and, due to the assay flexibility, can be more broadly applicable for measuring other enzyme activities from other viruses or implicated in various pathologies.","output":"Label-Free Screening of SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 Exonuclease Activity Using SAMDI Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection is a new disease that infects a large number of people, killing a ratio of whom every day in the world.

Detecting factors that disturb nurses' mental health during care of these patients can help to reduce their psychological distress. Therefore, this study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The present qualitative research was performed using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from March to May 2020. Participants in this study included the nurses caring for patients with COVID-19, and they were selected based on the purposeful sampling method. The data was collected through 20 phone call interviews and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis revealed 11 categories including death anxiety, anxiety due to the nature of the disease, anxiety caused by corpse burial, fear of infecting the family, distress about time wasting, emotional distress of delivering bad news, fear of being contaminated, the emergence of obsessive thoughts, the bad feeling of wearing personal protective equipment, conflict between fear and conscience, and the public ignorance of preventive measures.

A trend towards low lymphocyte count and high neutrophil counts in patients with poor outcomes has been reported by earlier studies. We aim to synthesize existing data evaluating the relationship between clinical outcomes and abnormal neutrophil and lymphocyte counts at admission in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An electronic search was carried out in PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify eligible studies reporting frequency data on neutrophilia and lymphopenia at admission in hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Pooled odds ratios of clinical outcomes for each parameter were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies (4,969 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. Lymphopenia at admission was found to be significantly associated with increased odd of progression to severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.20; 95% confidence interval [95CI%], 3.46-5.09) and death (OR, 3.71; 95%CI, 1.63-8.44). Neutrophilia at admission was also found to be significantly associated with increased odd of progression to severe disease (OR, 7.99; 95%CI, 1.77-36.14) and death (OR, 7.87; 95%CI, 1.75-35.35). Subgroup analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with severe lymphopenia (<0.5 x10(9)/L) had 12-fold increased odds of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Admission lymphopenia and neutrophilia are associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Regular monitoring and early and even more aggressive intervention shall hence be advisable in patients with low lymphocyte and high neutrophil counts.

The exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptor that plays a regulatory role in suppressing inflammation. To assess whether EPAC could regulate vWF release during inflammation, we utilized our EPAC1-null mouse model and revealed increased secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice in the absence of the EPAC1 gene. Pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 in vitro mimicked the EPAC1-/- phenotype. In addition, EPAC1 regulated tumor necrosis factor- (TNF)-triggered vWF secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a manner dependent upon inflammatory effector molecules phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Furthermore, EPAC1 activation reduced inflammation-triggered vWF release, both in vivo and in vitro.

A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. However, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, and in the past the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis to find a consensus sequence or common sequence motifs. RESULTS: We present a fully automated search method, EpiSearch that predicts the possible location of conformational epitopes on the surface of an antigen. The algorithm uses peptide sequences from phage display experiments as input, and ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in the peptides and in the patch. We have tested the performance of the EpiSearch algorithm for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments, the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu), the antibody mAb Bo2C11 targeting the C(2) domain of FVIII, antibodies mAb 17b and mAb b12 of the HIV envelope protein gp120, mAb 13b5 targeting HIV-1 capsid protein and 80R of the SARS coronavirus spike protein. In all these examples the conformational epitopes as determined by the X-ray crystal structures of the antibody-antigen complexes, were found within the highest scoring patches of EpiSearch, covering in most cases more than 50% residues of experimental observed conformational epitopes.

METHODS We retrospectively analysed from our prospectively gathered aneurysm database all aneurysms that were treated with balloon remodelling using TransForm occlusion balloon catheters from January 2013 to February 2014. We assessed patient demographics, morphological features of the aneurysms, procedure feasibility, technical and clinical complications. RESULTS Thirty-three patients harbouring 36 intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated during 33 procedures. Clinical finding were: 15 incidental discovery, 13 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), five aneurysms with mass effect, one ruptured aneurysm with SAH and mass effect, one recanalisation and one intraparenchymal haematoma. Thirty-five aneurysms were in the anterior and one in the posterior circulation. Mean dome and neck size were, respectively, 5.8 mm and 3.6 mm. Twenty-three aneurysms were treated with TransForm C and 13 with TransForm SC. We had two procedural thromboembolic complications, without permanent clinical events. No early rebleeding occurred.

FINDINGS: To inform global health programs that are considering employing an HCD approach, lessons learned are distilled into 3 categories: (1) planning: considerations for problem definition and project scoping to allow for flexibility and selection of appropriate methods; (2) engaging: reflections on the means to productively engage different stakeholder groups to build alignment, understanding, and buy-in; (3) applying: adoption of new ways of working during implementation to best take advantage of the benefits of HCD while promoting long-term program sustainability and learning. CONCLUSION: These lessons represent an important step on the pathway to demonstrate the contributions of HCD to improving the effectiveness of health programs at a time when the global health community needs the most robust set of tools possible to meet the demands of our current pandemic context and beyond.","output":"Integrating Human-Centered Design to Advance Global Health: Lessons From 3 Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Argatroban is licensed for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and is conventionally monitored by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio. The target range is 1.5 to 3.0 times the patients baseline APTT and not exceeding 100 s, however this baseline is not always known. APTT is known to plateau at higher levels of argatroban, and is influenced by coagulopathies, lupus anticoagulant and raised FVIII levels. It has been used as a treatment for COVID-19 and Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT). Some recent publications have favored the use of anti-IIa methods to determine the plasma drug concentration of argatroban. METHODS: Plasma of 60 samples from 3 COVID-19 patients and 54 samples from 5 VITT patients were tested by APTT ratio and anti-IIa method (dilute thrombin time dTT). Actin FS APTT ratios were derived from the baseline APTT of the patient and the mean normal APTT. RESULTS: Mean APTT ratio derived from baseline was 1.71 (COVID-19), 1.33 (VITT) compared to APTT ratio by mean normal 1.65 (COVID-19), 1.48 (VITT). dTT mean concentration was 0.64 g/ml (COVID-19) 0.53 g/ml (VITT) with poor correlations to COVID-19 baseline APTT ratio r(2) = 0.1526 p <0.0001, mean normal r(2) = 0.2188 p < 0.0001; VITT baseline APTT ratio r(2) = 0.04 p < 0.001, VITT mean normal r(2) = 0.0064 p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that dTT is a superior method to monitor the concentration of argatroban, we have demonstrated significant differences between APTT ratios and dTT levels, which could have clinical impact.

Sex differences in the response to inflammation have been documented and can be attributed, at least in part, to sex steroid hormones. Moreover, age-associated decreases in sex steroid hormones, namely, estrogen and testosterone, may mediate proinflammatory increases in older adults that could increase their risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Sex hormones can mitigate the inflammation response and might provide promising therapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19.

Results: Transfer students appear to be performing worse than control students in the fully online learning environment. Discussion: There may be a variety of reasons for the poorer performance of transfer students. They may be switching from smaller, in-person learning environments to more impersonal online environments. Limitations: Pre-existing differences in individual students could not be controlled for.

However, due to limited treatment, new cases of infection are still rising. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the basic molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 to control this virus. SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread depend on the recruitment of host ribosomes to translate viral messenger RNA (mRNA). To ensure the translation of their own mRNAs, the SARS-CoV-2 has developed multiple strategies to globally inhibit the translation of host mRNAs and block the cellular innate immune response. This review provides a comprehensive picture of recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular basis and complexity of SARS-CoV-2 protein translation. Specifically, we summarize how this viral infection inhibits host mRNA translation to better utilize translation elements for translation of its own mRNA.

However, GABA receptors can depolarize the resting membrane potential and thus can also show excitatory effects in neurons. The major mechanism behind this depolarization is mainly attributed to the accumulation of chloride ions in the intracellular compartment. This accumulation leads to increase in the intracellular chloride concentration and depolarize the Nernst potential of chloride ions. When the membrane potential is relatively hyperpolarized, this will result in a chloride efflux instead of influx trying to reach their depolarized equilibrium potential. Here, we propose different mechanism based on a major consequence of quantum mechanics, which is quantum tunneling. The quantum tunneling model of ions is applied on GABA receptors and their corresponding chloride ions to show how chloride ions can depolarize the resting membrane potential. The quantum model states that intracellular chloride ions have higher quantum tunneling probability than extracellular chloride ions. This is attributed to the discrepancy in the kinetic energy between them. At physiological parameters, the quantum tunneling is negligible to the degree that chloride ions cannot depolarize the membrane potential. Under certain conditions such as early neuronal development, gain-of-function mutations, stroke and trauma that can lower the energy barrier of the closed gate of GABA receptors, the quantum tunneling is enhanced so that the chloride ions can depolarize the resting membrane potential. The major unique feature of the quantum tunneling mechanism is that the net efflux of chloride ions is attained without the need for intracellular accumulation of chloride ions as long as the energy barrier of the gate is reduced but still higher than the kinetic energy of the chloride ion as a condition for quantum tunneling to take place.","output":"GABA Receptors Can Depolarize the Neuronal Membrane Potential via Quantum Tunneling of Chloride Ions: A Quantum Mathematical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viruses in airborne transmission of COVID-19 has been debated. The aerosols are transmitted through breathing and vocalization by infectious subjects. Some authors state that this represents the dominant route of spreading, while others dismiss the option.

We evaluate typical indoor settings such as an office, a classroom, choir practice, and a reception/party. Our results suggest that aerosols from highly infective subjects can effectively transmit COVID-19 in indoor environments. This \\"highly infective\\" category represents approximately 20% of the patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We find that \\"super infective\\" subjects, representing the top 5-10% of subjects with a positive test, plus an unknown fraction of less-but still highly infective, high aerosol-emitting subjects-may cause COVID-19 clusters (>10 infections). In general, active room ventilation and the ubiquitous wearing of face masks (i.e., by all subjects) may reduce the individual infection risk by a factor of five to ten, similar to high-volume, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtering.

We used a stochastic metapopulation model with a hierarchical structure and fitted the model to the positive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020. We incorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by assuming that the precaution strength grows with positive cases and studied two types of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most states and in the whole US respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while only three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction (k=1). Case fatigue (decline in people's vigilance to positive cases) is responsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of maximal fraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic fatigue (no case fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would have reduced by 68% on average.

Methods: : From 28 March to 24 June 2020, 10 febrile children were admitted with COVID-19 infection showing characteristics of PIMS in Buali tertiary hospital of Sari, in Mazandaran province, northern Iran. Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, and therapeutic modalities were recorded and analyzed. Results: : The mean age of the patients was 5.373.9 years (13 months to 12 years). Six of them were boys. Kawasaki disease, myocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, appendicitis, sepsis, urosepsis, prolonged febrile seizure, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, and COVID-19-related pneumonia were their first presentation. All of them had increased C-reactive protein levels, and most of them had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lymphopenia, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia.

The GMDH model has been first validated and standardised by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively. Thereafter, the number of active cases has been forecasted for the rest of 2020 to predict the impact of lockdown relaxation on spread of COVID-19 and indicate preparatory measures necessary to counter it.","output":"Assessment of impact of relaxation in lockdown and forecast of preparation for combating COVID-19 pandemic in India using Group Method of Data Handling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a health crisis that is experienced by the world Many countries decided to close schools, colleges, and universities The Indonesian government decided to close schools and educational institutions and change the teaching and learning process through face-to-face turns into online learning The transformation in this process impacts online learning for most teachers and students who have not adapted well This study aims to analyze the relevant ministries in the education sector, which is less capable and less responsive, creating the right policy to face changes that occur and policy alternatives that should be taken by the government This study uses the research method mixed method, that is a mixture of qualitative and quantitative with the type of concurrent triangulation to analyze each variables relationship more accurately The data source is secondary data sources derived from journals, online news, and previous research survey results This study shows that there is still the occurrence of inequality of internet access and technology capabilities, especially in rural areas;therefore, online learning facilities and infrastructure should be improved so that there is no aggrieved party","output":"COVID-19 outbreak and education institutions in Indonesia: A critical analysis of the ministry of educations work efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esta nota tcnica aborda o potencial do Programa de Aquisi??o de Alimentos (PAA) como ferramenta para mitigar os impactos econ?micos e sociais da Covid-19 no Brasil, alm de realizar proje??es sobre o alcance do programa em diferentes cenrios de investimento, visando gerar subsdios para auxiliar na tomada de decis?o quanto  aloca??o de recursos em medidas para reduzir os efeitos negativos decorrentes da pandemia","output":"O Programa de Aquisi??o de Alimentos (PAA): instrumento de dinamismo econ?mico, combate  pobreza e promo??o da seguran?a alimentar e nutricional em tempos de Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this narrative medicine essay, a medical school professor expresses gratitude for the caring and empathy expressed by the team caring for her mother hospitalized with COVID-19 and emphasizes the importance of humanity and compassion over facts and statistics for families physically separated from their critically ill loved ones","output":"COVID-19 Communication-The Need for Humanity, Empathy, and Grace: The Journal of the American Medical Association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pandemic emerging in East Asia and spreading rapidly to the rest of the world and continuing in our country. The number of studies examining the symptoms of the otolaryngology system and organs in COVID-19 patients is limited. The purpose of this study is to show whether COVID-19 infections cause any changes in nasal physiology in adult patients by measuring the mucociliary clearance (MCC) time with the saccharin test. METHODS: One hundred one patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (group 1, n = 42 smokers and group 2, n = 59 nonsmokers) and 87 individuals without COVID-19 infection as the control group (group 3, n = 33 smokers and group 4, n = 54 nonsmokers) were included in the study. A saccharin test was used to evaluate the nasal MCC time. RESULTS: Mucociliary clearance test averages of the groups were determined as 473.571  263.684, 442.966  228.463, 468.333  267.367, 412.629  192.179 seconds, respectively. When the test durations were examined, the group with the most prolonged MCC duration was determined as the smoking COVID (+) patient group (473.571  263.684 seconds). The second group, with the most prolonged MCC duration, was determined as the smoking control group (468.333  267.367 seconds). No statistically significant difference was found in intergroup mucociliary clearance time (P = 0.760).

However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-1?, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and elastic fibre fracture in the development of TAD in a rat model. METHODS: The TAD rat model was induced by ?-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). TAD was investigated in 112 male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were equally divided into four groups of 28 rats (Control, BAPN, BAPN + IL-1?, and BAPN + IL-1? antibody). Systolic blood pressure, survival, and the development of TAD were measured after six weeks. Expression of IL-1?, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was measured by Western blot. Apoptosis, aortic elastin concentration, and biomechanical characteristics were measured by the TdT mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay, Victoria blue staining, and in vitro testing. RESULTS: During six weeks, the mortality was 0% (0/28) in the control group, 53.6% (15/28) in the BAPN group (p < .001 compared with the control group), 75.0% (21/28) in the BAPN + IL-1? group (p = .007 compared with the BAPN group), and 35.7% (10/28) in the BAPN + IL-1? antibody group (p = .023 compared with BAPN group and p < .001 compared with the BAPN + IL-1? group). IL-1? treatment deteriorates BAPN induced mortality and aneurysm expansion, which were attenuated by anti-IL-1? treatment. In BAPN + IL-1? group, stress and strain parameters were decreased by 13.5%-53.5% and elastin content was decreased by 14%, and IL-1?, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were expressed higher by 117%, 108%, and 75% when compared with the rats in the BAPN group. Contrarily, in the BAPN + IL-1? antibody group, the above changes could be completely (strain, elastin content, and expression of MMP-2) or partly (elasticity modulus, stress, and expression of MMP-9) blocked by anti-IL-1? treatment. CONCLUSION: IL-1? plays a critical role in TAD formation by altering the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, degrading the aortic wall matrix, causing elastic fibre rupture, and changing the stress or strain of the aortic wall. Anti-IL-1? reduces the later effects and could be one of the molecular targets for prognosis and drug treatment of TAD in the future.","output":"Blocking Interleukin-1 Beta Reduces the Evolution of Thoracic Aortic Dissection in a Rodent Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to drastic changes in how psychiatric consultation-liaison (C-L) services conduct business and required rapid transition to telepsychiatry We describe the practice changes implemented to rapid transition to virtual care in a large, academic psychiatry C-L service in response to the pandemic OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical service structural changes, timelines and impacts on consultation volume as well as present quantitative and qualitative data regarding the experience of this transition from the standpoints of both psychiatric trainees and attending physicians METHODS: We present the narrative descriptions of transition details based on focused interviews with inpatient C-L leadership Inpatient consult volume and charge data were gathered using analysis of health system data Attending and trainee experience of the transition to virtual care were assessed using anonymous, online surveys RESULTS: During the pandemic, the average weekly consultation volume and average weekly charges were significantly lower compared with prepandemic Both volume and charges were affected by addition of video consultation capability Both attendings and trainees had moderate or high comfort and moderate satisfaction with telephone and video consultations Overall, the trainee satisfaction with supervision, learning, and their consult psychiatry experience did not seem to be affected by the pandemic CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the feasibility of the rapid implementation of virtual care in a psychiatric academic C-L service without negatively impacting the learner's consult psychiatry experience This should provide comfort to academic C-L services that required rapid implementation of virtual care (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Adaptation of an academic inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry service during the sars-cov-2 pandemic: Effects on clinical practice and trainee supervision"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A variety of outcome domains are currently measured for the assessment of hearing rehabilitation. To date, there is no consensus about which outcome domains should be measured, when they should be measured, and how they should be measured. In addition, most studies seeking to develop core outcome sets and measures for hearing rehabilitation services have primarily focussed on the opinions and expertise of researchers, and, to a lesser extent, clinicians, rather than also involving clients of those services. The principles of experience-based co-design suggest that health services, researchers, and policymakers should come together with clients and their families to design health services and define what metrics should be used for their success. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to seek views and consensus from a range of key stakeholders to define which client-centred self-report outcome domains should be measured, when they should be measured, and how they should be measured, in a national publicly funded hearing rehabilitation scheme. In addition, the study aimed to identify current and future potential mechanisms and systems to standardise the collection of data and reporting of outcomes, to enable comparison across clients and hearing service providers. METHODS: Two stakeholder groups participated in a three-round online Delphi process: (1) 79 professional stakeholders involved in the delivery of hearing services in Australia, and (2) 64 hearing rehabilitation services clients identified by not-for-profit consumer organisations. An initial set of in-person workshops scoped the key issues upon which to develop the initial open-ended questions and subsequent Likert-scale statements addressing these issues. These statements were then distributed to both groups in an online survey. The respondent ratings were summarised, and the summary was returned to respondents along with a second round of the survey. This process was then repeated once more. The five most important outcome domains from both groups were then combined, and a consensus workshop of seven professionals and three client advocates agreed on the top four ranked domains. RESULTS: A range of potential outcome domains were identified as relevant indicators of successful hearing rehabilitation. Communication ability, personal relationships, wellbeing, and participation restrictions were identified as a core outcome domain set that should be measured as a minimum for patients receiving hearing rehabilitation. There was little agreement on the preferred timepoints for collection of outcome measures, with respondents expressing the view that this should be established by research once a set of outcome measures has been selected. However, there was broad agreement that measurements of these domains should be collected at baseline (before the provision of hearing rehabilitation) and no earlier than 3 months following the completion of rehabilitation. Potential benefits and issues with the development of a national outcomes database/collection system were also identified and prioritised, with participants highlighting the importance of valid, high-quality, trustworthy, and comprehensive data collection. CONCLUSION: These results provide a Core Outcome Domain Set for the self-reported evaluation of hearing rehabilitation and provide important background information for the design of methods to implement them across hearing healthcare systems. However, the wide range of outcome domains identified as potentially providing important additional information and the lack of specific measures to address these domains strongly suggest that there is still more research to be done. Ongoing stakeholder engagement will continue to be vital for future implementation. In addition, further research is required to determine the optimal time following hearing rehabilitation to utilise any particular outcome measure.","output":"Defining a Patient-Centred Core Outcome Domain Set for the Assessment of Hearing Rehabilitation With Clients and Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several reports have determined that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are common complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lead them to poor outcomes. CVD biomarkers have, thus, great potential to be used as prognostic biomarkers. We aimed to determine the accuracy of CVD biomarkers for the prognosis of the COVID-19 patients outcome via a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis. Methods: Until September 30, 2020, we searched Web of Sciences, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed databases to obtain related papers. The summary points and lines were calculated using bivariate/HSROC model. As outcomes, we considered critical conditions and mortality. Results: A total of 17 659 patients from 33 studies were included. Five biomarkers, namely increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK), D-dimer, and thrombocytopenia, met the inclusion criteria. Our results indicated that LDH and cTnI had good accuracy for the prognosis of critical condition (AUCHSROC=0.83 and 0.80, respectively), while LDH, cTnI, and D-dimer had acceptable accuracy (AUCHSROC=0.74, 0.71, and 0.72, respectively) for the prognosis of mortality. LDH and D-dimer had high sensitivity, whereas cTnI had high specificity. The other biomarkers did not have acceptable accuracy. Significant publication bias was found for D-dimer (P=0.053). Conclusion: Among CVD biomarkers, LDH and cTnI had good accuracy for the prognosis of critical outcomes and acceptable accuracy for the prognosis of mortality, without publication bias.

We summarize a paradigm shift over the last 3 years in the field of interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral Mx-family GTPases. Expression of the myxovirus resistance proteins MxA in human cells and its ortholog Mx1 in murine cells is increased 50- to 100-fold by Type I (IFN- and -) and III IFNs (IFN-). Human MxA forms cytoplasmic structures, while murine Mx1 forms nuclear bodies. Since 2002, it has been widely thought that human (Hu) MxA is associated with the membraneous smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In a paradigm shift, our recent data showed that HuMxA formed membraneless phase-separated biomolecular condensates in the cytoplasm. Some of the HuMxA condensates adhered to intermediate filaments generating a reticular pattern. Murine (Mu) Mx1, which was predominantly nuclear, was also confirmed to be in phase-separated nuclear biomolecular condensates. A subset of Huh7 cells showed association of GFP-MuMx1 with intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm. While cells with cytoplasmic GFP-HuMxA condensates and cytoplasmic GFP-MuMx1 filaments showed an antiviral phenotype towards vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), those with only nuclear GFP-MuMx1 bodies did not. The new data bring forward the paradigm that both human MxA and murine Mx1 give rise to phase-separated biomolecular condensates, albeit in different subcellular compartments, and that differences in the subcellular localization of condensates of different Mx proteins determines the spectrum of their antiviral activity.","output":"Metastable biomolecular condensates of interferon-inducible antiviral Mx-family GTPases: A paradigm shift in the last three years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously triggered a sudden, substantial increase in demand for items such as personal protection equipment and hospital ventilators whilst also disrupting the means of mass-production and international transport in established supply chains.

Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish neighbourhoods in England experienced high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020-21 and measles outbreaks (2018-19) due to suboptimal childhood vaccination coverage. The objective of our study was to explore how the coronavirus vaccination programme (CVP) was co-delivered between public health services and an Orthodox Jewish health organisation. Methods included 28 semi-structured interviews conducted virtually with public health professionals, community welfare and religious representatives, and household members. We examined CVP delivery from the perspectives of those involved in organising services and vaccine beneficiaries. Interview data was contextualised within debates of the CVP in Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish print and social media. Thematic analysis generated five considerations: i) Prior immunisation-related collaboration with public health services carved a role for Jewish health organisations to host and promote coronavirus vaccination sessions, distribute appointments, and administer vaccines ii) Public health services maintained responsibility for training, logistics, and maintaining vaccination records; iii) The localised approach to service delivery promoted vaccination in a minority with historically suboptimal levels of coverage; iv) Co-delivery promoted trust in the CVP, though a minority of participants maintained concerns around safety; v) Provision of CVP information and stakeholders response to situated (context-specific) challenges and concerns. Drawing on this example of CVP co-delivery, we propose that a localised approach to delivering immunisation programmes could address service provision gaps in ways that involve trusted community organisations. Localisation of vaccination services can include communication or implementation strategies, but both approaches involve consideration of investment, engagement and coordination, which are not cost-neutral. Localising vaccination services in collaboration with welfare groups raises opportunities for the on-going CVP and other immunisation programmes, and constitutes an opportunity for ethnic and religious minorities to collaborate in safeguarding community health.","output":"Localising Vaccination Services: Qualitative Insights on an Orthodox Jewish Collaboration with Public health during the UK coronavirus Vaccine Programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary explores the manner in which the current COVID-19 crisis is affecting key sources of entrepreneurial finance in the United Kingdom.

Our findings suggest that the volume of new equity transactions in the United Kingdom has declined markedly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic caused many other consequences, including economic implications and teaching consequences, notably in higher education throughout the world. COVID-19 and the resulting closure of university campuses have had many impacts on Health Professions Education (HPEd), affecting all aspects, including teaching methods, assessment methods, curricula, student-teacher relationships, student selection processes, and student well-being. It has had significant effects on the setting in which students are required to learn more skills such as psychomotor skills. This manuscript aims to investigate the changes implemented in medical education during the pandemic and describe one medical school's response to medical education changes during the pandemic. METHODS: This study was a combination of a case study done by in-depth investigation of the current context at one medical school during the pandemic and action research done by gathering information to change a condition in a particular place. RESULTS: Many changes were implemented in medical education, including online teaching for basic science courses (first two years of the program) and online assessments (video-based remote proctoring) in the program's first two years. Such courses as Clinical Skills are using telemedicine/telehealth concepts in training. There were changes such as video-based remote proctoring of NBME shelf-examinations even in the assessments of clerkships/clinical rotations. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations of medical education during this pandemic is highly dependent on technology. Most of the changes will be practiced until the campuses are open.

The structure of their information exchange networks may influence the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to explore and classify information exchange networks in primary care for patients with chronic diseases in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out between 2019 and 2021. As part of a larger project on coordination of care, this study focused on information exchange in practice teams regarding patients with type 2 diabetes (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Social network analysis was applied to determine the number of connections, density and centralization for each of the health conditions for each of the practices. On the basis of the descriptive findings, we developed typologies of information exchange networks in primary care practices. RESULTS: We included 153 health workers from 40 practices, of which 25 practices were included in the social network analysis. Four types of information exchange structures were identified for the three chronic diseases: highly connected networks with low hierarchy, medium connected networks with medium hierarchy, medium connected networks with low hierarchy and lowly connected networks. Highly connected networks with low hierarchy were identified most frequently (18 networks for DM, 17 for CHD and 14 for CHF). Of the three chronic conditions, information sharing about patients with DM involved the most team members. Information exchange outside the family practice took place mainly with nurses and pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified four types of information exchange structures, which provides a practical tool for management and improvement in primary care. Some practices had few information transfer connections and could hardly be considered a network.

By sequencing the differentially expressed lncRNAs in BALF exosomes, we seek potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). Methods Considering that human and rat genes are about 80% similar, ALI was induced using lipopolysaccharide in six male Wistar rats, with six rats as control (all weighing 200  20 g and aged 6-8 weeks). BALF exosomes were obtained 24 h after ALI. The exosomes in BALF were extracted by ultracentrifugation. The differential expression of BALF exosomal lncRNAs in BALF was analyzed by RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to predict the functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs, which were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results Compared with the control group, the ALI group displayed a higher wet/dry ratio, tumor necrosis factor- levels, and interleukin-6 levels (all P < 0.001). The airway injection of exosomes in rats led to significant infiltration by neutrophils. A total of 2,958 differentially expressed exosomal lncRNAs were identified, including 2,524 upregulated and 434 downregulated ones. Five lncRNAs confirmed the reliability of the sequencing data. The top three GO functions were phagocytic vesicle membrane, regulation of receptor biosynthesis process, and I-SMAD binding. Salmonella infection, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and osteoclast differentiation were the most enriched KEGG pathways. The lncRNA-miRNA interaction network of the five confirmed lncRNAs could be predicted using miRDB.

Analyses were conducted on distinguished trabeculation which was divided into NC (maximum noncompacted/compacted ratio  2.0) or hypertrabeculation (HT) (ratio < 2.0). We evaluated features of trabeculation and explored cardiovascular (CV) outcome events (coronary revascularization, hospitalization for worsening heart failure (HF), stroke, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and CV death). Over a mean of 4.2 years, CV outcome events occurred in 122 (41%) patients who were older and exhibited an increased frequency of diabetes mellitus, stroke, implantation of ICD, HF and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Patients in the placebo arm were given identical looking placebo tablets. Rest of the treatment was continued as per the existing protocol and the clinical judgment of the treating teams. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 6 of admission. The secondary outcome measures were symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 115 patients were enrolled for the study of which 112 were included in the final analysis. Of them, 55 were randomised to the intervention arm while 57 were randomised to the placebo arm. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two arms. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 between the two groups.

Methods: This prospective, single-arm, interventional study recruited a total of 309 patients with psoriasis, 163 with psoriatic arthritis and 146 without psoriatic arthritis, who completed a 12-week MTX treatment and 1,031 healthy controls. Patients' characteristics including age, gender, disease duration, height, weight, smoking status, alcohol consumption, medical history, disease severity and liver function test results were accessed and recorded. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of rs1801131 and rs1801133 in the MTHFR gene was performed. Results: The rs1801133 CC genotype was more frequent in patients with PsA than those with PsO and healthy controls (42.3% vs. 28.8% vs. 33.1%, p < 0.05). The 90% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 90) response rates to MTX were significantly higher in patients with the rs1801133 TT genotype than those with the CT and CC genotype (33.96% vs. 19.31% vs. 14.41%, OR = 2.76, p = 0.006).

PATIENTS All patients less than 18 years old were included at admission to the PICU. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Between May 21, 2015, and December 31, 2016, 1,386 consecutive PICU stays from 1,194 patients were recorded in the database. Data were prospectively collected from admission to discharge, every 5 seconds from monitors and every 30 seconds from mechanical ventilators and infusion pumps. These data were linked to the patient's electronic medical record. The database total volume was 241 GB. The patients' median age was 2.0 years (interquartile range, 0.0-9.0). Data were available for all mechanically ventilated patients (n = 511; recorded duration, 77,678 hr), and respiratory failure was the most frequent reason for admission (n = 360).

To collect samples that characterize variability throughout changing hydrologic periods, a process control system was developed for unattended, large-volume (56C2800 L) filtration over extended durations. This system provided flow-weighted mean concentrations during runoff and extended (24-h) low-flow periods. Human viruses and bovine viruses were detected by real-time qPCR in 49% and 41% of samples (n = 63), respectively. All human viruses analyzed were detected at least once including adenovirus (40% of samples), GI norovirus (10%), enterovirus (8%), rotavirus (6%), GII norovirus (1.6%) and hepatitis A virus (1.6%). Three of seven bovine viruses analyzed were detected including bovine polyomavirus (32%), bovine rotavirus (19%), and bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (5%). Human viruses were present in 63% of runoff samples resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 20% of low-flow samples. Maximum human virus concentrations exceeded 300 genomic copies/L. Bovine viruses were present in 46% of runoff samples resulting from precipitation and snowmelt and 14% of low-flow samples. The maximum bovine virus concentration was 11 genomic copies/L. Statistical modeling indicated that stream flow, precipitation, and season explained the variability of human viruses in the watershed, and hydrologic condition (runoff event or low-flow) and season explained the variability of the sum of human and bovine viruses; however, no model was identified that could explain the variability of bovine viruses alone.

People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical distancing) if theyre financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT.

In this paper, we aim to improve the generalization ability of DR models from source training domains with rich supervision signals to target domains without any relevant labels, in the zero-shot setting. To achieve that, we propose Momentum adversarial Domain Invariant Representation learning (MoDIR), which introduces a momentum method in the DR training process to train a domain classifier distinguishing source versus target, and then adversarially updates the DR encoder to learn domain invariant representations.

Hydroxyurea is the primary disease-modifying therapy for the SCD, with proven benefits to reduce both short-term and long-term complications. Despite the well-described inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and optimal dose, hydroxyurea is traditionally initiated at a weight-based dose with a subsequent conservative dose escalation strategy to avoid myelosuppression. Because the dose escalation process is time consuming and requires frequent laboratory checks, many providers default to a fixed dose, resulting in inadequate hydroxyurea exposure and suboptimal benefits for many patients. Results from a single-center trial of individualized, PK-guided dosing of hydroxyurea for children with SCD suggest that individualized dosing achieves the optimal dose more rapidly and provides superior clinical and laboratory benefits than traditional dosing strategies. However, it is not clear whether these results were due to individualized dosing, the young age that hydroxyurea treatment was initiated in the study, or both. The Hydroxyurea Optimization through Precision Study (HOPS) aims to validate the feasibility and benefits of this PK-guided dosing approach in a multi-center trial. METHODS: HOPS is a randomized, multicenter trial comparing standard vs. PK-guided dosing for children with SCD as they initiate hydroxyurea therapy. Participants (ages 6 months through 21 years), recruited from 11 pediatric sickle cell centers across the USA, are randomized to receive hydroxyurea either using a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day (Standard Arm) or a PK-guided dose (Alternative Arm). PK data will be collected using a novel sparse microsampling approach requiring only 10 L of blood collected at 3 time-points over 3 h. A protocol-guided strategy more aggressive protocols is then used to guide dose escalations and reductions in both arms following initiation of hydroxyurea. The primary endpoint is the mean %HbF after 6 months of hydroxyurea. DISCUSSION: HOPS will answer important questions about the clinical feasibility, benefits, and safety of PK-guided dosing of hydroxyurea for children with SCD with potential to change the treatment paradigm from a standard weight-based approach to one that safely and effectively optimize the laboratory and clinical response.

Despite the authorization, the off-label use of these vaccines may still be possible especially to answer specific concerns as the lack of vaccine doses, the delay in the delivery of planned doses or the pressure from public opinion and political influence also in relation to the evolution of the pandemic. This paper aims to assess the possible off-label use of COVID-19 vaccines and the ethical and medico-legal implications of this eventuality.

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients with OCD who attended a specialist OCD Clinic in Barcelona, Spain, were assessed by phone from April 27 to May 25, 2020, during the early phase of the pandemic, using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and a structured interview that collected clinical and sociodemographic information. Results were compared with those for 237 healthy controls from the same geographic area who completed an online survey. RESULTS: Although 65.3% of the patients with OCD described a worsening of their symptoms, only 31.4% had Y-BOCS scores that increased >25%. The risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV2 was reported as a new obsession by 44.8%, but this only became the main obsessive concern in approximately 10% of the patients. Suicide-related thoughts were more frequent among the OCD cohort than among healthy controls. The presence of prepandemic depression, higher Y-BOCS scores, contamination/washing symptoms, and lower perceived social support all predicted a significantly increased risk of OCD worsening. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with OCD appear to be capable of coping with the emotional stress of the COVID-19 outbreak and its consequences during the initial phase of the pandemic. Nevertheless, the current crisis constitutes a risk factor for a significant worsening of symptoms and suicidal ideation. Action is needed to ensure effective and individualized follow-up care for patients with OCD in the COVID-19 era.","output":"How is COVID-19 affecting patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder?

We aimed to assess the feasibility of prehospital bolus dose esmolol for patients with RVF treated by a high\\\\volume, ground\\\\based emergency medical services (EMS) agency. METHODS: Esmolol (0.5 mg/kg single bolus) was added to the RVF protocol on December 10, 2018. Feasibility was defined as esmolol administration in >75% of RVF cases. Secondarily, we compared the proportion of patients with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 24\\\\hour survival, and survival to hospital discharge during the intervention period (December 10, 2018CJune 10, 2020) to a historical control period (June 10, 2017CDecember 9, 2018) using chi\\\\square tests. RESULTS: Before the protocol change, 63 patients with RVF were identified. After esmolol was added, 70 patients with RVF were identified and 61 (87%) received esmolol. Prehospital ROSC was higher in the esmolol group compared to the historical control group, though statistical significance was not reached (38% versus 24%, P = 0.09). Overall, few patients survived to 24 hours (esmolol n = 15, pre\\\\esmolol n = 16) and fewer survived to hospital discharge (esmolol n = 5, pre\\\\esmolol n = 5), precluding stable statistical comparisons. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings suggest that EMS clinicians are able to accurately identify RVF and administer esmolol in the prehospital setting and that ROSC may be increased.

The contemporary political theory literature-which largely conceptualizes legitimacy in terms of democracy or basic rights-would seem to suggest not. I argue, however, that there exists another, overlooked aspect of legitimacy concerning a government's ability to ensure safety and security. While, under normal conditions, maintaining democracy and rights is typically compatible with guaranteeing safety, in emergency situations, conflicts between these two aspects of legitimacy can and often do arise. A salient example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, during which severe limitations on free movement and association have become legitimate techniques of government. Climate change poses an even graver threat to public safety. Consequently, I argue, legitimacy may require a similarly authoritarian approach. While unsettling, this suggests the political importance of climate action.

It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of 18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of 24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of &#8805;5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients' outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. RESULTS: A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57-77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (&#8805;5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P 0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22-3.32, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk.

Vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and 25-OHD levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (including outcomes), laboratory measurements (including 25-OHD) and a thoracic computerized tomography (including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20ng/mL (<50nmol/L) and severely low (or deficient) 25-OHD as a level []12ng/mL (<30nmol/L) RESULTS: Of the 551 patients included, low 25-OHD levels were present in 45.6% and severely low levels in 10.9%. Severely low 25-OHD levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19 (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.94-0.99, p=0.042), adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by 25-OHD levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency ([]12ng/mL or <30nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low 25-OHD may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Serum Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 severity markers and mortality independent of visceral adiposity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the end of 2019 the first cases of severe pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China.

In RTA type 4, there is either deficiency or resistance to aldosterone leading to impaired regulation of electrolytes and hydrogen ions. This leads to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidemia. We present an unsuspecting etiology to RTA type 4 in a critically ill. SARS-CoV-2 patient as noted by heparin use for VTE prophylaxis. [1,2] CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old male with history of chronic kidney disease, leukemia in remission presents with 6-day history of flu-like symptoms including intermittent diarrhea, fevers, decreased appetite, shortness of breath and generalized malaise with exposure to several known sick contacts with SARS-CoV-2. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and started on Decadron, Remdesivir, Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, Lovenox, Zinc, and vitamin C and subsequently intubated on day 10. Creatinine up trended and peaked at 3.51 mg/dL on hospital day 14. He developed hyperkalemia initially presumed to be secondary to acute kidney injury. His platelet counts declined by >50%, >10 days after hospitalization. Due to concern for HIT, argatroban was started but stopped due to bleeding. As fondaparinux is contraindicated in renal failure, he was restarted on heparin when HIT ab (-) result was obtained. Serum potassium peaked at 6.7 mmol/L on day 21. He was treated with calcium gluconate, insulin D50, Patiromer 8.4 g with no significant improvement in potassium levels. Due to concerns that use of heparin may be causing hyperkalemia by suppressing aldosterone, heparin was discontinued. Subsequently, serum potassium levels improved to normal range. DISCUSSION: In RTA type 4, either low levels of aldosterone or from kidneys not responding to aldosterone, impaired sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion occurs.[2]. Persistent hyperkalemia in whom there is no apparent cause such as potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic or renal failure, hypoaldosteronism must be considered [3-5].In COVID-19, there exists a higher propensity for thromboembolic disease and often prevention with heparin can serve as the best treatment. Heparin has a direct toxic impact on the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells, which may be facilitated by a drop in the number and affinity of adrenal angiotensin II receptors [4,6]. This reduction in aldosterone can lead to severe hyperkalemia [6]. CONCLUSIONS: This case is unique because hyperkalemia was noted to be refractory to the typical standard treatment given the etiology was hypoaldosteronism likely secondary to heparin use. Most patients with RTA if treated adequately in the early stages do not develop permanent kidney failure, have better mortality and morbidity outcomes and necessitate a broad etiologic differential.

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquineazithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. METHODS: Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquineazithromycin from March 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in Torsade de pointes. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation, and arrhythmogenic death. RESULTS: Two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine, and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was not observed in the entire population. Baseline corrected QT interval intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) versus those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; 440.624.9 versus 439.924.7 ms, P=0.834).

Associating exposure with bioaerosol and health problems is challenging, and adequate exposure monitoring is a top priority for aerosol scientists. The multiple factors affecting bioaerosol content, the variability in the focus of each bioaerosol exposure study, and the variations in experimental design and the standardization of methods make bioaerosol exposure studies very difficult. Therefore, the health impacts of bioaerosol exposure are still poorly understood. This paper presents a brief description of a state-of-the-art development in bioaerosol exposure studies supported by studies on several related subjects. The main objective of this paper is to propose new considerations for bioaerosol exposure guidelines and the development of tools and study designs to better interpret bioaerosol data. The principal observations and findings are the discrepancy of the applicable methods in bioaerosol studies that makes result comparison impossible. Furthermore, the silo mentality helps in creating a bigger gap in the knowledge accumulated about bioaerosol exposure. Innovative and original ideas are presented for aerosol scientists and health scientists to consider and discuss. Although many examples cited herein are from occupational exposure, the discussion has relevance to any human environment. This work gives concrete suggestions for how to design a full bioaerosol study that includes all of the key elements necessary to help understand the real impacts of bioaerosol exposure in the short term. The creation of the proposed bioaerosol public database could give crucial information to control the public health. Implications: How can we move toward a bioaerosol exposure guidelines? The creation of the bioaerosol public database will help accumulate information for long-term association studies and help determine specific exposure biomarkers to bioaerosols. The implementation of such work will lead to a deeper understanding and more efficient utilization of bioaerosol studies to prevent public health hazards.","output":"On the interpretation of bioaerosol exposure measurements and impacts on health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 pandemic continues to spread across the world in late August 2020.

This study sought to investigate whether quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with depression among Koreans. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Seoul COVID-19 Study of Quarantine (SCS-Q) and the 2019 Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS). Using propensity scores estimated based on sociodemographic and health conditions, 919 individuals undergoing quarantine in the SCS-Q were matched with 919 individuals who did not experience quarantine in the 2019 KCHS. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), where major depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score  10. Logistic regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors. RESULTS: Depression prevalence was higher in quarantined individuals than in the control group (7.8 vs. 3.8%, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses revealed that quarantining was associated with higher likelihoods of having major depression [odds ratio (OR) = 2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.49, 3.51] after adjusting for relevant covariates. LIMITATIONS: Due to the online nature of the SCS-Q, this study included a limited number of elderly participants, limiting the generalizability of the findings to the general Korean population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that Koreans undergoing COVID-19 quarantine are at higher risk of depression. While further investigation is warranted, public health measures to control infectious disease outbreaks, such as quarantine, would benefit from incorporating strategies to address unintended adverse psychological effects, such as depression.","output":"Depression During COVID-19 Quarantine in South Korea: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to drastic changes in the lives of customers. Social isolation, financial difficulties, fear of being infected and many other factors have caused the psychological well-being of customers to deteriorate. By taking up the role of online reviews in the regulation of consumers moods, this study aims to examine the changes that have occurred in online product ratings, as well as the negative tone and word counts of product reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the online reviews of 321 products in the pre-COVID, immediate COVID and extended COVID periods. This paper compares the changes that have taken place in product evaluations via various analysis of variance analyses. The authors also test the effect of COVID-related deaths on product evaluations via regression analyses. Findings: The results indicate that online product ratings decreased sharply just after the outbreak of COVID-19. The study also found that the tone of reviews was found to be more negative and the length of reviews appeared to be longer in comparison to the pre-COVID-19 period. The results also revealed that the product type (experience vs search) moderated the effect of the pandemic in online reviews and the impact of COVID-19 on online product reviews diminished in the later stages of the ongoing pandemic. Practical implications: Managers should be aware of the detrimental impact of pandemics on online product reviews and be more responsive to customer problems during the early stages of pandemics. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes the effects of a pandemic on online product ratings and review content.

We propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain, possibly along olfactory nerves. This is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals. In our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models.

In general and during lockdown phases, people worldwide use social media network to state their viewpoints and general feelings concerning the pandemic that has hampered their daily lives. Twitter is one of the most commonly used social media platforms, and it showed a massive increase in tweets related to coronavirus, including positive, negative, and neutral tweets, in a minimal period. The researchers move toward the sentiment analysis and analyze the various emotions of the public toward COVID-19 due to the diverse nature of tweets. Meanwhile, people have expressed their feelings regarding the vaccinations' safety and effectiveness on social networking sites such as Twitter.

It is unknown if bypassing thrombolysis centres in favour of endovascular thrombectomy (mothership) outweighs transport to the nearest thrombolysis centre for alteplase and then transfer for endovascular thrombectomy (drip-and-ship). We use conditional probability modelling to determine the impact of treatment times on transport decision-making for acute ischaemic stroke. Materials and methods Probability of good outcome was modelled using a previously published framework, data from the Irish National Stroke Register, and an endovascular thrombectomy registry at a tertiary referral centre in Ireland. Ireland was divided into 139 regions, transport times between each region and hospital were estimated using Google's Distance Matrix Application Program Interface. Results were mapped using ArcGIS 10.3. Results Using current treatment times, drip-and-ship rarely predicts best outcomes. However, if door to needle times are reduced to 30 min, drip-and-ship becomes more favourable; even more so if turnaround time (time from thrombolysis to departure for the endovascular thrombectomy centre) is also reduced. Reducing door to groin puncture times predicts better outcomes with the mothership model. Discussion This is the first case study modelling pre-hospital transport for ischaemic stroke utilising real treatment times in a defined geographic area. A moderate improvement in treatment times results in significant predicted changes to the optimisation of a national acute stroke patient transport strategy. Conclusions Modelling patient transport for system-level planning is sensitive to treatment times at both thrombolysis and thrombectomy centres and has important implications for the future planning of thrombectomy services.","output":"Drip and ship versus direct to endovascular thrombectomy: The impact of treatment times on transport decision-making."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the large number of mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, only population-based studies can provide reliable estimates of the magnitude of the pandemic. We therefore aimed to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Munich general population after the first wave of the pandemic. For this purpose, we drew a representative sample of 2994 private households and invited household members 14 years and older to complete questionnaires and to provide blood samples. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was defined as Roche N pan-Ig &#8805; 0.4218. We adjusted the prevalence for the sampling design, sensitivity, and specificity. We investigated risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and geospatial transmission patterns by generalized linear mixed models and permutation tests. Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was 1.82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-2.37%) as compared to 0.46% PCR-positive cases officially registered in Munich.

METHODS: This work aims to describe the development and study protocol of the SmartFeeding4Kids (SF4K) program, an online self-guided 7-session intervention for parents of young (2C6 years old) children. The program is informed by social cognitive, self-regulation, and habit formation theoretical models and uses self-regulatory techniques as self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback to promote behavior change. We propose to examine the intervention efficacy on childrens intake of fruit, vegetables, and added sugars, and parental feeding practices with a two-arm randomized controlled with four times repeated measures design (baseline, immediately, 3 and 6 months after intervention). Parental perceived barriers about food and feeding, food parenting self-efficacy, and motivation to change will be analyzed as secondary outcomes. The study of the predictors of parents dropout rates and the trajectories of parents and childrens outcomes are also objectives of this work.

We aimed to compare the innate immunity transcriptome signature between COVID-19 and KD, and to analyze the interactions of these molecules with genes known to predispose to KD. METHODS: Transcriptome datasets of COVID-19 and KD cohorts (E-MTAB-9357, GSE-63881, GSE-68004) were downloaded from ArrayExpress for innate immune response analyses. Network analysis was used to determine enriched pathways of interactions. RESULTS: Upregulations of IRAK4, IFI16, STING, STAT3, PYCARD, CASP1, IFNAR1 and CD14 genes were observed in blood cells of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections with moderate severity. In the same patient group, increased expressions of TLR2, TLR7, IRF3, and CD36 were also noted in blood drawn a few days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Elevated blood PYCARD level was associated with severe COVID-19 in adults. Similar gene expression signature except differences in TLR8, NLRP3, STING and IRF3 levels was detected in KD samples. Network analysis on innate immune genes and genes associated with KD susceptibility identified enriched pathways of interactions. Furthermore, higher expression levels of KD susceptibility genes HLA-DOB, PELI1 and FCGR2A correlated with COVID-19 of different severities. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most enriched innate immune response pathways were shared between transcriptomes of KD and COVID-19 with moderate severity.

We examined this hypothesis in a sample of underserved Black adults. Methods: Black adults (n=67) recruited from a clinical setting completed assessments of medical mistrust, trust in public authorities and the media as well as a scale to assess COVID-19 related stress, perceptions, and safety behaviors. Inflammation levels were measured using C-Reactive Protein levels derived from a blood assay. Sleep Quality was indicated using apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and REM generated by a home sleep assessment tool (Itamar WatchPAT200). The association between feelings of mistrust with COVID-19 related outcomes were examined using bivariate correlations. Results: The study sample were 66% female and had a mean age of 56.1 (SD=5.1) years. Overall, participants endorsed high levels of mistrust in medical and public authorities, high levels of COVID-related stress, and low engagement in safety behaviors (see Table 1). Higher levels of medical mistrust were associated with a lower belief that reducing the number of people met in a day (r= -.258;p&lt;.05) and avoiding public transportation (r= -.259;p&lt;.05), would reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. Lower levels of trust in public authorities were associated with higher levels of AHI (r= -.312;p&lt;.05), and less REM sleep (r= .444;p&lt;.01). Lower levels of media trust were associated with higher levels of inflammation (CRP;r= -.368;p&lt;.05) and AHI (r= -.413;p&lt;.05).

It can be suggested that the serological tests be only used as complementary tests to rRT-PCR or for monitoring the immune response of children with COVID-19.","output":"The Accuracy of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay in the Diagnosis of COVID-19 in Iranian Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic individuals and by blood transfusion are important issues to understand in order to control the viral spread. In this work, we estimated the current SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in blood donors from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Saliva and blood samples were collected from 4103 blood donors from June 15 to September 30, 2020. Saliva samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in mini-pools of four samples. Individual samples were tested for positive or inconclusive pools, and positive donors had their plasma tested. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (0.66%) blood donors were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their saliva, but their plasma was negative, except for one, who presented a high viral load in saliva and nasopharyngeal samples and RNAemia in the plasma close to the limit of detection. Fourteen (56%) positive blood donors reported mild symptoms related to COVID-19 after donation, but the viral load levels were not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION: Despite the measures taken by Blood Centers to avoid blood donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers are able to donate. The risk of the virus transmission by transfusion seems to be negligible since plasma RNAemia was seen at a very low level in only one (3.7%) of the positive donors, but other studies must be performed to confirm this finding.

Fatigue has an adaptive function and serves as a temporary signal to rest and save energy often in response to immune activation. It may, however, also persist in a pathological condition incurring significant burden. While subjective symptoms and scientific consensus indicate that both physical and mental determinants of motivated behavior are affected in fatigue, the underlying processes are rarely examined using objective, task-based indicators. Methods. In three consecutive studies, including validation (N = 48) and reliability assessments (N = 27), we use an experimental task to jointly objectify reward learning and effort execution as two determinants of behavioral motivation. In addition, we tested how fatigue and its acute perturbation in response to immune activation after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are linked to these task-based indicators of motivation in a longitudinal cross-over design (N = 55). Results. The validation study showed the utility of the experimental task for simultaneously assessing learning, effort exertion, and its regulation based on subjective confidence. The reliability assessment over a one-week period indicated that symptoms of fatigue and task behavior are highly reliable and that repetition effects have little impact on motivated behavior. Finally, in the vaccination trial, we found significant links between fatigue and task behavior. Baseline levels of fatigue predicted how effort is gauged in dependence of current confidence about reward outcomes, and state perturbations of fatigue in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduced confidence during learning. Importantly, task success was significantly lower in subjects who reported high fatigue at baseline and who additionally experienced stronger increase in fatigue in response to vaccination. Discussion. Our results demonstrate that the experimental task allows to jointly assess determinants of motivated behavior, and to link its constituent processes to subjective fatigue. This suggests that our understanding of fatigue and its perturbation due to acute immune activation can benefit from objective, task-based indicators of the underlying motivational mechanisms. Future studies could build on these findings to further deepen the understanding of neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying fatigue in the context of immune activation.","output":"Determinants of motivated behavior are linked to fatigue and its perturbation by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Sense of purpose has been associated with greater health and well-being, even in daily contexts. However, it is unclear whether effects would hold in daily life during COVID-19, when people may have difficulty seeing a path towards their life goals. DESIGN The current study investigated whether purposefulness predicted daily positive affect, negative affect, and physical symptoms. Participants (n = 831) reported on these variables during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response in North America. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants completed daily surveys asking them for daily positive events, stressors, positive affect, negative affect, physical symptoms, and purposefulness. RESULTS Purposefulness at between- and within-person levels predicted less negative affect and physical symptoms, but more positive affect at the daily level. Between-person purposefulness interacted with positive events when predicting negative and positive affect, suggesting that purposeful people may be less reactive to positive events. However, between-person purposefulness also interacted with daily stressors, insofar that stressors predicted greater declines in positive affect for purposeful people. CONCLUSION Being a purposeful person holds positive implications for daily health and well-being, even during the pandemic context. However, purposefulness may hold some consequences unique to the COVID-19 context, which merit attention in future research.","output":"Purposefulness and daily life in a pandemic: Predicting daily affect and physical symptoms during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of pandemic COVID-19 has created unprecedented need for information. The pandemic is the cause of significant mortality and with this the need for rapidly disseminated information for palliative care professionals regarding the prevalence of symptoms, their intensity, their resistance or susceptibility to symptom control and the mode of death for patients. METHODS We undertook a systematic review of published evidence for symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (with a specific emphasis on symptoms at end of life) and on modes of death. Inclusion: prospective or retrospective studies detailing symptom presence and/or cause or mode of death from COVID-19. RESULTS 12 papers met the inclusion criteria and gave details of symptom burden: four of these specifically in the dying and two detailed the cause or mode of death. Cough, breathlessness, fatigue and myalgia are significant symptoms in people hospitalised with COVID-19. Dyspnoea is the most significant symptom in the dying. The mode of death was described in two papers and is predominantly through respiratory or heart failure. CONCLUSIONS There remains a dearth of information regarding symptom burden and mode of death to inform decisions regarding end-of-life care in patients dying with COVID-19. Rapid data gathering on the mode of death and the profile of symptoms in the dying and their prevalence and severity in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent will provide important intelligence for clinicians.

All sizes of landholdings are deforesting much more than before, and current political and economic forces favoring the agribusiness sector foreshadow increasing rates of forest clearing for pasture establishment in Apu. The area cleared per year over the 2013C2018 period in Apu grew by a percentage more than twice the corresponding percentage for the Brazilian Amazon as a whole. With the national congress and presidential administration signaling impunity for illegal deforestation, wealthy actors, and groups are investing resources in land grabbing and land accumulation, with land speculation being a crucial deforestation factor. This paper is unique in providing causal explanations at the decision-makers level on how deforestation trajectories are linked to economic and political events (period effects) at the larger scales, adding to the literature by showing that such effects were more important than aging and cohort effects as explanations for deforestation trajectories.

Identifying populations vulnerable to these effects is beneficial for promoting effective health and prevention strategies. Using health insurance receipt data from 2009 to 2020, we assessed changes in prevalence of major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and mental disorders, among affected populations before and after the Fukushima disaster and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Japan. Furthermore, age and sex groups with the largest increases in prevalence after these events were identified. The participants of this study were members of the Employees Health Insurance scheme, including employees of companies and their dependent family members. The dataset was provided by JMDC Inc. The annual age-adjusted prevalence of each disease was used to calculate the ratio of disease prevalence before and after the events. After the Fukushima disaster, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes generally increased over a 9-year period in Fukushima Prefecture. The increase in the prevalence rate of these three NCDs and mental disorders were the highest among females aged 40-74 years compared to males and the other age groups. The prevalence of all four diseases increased after the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, with marked increase in males aged 0-39 years.

Despite the evolution of global standards to protect health workers and ensure the delivery of health care in times of conflict, attacks against health systems have continued throughout the worldviolating humanitarian law, undermining human rights, and threatening public health. The persistence of such violence against health care, especially in humanitarian crises related to armed conflict, has prompted global institutions to develop systematic monitoring mechanisms in an effort to alleviate these harms, seeking to protect health workers from being harmed for their healing efforts. This article examines the development and implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare (SSA) as a systematic mechanism to collect and disseminate data concerning attacks on health care systems. Although the SSA provides a foundation for monitoring attacks in conflict zones, this research considers whether the SSA has collected the necessary data, categorized these data appropriately, and disseminated sufficient information to facilitate human rights accountability, analyzing the political, methodological, and institutional challenges faced by WHO.

Items included body composition, dietary habits assessed by the Lifestyle Behaviour Questionnaire (LBQ), attitudes towards being role models for health (RA: role attitudes) and attitudes toward health promotion practice (ATHPP): 33.8% of the sample self-reported as overweight or obese; 67.6% did not consume 5-a-day portions of fruit/veg; 31.5% reported a healthy diet; and 89.6% believed their diet could be healthier. Positive RA was significantly linked to health promotion engagement (HP) (? = 0.33, p < 0.001). Positive ATHPP was significantly predicted by lower BMI (? = ?0.08, p = 0.078), positive RA (? = 0.67, p < 0.001), lower HP (? = ?0.25, p < 0.001) and male gender (? = 0.09, p = 0.02).

Herein, we aimed to determine patient-perceived seizure control during the surge, specific variables associated with worsened seizures, the prevalence of specific barriers to care, and patient-perceived efficacy of epilepsy care delivered via telephone and live video visits during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study of adult epilepsy patients who had a scheduled appointment at a single urban Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (Montefiore Medical Center) between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bronx. Subjects able to answer the questionnaire themselves in English or Spanish were eligible to complete a one-time survey via telephone or secure online platform (REDCap). RESULTS: Of 1212 subjects screened, 675 were eligible, and 177 adequately completed the questionnaire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 75.1% of patients reported no change in seizure control, whereas 17.5% reported that their seizure control had worsened, and 7.3% reported improvement. Subjects who reported worsened seizure control had more frequent seizures at baseline, were more likely to identify stress and headaches/migraines as their typical seizure precipitants, and were significantly more likely to report increased stress related to the pandemic. Subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 did not report worsened seizure control. Nearly 17% of subjects reported poorer epilepsy care, and 9.6% had difficulty obtaining their antiseizure medications; these subjects were significantly more likely to report worse seizure control.

We examine the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress in ED clinicians working during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined psychological and physiological (sleep, resting heart rate, blood pressure) of a sample of frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: This was a sample of 52 clinicians (physicians, residents, nurses, PAs, NPs) who were frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic across a diverse (academic, community, urban, and suburban) range of four emergency departments in the New York Metropolitan area during July 2020-September 2020. Study design is a longitudinal prospective cohort design. At baseline, we conducted a psychological test battery including measures of COVID-19 related stress, PTSD (PCL-5), anxiety (GAD-5), depression (PHQ-9), and burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory). We also assessed home blood pressure at wake/sleep, resting heart rate, and sleep duration using an accelerometer watch device (Fitbit). Results: Baseline demographics in our sample had more self-identified women participants (62%), caucasian (67%), with median age of 42. Sample was diverse, containing physicians/advanced practice providers (45%) nurses (43%) and residents (12%) At baseline, positive screens for psychological symptoms were common;48% for acute stress, 37% for depressive, and 30% for anxiety symptoms. Overall, housestaff rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from attendings or nurses. Overall participants had elevated levels of emotional exhaustion on burnout surveys (median 24, SD 3.5). Average sleep duration was 6.2 hours (SD 1.3), resting heart rate of 86 (SD 18.2), and home blood pressure of 128/76. Increased levels of emotional exhaustion was positively associated with elevated resting blood pressure (Pearson r=.32), and resting heart rate (r=.38), while negatively associated with sleep duration (r=.23). Conclusion: Our preliminary work and others have highlighted that HCWs are experiencing significant COVID-19-related psychological and physical distress. Future work and data will address key questions such as whether such elevated distress symptoms remain persistent with the evolution of the pandemic.

METHODS: We assessed medical data regarding all patients who underwent emergency surgery at the main campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 23, 2020, to February 15, 2020. We classified patients based on suspicion of COVID-19 infection (suspected vs not suspected) before they were admitted to the operating room. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. Outcomes included the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 infection and length of stay, which were followed until March 25, 2020. RESULTS: Among the 88 emergency patients included in this study, the mean age was 37 years. Twenty-five patients presented with abnormalities observed on chest CT scans and 16 presented with fever. The median wait time for surgery was one day. The median preparation time and median time until short orientation memory concentration test (SOMCT) recovery from anesthesia were 44.0 min and 23.0 min, respectively. The median postoperative length of stay was five days. Compared with patients not suspected of COVID-19 infection, six patients were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in the suspected group. No health care workers were infected during this study period. CONCLUSION: Simple identification using temperature screening of patients, respiratory symptoms, and chest CT scans before being admitted for emergency surgery was rapid and effective. Shortened contact times might reduce the risk of infection. Additional investigations with larger samples and improved designs are needed to confirm these observations.","output":"Simple and Effective Primary Assessment of Emergency Patients in a COVID-19 Outbreak Area: A Retrospective, Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Translate and investigate psychometric properties of the Polish version of COVID-19-PTSD in a sample of healthcare workers. METHODS: The PTSD symptoms were investigated among 184 participants (physicians, nurses, and paramedics). The respondents completed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Related to COVID-19 Questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD) via online survey. The psychometric properties (i.e., internal consistency, validity, and reliability) of the Polish version of COVID-19-PTSD were analyzed. RESULTS: The findings showed that the Polish version of COVID-19-PTSD is a reliable instrument. The total and subscale scores demonstrated good internal consistency. We also found that the prevalence of PTSD was reported at around 32% of healthcare workers. DISCUSSION: The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Related to COVID-19 Questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD) is a first tool designed to assess the severity of PTSD symptoms related to the pandemic. The findings of our study confirmed good validity and reliability of the Polish version of COVID-19-PTSD which can be recommended to be used as a reliable screening tool to conduct psychological screening among Polish healthcare workers.","output":"Polish Version of the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Related to COVID-19 Questionnaire COVID-19-PTSD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebral arterial vasoreactivity is vital to the regulation of cerebral blood flow. Depolarization of arterial myocytes elicits whole-cell Ca(2+) oscillations as well as subcellular Ca(2+) sparks due to activation of ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Previous evidence illustrates that contraction of cerebral arteries from sheep and underlying Ca(2+) signaling pathways are modified by age and that long-term hypoxia (LTH) causes aberrations in Ca(2+) signaling pathways and downstream effectors impacting vasoregulation. We hypothesize that age and LTH affect the influence of membrane depolarization on whole-cell intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations and sub-cellular Ca(2+) spark activity in cerebral arteries. To test this hypothesis, we examined Ca(2+) oscillatory and spark activities using confocal fluorescence imaging techniques of Fluo-4 loaded basilar arterial myocytes of low- and high-altitude term fetal (145 days of gestation) and adult sheep, where high-altitude pregnant and non-pregnant sheep were placed at 3,801 m for >100 days. Ca(2+) oscillations and sparks were recorded using an in situ preparation evaluated in the absence or presence of 30 mM K(+) (30K) to depolarize myocytes. Myocytes from adult animals tended to have a lower basal rate of whole-cell Ca(2+) oscillatory activity and 30K increased the activity within cells. LTH decreased the ability of myocytes to respond to depolarization independent of age. These observations illustrate that both altitude and age play a role in affecting whole-cell and localized Ca(2+) signaling, which are important to arterial vasoreactivity and cerebral blood flow.","output":"Long-Term Hypoxia Negatively Influences Ca(2+) Signaling in Basilar Arterial Myocytes of Fetal and Adult Sheep"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China has become an emergency of international concern When thousands of peolple were infected around the world We report a case infected by SARS-Cov-2 and HIV simultaneously,which showed a longer course of disease and slower generation of specific antibody This case highlights the coinfection of SARS-Cov-2 and HIV may impaire the immune system worse","output":"Case Report: One Case of Coronavirus Desease 2019(COVID-19) in Patient Co-nfected by HIV With a Low CD4+ T Cell Count"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims The dosages and efficacy of 14 ultraviolet (UV) decontamination technologies were measured against a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus that was dried on to different materials for lab and field testing.

In addition, it references the practical experience of developing and teaching modules focused on the craft of playmaking for the online Theatre Studies BA at Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance. Although there may appear to be a disconnection between encouraging playwrights to engage with collaborative theatre making and the mainly asynchronous nature of an online degree, where students often work in isolation, the core tenet of this 'Perspectives' piece is that all teaching of playwriting, regardless of whether it is online or not, needs to move beyond the traditional classroom/workshop approach. Whilst the pedagogical framework that sees students engage in text-based studies of scripts and books about writing cannot be entirely abandoned, students benefit from a more embodied approach, which reminds them that they are writing for a medium which communicates in a multi-faceted way and is negotiated in the moment, so that they gain a more holistic understanding of how a script might be interpreted in live performance. Drawing on both my practice as a playwright and dramaturg, and my work in online teaching, I argue that there is potential to treat the 'Zoom room' as workshop, where students can work together, improvise, and treat their screens as spaces for experimentation and performance. In addition, this more dynamic approach helps to prepare students for a rapidly evolving theatre ecology, which had embraced digital technology long before Covid-19 entered our lives. ? 2022 Open Library of Humanities.

We aimed to develop and validate CT-based radiomic models for predicting the presence of residual lung lesions in COVID-19 survivors at three months after discharge. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 162 COVID-19 confirmed patients in our hospital (84 patients with residual lung lesions and 78 patients without residual lung lesions, at three months after discharge). The patients were all randomly allocated to a training set (n = 114) or a test set (n = 48). Radiomic features were extracted from chest CT images in different regions (entire lung or lesion) and at different time points (at hospital admission or at discharge) to build different models, sequentially, or in combination, as follows: (1) Lesion_A model (based on the lesion region at admission CT); (2) Lesion_D model (based on the lesion region at discharge CT); (3) lesion model (based on the lesion region at admission CT and discharge CT); (4) Lung_A model (based on the lung region at admission CT); (5) Lung_D model (based on the lung region at discharge CT); (6) lung model (based on the lung region at admission CT and discharge CT). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the predictive performances of the radiomic models. Results: Among the six models, the Lesion_D and the lesion models achieved better predictive efficacy, with AUCs of 0.907 and 0.927, sensitivity of 0.898 and 0.763, and specificity of 0.855 and 0.964 in the training set, and AUCs of 0.875 and 0.837, sensitivity of 0.920 and 0.680, and specificity of 0.826 and 0.913 in the test set, respectively.

The study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced dose (5.0  10 9 cfu) of S19 vaccine in adult cattle and its shedding in the milk of vaccinated cattle using molecular techniques. The OIE recommended tests (RBPT, SAT, and iELISA) for brucellosis screening in cattle were used. Seronegative cattle (n = 90) of different age groups (young, old heifers & milking cows, n = 30 each) were selected for the vaccine trials. Antibody titers were recorded at 7th, 21st, 30th, 60th, 90th and 120th days post-vaccination (DPV) to monitor the immune responses following vaccination and at 150th, 180th, 210th and 240th DPB following booster-dose to an intraocular group. The humoral immune responses observed by RBPT and ELISA, proved that antibody titers persisted in s/c group compared to the i/o group in all categories. The IFN-?3 stimulation (CMI) due to reduced dose vaccination was noticed early as 30th in all groups and declined after 90th DPV, with higher IFN-?3 stimulation among the s/c group.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor and dual-labeled trastuzumab with both a fluorophore (IRDye800CW) and a radioactive label (111In) can be used for multimodal imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model. METHODS Trastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100 g [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48 h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal. RESULTS Based on the biodistribution data, a 30 g dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13  2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101  7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2  0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression. CONCLUSIONS Dual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors.","output":"Multimodal image-guided surgery of HER2-positive breast cancer using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast tumor model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic and during the first week of May Bangladesh has reported more than 10,000 cases.

The more useful studies are pathogen-focused trials which do not exclude the more complicated subjects with conditions such as renal failure, immunocompromised status, or exposure to prior antibiotic therapy. METHODS: The TANGO II study was an open-label investigation of M-V compared with the best available treatment (BAT) in hospitalized adults with a confirmed infection that was known or suspected to be a CRE infection. TANGO II specifically included patients with comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, renal failure, and immunocompromised status that are typical in patients with a CRE infection. Interim data analysis indicated that a significant benefit was seen for those patients receiving M-V over BAT. This analysis reports on subsets of TANGO II study patients with multiple comorbidities and high severity of illness, specifically those with prior antibiotic therapy, renal failure, and immunocompromised status. A patient case that highlights particular complexities and challenges of treating patients with CRE infections in the real world is also presented.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on neurocritically ill patients at a 413-bed level 1 trauma and stroke center who received three or more days of mechanical ventilation to describe rates of VAE, describe characteristics of patients with VAE, and examine the association of VAE on ventilator days, mortality, length of stay, and discharge to home. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period from 2014 through 2018, 855 neurocritically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation were identified. A total of 147 VAEs occurred in 130 (15.2%) patients with an overall VAE rate of 13 per 1000 ventilator days and occurred across age, sex, BMI, and admission Glasgow Coma Scores. The average time from the start of ventilation to a VAE was 5 (range 3C48) days after initiation of mechanical ventilation. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions, VAEs met criteria for a ventilator-associated condition in 58% of events (n = 85), infection-related VAE in 22% of events (n = 33), and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia in 20% of events (n = 29). A most common trigger for VAE was an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (84%). Presence of a VAE was associated with an increase in duration of mechanical ventilation (17.4[IQR 20.5] vs. 7.9[8.9] days, p < 0.001, 95% CI 7.86C13.92), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (20.2[1.1] vs. 12.5[0.4] days, p < 0.001 95% CI 5.3C10.02), but not associated with in-patient mortality (34.1 vs. 31.3%. 95% CI 0.76C1.69) or discharge to home (12.7% vs. 16.3%, 95% 0.47C1.29).

During COVID-19, accessing online books, completing assignments, and online assessments are highly recommended by universities, teachers, and students. The Internet has increasingly become a vital part of our lives, and distant online classes increase the dependency of students on the Internet. The aim of this study is to assess the level of internet addiction among medical or non-medical students in Tanta University, Egypt. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during October and November 2020. It included 373 students from the faculty of medicine and 373 non-medical students from the faculty of science. The validated (IAT-20) was used to assess the level of Internet addiction among these students. A total of 51.7% of medical students were found severe internet addicts and 43.4% of them were possible addicts compared to only 11.3% of non-medical students who were found severely addicted to the Internet and 68.9% of them were possible addicts with statistically significant difference between them. Female students of both colleges were found addicted to the Internet than males. Female medical and non-medical students suffered from severe Internet addiction more than non-medical and male ones.

While numerous measures have been put in place to detect an infected person and protect uninfected areas from contracting these contagious diseases, the spread of diseases like COVID-19 continues to be rapid. As of the time of writing this paper, the number of affected people has continued to rise, and there is no clear indication of the number of people who are infected but have gone undiscovered and are spreading the infections. That is why, in order to combat the threat of contiguous disease spread, this research presented an upgraded autonomous socio-contact tracing system on a mobile platform.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is associated with reduced food insecurity, but benefit levels may be insufficient for beneficiaries to afford healthy foods. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether participation in SuperSNAP, a program that provides an additional $40 per month for the purchase of fruits and vegetables with no added sugar, sodium, or fat to SNAP beneficiaries, is associated with changes in food purchasing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study used data from transaction records of a large supermarket chain with approximately 500 stores located across North Carolina from October 2019 to April 2020. Participants were SNAP beneficiaries. EXPOSURE: SuperSNAP participation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly spending on all fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts (primary outcome); spending on less healthy food categories; and spending on sugar-sweetened beverages as 1 category of less healthy foods. Monthly data on purchases by SNAP beneficiaries before and during SuperSNAP participation were compared with data from SNAP beneficiaries not enrolled in the program who shopped at the same stores. Overlap weighting (a propensity scoreCbased method) was used to account for confounding, and linear mixed-effects models were fitted with random effects to account for repeated measures and clustering by store. RESULTS: The study included 667 SuperSNAP participants and 33 246 SNAP beneficiaries who did not use SuperSNAP but shopped in the same stores; 436 SuperSNAP participants had preintervention data and were included in the main analysis. SuperSNAP participation was associated with increased monthly purchases of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes ($31.84; 95% CI, $31.27-$32.42; P < .001; 294.52 oz; 95% CI, 288.84-300.20 oz; P < .001). Only a small increase in spending on less healthy food categories compared with the SNAP beneficiaries who did not use SuperSNAP ($1.60; 95% CI, $0.67-$2.53; P < .001) was observed. As total spending increased, the proportion of total food and beverage spending on less healthy foods significantly decreased (difference, 4.51%; 95% CI, 4.27%-4.74%; P < .001). Monthly spending on sugar-sweetened beverages decreased (difference, $1.83; 95% CI, $1.30-$2.36; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, participation in SuperSNAP was associated with meaningful increases in healthy food purchasing.

Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-h food recall. Plasma oxidative stress related markers superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-oxo-dG) were measured. The association between dietary antioxidant vitamin intake, oxidative stress related markers and NAFLD were analysed by Spearman correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Mediation models were established to examine whether SOD mediated the association between dietary vitamin A or &#945;-tocopherol intake and NAFLD. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that dietary vitamin A and &#945;-tocopherol intake were positively correlated with SOD (p < .05). Multiple logistic regression analysis found plasma SOD, dietary vitamin A and &#945;-tocopherol intake were inversely associated with NAFLD (all p < .05). Mediation analysis indicated that SOD significantly mediated the indirect effect of dietary &#945;-tocopherol (mediated effect = 13.21% total effect) or vitamin A (mediated effect = 3.12% total effect) intake on NAFLD. Our study indicated that dietary vitamin A and &#945;-tocopherol intake may contribute to protect from NAFLD in Chinese non-diabetics, and the associations were partly mediated by SOD.

Previously, we modeled Social Distancing with t/dbl as a linear function of time, where N[t]=1exp[+K/A t/(1+ gamma/o t)] is used here. Additional parameters besides {K/o,gamma/o} are needed to better model different rho[t]=dN[t]/dt shapes. Thus, a new Orthogonal Function Model [OFM] is developed here using these orthogonal function series: N(Z) = sum[m=0,M/F] g/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z] , R(Z) = sum[m=0,M/F] c/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z] , where N(Z) and Z[t] form an implicit N[t]=N(Z[t]) function, giving: G/o = [K/A / gamma/o ] , Z[t] = +[ G/o / (1+ gamma/ot) ] , rho[t] = [ gamma/o / G/o ] (Z^2) R(Z) , with L/m(Z) being the Laguerre Polynomials. At large M/F values, nearly arbitrary functions for N[t] and rho[t]=dN[t]/dt can be accommodated. How to determine {K/A, gamma/o} and the {g/m; m=(0,+M/F)} constants from any given N(Z) dataset is derived, with rho[t] set by: c/(M/F - k) = sum[m=0,k] g/m .

Given its rarity, current evidence is mainly based on case reports and case series, and no guidelines are available. The present study investigated the current surgical management and related outcomes of LA in the upper limb. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and Virtual Health Library were accessed in September 2021. Clinical studies evaluating patients with LA undergoing surgical treatment were considered eligible for this systematic review. Only studies which reported data on LA located in the upper limb with histopathological confirmation were considered. Articles that reported data from nonsurgical management were not considered. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies reporting 22 lesions in 21 patients were assessed. The mean age of the patients was 48.48 years (range 22C77). Most studies evaluated the restoration of range of motion and symptom resolution for the functional outcome assessment. Open or arthroscopic excision and synovectomy were the most common surgical procedures for LA. The concomitant lesions were treated in a single-stage procedure. All patients had satisfactory outcomes after open or arthroscopic excision and synovectomy without recurrence at a mean follow-up of 21.14 months (range 2C60). One patient developed postoperative cellulitis (4.55%). CONCLUSION: Open and arthroscopic excision combined with synovectomy should be considered the standard treatment option of upper limb LA.

Main outcome: Hospitalisation with COVID-19 Results: The cohort comprised 158,445 healthcare workers, the majority being patient facing (90,733 / 158,445; 57.3%), and 229,905 household members. Of all COVID-19 hospitalisations in the working age population (18-65-year-old), 17.2% (360 / 2,097) were in healthcare workers or their households. Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in non-patient facing healthcare workers and their households was similar to the risk in the general population (hazards ratio [HR] 0.81; 95%CI 0.52-1.26 and 0.86; 95%CI 0.49-1.51 respectively).

This is the case for salamanders, which can adapt to most environments on earth. On the Korean Peninsula, Hynobius salamanders are widespread, with several species overlapping in distribution. In addition, while there are seven segregated clades based on mitochondrial DNA, only four of them have been described as segregated species and the three others are candidate species for which the species level of divergence has not been tested yet. Here we measured 329 individuals from all seven clades, in areas of range overlap or not, on islands and on the mainland (Graphical Abstract A), and tested for the species status of the three candidate species. Individuals on the mainland had a generally broader morphology than those on the islands (Graphical Abstract B), and individuals in the range overlap differed from the individuals from the same species that were not found in presence of another clade (Graphical Abstract C). Despite a significant impact of the island effect and the sympatric areas, all seven clades have significantly different morphologies, and we describe Hynobius notialis sp. nov., Hynobius geojeensis sp. nov. and Hynobius perplicatus sp. nov. ABSTRACT: Closely related individuals from different areas can see their morphologies change based on differences between clades, but also ecological variables such as the island effect or sympatry. This is the case of salamanders, which have adapted to a broad range of ecological niches, ranging from underground dwellers in xeric landscape to tropical arboreal habitats. On the Korean Peninsula, salamanders from the Hynobius clade are widespread on the mainland and islands, with several partially sympatric clades and candidate species. Currently, seven lineages have been identified based on mtDNA, four of them matching named species and three others for which the species status remains untested. While the morphology of Korean Hynobius is known to be variable between genetically segregated clades, we hypothesise that (1) the candidate species are morphologically different, and that (2) the island effect and (3) the sympatric status have significant impacts on the morphology of individuals within the genus. Here we measured 329 Hynobius salamanders from all seven clades, in areas of sympatry and allopatry, and on islands and on the mainland (Graphical Abstract A). We determined that the island effect had a significant impact on the morphology of the genus, with mainland individuals generally displaying a broader range of morphology than islandic individuals (Graphical Abstract B). We also determined that sympatry had an impact on morphology, with the sizes of individuals from clades in sympatric areas diverging from each other (Graphical Abstract C). Finally, we demonstrated that all seven clades have significantly different morphologies, and we described the three candidate species that had already been isolated based on mtDNA and microsatellite data: Hynobius notialis sp. nov., Hynobius geojeensis sp. nov. and Hynobius perplicatus sp. nov. We conclude that looking at morphology alone would be misleading about the true diversity of Hynobius species, and species in general, because of the island and patry effects.","output":"Disentangling the Impacts of Speciation, Sympatry and the Island Effect on the Morphology of Seven Hynobius sp.

This research aims to scrutinize the outlook, awareness, and customs of Saudi undergraduate students regarding COVID-19. METHODS: The current cross-sectional study comprises 178 undergraduate students in the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences. The data were collected from online Google form questionnaires. The differences were picked out of the questionnaires, and the mean scores of the differences were duly assessed. The variables associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were evaluated; moreover, a comparative study was conducted on these variables in different faculty departments. ANOVA, Students t-test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the data on knowledge, attitude, and practice. RESULTS: Most of the undergraduate students were well acquainted with COVID-19. We obtained the mean knowledge score for COVID-19 to be 3.08  .82 (range: 1C5), indicating good knowledge. The attitude means the score was 3.02  .61 (range: 0C4), implying good positive attitudes.

To achieve the low detection limit for the early stage where a small number of viruses are present in the sample, proper amplified signals from a sensor can make readable and reliable detection. In this work, a new model of fluorescent and electrochemical dual-mode detection system has been developed to detect virus, taking recombinant Chikungunya virus E1 protein (CHIK-VP) as an example. The hydrophobic quantum dots (QDs) embedded in the lipid bilayer of liposome and methylene blue (MB) encapsulated in the inner core of liposomes played a role of dual-signaling modulator. After CHIK-VP addition, the nanocomposites and APTES-coated Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4) NPs) were conjugated with antibodies to form a sandwich structure and separated from the medium magnetically. The nanoconjugates have been burst out by chloroform as surfactant, and both the QDs and MB are released from the liposome and were then monitored through changes in the fluorescence and electrochemical signals, respectively. These two fluorometric and electrochemical signals alteration quantified the CHIK-VP in the range of femtogram to nanogram per milliliter level with a LOD of 32 fg mL(?1), making this liposomal system a potential matrix in a virus detection platform.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 100 SCA patients; 50 with COVID-19 (COVID group) and 50 without (non-COVID group). All patients signed written informed consent. RESULTS: The COVID group had a significantly higher VOC episode median per year; 3 (IQR,1-6) vs 2 (IQR,2-12) (P < 0.05). The need for hospitalisation was similar in both groups. The non-COVID group had more history of culture-proven infection (P = 0.05). The COVID-group had more osteonecrosis (P < 0.05), splenic sequestration, splenomegaly and hepatic crisis (P = 0.05, 0.006, 0.02; respectively) and significantly higher (P < 0.05) symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain and anosmia.

In this study, we analyzed Ab-secreting cell and Ab responses in 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19 and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific Ab-secreting cells in all 20 COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot Assay.

Studies suggest some psychiatric disorders are associated with differences in discounting compared with controls, but null findings have also been reported. Objective To conduct a meta-analysis of the published literature on delay discounting in people with psychiatric disorders. Data Sources PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched through December 10, 2018. The psychiatric keywords used were based on DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnostic categories. Collected data were analyzed from December 10, 2018, through June 1, 2019. Study Selection Following a preregistered Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, 2 independent raters reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. English-language articles comparing monetary delay discounting between participants with psychiatric disorders and controls were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Hedges g effect sizes were computed and random-effects models were used for all analyses. Heterogeneity statistics, one-study-removed analyses, and publication bias indices were also examined. Main Outcomes and Measures Categorical comparisons of delay discounting between a psychiatric group and a control group. Results The sample included 57 effect sizes from 43 studies across 8 diagnostic categories. Significantly steeper discounting for individuals with a psychiatric disorder compared with controls was observed for major depressive disorder (Hedges g = 0.37; P = .002; k = 7), schizophrenia (Hedges g = 0.46; P = .004; k = 12), borderline personality disorder (Hedges g = 0.60; P < .001; k = 8), bipolar disorder (Hedges g = 0.68; P < .001; k = 4), bulimia nervosa (Hedges g = 0.41; P = .001; k = 4), and binge-eating disorder (Hedges g = 0.34; P = .001; k = 7). In contrast, anorexia nervosa exhibited statistically significantly shallower discounting (Hedges g = -0.30; P < .001; k = 10). Modest evidence of publication bias was indicated by a statistically significant Egger test for schizophrenia and at the aggregate level across studies. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this study appear to provide empirical support for delay discounting as a transdiagnostic process across most of the psychiatric disorders examined; the literature search also revealed limited studies in some disorders, notably posttraumatic stress disorder, which is a priority area for research.","output":"Delay Discounting as a Transdiagnostic Process in Psychiatric Disorders: A Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess if a vacuum-assisted closure device initially utilised as a temporising measure to dress a wound defect over a cochlear implant prior to definitive surgical intervention could instead be used to close the soft tissue and avoid surgery.

Given the importance of COVID-19 TP rates for understanding COVID-related morbidity, researchers and clinicians have become increasingly interested in comparing TP rates across countries. The statistical methods for performing such comparisons fall into two general categories: frequentist tests and Bayesian methods. Using data from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org), we performed comparisons for two prototypical yet disparate pairs of countries: Bolivia versus the United States (large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates), and South Korea vs. Uruguay (two very small TP rates of similar magnitude). Three different statistical procedures were used: two frequentist tests (an asymptotic z-test and the 'N-1' chi-square test), and a Bayesian method for comparing two proportions (TP rates are proportions). Results indicated that for the case of large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates (Bolivia versus the United States), the frequentist and Bayesian approaches both indicated that the two rates were substantially different. When the TP rates were very small and of similar magnitude (values of 0.009 and 0.007 for South Korea and Uruguay, respectively), the frequentist tests indicated a highly significant contrast, despite the apparent trivial amount by which the two rates differ. The Bayesian method, in comparison, suggested that the TP rates were practically equivalent-a finding that seems more consistent with the observed data. When TP rates are highly similar in magnitude, frequentist tests can lead to erroneous interpretations. A Bayesian approach, on the other hand, can help ensure more accurate inferences and thereby avoid potential decision errors that could lead to costly public health and policy-related consequences.","output":"Statistical methods for comparing test positivity rates between countries: Which method should be used and why?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this special interest group (SIG), we follow up on previous conversations around hybrid models for conferences, conducted in open sessions by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) Executive Committee (EC).

Infants were stratified as follows: Group 1: no significant placental pathology; Group 2: single significant placental lesion; and Group 3: 2 placental lesions (multiple lesions). Primary outcome was death and/or BPD. Two-year neurodevelopmental follow-up was compared. RESULTS: In all, 42% (100/241) of infants had one placental lesion, and 34% (82/241) 2 lesions.

An 8-item symptom inventory (pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, fever, swelling, discharge, redness) was developed and made available on postoperative days (POD) 2-6. Responses exceeding defined thresholds of severity triggered alerts to healthcare providers. Symptoms, alerts, actions taken, urgent care center (UCC) visits, hospital admissions were tracked until POD 30. Patient satisfaction was evaluated on POD 7. A patient was defined as \\"responder\\" if at least 5/8 items on at least 3 PODs were completed. The assessment method was deemed successful if 64/100 patients responded. RESULTS: 97/102 patients were evaluable; 65 met \\"responder\\" criteria (67% responder rate; 95% CI 57-76%). 321 surveys were completed (median 4/patient), 248 (77%) in &#8804;2 min.

However, the prevalence of OSA among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and relationship to outcomes is poorly characterized, and the relevance of other sleep disorders remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of pre-existing sleep disorders and association with outcomes related to severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital System were included. Electronic medical records were queried for sleep disorders diagnostic codes. Data was extracted from polysomnography and home sleep testing in a subgroup with previous diagnostic testing at our center. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep disorders with mechanical ventilation requirement, treatment with vasopressors, and death, and Cox proportional hazards regression for time to discharge. RESULTS Among N=572 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 113 (19.8%) patients had OSA, 4 patients had central sleep apnea (CSA) (0.7%), 5 had hypoventilation (0.9%), 63 had insomnia (11.0%), and 22 had restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements disorder (RLS/PLMD) (3.9%). After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and race, no significant relationship was apparent between sleep disorders diagnoses or indices of sleep disordered breathing severity and outcomes.

No association between brachial BP variables and mortality was shown for the total sample in quartiles analysis; however, MAP in the highest quartile, compared with the second, was associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence intervals, 1.09-3.12) among cognitively impaired individuals. The fractional-polynomials approach for BP confirmed this finding and further showed, solely in the MMSE <24 subcohort, U-shaped trends of MAP and systolic BP, with increased mortality risk in extremely low or high values; no such pattern was evident for patients with MMSE 24.

Recently, vaccination against COVID-19 has begun, but further studies on effective therapeutic agents are still needed. The severity of COVID-19 is attributable to several factors such as the dysfunctional host immune response manifested by uncontrolled viral replication, type I interferon suppression, and release of impaired cytokines by the infected resident and recruited cells. Due to the evolving pathophysiology and direct involvement of the host immune system in COVID-19, the use of immune-modulating drugs is still challenging. For the use of immune-modulating drugs in severe COVID-19, it is important to balance the fight between the aggravated immune system and suppression of immune defense against the virus that causes secondary infection. In addition, the interplaying events that occur during virus-host interactions, such as activation of the host immune system, immune evasion mechanism of the virus, and manifestation of different stages of COVID-19, are disjunctive and require thorough streamlining.

In South Africa, the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown have highlighted the shortcomings in the protection and care of children. Children in alternative care are particularly at risk as a result of disrupted and uncoordinated service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and impact of the pandemic and the resulting social isolation on the wellbeing and protection of children living in a residential care facility. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: We used qualitative, participatory approaches - specifically draw-and-write methods - to engage with 32 children (average age = 13.5 years) living in a residential care facility in Gauteng. FINDINGS: Children in care demonstrated an awareness of the socio-economic difficulties facing communities in South Africa, and shared deep concerns about the safety, well-being and welfare of parents and siblings. Although they expressed frustration at the lack of contact with family members, they acknowledged the resources they had access to in a residential care facility, which enabled them to cope and which ensured their safety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We focus our discussion on the necessity of a systemic response to child welfare, including a coordinated approach by policy makers, government departments and child welfare systems to address the structural factors at the root of inequality and inadequate, unacceptable care. This response is essential not only during COVID-19 but also in pre- and post-pandemic context.","output":"'When will I be free': Lessons from COVID-19 for Child Protection in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since 2011, there have been ongoing massive unexplained increases of sargassum seaweed strandings along the coastlines of Caribbean countries.

METHODS: This observational study included patients from January 2018 to December 2018 for complaints attributed to decomposing sargassum seaweed. History and geographical characteristics of sargassum seaweed strandings as well as detection of ambient air hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels were documented during the inclusion period. FINDINGS: A total of 154 patients were included. Mean exposure period was 3 months.

In this scenario, monitoring spatial and temporal properties plays a key role in the understanding of how complex behaviors can emerge from local and dynamic interactions. We propose here the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a logic-based formal language designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over the execution of mobile and spatially distributed CPS. STREL considers the physical space in which CPS entities (nodes of the graph) are arranged as a weighted graph representing their dynamic topological configuration. Both nodes and edges have attributes modeling physical and logical quantities that can evolve over time. STREL combines the Signal Temporal Logic with two spatial modalities reach and escape that operate over the weighted graph. From these basic operators, we can derive other important spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere, and surround. We propose both qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint semirings, an algebraic structure suitable for constraint satisfaction and optimization. We provide an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and we show the feasibility of our approach with the application to two case studies: monitoring spatio-temporal requirements over a simulated mobile ad-hoc sensor network and a simulated epidemic spreading model for COVID19.","output":"A Logic for Monitoring Dynamic Networks of Spatially-distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sacituzumab govitecan (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy; Trodelvy?) is a Trop-2-directed antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (SN-38) that is being developed by Immunomedics for the treatment of solid tumours, including breast cancer.

There is evidence of improved survival after 24 weeks though the ideal mode of delivery remains unclear. There are no clear management protocols to guide patient management. We sought to determine the incidence of preterm labour occurring between 24 to 28 weeks, its associated risk factors and the preferred mode of delivery in a low resource setting with the aim of streamlining patient care. METHODS: Between February 2020 and September 2020, we prospectively followed 392 women with preterm labour between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation and their newborns from admission to discharge at Kawempe National Referral hospital in Kampala, Uganda. The primary outcome was perinatal mortality associated with the different modes of delivery. Secondary outcomes included neonatal and maternal infections, admission to the Neonatal Special Care Unit (SCU), need for neonatal resuscitation, preterm birth and maternal death. Chi-square test was used to assess the association between perinatal mortality and categorical variables such as parity, mode of delivery, employment status, age, antepartum hemorrhage, digital vaginal examination, and admission to Special Care unit. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between comparative outcomes of the different modes of delivery and maternal and neonatal risk factors. RESULTS: The incidence of preterm labour among women who delivered preterm babies between 24 to 28 weeks was 68.9% 95% CI 64.2C73.4). Preterm deliveries between 24 to 28 weeks contributed 20% of the all preterm deliveries and 2.5% of the total hospital deliveries. Preterm labour was independently associated with gravidity (p-value = 0.038), whether labour was medically induced (p-value <0.001), number of digital examinations (p-value <0.001), history of vaginal bleeding prior to onset of labour (p-value < 0.001), whether tocolytics were given (p-value < 0.001), whether an obstetric ultrasound scan was done (p-value <0.001 and number of babies carried (p-value < 0.001). At multivariate analysis; multiple pregnancy OR 15.45 (2.00C119.53), p-value < 0.001, presence of fever prior to admission OR 4.03 (95% CI .23C13.23), p-value = 0.002 and duration of drainage of liquor OR 0.16 (0.03C0.87), p-value = 0.034 were independently associated with preterm labour. The perinatal mortality rate in our study was 778 per 1000 live births. Of the 392 participants, 359 (91.5%), had vaginal delivery, 29 (7.3%) underwent Caesarean delivery and 4 (1%) had assisted vaginal delivery. Caesarean delivery was protective against perinatal mortality compared to vaginal delivery OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.14C0.82, p-value = 0.017). The other protective factors included receiving antenatal corticosteroids OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.33C0.98, p-value = 0.040, Doing 3C4 digital exams per day, OR = 0.41, 95% 0.18C0.91, p-value = 0.028) and hospital stay of > 7 days, p value = 0.001.

Dynamic pro-gramming techniques divide a problem situation into several sub-problems and dynamically solves each sub-problem based on student needs. Thus it allows student focused customization at each step and provides adaptive e-learning to support students with different capabilities. The objective of this study is to review different e-learning problems and challenges and how those can be addressed using dynamic programming techniques. We conclude by highlighting the importance of different dynamic programming techniques for different processes of e-learning.","output":"Improving the Effectiveness of e-Learning Processes through Dynamic Programming: A Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The harsh conditions of the gastro-intestinal (GI) milieu pose a major barrier to the oral delivery of protein nanocages. Here we studied the stability of Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (NV) virus-like particles (VLPs) in simulated GI fluids. NV VLPs capsids and procapsids were transiently expressed in plants, the VLPs were incubated in various simulated GI fluids and their stability was determined by gel electrophoresis, density gradient ultracentrifugation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the capsids were highly resistant to simulated gastric fluids at pH 3. Even under the harshest conditions, which consisted of a pepsin solution at pH 1.2, NV capsids remained assembled as VLPs, though some digestion of the coat protein occurred. Moreover, 80.8% (10.2%) stability was measured for NV capsids upon 4 hours incubation in simulated intestinal fluids. The high resistance of this protein cage to digestion and denaturation can be attributed to its distinctively compact structure. The more porous form of the VLPs, the procapsid, was less stable under all conditions. Our results suggest that NV VLPs capsids are likely to endure transit through the GI tract, designating them as promising candidate protein nanocages for oral drug delivery.","output":"High stability of plant-expressed virus-like particles of an insect virus in artificial gastric and intestinal fluids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Health services that were already under pressure before the COVID-19 pandemic to maximize its impact on population health, have not only the imperative to remain resilient and sustainable and be prepared for future waves of the virus, but to take advantage of the learnings from the pandemic to re-configure and support the greatest possible improvements.

Besides, control of nosocomial infections transmitted from HCWs to the patients is also a cause of concern. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the hospital staff of a tertiary care health facility in north India. Methods: The HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG+IgM) using chemiluminescence immunoassay between June 22 and July 24, 2020. Venous blood (2 ml) was collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies. Results: Of the 3739 HCWs tested, 487 (13%) were positive for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was observed in administrative staff (19.6%) and least in physicians (5.4%). The staff who used public (20%) and hospital transportation (16.9%) showed higher seroprevalence compared to staff using personal transportation (12.4%). No difference was observed between HCWs posted in COVID versus non-COVID areas. All seropositive symptomatic HCWs in our study (53.6%) had mild symptoms, and the remaining 46.4 per cent were asymptomatic. The antibody positivity rate progressively increased from 7.0 per cent in the first week to 18.6 per cent in the fourth week during the study. Interpretation & conclusions: The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a significant number of asymptomatic HCWs, association with the use of public transport, relatively lower seroprevalence compared with the non-HCWs and rising trend during the period of the study highlight the need for serosurveillance, creating awareness for infection control practices including social distancing and study of infection dynamics in the community for effective control of an infectious pandemic.","output":"Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers & implications of infection control practice in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the successes and barriers to the implementation of Public Health England (PHE) infection prevention and control guidance in English maternity units during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews with obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists who worked in a maternity unit in England, UK between March 2020 and July 2021. A thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Successes to the implementation of PHE guidance were related to existing infrastructure, training satisfaction, and organisational culture where subthemes considered the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, COVID-19 dedicated roles and hospital wide communication. Barriers to implementation related to the applicability of the guidance with subthemes highlighting contradictions between updates, specialties and hospitals, undesirable timings and frequency of guidance updates, reductions in staff compliance, and delayed implementation. Finally, the layout of some units made it difficult to implement various aspects of the guidance (e.g. social distancing), and many detailed issues related to information technology compatibility, a lack of availability and accessibility to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and variances in testing arrangements between units. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides information on the experiences of healthcare professionals working on maternity units during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early detection could reduce CRC incidence and mortality, and reduce CRC health disparities, which may be due in part to lower screening adherence and later stage diagnosis among African Americans compared to whites. Culturally tailored interventions to increase access to and uptake of CRC stool-based tests are one effective strategy to increase benefits of screening among African Americans. The objectives of this study were to obtain feedback from African Americans on CRC educational materials being developed for a subsequent behavioral clinical trial and explore participants knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CRC and CRC screening. Seven focus groups were conducted between February and November 2020. Participants were African Americans recruited through community contacts. Four focus groups were held in-person and three were conducted virtually due to Covid-19 restrictions. Participants ranked CRC educational text messages and provided feedback on a culturally tailored educational brochure. A focus group guide with scripted probes was used to elicit discussion and transcripts were analyzed using traditional content analysis. Forty-two African Americans participated. Four themes were identified from focus group discussions: (1) knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs on CRC and CRC screening; (2) reliable sources of cancer education information; (3) cultural factors affecting perspectives on health; and (4) community insights into cancer education.

Critical theorists have observed how work is linked to recognition and self-realization. Consequently, they see how unemployment can lead to a sense of alienation. Exploring the social practices among young entrepreneurial creative people receiving unemployment benefits in Denmark, we pose the following research question: how do young people in the unemployment benefit system work within and against the system? Based on interviews with young unemployed people conducted as part of a PhD (Pultz, 2017), we aim to unfold how the young people challenge the work first paradigm, including resisting the neoliberal understanding that human worth is determined by employment status. We combine insight from critical theory in order to understand the current work pathologies and apply the critical psychological concepts of restricted and expansive agency to shed light on how our sample engages in recognition struggles. They do so by seeking to gain influence over conditions and simultaneously resisting structures that restrict subjective agency in the spheres of love, achievement and rights. We will use this combined macro- and micro-level theoretical framework to analyse subjective reasoning for expansive agency embedded in an institutional and political context that reflects the work pathology diagnosis and produces its own dilemmas that need further understanding. Combining critical theory, more specifically Axel Honneths work on recognition with critical psychology, allows us to move beyond deterministic holds and to improve our understanding of agentic potential in society.

We aimed to assess the prevalence, clinical profile and outcome of BSIs in critically ill Covid-19 disease. Material: and Methods: This was a single-centre retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Western India. All the patients (age >18 years) with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed Covid-19 pneumonia admitted in Covid intensive care unit (ICU) between September 2020 to February 2021 were included. Hospital electronic records were searched for demographic data, time of bloodstream infection since admission, clinical profile, antimicrobial resistance pattern and clinical outcome of all patients who developed BSIs. Results: : Out of 750 patients admitted in Covid ICU, 8.5% developed secondary BSIs. All severe Covid-19 pneumonia patients developed BSIs succumbed to illness. The major proportion of BSIs were gram-negative pathogens (53/64, 82.8%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the commonest isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.8% and 21.9% respectively). Multidrug-resistance microorganisms (MDRO) were found in 57.8% of the cases. The majority of MDRO belonged to K. pneumoniae and Enterococcus groups. The proportion of gram-negative bacteria resistant to carbapenems was 47.2% (25/53). Conclusion: BSIs in severe Covid-19 patients carries a substantial mortality, which is a cause for concern.

Our study assesses the feasibility of the Modified Angoff Method to reach expert consensus regarding difficulty of medical simulations. We compared scores with participant physiologic stress. METHODS Emergency medicine physicians with expertise in simulation education were asked to review 8 scenarios and estimate the percentage of resident physicians who would perform all critical actions using the modified Angoff method. A standard deviation (SD) of less than 10% of estimated percentage correct signified consensus. Twenty-five residents then performed the 6 scenarios that met consensus and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured. RESULTS During round 1, experts rated 4/8 scenarios within a 10% SD for postgraduate year 3 (PGY3) and 3/8 for PGY4 residents. In round 2, 6/8 simulation scenarios were within an SD of 10% points for both years. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.84 for PGY3 ratings and 0.89 for PGY4 ratings. A mixed effects analysis of variance showed no significant difference in HRV change from rest to simulation between teams or scenarios. Modified Angoff Score was not a predictor of HRV (multiple R = 0.0176). CONCLUSIONS Modified Angoff ratings demonstrated consensus in quantifying the estimated percentage of participants who would complete all critical actions for most scenarios. Although participant HRV did decrease during the scenarios, we were unable to significantly correlate this with ratings. This modified Angoff method is a feasible approach to evaluate simulation difficulty for educational and research purposes and may decrease the time and resources necessary for scenario piloting.","output":"A Novel Application of the Modified Angoff Method to Rate Case Difficulty in Simulation-Based Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The symptomatology of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus type 2 infection runs the entire gamut of mild to moderate and serious illness among the affected individuals.

METHODS Retrospective cohort study of patients presenting with chest pain, without ST-elevation myocardial infarction or myocardial injury by serum troponin testing, between 2013-2019 to 21 EDs within an integrated health care system. We examined the association between NIT referral (within 72-hours of the ED encounter) and a primary outcome of 60-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Secondary outcomes were 60-day MACE without coronary revascularization (MACE-CR) and 60-day all-cause mortality. To account for confounding by indication for NIT, we grouped patient encounters into ranked tertiles of NIT referral-intensity based on the likelihood of 72-hour NIT referral associated with the initially assigned emergency physician, relative to local peers and within discrete time periods. Associations between NIT referral-intensity tertile and outcomes were assessed using risk-adjusted multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Among 210,948 eligible patient encounters, 72-hour NIT referral frequency was 11.9%, 18.3% and 25.9% in low, intermediate and high NIT referral-intensity encounters, respectively. Compared with the low referral-intensity tertile, there was a higher risk of 60-day MACE within the high referral-intensity tertile (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.17) due to more coronary revascularizations without corresponding differences in MACE-CR or all-cause mortality. In analyses stratified by patients' estimated risk (HEART score; 50.5% lower-risk, 38.7% moderate-risk, 10.8% higher-risk), the difference in 60-day MACE was primarily attributable to moderate-risk encounters (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.24)), with no differences among either lower (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.31) or higher (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90-1.14) risk encounters. CONCLUSION Higher referral-intensity for 72-hour NIT was associated with higher risk of coronary revascularization but no difference in adverse events within 60 days.

Laboratory workup was notable for thrombocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase as commonly seen with COVID-19. Infectious screen resulted with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR by nasal swab, negative respiratory viral panel, negative HIV PCR, and negative fungal pneumonia screen. Imaging showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia (figure). He was started on a 5-day course of antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and given high suspicion for COVID-19 pneumonia was started on dexamethasone 6mg daily with a plan to repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing. Repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative on hospital day 2 and 4 but SARS-CoV-2 antibody was positive on hospital day 6 (10 days after symptom onset).

This work investigates the interaction-related effects of sitting positions of learners, visualization styles of peer-learners and teachers, and hand-raising behaviors of virtual peer-learners on learners in an immersive VR classroom, using eye tracking data. Our results indicate that learners sitting in the back of the virtual classroom may have difficulties extracting information. Additionally, we find indications that learners engage with lectures more efficiently if virtual avatars are visualized with realistic styles. Lastly, we find different eye movement behaviors towards different performance levels of virtual peer-learners, which should be investigated further.

This article reports a computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach for the screening of 118 compounds with 16 distinct heterocyclic moieties in comparison with 5 natural products and 7 repurposed drugs. Molecular docking analysis against M(pro) protein were performed finding isatin linked with a oxidiazoles (A2 and A4) derivatives to have the best docking scores of ?11.22 kcal/mol and ?11.15 kcal/mol respectively. Structure-activity relationship studies showed a good comparison with a known active M(pro) inhibitor and repurposed drug ebselen with an IC(50) value of ?0.67 M. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for 50 ns were performed for A2 and A4 supporting the stability of the two compounds within the binding pocket, largely at the S1, S2 and S4 domains with high binding energy suggesting their suitability as potential inhibitors of M(pro) for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Determination of potential inhibitors based on isatin derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (m(pro)): a molecular docking, molecular dynamics and structure-activity relationship studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The use of standard CO2 for insufflation during laparoscopic colorectal surgery may be associated with cooling and drying of the peritoneal cavity contributing to perioperative hypothermia. The aim was the assess the feasibility of a study comparing insufflation of warmed, humidified CO2 (WHCO2) (using HumiGard, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) with standard measures and its impact on the quality of recovery of surgical patients. METHODS Single-centre, triple-blind, feasibility, randomised controlled trial of adults scheduled for planned laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The primary outcome was recruitment. Secondary outcomes included feasibility of blinding, acceptability to patients, and suitability of objective measures: patient-reported quality of recovery using a validated questionnaire (QoR-40), patient pain scores, and semi-continuous core temperature measurements. RESULTS Thirty-nine participants were randomised to either WHCO2 group (n=19) or standard care alone (n=20). Recruitment to the study was successful and acceptable to patients. Blinding of the surgeons, patients, and assessors was effective. Response rates to QoR-40 were high, but ceiling effects were observed indicating the tool was unsuitable in this population. Less patients in the WHCO2 group reported post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) at days 1 (53%vs 65%) and 3 (37%vs 60%). Median hospital length of stay was 5.5 days in the standard care group and 4 days in the WHCO2 group. CONCLUSIONS A study of WHCO2 for insufflation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is highly acceptable to both patients and researchers. Potential reductions in PONV and hospital length of stay in patients treated with WHCO2 merits further investigation.

The environment, mutational history, and random processes can all impact the exact evolutionary paths, but to which extent these factors contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of a particular system is an open question. Especially in a virus like HIV-1, with a large mutation rate and large population sizes, evolution is expected to be highly predictable if the impact of environment and history is low, and evolution is not neutral. We investigated the effect of environment and mutational history by analyzing sequences from a long-term evolution experiment, in which HIV-1 was passaged on 2 different cell types in 8 independent evolutionary lines and 8 derived lines, 4 of which involved a switch of the environment. The experiments lasted for 240C300 passages, corresponding to approximately 400C600 generations or almost 3 years. The sequences show signs of extensive parallel evolutionthe majority of mutations that are shared between independent lines appear in both cell types, but we also find that both environment and mutational history significantly impact the evolutionary paths. We conclude that HIV-1 evolution is robust to small changes in the environment, similar to a transmission event in the absence of an immune response or drug pressure. We also find that the fitness landscape of HIV-1 is largely smooth, although we find some evidence for both positive and negative epistatic interactions between mutations.","output":"Long-term experimental evolution of HIV-1 reveals effects of environment and mutational history"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PARTICIPANTS: 274 nurses and midwives assigned to labour and delivery, operating room and newborn care units were recruited from 20 healthcare facilities in Nigeria and Kenya and randomised to one of three groups: VR (eHBB+digital guide), video (video+digital guide) or control (digital guide only) groups before an in-person HBB course. INTERVENTION(S): eHBB VR simulation or neonatal resuscitation video. MAIN OUTCOME(S): Healthcare worker neonatal resuscitation skills using standardised checklists in a simulated setting at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. RESULTS: Neonatal resuscitation skills pass rates were similar among the groups at 6-month follow-up for bag-and-mask ventilation (BMV) skills check (VR 28%, video 25%, control 22%, p=0.71), objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) A (VR 76%, video 76%, control 72%, p=0.78) and OSCE B (VR 62%, video 60%, control 49%, p=0.18). Relative to the immediate postcourse assessments, there was greater retention of BMV skills at 6 months in the VR group (?15% VR, p=0.10; ?21% video, p<0.01, C27% control, p=0.001). OSCE B pass rates in the VR group were numerically higher at 3 months (+4%, p=0.64) and 6 months (+3%, p=0.74) and lower in the video (?21% at 3 months, p<0.001; ?14% at 6 months, p=0.066) and control groups (?7% at 3 months, p=0.43; ?14% at 6 months, p=0.10).

However, controversy exists on the role of loco-regional anaesthesia and the outcomes associated with it. Here we review the challenges, outcomes and complications of loco-regional anaesthesia for URS. A Cochrane style review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines to evaluate the outcomes of loco-reginal anaesthesia for URS in stone disease, including all English language articles from January 1980 and December 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Twenty-one studies (1843 procedures) with a mean age of 46 years and a male : female ratio of 1.2 : 1 underwent URS under loco-regional anaesthesia. The mean stone size was 9 mm (range:4-21 mm) and except five papers, all other papers included stones in the ureter of which the majority were in the distal ureter. The conversion to general anaesthesia was needed in 2.7% patients (range 1-21%) across studies, with a stone free rate of 48-100%. The complication rate varied from 1.4 to 36%. Although the intraoperative complications included ureteric injury (n = 21) or perforation (n = 4), the postoperative complications included fever (n = 37), urinary tract infection (n = 20), haematuria (n = 4), urosepsis (n = 4) and others (n = 7). SUMMARY The present systematic review shows that local anaesthetic URS is a potential alternative to general anaesthetic URS in carefully selected patients. Randomised controlled trials with subgroup analysis are required to further assess whether loco-regional anaesthesia URS is noninferior to general anaesthesia URS and might help determine if the former approach should become more widespread.","output":"Outcomes of loco-regional anaesthesia in ureteroscopy for stone disease: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a framework to analyse the gendered impact of Covid\\\\19 on workers in global value chains using the business process outsourcing, garments and electronics industries.

The EPPM was used to examine the danger control and fear control responses, along with the separate effects of their sub-factors (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy) on personal hygiene behaviors, social distancing measures, and fatalism. In total, data from an online survey of 813 adults were analyzed. The results of multiple regression analysis showed a strong effect of self-efficacy on danger control (? = 0.23 for personal hygiene behaviors,  = 0.26 for social distancing) and fear control responses (? = -0.13 for fatalism). However, based on the type of control response, the effect of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity, which were the main factors in threat appraisal, was insignificant or marginally significant. Further, a higher perceived severity was associated with higher fatalism in the fear control response (? = 0.09). Those who were currently employed performed fewer social distancing measures compared to those who did not (? = -0.11), whereas there was no difference in personal hygiene behaviors.

Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission.

Here, we comprehensively characterized various parameters of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines under real-world conditions. Methods: Venous blood was collected from 126 adults, before and/or after inactivated COVID-19 vaccine inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) and S-receptor binding domain IgG in the serum were detected. The isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by three pools of lyophilized peptides covering the spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2 for evaluating antigen-specific T cell responses against the virus. Findings: The seroconversion rate for S-RBD IgG and NAb after two doses of vaccination was 87.06% (74/85) and 78.82% (67/85), respectively. Female participants developed higher concentrations of S-RBD IgG and NAb compared to male vaccinees. Interestingly, a longer dosing interval between the first and second vaccination resulted in a better long-term SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG response. The frequencies of CD4+ T cells that produce effector cytokines (IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-) in response to stimulation with peptide pools corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) or membrane (M) protein increased significantly after a single vaccination dose, and continued to increase after the second administration. S, N, or M-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses became detectable in 95.83% (69/72) and 54.16% (39/72) of double-vaccinated individuals, respectively. The longitudinal analysis demonstrated that CD4+ T cell responses recognizing S, N, and M waned quickly after a single vaccine dose, but were boosted and became more sustained following a second dose.

Participants assessed the taste of 0.3 M and 0.5 M sodium chloride solutions in two types of sensory evaluations: (1) a cup tasting test, in which they sipped the solution from cups, spat it out, and rated static salty taste intensity, and (2) a time-intensity sensory evaluation, in which the solutions were delivered to participants tongues through a custom-made delivery system while they recorded dynamic taste intensities on a hand-held meter. Older adults perceived significantly lower taste intensities than young adults (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001 for 0.3 M and 0.5 M, respectively). Reaction timings for both solutions did not differ, but the slopes for both concentrations were significantly lower for older adults than for young adults (p < 0.001). Using a standardized system allowed us to evaluate and directly compare real-time feedback on taste intensities according to age. This study is the first to characterize the time-intensity profiles of salty taste intensity in older adults. Our findings show that older adults do not take longer to recognize a salty taste, but their perception of taste intensity slowly increases, and yet remains lower than that of young adults. This suggests that older adults should be aware of the tendency to add more salt to their food to compensate for their low perceptions of salty taste. We would like to suggest them to savor and chew sufficiently during eating to optimize the perceived salty taste. Furthermore, our results offer a reference for ordinary citizens taste-intensity perceptions; our standardized system could be usefully integrated into clinical follow-up examinations and treatments.","output":"Differences in dynamic perception of salty taste intensity between young and older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) guide many fundamental cell behaviors. Native connective tissue consists of highly organized, 3D networks of ECM fibers with complex, nonlinear mechanical properties. The most abundant stromal matrix component is fibrillar type I collagen, which often possesses a wavy, crimped morphology that confers strain- and load-dependent nonlinear mechanical behavior. Here, we established a new and simple method for engineering electrospun fibrous matrices composed of dextran vinyl sulfone (DexVS) with controllable crimped structure. A hydrophilic peptide was functionalized to DexVS matrices to trigger swelling of individual hydrogel fibers, resulting in crimped microstructure due to the fixed anchorage of fibers. Mechanical characterization of these matrices under tension confirmed orthogonal control over nonlinear stress-strain responses and matrix stiffness. We next examined ECM mechanosensing of individual endothelial cells (ECs), finding that fiber crimp promoted physical matrix remodeling alongside decreases in cell spreading, focal adhesion area, and nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP). These changes corresponded to an increase in migration speed along with evidence for long-range interactions between neighboring cells in crimped matrices. Interestingly, when ECs were seeded at high density in crimped matrices, capillary-like networks rapidly assembled containing tube-like cellular structures wrapped around bundles of synthetic matrix fibers due to increased physical reorganization of matrix fibers. Our work provides an additional level of mechanical and architectural tunability to synthetic fibrous matrices and implicates a critical role for mechanical nonlinearity in EC mechanosensing and network formation.","output":"Fiber Crimp Confers Matrix Mechanical Nonlinearity, Regulates Endothelial Cell Mechanosensing, and Promotes Microvascular Network Formation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the backdrop for contemporary international relations, globalization reflects the way economic and political power are distributed, and provides the grand context for China's strategic planning.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of linear stapled reconstruction in terms of anastomotic-related complications for EJS in TLTG. METHODS We collected data on 829 consecutive gastric cancer patients who underwent TLTG reconstructed by the Roux-en-Y method with radical lymphadenectomy between January 2010 and December 2016 in 13 hospitals. The patients were divided into two groups according to reconstruction method and matched by propensity score. Postoperative EJS-related complications were compared between the linear stapler (LS) and the circular stapler (CS) groups. RESULTS After matching, data from 196 patients in each group were analyzed. The overall incidence of EJS-related complications was significantly lower in the LS group than in the CS group (4.1% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.008). The incidence of EJS anastomotic stenosis during the first year after surgery was significantly lower in the LS group than in the CS group (1.5% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.011). The incidence of EJS bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups, although no bleeding was observed in the LS group (0% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.123). The incidence of EJS leakage did not differ significantly between the groups (2.6% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.771). CONCLUSION The use of linear stapled reconstruction is safer than the use of circular stapled reconstruction for intracorporeal EJS in TLTG because of its lower risks of stenosis.","output":"Linear or circular stapler?

Retrieval of an embolized device may often be complicated by failure to introduce the right atrial (RA) disk hub into the sheath or difficulty in securely grasping the hub pin of RA disk. We aimed to evaluate the efficiency and success rate of device retrieval using a novel double snare technique. METHODS We reviewed retrieval procedures of embolized atrial septal defect (ASD) or left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder using double snare technique reported from five tertiary referral centers in Korea, Japan, and Uzbekistan. A total of 16 retrieval procedures in 15 patients were reported, including 14 patients who were planned for ASD device closure while 1 patient was planned for LA appendage occlusion. RESULTS Retrieved devices included 15 ASD occluders from six different manufacturers and one Amplantzer cardiac plug. Success rate of retrieval procedure was 100% using the double snare technique. There were no complications related to device retrieval. Most (15/16, 93.8%) of these devices could be retrieved through their original delivery sheaths. In six patients for whom retrieval was unsuccessful with conventional single snare technique and switched to double snare technique, the retrieval time was shortened significantly (P = 0.004*) by using the double snare technique.

This practice has a significant clinical utility as Ct values can be correlated with the viral load. In addition, Ct values have a strong correlation with multiple haematological and biochemical markers. However, it is essential to consider that Ct values might be affected by pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytical variables such as collection technique, specimen type, sampling time, viral kinetics, transport and storage conditions, nucleic acid extraction, viral RNA load, primer designing, real-time PCR efficiency, and Ct value determination method.

So far, there is limited clinical evidence on the effect of corticosteroid therapy for this disease. This study aims to investigate the association between corticosteroid therapy and the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance among patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with mild COVID-19 were enrolled from two medical centers in China between January 13, 2020 and February 29, 2020. Baseline characteristics and durations of RNA clearance were compared between the corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid therapy groups. The independent effects of corticosteroid therapy on the duration of RNA clearance were estimated by generalized linear models. RESULTS: Of 82 patients with a mild infection, 40 patients were male (48.8%), with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, IQR 36C61). Among those patients, 36 patients (43.9%) received corticosteroid therapy. The adjusted multivariate models showed that the effects of corticosteroids were non-significant on the durations of onset to first RNA clearance [ 2.48, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) ? 0.42 to 5.38, P = 0.0926] and to persistent RNA clearance ( 1.54, 95% CI ? 1.41 to 4.48, P = 0.3016), and durations of therapy to first RNA clearance ( 2.16, 95% CI ? 0.56 to 4.89, P = 0.1184) and to persistent RNA clearance ( 1.22, 95% CI ? 1.52 to 3.95, P = 0.3787). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy in patients with mild COVID-19 was not associated with the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, suggesting that the use of corticosteroids may not be beneficial for patients with mild COVID-19 and should be prudently recommended in clinical practice.

The Ethics Review Committee (ERC) is the key oversight mechanism designated to ensure ethics review. Whether or not this governance mechanism is still fit for purpose in the data-driven research context remains a debated issue among research ethics experts.

Second, we map these strengths and weaknesses onto specific challenges raised by big data research. We distinguish two categories of potential weakness. The first category concerns persistent weaknesses, i.e., those which are not specific to big data research, but may be exacerbated by it. The second category concerns novel weaknesses, i.e., those which are created by and inherent to big data projects. Within this second category, we further distinguish between purview weaknesses related to the ERCs scope (e.g., how big data projects may evade ERC review) and functional weaknesses, related to the ERCs way of operating. Based on this analysis, we propose reforms aimed at improving the oversight capacity of ERCs in the era of big data science.

This paper provides the first empirical work identifying major features of symptom screening in a broad population and exploring the trade\\\\offs employers face in using daily symptom screening. First, we find that common symptom checkers could screen out up to 7 percent of workers each day, depending on the measure used. Second, we find that the measures used will matter for three reasons: Many respondents report any given symptom, survey design affects responses, and demographic groups report symptoms at different rates, even absent fluctuations in likely COVID exposure.

Here, we tackle this problem through an agent-based model, in which agents move in a two-dimensional physical space and interact according to proximity criteria. The planar space comprises several locations, which represent bounded regions of the urban space. Based on empirical evidence, we consider locations of different density and place them in a core-periphery structure, with higher density in the central areas and lower density in the peripheral ones. Each agent is assigned to a base location, which represents where their home is. Through analytical tools and numerical techniques, we study the formation mechanism of the network of contacts, which is characterized by the emergence of heterogeneous interaction patterns. We put forward an extensive simulation campaign to analyze the onset and evolution of contagious diseases spreading in the urban environment. Interestingly, we find that, in the presence of a core-periphery structure, the diffusion of the disease is not affected by the time agents spend inside their base location before leaving it, but it is influenced by their motion outside their base location: a strong tendency to return to the base location favors the spreading of the disease. A simplified one-dimensional version of the model is examined to gain analytical insight into the spreading process and support our numerical findings. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, supporting the intuition that vaccination in central and dense areas should be prioritized.","output":"A multi-agent model to study epidemic spreading and vaccination strategies in an urban-like environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, Indonesia experienced a decline in the value of exports.

Cancer diagnosis in pandemic status (PANS) was evaluated by retrospective review of the findings of FDG-PET/CT examinations performed between 11 March 2020 and 28 December 2021 for initial staging and restaging for malignancy. Evaluation of cancer diagnosis in pre-pandemic status (pPANS) was conducted similarly in FDG-PET/CT examinations performed between 4 January 2018 and 10 March 2020. Of these, patients with malignant lymphoma (ML), lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and colorectal cancer who had a pathologically proven diagnosis or clinical diagnosis following therapy of the disease were selected for analysis. Initial cancer staging was determined by the diagnostic report of FDG-PET/CT. Change in cancer stage and in the number of FDG-PET/CT examinations performed was evaluated between pPANS and PANS, and according to term of the pandemic and vaccination status. The COVID-19 epidemic influenced the number of cancer patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT. There was a marked decrease in the number of cancer patients receiving FDG-PET/CT in Terms 1-3 (March 2020 to February 2021), but it recovered in Terms 4-6 (March 2021 to December 2021). There was no significant difference between PANS and pPANS in terms of the initial stage of cancer, but Stage IV ML and Stage II esophageal cancer were more frequent in PANS. Initial staging of ML, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer revealed more advanced cancer stages in Terms 4-6 compared with Terms 1-3.

The TCR repertoire and relative proportions of various T cell subsets are established in the thymus, and continue to be shaped and regulated in the periphery. As the thymic function declines, peripheral homeostatic mechanisms assume increasing importance. Indeed, loss of thymic function does not lead to progressive decline of T cell numbers because peripheral mechanisms ensure that the size of the T cell population is maintained due to proliferation of residual cells. However, our current understanding of the basic mechanisms of homeostatic or lymphopenia-induced proliferation suggests that this drive to maintain population size may be accompanied by loss of TCR diversity and emergence of auto-reactive effector T cells. This prediction is supported by experimental and clinical evidence. This consideration is important because lymphopenia is seen commonly in clinical practice as a consequence of viral infections, or medical treatment of cancer, autoimmunity, and graft rejection. Lymphopenia may be a simple link between viral infections and autoimmunity, and may be one reason for common failure of very potent, but non-specific, immunosuppressive drugs in current clinical use.","output":"A causal link between lymphopenia and autoimmunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite their significance, the only available vaccines against respiratory viruses are those for the prevention of influenza.

We provide an explanation for this income effect based on the stringency of government response to the pandemic and the unequal distribution of agency among social classes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper makes use of data from the Six-Country Survey on Covid-19 to establish the existence of an income effect on health utilisation, and from the Oxford Covid-19 Government response tracker to show that this income effect is associated with the stringency of governmental response to the pandemic. Data from the 2011/12 Health and Healthcare round of the International Social Survey Programme is used to show that this income effect cannot be explained by pre-existing patterns. An explanation for the link between government stringency and the income effect is advanced on a theoretical basis. Findings: The authors find in Britain, the US, and C with greater uncertainty C in Japan that individuals who experience potential Covid-19 symptoms are less likely to seek medical treatment if they have a lower income. The authors also show that governments in these countries adopted a less stringent response to the pandemic than the countries in our sample which do not exhibit an income effect C China, Italy and South Korea. The authors argue that laissez-faire policies place the burden of action upon the individual, activating underlying differences in agency between the social classes, and making (high) low-income individuals (more) less likely to seek medical attention. Research limitations/implications: Since there was not a direct measure of agency in the data, it could not be empirically verified that agency mediates the effect of government stringency on health utilisation. Further research could make use of datasets which incorporate such a measure, if they become available. It could also extend the geographical scope of the findings, to see if the income effect manifests in other countries which adopted a laissez-faire response to the pandemic. Practical implications: Governments should intervene more stringently during pandemics to minimise inequality in health outcomes. Originality/value: This paper establishes an association between the stringency of government response to the Covid-19 pandemic and income inequality in health utilisation. This contributes to scholarly and policy debates around health inequality in the area of social epidemiology, and the sociology of inequality more generally. It is also of relevance to the general public, in the context of a deadly pandemic.","output":"Hands-off?

One way to decarbonize the energy industry is by converting electrical energy into chemical energy via water electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen can then be stored, used in a fuel cell to generate electricity, or burnt cleanly with air to generate heat, steam, producing only water as a by-product. However, hydrogen has an extremely low density, even when compressed, which means that its energy density on a volumetric basis remains distinctly substandard to most liquid fuels, hydrogen also has a much wider range of concentrations over which it remains potentially explosive. Ammonia alternatively is ~ 18% hydrogen by weight, which means that in terms of hydrogen density, it is ~ 50% higher than compressed or liquefied hydrogen. One major advantage is that there is an existing infrastructure for the production, transport and distribution of ammonia worldwide. Although ammonia in theory can be combusted to produce only nitrogen and water as emissions, in practice, several challenges arise, nitrous oxides (NOx) are often generated, especially if the combustion happens at higher temperatures and/or under pressure, in vehicle engines, gas turbines and as rocket fuel. To overcome such challenges, further research into ammonia combustion phenomena is required.

Given primary care clinics are where people most often interact with health care providers, understanding factors associated with this hesitance may help providers in integrated primary care settings best address this hesitance. METHOD: Between September and November of 2020, a survey was sent to all primary care patients within a large southern California health system, with over 10,000 responding (22% response rate). Survey items included sociodemographic variables, level of vaccine hesitance, \\"proximity to COVID\\" (e.g., direct exposure to COVID-19 and consequences), as well as a patient's primary source of health information (e.g., traditional news, social media, etc.). Responses assessed the strength of hesitance. RESULTS: Results showed that while 78% of participants \\"strongly\\" believed vaccines generally are a good way to protect from illness, only 51% reported strong willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Consistent with previous surveys, younger patients were more hesitant to get vaccinated, as were people of color. Unique to this survey was the finding that those relying on social media, faith-based organizations, or family/friends for health information had the greatest vaccine hesitance.

As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies. Methods: Data from deceased cases reported across SSA through May 10, 2020 and from hospitalized cases in Burkina Faso through April 15, 2020 were analyzed. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information on deceased cases in SSA was derived through a line-list of publicly available information and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Center Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou. A synthetic case population was derived probabilistically using distributions of age, sex, and underlying conditions from populations of West African countries to assess individual risk factors and treatment effect sizes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses. Results: Across SSA, deceased cases for which demographic data are available have been predominantly male (63/103, 61.2%) and over 50 years of age (59/75, 78.7%). In Burkina Faso, specifically, the majority of deceased cases either did not seek care at all or were hospitalized for a single day (59.4%, 19/32); hypertension and diabetes were often reported as underlying conditions. After adjustment for sex, age, and underlying conditions in the synthetic case population, the odds of mortality for cases not receiving oxygen therapy was significantly higher than those receiving oxygen, such as due to disruptions to standard care (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.56-2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality than those who did not (95% CI: 0.24-0.93). Conclusion: Investment in sustainable production and maintenance of supplies for oxygen therapy, along with messaging around early and appropriate use for healthcare providers, caregivers, and patients could reduce COVID-19 deaths in SSA. Further investigation into convalescent plasma is warranted, as data on its effectiveness specifically in treating COVID-19 becomes available.

METHODS: Baseline NLR and MLR values were divided into two groups, high and low, according to cut-off-points determined from the ROC curve (2.2 for NLR and 0.22 for MLR). Coxs model was utilized for survival analyses. RESULTS: High NLR and MLR correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) among all the patients (p  0.030). Among the HER2+ patients whose adjuvant treatment did not include trastuzumab (n = 64), the survival rates were remarkably lower in patients with a high NLR as compared to those with low; 31% vs. 71% for OS and 42% vs. 74% for BCSS (p  0.014). Similarly, high MLR correlated with poor survival among these patients (p  0.020). On the contrary, among the patients who had received adjuvant trastuzumab (n = 43), NLR or MLR did not correlate with survival. Furthermore, trastuzumab was beneficial for the HER2+ patients with high NLR/MLR, while the survival of the HER2+ patients with low NLR/MLR was good irrespective if they received adjuvant trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that trastuzumab modulates the systemic inflammatory conditions and overcomes the poor prognostic impact of high NLR/MLR.

HAV has several unique biological characteristics that distinguish it from other members of this family. Recent and previous studies revealed that codon usage plays a key role in HAV replication and evolution. In this study, the patterns of synonymous codon usage in HAV have been studied through multivariate statistical methods on 30 complete open reading frames (ORFs) from the available 30 full-length HAV sequences. Effective number of codons (ENC) indicates that the overall extent of codon usage bias in HAV genomes is significant. The relative dinucleotide abundances suggest that codon usage in HAV can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies. These factors strongly correlated with the first major axis of correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU). The distribution of the HAV ORFs along the plane defined by the first two major axes in COA showed that different genotypes are located at different places in the plane, suggesting that HAV codon usage is also reflecting an evolutionary process. It has been very recently described that fine-tuning translation kinetics selection also contributes to codon usage bias of HAV. The results of these studies suggest that HAV genomic biases are the result of the co-evolution of genome composition, controlled translation kinetics and probably the ability to escape the antiviral cell responses.","output":"A detailed comparative analysis on the overall codon usage patterns in Hepatitis A virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the recent epidemics of yellow fever in Angola and Brazil as well as the importation of cases to China in 2016, there has been an increased interest in the century-old enigma, absence of yellow fever in Asia.

The HCWs who participated in the focus groups included physicians, nurses, medical practitioners, and cleaning staff who directly or indirectly cared for patients during the COVID-19 epidemic. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the consensual qualitative research approach. RESULTS: Our qualitative data analysis revealed four main domains: work-related struggles, personal life-related struggles, psychological stress, and health-related struggles. Health care providers were challenged by working in critical situations and were overwhelmed by heavy workloads, fear of infection, lifestyle changes, and psychological and physical struggles.

However, new devices such as video laryngoscopes should help in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of 4 intubation devices in pediatric manikin-simulated CPR. METHODS One hundred two paramedics participated in this study. None had prior experience in video laryngoscopy. After a standardized audiovisual lecture lasting 45 minutes, the paramedics participated in a practical demonstration using the advanced pediatric patient simulator PediaSIM CPR (FCAE HealthCare, Sarasota, FL), which was designed to be an accurate representation of a 6-year-old child. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed using LUCAS-2 (Physio-Contro, Redmond, WA). Afterward, paramedics were instructed to perform ETI using 4 intubation devices (MacGrathMAC, GlideScope, AirTraq, and Miller Laryngoscope Blade [Miller]) in a randomized sequence. The primary outcome was the success rate of tracheal intubation. The secondary outcome was the time to intubation. RESULTS The mean time to intubation was 30.7  15.3, 28.6  15.9, 24.1  5.0, and 39.3  14.7 seconds (McGrath, GlideScope, AirTraq, and Miller, respectively); and the success ratio of intubation for the devices was 100% vs 100% vs 100% vs 77.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Child ETI performed by paramedics during uninterrupted chest compression often has a low success rate. In contrast, McGrath, GlideScope, and AirTraq intubation devices are fast, safe, and easy to use. Within the limitations of a manikin study, this study suggests that inexperienced medical staff might benefit from using video laryngoscopy devices for child emergency airway management.","output":"Comparison of intubation through the McGrath MAC, GlideScope, AirTraq, and Miller Laryngoscope by paramedics during child CPR: a randomized crossover manikin trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media platforms may provide potential space for discourses that contain hate speech, and even worse, can act as a propagation mechanism for hate crimes.

SARS-CoV-2 can propagate through several direct or indirect means resulting in its exponential spread in short times. Consequently, finding new research based real-world and feasible solutions to interrupt the spread of pathogenic microorganisms is indispensable. It has been established that this virus can survive on a variety of available surfaces ranging from a few hours to a few days, which has increased the risk of COVID-19 spread to large populations. Currently, available surface disinfectant chemicals provide only a temporary solution and are not recommended to be used in the long run due to their toxicity and irritation. Apart from the urgent development of vaccine and antiviral drugs, there is also a need to design and develop surface disinfectant antiviral coatings for long-term applications even for new variants.

However, the research work for their use in antimicrobial surface coatings is minimal. This perspective enlightens the scope of using GBNs as antimicrobial/antiviral surface coatings to reduce the spread of transmittable microorganisms, precisely, SARS-CoV-2. This study attempts to demonstrate the synergistic effect of GBNs and metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), for their potential antiviral applications in the development of surface disinfectant coatings.

A quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) assay using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe was assessed by grape growers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Custom impaction spore samplers were placed at a research vineyard and six commercial vineyard locations, and were tested bi-weekly by the lab and by growers.

Here we investigated the ability of dihydrosphingosine to incorporate into the site of membrane fusion mediated by the HIV envelope (Env) protein. Dihydrosphingosine as well as cholesterol, fatty acid, and tocopherol was conjugated to highly conserved, short HIV-1 Env-derived peptides with no antiviral activity otherwise. We showed that dihydrosphingosine exclusively endowed nanomolar antiviral activity to the peptides (IC(50) as low as 120 nM) in HIV-1 infection on TZM-bl cells and on Jurkat T cells, as well as in the cell-cell fusion assay. These sphingopeptides were active against enfuvirtide-resistant and wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV strains. The anti-HIV activity was determined by both the peptides and their dihydrosphingosine conjugate.

Understanding how individual-level processes of sampling and reporting test results can affect community- or population-level spread is a dynamical modeling question. The effect of testing processes on epidemic dynamics depends on factors underlying implementation, particularly testing intensity and on whom testing is focused. Here, we use a simple model to explore how the individual-level effects of testing might directly impact population-level spread. Our model development was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, but has generic epidemiological and testing structures. To the classic SIR framework we have added a per capita testing intensity, and compartment-specific testing weights, which can be adjusted to reflect different testing emphases -- surveillance, diagnosis, or control. We derive an analytic expression for the relative reduction in the basic reproductive number due to testing, test-reporting and related isolation behaviours. Intensive testing and fast test reporting are expected to be beneficial at the community level because they can provide a rapid assessment of the situation, identify hot spots, and may enable rapid contact-tracing. Direct effects of fast testing at the individual level are less clear, and may depend on how individuals' behaviour is affected by testing information. Our simple model shows that under some circumstances both increased testing intensity and faster test reporting can reduce the effectiveness of control, and allows us to explore the conditions under which this occurs.

The anti-viral efficacy of these combinations in relation to Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a patient in Universitas Airlangga hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia and evaluated for IC(50) 24, 48, and 72 hours after viral inoculation was subsequently determined. Observation of the viral load in qRT-PCR was undertaken, the results of which indicated the absence of high levels of cytotoxicity in any samples and that dual combinatory drugs produced lower cytotoxicity than single drugs. In addition, these combinations demonstrated considerable effectiveness in reducing the copy number of the virus at 48 and 72 hours, while even at 24 hours, post-drug incubation resulted in low IC(50) values. Most combination drugs reduced pro-inflammatory markers, i.e. IL-6 and TNF-, while increasing the anti-inflammatory response of IL-10.

The Cape Town Declaration on Access to Cardiac Surgery in the Developing World was published in August 2018, signaling the commitment of the global cardiac surgery and cardiology communities to improving care for rheumatic heart disease patients. METHODS As the Cape Town Declaration formed the basis for which the Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance was formed, the purpose of this article is to describe the history of the Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance, its formation, ongoing activities, and future directions, including the announcement of selected pilot sites. RESULTS The Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance is an international alliance consisting of representatives from major cardiothoracic surgical societies and the World Heart Federation. Activities have included meetings at annual conferences, exhibit hall participation for advertisement and recruitment, and publication of selection criteria for cardiac surgery centers to apply for Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance support. Criteria focused on local operating capacity, local championing, governmental and facility support, appropriate identification of a specific gap in care and desire to engage in future research. Eleven applications were received for which three finalist sites were selected and site visits conducted. The two selected sites were Hospital Central Maputo (Mozambique) and King Faisal Hospital Kigali (Rwanda). CONCLUSIONS Substantial progress has been made since the passing of the Cape Town Declaration and the formation of the Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance, but ongoing efforts with collaboration of all committed parties-cardiac surgery, cardiology, industry, and government-will be necessary to improve access to life-saving cardiac surgery for rheumatic heart disease patients.","output":"United in earnest: First pilot sites for increased surgical capacity for rheumatic heart disease announced by Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with lasting symptoms of COVID-19 should be offered a comprehensive recovery programme. 30 individuals (mean[SD] age 58[16]) that completed a 6 week, twice supervised rehabilitation programme demonstrated statistically significant improvements in exercise capacity, respiratory symptoms, fatigue and cognition.

The main variables in increasing diagnostic capability are reduced cost, turnaround or diagnosis time, and upfront equipment cost and accessibility. Two candidates for machine learning COVID-19 diagnosis are Computed Tomography (CT) scans and plain chest X-rays. While CT scans score higher in sensitivity, they have a higher cost, maintenance requirement, and turnaround time as compared to plain chest X-rays. The use of portable chest X-radiograph (CXR) is recommended by the American College of Radiology (ACR) since using CT places a massive burden on radiology services. Therefore, X-ray imagery paired with machine learning techniques is proposed a first-line triage tool for COVID-19 diagnostics. In this paper we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to accurately classify chest X-ray scans of COVID-19 and normal subjects by fine-tuning several neural networks (ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet201) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. These neural networks are fused in a parallel architecture and the voting criteria are applied in the final classification decision between the candidate object classes where the output of each neural network is representing a single vote. Several experiments are conducted on the weakly labeled COVID-19-CT-CXR dataset consisting of 263 COVID-19 CXR images extracted from PubMed Central Open Access subsets combined with 25 normal classification CXR images. These experiments show an optimistic result and a capability of the proposed model to outperforming many state-of-the-art algorithms on several measures. Using k-fold cross-validation and a bagging classifier ensemble, we achieve an accuracy of 99.7% and a sensitivity of 100%.","output":"Fused Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Precision Diagnosis of COVID-19 Using Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social pediatric initiatives aim to improve health outcomes for vulnerable children by working in the community to empower families, to enhance protective factors that mitigate adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and to deliver place-based health care.

Yet, replication often is not employed on larger scales, as na?vely mirroring a computation once effectively halves the machine size, and as keeping replicated simulations consistent with each other is not trivial. We demonstrate for the ExaHyPE enginea task-based solver for hyperbolic equation systemsthat it is possible to realise resiliency without major code changes on the user side, while we introduce a novel algorithmic idea where replication reduces the time-to-solution. The redundant CPU cycles are not burned for nothing. Our work employs a weakly consistent data model where replicas run independently yet inform each other through heartbeat messages whether they are still up and running. Our key performance idea is to let the tasks of the replicated simulations share some of their outcomes, while we shuffle the actual task execution order per replica. This way, replicated ranks can skip some local computations and automatically start to synchronise with each other. Our experiments with a production-level seismic wave-equation solver provide evidence that this novel concept has the potential to make replication affordable for large-scale simulations in high-performance computing.","output":"TeaMPIReplication-Based Resilience Without the (Performance) Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We surveyed 56 Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in the United States and identified costs incurred since 2014 ($1.76 million/ETC) and sustainability strategies.

However, with the lack of on-ground automated prevention measures, depending on humans to enforce face mask-wearing policies in universities and other organizational buildings, is a very costly and time-consuming measure. Without addressing this challenge, mitigating highly airborne transmittable diseases will be impractical, and the time to react will continue to increase. Considering the high personnel traffic in buildings and the effectiveness of countermeasures, that is, detecting and offering unmasked personnel with surgical masks, our aim in this paper is to develop automated detection of unmasked personnel in public spaces in order to respond by providing a surgical mask to them to promptly remedy the situation. Our approach consists of three key components. The first component utilizes a deep learning architecture that integrates deep residual learning (ResNet-50) with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to detect the existence of human subjects in the videos (or video feed). The second component utilizes Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Networks (MT-CNN) to detect and extract human faces from these videos. For the third component, we construct and train a convolutional neural network classifier to detect masked and unmasked human subjects. Our techniques were implemented in a mobile robot, Thor, and evaluated using a dataset of videos collected by the robot from public spaces of an educational institute in the U.S. Our evaluation results show that Thor is very accurate achieving an F_{1} score of 87.7% with a recall of 99.2% in a variety of situations, a reasonable accuracy given the challenging dataset and the problem domain. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Thor: A deep learning approach for face mask detection to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biological function of bovine colostral immunoglobulins is to provide the newborn calf with adequate passive immune protection against microbial infections.

The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by 3.3 million or 22 percent over the crucial two-month window from February to April 2020. The drop in active business owners was the largest on record, and losses to business activity were felt across nearly all industries. African-American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a 41 percent drop in business activity. Latinx business owner activity fell by 32 percent, and Asian business owner activity dropped by 26 percent. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of business activity losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses in business activity of 36 percent. Female business owners were also disproportionately affected (25 percent drop in business activity). Continuing the analysis in May and June, the number of active business owners remained low C down by 15 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The continued losses in May and June, and partial rebounds from April were felt across all demographic groups and most industries.

A cohort with a first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021 was used for comparison. Main outcome measuresOutcomes included Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), Bells palsy, encephalomyelitis, and transverse myelitis. Incidence rates were estimated in the 28 days post first-dose vaccine, 90 days post-COVID-19, and between 2017 to 2019 for the general population cohort for background rates. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated from the SCCS when sufficient statistical power was reached. ResultsWe included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees; 299,311 people infected with COVID-19; and 2,290,537 from the general population. SIRs for GBS were 1.91 [95% CI: 0.86 to 4.26] after ChAdOx1, 1.29 [0.49 to 3.45] after BNT162b2, and 5.20 [1.95 to 13.85] after COVID-19.

Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1a woman in her 60sreturned from China in mid-January, 2020.

We compared human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) incidence and residual risk before and after this policy change using data from >50% of the US blood supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Three estimation intervals from the Transfusion-Transmissible Infections Monitoring System were compared: 15-months pre- and two consecutive, nonoverlapping 15-month post-MSM deferral implementation. Repeat, first-time, and weighted all-donor incidences were estimated. Residual risk was calculated for all incidence estimates using the incidence/window-period method. RESULTS HIV repeat donor incidence was 1.57 per 100 000 person-years (phtpy) in the second 15-month post change and not significantly different from pre-MSM incidence of 2.19 phtpy. Similar values were seen for HCV (1.49 phtpy vs 1.46 phtpy) and HBV (1.14 phtpy vs 0.97 phtpy). In some cases, higher estimated incidence, but without significant change from pre-MSM to the second post change period occurred for males and first-time donors (eg, first-time donors, second post change period: 6.12 phtpy HIV, 6.41 phtpy HCV and 5.34 phtpy HBV). Estimated per donation residual risk was 1:1.6 million for HIV, 1:2.0 million for HCV and 1:1.0 million for HBV based on weighted incidence for all donors. CONCLUSIONS Repeat, first-time, and overall donor incidence did not vary significantly comparing pre-MSM to either of the post-MSM estimation intervals.

More arts and cultural engagement was associated with fewer reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors, better self-control scores, and fewer positive perceptions of reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors concurrently and one to two years later. Arts and cultural engagement may provide opportunities for adolescents to realize positive developmental outcomes, reducing their risk of reportedly antisocial or criminalized behaviors.","output":"Arts and Cultural Engagement, Reportedly Antisocial or Criminalized Behaviors, and Potential Mediators in Two Longitudinal Cohorts of Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Revisional bariatric surgery following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) failure presents a clinical challenge for the bariatric surgeon. Limited evidence exists in selecting the appropriate revisional operation: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB), laparoscopic re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG), or other surgical intervention (OSI), to address weight regain. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the efficacy of existing revisional surgery. A comprehensive search of electronic databases (e.g., Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) was completed. All randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparison study, and case series were included. Eleven primary studies (218 patients) were identified and included in the systematic review. Studies were grouped into three main categories: LGB, LRSG, and OSI. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 41.9 kg/m(2) (LGB), 38.5 kg/m(2) (LRSG), and 44.4 kg/m(2) (OSI). After conversion to LGB, BMI decreased to 33.7 and 35.7 kg/m(2) at 12 and 24 months of follow-up, respectively. Excess weight loss (EWL) was 60 and 48 % over the same periods. After LRSG, BMI decreased to 30.4 and 35.3 kg/m(2) with corresponding EWL of 68 and 44 %, at 12 and 24 months, respectively. After OSI, BMI decreased to 27.3 kg/m(2) with an EWL of 75 % at 24-month follow-up but could not be analyzed due to incomplete data collection in primary studies. Both LGB and LRSG achieve effective weight loss following failed LSG. The less technically challenging nature of LRSG may be more widely applicable.

Such strategies are characterized as the handoff or transfer of an individual between two service providers through a face-to-face, phone, or technology-assisted interaction. This approach may be useful for maternal and child health home visitors who provide direct services and facilitate connections to community resources for client families. However, little is known about the effectiveness of warm handoffs. METHODS A systematic review of the literature on warm handoffs was conducted with studies identified in four databases. Full text was reviewed for studies for which abstracts met inclusion criteria or for which abstracts were not available. Evidence tables summarizing study characteristics, outcome measures and data sources, intervention descriptions, intervention components, and study results were constructed. RESULTS Of the 42,816 unique articles identified, 32,163 titles/abstracts were screened, 227 qualified for full text review, and five comprised the study sample. Three studies examined referrals from substance use treatment centers to self-help groups, one from federally qualified health centers to community mental health clinics, and one from a mobile needle exchange program to substance use treatment/intake. Three studies showed increases in receipt of services by clients following referral between the warm handoff intervention and control group.

An examination of the effectiveness of warm handoffs in the context of home visits is needed to assess whether they facilitate client referrals.","output":"Warm Handoffs for Improving Client Receipt of Services: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. To conduct a living systematic review of the clinical evidence regarding the effect of different mouth''rinses on the viral load of SARS''CoV''2 in the saliva of infected patients. The viral load in aerosols, the duration of the reduction in viral load, viral clearance, SARS''CoV''2 cellular infectivity, and salivary cytokine profiles were also evaluated. Materials and methods. This study was reported using the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search was conducted in seven databases and in preprint repositories. We included human clinical trials that evaluated the effect of mouth''rinses with antiseptic substances on the viral load of SARS''CoV''2 in the saliva of children or adults that tested positive for SARS''CoV''2 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT''PCR). Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021240561. Results. Four studies matching eligibility criteria were selected for evaluation (n=32 participants). Study participants underwent oral rinses with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 1 %, povidone''iodine (PI) at 0.5% or 1%, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) at 0.2% or 0.12% or cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) at 0.075%.

In the current study, a multi-modality approach has been attempted to capture the different aspects of sleep disturbances, including insomnia (using ISI), daytime sleepiness (using ESS), sleep quality (using PSQI), sleep architecture, and SDB (using PSG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eligible ARDS survivor patients were updated about the study's design prior to hospital discharge. At admission, data regarding demographic details, clinical history, etiology of ARDS, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio at presentation, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores was collected. All enrolled patients were evaluated twice (early-within 7 days of admission and late-after 6 weeks of discharge) by the RichardsCCampbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ), Insomnia severity index (ISI), and level 1 PSG. Additionally, ESS questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were also recorded in late evaluation. Abnormal sleep was defined if one or more of the following characteristics met: ISI > 15, ESS > 10, global PSQI > 5, AHI  5 events/h. RESULTS: Thirty patients were recruited out of the total of 88 ARDS patients screened at admission. The median (IQR) PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and APACHE II scores were 176 (151C191.5) and 14 (14C16), respectively. The median (IQR) duration of stay in the ICU was 10 (7.3C19.5) days. The median RCSQ score in the early and late evaluation was 42 and 69, respectively. The mean ISI score in the early evaluation was 16.67  4.72, which decreased to 11.70  5.03 in late evaluation (p < 0.05). ISI score > 15 (clinical insomnia) was found in 18 out of 30 subjects (60%) in early evaluation and 11 out of 30 (36%) in late evaluation. During the early evaluation, sleep efficiency was low (median 59.9% and predominantly N1 and N2) which improved in late evaluation (median 80.6%). Of the 30 patients, only 4 had AHI > 5 in early evaluation and none in late evaluation. Neither of P/F ratio, SOFA, and APACHE II scores did correlate with ICU events in the early and late evaluations. Regression analysis showed subjects with ICU stay more than 10 days, duration of IMV more than 7 days, Fentanyl more than 7 mg, duration of sedative use more than 7 days was independently associated with poor objective sleep quality (low sleep efficiency, low TST and high arousal index) during the early and late evaluations after ICU discharge compared to counterparts (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that sleep quality in ARDS survivors was poor within 7 days of ICU discharge, characterized by severe disruption of sleep architecture and sleep-disordered breathing. After 6 weeks of ICU discharge sleep quality showed significant improvement in the N3 stage and AHI, however persistent insomnia was observed even at 6 weeks.

The benefits of measuring PCT in the Emergency Department (ED) are not yet fully characterised. 2. PCT is widely used in the intensive care setting to guide antimicrobial prescribing. WHAT THIS ADDS? Measurement of PCT as a routine in the emergency department for all patients treated for possible sepsis identifies a high-risk cohort. KEY IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT CARE: 1. A PCT measurement of >0.2ug/L in the Emergency Department identifies a patient at increased risk of deterioration and of in-hospital death. BACKGROUND: Early recognition and management of sepsis in the Emergency Department (ED) is a clinical challenge. Our aim was to determine if measuring the biomarker PCT in patients with suspected sepsis enables the identification of patients at increased risk of deterioration or in-hospital death in the ED setting of a district general hospital in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on all patients aged 18 and over presenting to ED fulfilling NICE criteria for moderate to high risk of sepsis admitted to hospital. Patients had a PCT test alongside the sepsis six protocol. PCT was measured using Brahmss chemiluminescent micro particle assay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of PCT in human serum and plasma on the Abbott Alinity I analytical platform. The cost per test was approximately 13 GBP. The analysis was performed on patients having a PCT in ED over a 7-month period, with in-depth scrutiny of an appropriate subgroup. A high level quality improvement (QI) approach was used in the study. RESULTS: A total of 1242 patients were included in the study. Mean/median age was 67.9/72, (range 18-102). 88.7% of deaths occurred in patients over 65 years of age. 42.4% (n=532) had a PCT level in ED of >0.2 ug/L. This identified a high risk group with a 2.4 fold increase in mortality rate (7.7%:18.2% p value <0.001). The median length of stay (LOS) was 5 (IQR 9) and 8 days (IQR 11) in patients with a first PCT of 0.2 ug/L versus >0.2 ug/L respectively.

It also abruptly curtailed in-person large gatherings, including academic conferences. Although many marketing scholarly professional organizations suffered a negative financial impact, the quick transition to offer completely online live events allowed many marketing educators to attend a virtual conference for the first time. After having experienced the benefits of virtual attendance, will marketing educators return to in-person attendance when it is deemed safe to do so? Marketing educators can earn credit for serving in scholarly professional organization leadership roles and for organizing and participating in academic conferences offered by those organizations. Thus, there is a vested interest in having profitable events to support the organizations. This study seeks to answer the question, what motivates marketing educators to attend in-person and virtual academic conferences? Grounded in self-determination theory, relatedness and competence are examined as marketing educator motivations. Regression analysis of the survey results suggests marketing educators have a relatedness motivation to participate in-person. They also have a competence motivation to participate virtually.

In this study we show that LNP-RNA nanostructure modulates the energetic cost of LNP fusion with a target membrane. The inclusion of a new class of structurally-active lipids leads to superior LNP endosomal fusion, fast evasion of endosomal entrapment, and efficacious RNA delivery.

Telehealth is increasingly being used to support symptom management. The overall aim was to determine the effectiveness of nurse-led telehealth symptom management interventions for patients with cancer receiving systemic or radiation therapy compared to usual care on health service use, quality of life, and symptom severity. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA reporting guidelines. Five electronic databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data. Meta-analysis was performed if data were clinically and methodologically homogeneous. Subanalysis was conducted on reactive and scheduled telehealth interventions. RESULTS: Of 7749 citations screened, 10 studies were included (8 randomized control trials, 2 quasi-experimental). Five were reactive telehealth interventions with patient-initiated contact and five evaluated scheduled telehealth interventions initiated by nurses. Compared to usual care (typically patient-initiated calls), nurse-led telehealth interventions for symptom management showed no statistically significant difference in hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or unscheduled clinic visits. Two of three studies of reactive telehealth interventions showed improved quality of life. All telehealth interventions showed reduction in the severity of most symptoms. Pain severity was significantly reduced (standard mean difference ? 0.54; 95% CI ? 0.88, ? 0.19). Significant heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis for most outcomes. CONCLUSION: Few studies evaluated nurse-led telehealth interventions for cancer symptom management. Compared to usual care, patients exposed to telehealth interventions had reduced symptom severity and no difference in health services use.

Method Participants were all individuals who had completed a psychological evaluation with the principal author in either a community health care clinic or a nearby independent assessment practice. Testing had to have taken place a minimum to one year prior and participant's had to be within the age range to repeat the same test that was previously administered. Thus far, there are 16 total participants. Results Paired samples t-tests indicated that there were no significant differences between the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI), and Working Memory Index (WMI) on the WISC-V for those administered in person and through telehealth VCI (t(4) = 2.08, p = 0.106) FRI (t(4) = ?0.86, p = 0.439);and WMI (t(3) = ?0.104, p = 0.924).

Pre-clinical or clinical trials of favipiravir require robust, sensitive, and accurate bioanalytical methods for quantitation of favipiravir levels. Recently, several studies have been reported about developing a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for measuring favipiravir levels. However, these methods were validated predominantly for plasma samples, electrospray ionization was operated only in negative or positive mode, and clinical application of these methods has not been applied for patients with COVID-19.

Simple protein precipitation was used for the extraction of favipiravir from the desired matrix. Favipiravir levels were quantitated using MS / MS with an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.

Here we describe the different methods used, and we present a large series of 729 cases of laparoscopic appendectomy. In the majority of the cases the diagnosis was acute appendicitis followed by laparoscopic appendectomy. In only 124 cases was an incidental appendectomy performed associated with another laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS In 350 cases (48%) monopolar cauterization was used to obtain vascular control of the appendicular artery. In the other 379 cases the artery was either clipped or stapled (52%). There were no postoperative complications reported. There was no difference in patient outcome with either approach to obtain adequate vascular control.

Here, we predict the mutability of all positions in SARS-CoV-2 protein domains to forecast the appearance of unseen variants. Using sequence data from other coronaviruses, pre-existing to SARS-CoV-2, we build statistical models that do not only capture amino-acid conservation but more complex patterns resulting from epistasis. We show that these models are notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the already observable SARS-CoV-2 variability. In the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, we observe that the predicted mutability correlates well with experimental measures of protein stability and that both are reliable mutability predictors (ROC AUC ~0.8). Most interestingly, we observe an increasing agreement between our model and the observed variability as more data become available over time, proving the anticipatory capacity of our model. When combined with data concerning the immune response, our approach identifies positions where current variants of concern are highly overrepresented. These results could assist studies on viral evolution, future viral outbreaks and, in particular, guide the exploration and anticipation of potentially harmful future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Significance statementDuring the COVID pandemic, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and spread, some being of major concern due to their increased infectivity or their capacity to reduce vaccine efficiency. Anticipating new mutations, which might give rise to new variants, would be of great interest. Here we construct sequence models predicting how mutable SARS-CoV-2 positions are, using a single SARS-CoV-2 sequence and databases of other coronaviruses. Predictions are tested against available mutagenesis data and the observed variability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Interestingly, our predictions agree increasingly with observations, as more SARS-CoV-2 sequences become available. Combining predictions with immunological data, we find a clear overrepresentation of mutations in current variants of concern. The approach may become relevant for potential outbreaks of future viral diseases.","output":"Epistatic models predict mutable sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Timely identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality can significantly improve patient management and resource allocation within hospitals.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation ( 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein ( 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen ( 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine ( 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87C0.94) on the derivation cohort.

Common routine tests such as complete blood count (CBC), glucose, electrolytes, liver and kidney function parameters and markers of inflammation, thrombosis and endothelial dysfunction including complement component split product C5a, Interleukin-6, ferritin and C-reactive protein were measured at the time COVID-19 infection was confirmed. Correlation tests suggest that C5a is a predictive marker of disease severity and mortality, in addition to 40 biological and physiological parameters that were found statistically significant between survivors and non-survivors. Survival analysis showed that high C5a levels, hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, elevated procalcitonin, neutrophilic leukocytosis, acute anemia along with increased acute kidney and hepatocellular injury markers were associated with a higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Altogether, we created a prognostic classification model, the CAL model (C5a, Albumin, and Lymphocyte count) to predict severity with significant accuracy. Stratification of patients using the CAL model could help in the identification of patients likely to develop severe symptoms in advance so that treatments can be targeted accordingly.","output":"Complement C5a and Clinical Markers as Predictors of COVID-19 Disease Severity and Mortality in a Multi-Ethnic Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Self-compassion is recognized to have a positive effect upon a person's health. However, the influence of self-compassion on the health of midwives and nurses is less well understood. Midwives and nurses often work in highly demanding environments and situations, and are exposed to multiple work-based stressors simultaneously. Stressors such as a demanding clinical workload, high acuity, missing breaks, working more than their contracted hours, insufficient resources and staff, and poor patient outcomes can lead to midwives and nurses feeling physically exhausted and at increased risk of poor mental health. Self-compassion may act as a protective factor, assisting midwives and nurses to remain healthy. OBJECTIVE This scoping review will provide an overview of the evidence base relating to the influence of self-compassion on the health of midwives and nurses. METHODS The purpose of a scoping review is to comprehensively and systematically review the literature and identify key evidence or gaps. The search strategy for this protocol includes electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, Emcare, PsycInfo, Joanna Briggs Institute, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Grey literature sources will be also searched, including ProQuest Central, internet search engines (Google Scholar), and manually searched key journals and reference lists of relevant articles. This scoping review will be undertaken in seven stages, guided by established scoping review methods and reporting guidelines: (1) identifying the research questions; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting the studies; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; (6) consulting; and (7) dissemination of knowledge. Data will be abstracted and presented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and explanation by three independent researchers. RESULTS A preliminary search conducted in Medline (OVID) retrieved 194 results. Completion of the review is expected in December 2020 and will be published in early 2021. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review of evidence-based literature relating to the influence of self-compassion on the health of midwives and nurses. It is anticipated that this analysis of the literature will contribute to understanding how midwives and nurses may use self-compassion in a proactive way to reduce work-based stressors such as burnout, stress, and compassion fatigue. Furthermore, the findings may inform educational needs with implications for clinical practice.

The proportion of case and control pigs positive for each virus was determined and statistically compared for determining the strength of the association that each virus had with PMWS individually or in combinations. Porcine circovirus type 2 had the strongest association (OR = 9.3, P = 0.006) with PMWS among the viruses tested for. Risk for PWMS was much higher (OR = 31.2, P = 0.0009) if the animal was concurrently infected with PCV2 and PRRSV, suggesting that development of PMWS may be enhanced by cofactor(s). Because PCV2 was also found in 62.5% of the controls, PCV2 from 5 cases and 4 controls were selected and genetically compared.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the dissemination of the Miyara et al study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes toward smoking occurred after its publication as preprint on April 21, 2020. METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14 and May 4, 2020, by the Tweepy stream application programming interface, using a COVID-19Crelated keyword query. After filtering, the final 1929 tweets were classified into three groups: (1) tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study before it was published, (2) tweets that were not related to Miyara et al study after it was published, and (3) tweets that were related to Miyara et al study after it was published. The attitudes toward smoking, as expressed in the tweets, were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in the statistical analysis software R (The R Foundation). RESULTS: Temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed that the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to the Miyara et al study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than the proportion in tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study, either before (44/126, 34.9%; P<.001) or after the Miyara et al study was published (68/198, 34.3%; P<.001).

The concept of mobilities of care provides a powerful framework to study the impacts of lockdown policy but would benefit from further theoretical development. In this paper we use a mixed-methods approach to study the impact of lockdown measures in a group of 40 low-income women living in peri-urban areas of Itag, a municipality in the south of the Medelln metropolitan area, Colombia. Based on existing feminist literature, we make three main contributions to the conceptualisation of mobilities of care beyond drawing attention to immobilities of care. First, we argue that by focusing on trip motivations rather than purpose, the concept of mobilities of care goes beyond a taxonomical change of trip categories. Second, we propose a focus that extends beyond immediate family members and includes care activities focused on the local community. Finally, we suggest that mobilities of care could benefit if activities of self-care are included.","output":"Im/Mobilities of Care During the Covid-19 Lockdown in Itagui, Colombia (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE(S): Many patients die due to vascular, gastrointestinal lumen problems, and coronary heart diseases. Synthetic vessels that are made of biodegradable-nanofiber polymers have significant properties such as proper biodegradability and efficient physical properties such as high strength and flexibility. Some of the best options for supporting cells in soft tissue engineering and design are applications of thermoplastic polyurethane polymer in the venous tissue. In this study, the first nanoparticle-reinforced polymeric artificial prosthesis was designed and tested to be used in the human body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, artificial gastrointestinal lumen were fabricated and prepared using a 3D printer. To improve cell adhesion, wettability properties and mechanical stability of elastin biopolymer with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as well as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were prepared as separate filaments. MNPs were made in 5C7 mm sizes and then examined for mechanical, biological, and hyperthermia properties. Then, the obtained results of the gastrointestinal lumen were simulated using the Abaqus software package with a three-branch. The results were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology and phase analysis. RESULTS: The obtained results of the designed vessels showed remarkable improvement in mechanical properties of the SWCNT vessels and hyperthermia properties of the vessels containing the MNPs. The results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis showed that the artificial vessels had lower shear stress at the output. CONCLUSION: Five-mm MNP containing vessels showed noticeable chemical and biological properties along with ideal magnetic results in the treatment of thrombosis and vascular obstruction.","output":"Therapy with new generation of biodegradable and bioconjugate 3D printed artificial gastrointestinal lumen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: No study has so far compared Amulet with the new Watchman FLX in terms of residual left atrial appendage (LAA) patency or clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous LAA closure (LAAC). Methods: In the investigator-initiated SWISS APERO trial, patients undergoing LAAC were randomized (1:1) open-label to receive Amulet or Watchman 2.5 or FLX (Watchman) across 8 European centres. The primary endpoint was the composite of justified crossover to a non-randomized device during LAAC procedure or residual LAA patency detected by cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at 45 days. The secondary endpoints included procedural complications, device related thrombus (DRT), peridevice leak (PDL) at transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and clinical outcomes at 45 days. Results: Between June 2018, and May 2021, 221 patients were randomly assigned to Amulet (111 [50.2%]) or Watchman (110 [49.8%]), of whom 25 (22.7%) patients included before October 2019 received Watchman 2.5, and 85 (77.3%) patients received Watchman FLX. The primary endpoint was assessable in 205 (92.8%) patients and occurred in 71 (67.6%) Amulet and 70 (70.0%) Watchman patients respectively (risk ratio [RR] 0.97 [95% CI 0.80- 1.16]; P=0.713). A single justified cross-over occurred in an Amulet patient who fulfilled LAA patency criteria at 45-day CCTA. Major procedure related complications occurred more frequently in the Amulet group (9.0% vs. 2.7%; P=0.047), owing to more frequent bleeding (7.2% vs.1.8%). At 45 days, the PDL rate at TEE was higher with Watchman than Amulet (27.5% vs. 13.7%, p=0.020), albeit none was major (i.e. > 5 mm), whereas DRT was detected in 1 (0.9%) patient with Amulet and 3 (3.0%) patients with Watchman at CCTA and in 2 (2.1%) and 5 (5.5%) patients at TEE, respectively. Clinical outcomes at 45 days did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: Amulet was not associated with lower rate of the composite of crossover or residual LAA patency compared with Watchman at 45-day CCTA. Amulet, was however associated with lower PDL rates at TEE, higher procedural complications and similar clinical outcomes at 45 days compared with Watchman.

Recombination signal-binding protein J (RBP-J)-mediated Notch signaling regulates macrophage development and phenotype. Here, using bleomycin-induced fibrosis model combined with myeloid-specific RBP-J disruption (RBP-JcKO ) mouse, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in macrophages during PF. Compared with the control, RBP-JcKO mice exhibited alleviated lung fibrosis as manifested by reduced collagen deposition and inflammation, and decreased TGF- production. FACS analysis suggested that decreased Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs might make the major contribution to attenuated fibrogenesis in RBP-JcKO mice, probably by reduced inflammatory factor release and enhanced matrix metalloproteinases expression. Using clodronate-mediated macrophage depletion in RBP-JckO mice, we demonstrated that embryonic-derived AMs play negligible role in lung fibrosis, which was further supported by adoptive transfer experiments. Moreover, on CCR2 knockout background, the effect of RBP-J deficiency on fibrogenesis was not elicited, suggesting that Notch regulated monocyte-derived AMs. Co-culture experiment showed that monocyte-derived AMs from RBP-JcKO mice exhibit reduced myofibroblast activation due to decreased TGF- secretion.

The authors contrast Ardern's communications with those of Donald Trump, the President of the United States (US), as evidence that leaders do not necessarily follow these strategies. Findings The findings show that clear, consistent and credible communications, backed up by open access to the numerical data that underlie the decisions, ensure that these decisions are seen as legitimate, ensure that citizens/stakeholders feel leaders are accountable and believe in the necessity of measures taken and that they conform to the guidelines and rules. By contrast, the strategy of attempting to withhold information, blaming others, refusing to acknowledge that there are problems and refusing to address problems lead to non-conformance by citizens/stakeholders. Business leaders could apply these lessons to the management of crises in their organizations to ensure buy-in from employees and other stakeholders.

The purpose of this study was to measure the sensitivity and specificity of touch preparation of nasal debridement specimens as a rapid diagnostic tool for invasive fungal sinusitis. A retrospective chart review was performed of 22 patients undergoing nasal debridement due to suspicion for invasive fungal sinusitis over a 10-year period. Thirteen patients had touch preparation of nasal specimens followed by routine histologic processing; two of these patients underwent 2, and 1 patient had 3 separate debridements, for a total of 17 touch preparations performed. The sensitivity and specificity of touch preparation were calculated by correlating the initial results with the presence of fungal invasion on final pathologic analysis. The sensitivity of touch preparation was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23-0.85), specificity was 100% (95% CI: 0.60-1.00), positive predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 0.46-1.00), and negative predictive value was 67% (95% CI: 0.35-0.89).

Therefore, it is very important to understand patients' degree of infection and infection history through antibody testing. Such information is useful also for the government and hospitals to formulate reasonable prevention policies and treatment plans. In this paper, we develop a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) method based on superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SMNPs) and a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensing system for the simultaneously quantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). A simple and time-effective co-precipitation method was utilized to prepare the SMNPs, which have good dispersibility and magnetic property, with an average diameter of 68 nm. The Internet of Medical Things-supported GMR could transmit medical data to a smartphone through the Bluetooth protocol, making patient information available for medical staff. The proposed GMR system, based on SMNP-supported LFIA, has an outstanding advantage in cost-effectiveness and time-efficiency, and is easy to operate. We believe that the suggested GMR based LFIA system will be very useful for medical staff to analyze and to preserve as a record of infection in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection with a GMR based LFIA system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Severe respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 has been associated with higher rate of neurologic manifestations. Our aim was to investigate whether the severity of chest imaging findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates with the risk of acute neuroimaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 who received care at our hospital between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, and underwent chest imaging within 10 days of neuroimaging. Chest radiographs were assessed using a previously validated automated neural network algorithm for COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity score). Chest CTs were graded using a Chest CT Severity scoring system based on involvement of each lobe. Associations between chest imaging severity scores and acute neuroimaging findings were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Twenty-four of 93 patients (26%) included in the study had positive acute neuroimaging findings, including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 7), infarction (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), or a combination of findings (n = 4). The average length of hospitalization, prevalence of intensive care unit admission, and proportion of patients requiring intubation were significantly greater in patients with acute neuroimaging findings than in patients without them (P < .05 for all). Compared with patients without acute neuroimaging findings, patients with acute neuroimaging findings had significantly higher mean Pulmonary X-ray Severity scores (5.0 [SD, 2.9] versus 9.2 [SD, 3.4], P < .001) and mean Chest CT Severity scores (9.0 [SD, 5.1] versus 12.1 [SD, 5.0], P = .041). The pulmonary x-ray severity score was a significant predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 and acute neuroimaging findings had more severe findings on chest imaging on both radiographs and CT compared with patients with COVID-19 without acute neuroimaging findings. The severity of findings on chest radiography was a strong predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Severity of Chest Imaging is Correlated with Risk of Acute Neuroimaging Findings among Patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the effects of two mechanisms which increase the efficacy of contact-tracing applications (CTAs) such as the mobile phone contact-tracing applications that have been used during the COVID-19 epidemic. The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs(1) the p% of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p% of the population that uses the CTA is the p% with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p% is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced. Our models incorporate geometric inhomogeneous random graphs to study the effects of the presence of super-spreaders and of the absence of long-distant contacts (e.g., through travel restrictions) on our conclusions.","output":"Increasing efficacy of contact-tracing applications by user referrals and stricter quarantining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We studied the safety of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PCDT) in severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-nCoV2).

RESULTS: On 18 March 2020 all elective surgery was halted at RFH to redeploy resources and staff for the COVID-19 surge. Prioritizing of patients according to European Association of Urology guidance was introduced. Clinics and the specialist multidisciplinary team (SMDT) meetings were maintained with physical distancing, kidney surgery was moved to a COVID-protected site, and infection prevention measurements were enforced. During the 7 weeks of lockdown (23 March to 10 May 2020), 234 cases were discussed at the SMDT meetings, 53% compared to the 446 cases discussed in the 7 weeks pre-lockdown. The reduction in referrals was more pronounced for small and asymptomatic renal masses. Of 62 low-priority cancer patients, 27 (43.5%) were deferred.

At the same time, Latinx children in high-income countries have been disproportionately affected by obesity. Public health and medical experts have called for greater focus on multi-sector approaches to obesity prevention, including policy, systems, and environmental strategies, but current evidence for effective intervention strategies among Latinx children is lacking. Several systematic reviews have investigated obesity prevention interventions in Latinx children in the United States and in Latin America, including our own review, but these are now a decade old. Thus, an updated review of existing interventions is needed. To address this gap, we will conduct a systematic review and summary of interventions for obesity prevention among Latinx children published over the past 10 years. The objective of this paper is to outline the protocol for conducting the systematic review and possible meta-analysis. METHODS We will conduct a literature search using PubMed, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Google Scholar databases for studies of interventions to prevent obesity in Latinx children ages birth to 18 years of age. To meet our definition of an intervention, we will include study designs that evaluate the either the efficacy or effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions, including randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and non-randomized interventions with a control or comparison group. We will exclude interventions that aimed to treat rather than prevent overweight or obesity. Interventions may take place in any country or setting. The primary outcome of interest will be child overweight or obesity, measured as adiposity, body mass, or similar anthropometric measures. We will assess risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized and non-randomized studies, as appropriate. We may conduct meta-analyses if studies with comparable exposure and outcome variables are available. DISCUSSION This protocol paper establishes a methodology for a future systemic review of obesity prevention interventions in Latinx children. A systematic review of this topic will provide an important update to the literature regarding interventions to prevent obesity in Latinx child populations globally over the past decade.

The spectrum of COVID-19 illness is broad, from asymptomatic infection to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the long-term sequelae of infection are unclear. COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis has been previously described in the setting of critical illness and ARDS but has not been well described in cases requiring minimal supplemental oxygen. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 42-year-old man hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who initially required minimal supplemental oxygen but weeks later developed progressive pulmonary fibrosis requiring high-flow nasal cannula and ICU admission. Using novel computed tomography (CT) imaging processing techniques, we demonstrate progression from initial ground-glass opacities to pulmonary fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis over several months. Additionally, we describe clinical responsiveness to an extended course of corticosteroids.

The most compelling reasons to develop rVSV as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans, the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells, and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture. Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform. When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant. However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in NHPs indicated that these prototypic rVSV vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations. To address this safety concern, a variety of different attenuation strategies, designed to produce a range of further attenuated rVSV vectors, are currently under investigation.

To reach the declared goal, the paper applies the C.A.O.S. (Characteristics, Ambience, Organizations, Start-up) model, an interpretative model for analyzing the small and medium enterprise dimension. In this way, the main aspects that allowed the farm to be competitive and to react at the emergency period were described.FindingsThe findings show that innovation technology involved the farm's internal processes, improving execution, control and feedback phases.

We assessed whether people living with HIV hospitalised with COVID-19 had increased odds of severe presentation and of in-hospital mortality compared with individuals who were HIV-negative and associated risk factors. METHODS: Between Jan 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021, anonymised individual-level data from 338 566 patients in 38 countries were reported to WHO. Using the Platform pooled dataset, we performed descriptive statistics and regression analyses to compare outcomes in the two populations and identify risk factors. FINDINGS: Of 197 479 patients reporting HIV status, 16 955 (86%) were people living with HIV. 16 283 (96.0%) of the 16 955 people living with HIV were from Africa; 10 603 (629%) were female and 6271 (371%) were male; the mean age was 455 years (SD 137); 6339 (383%) were admitted to hospital with severe illness; and 3913 (243%) died in hospital. Of the 10 166 people living with HIV with known antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, 9302 (915%) were on ART. Compared with individuals without HIV, people living with HIV had 15% increased odds of severe presentation with COVID-19 (aOR 115, 95% CI 110C120) and were 38% more likely to die in hospital (aHR 138, 134C141). Among people living with HIV, male sex, age 45C75 years, and having chronic cardiac disease or hypertension increased the odds of severe COVID-19; male sex, age older than 18 years, having diabetes, hypertension, malignancy, tuberculosis, or chronic kidney disease increased the risk of in-hospital mortality. The use of ART or viral load suppression were associated with a reduced risk of poor outcomes; however, HIV infection remained a risk factor for severity and mortality regardless of ART and viral load suppression status. INTERPRETATION: In this sample of hospitalised people contributing data to the WHO Global Clinical Platform for COVID-19, HIV was an independent risk factor for both severe COVID-19 at admission and in-hospital mortality.

Recently, the Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination has been regarded as a potential candidate to explain this difference. Herein, we hypothesised that past tuberculosis epidemic may act as a latent explanatory factor for the worldwide difference in COVID-19 impact. We compared two indicators of past tuberculosis epidemic, namely, incidence (90 countries for the incidence rate in 1990) and mortality (28 countries for the mortality rate in 1950) with COVID-19 mortality rate. An inverse relationship exists between both past epidemic indicators and COVID-19 mortality. The rate ratio of the cumulative COVID-19 mortality per 1 million was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98C1.18) per 1 unit decrease in the incidence rate of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. This association existed even after adjusting for potential confounders (elderly rate, diabetes prevalence, mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, and gross domestic product per capita) [adjusted rate ratio: 1.05, 95% CI: (1.03C1.08)].

The major spices exported by India are turmeric, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, peppers, etc. The Indian spices are divided into three era viz. early period, middle age and early modern period. Spices are used in beverages, liquors, and pharmaceutical, cosmetic and perfumery products. The major issue with spices is their handling and storage. This review article mainly focuses on two aspects: at the outset the handling and storage of the spices is an essential factor as spices are available in different forms like raw, processed, fresh, whole dried, or pre\\\\ground dried. Therefore, the need of processing, packaging, storage and handling of the spices is important as the deterioration of spices can lead to the loss of therapeutic activity. Furthermore, many herbal constituents have the capability to enhance the bioavailability of drugs.

Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS). Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety. Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables.

The butterfly goalie technique is thought to involve extreme ranges of hip motion that may predispose goaltenders to FAI. PURPOSE To quantify hip mechanics during 3 common goaltender movements and interpret their relevance to the development of FAI. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Fourteen collegiate and professional goaltenders performed skating, butterfly save, and recovery movements on the ice. Hip mechanics were compared across the 3 movements. RESULTS The butterfly did not exhibit the greatest range of hip motion in any of the 3 planes. Internal rotation was the only hip motion that appeared close to terminal in this study. When subjects decelerated during skatingshaving the blade of their skate across the surface of the icethe magnitude of peak hip internal rotation was 54% greater than in the butterfly and 265% greater than in the recovery. No movement involved levels of concomitant flexion, adduction, and internal rotation that resembled the traditional impingement (FADIR) test. CONCLUSION The magnitude of internal rotation was the most extreme planar hip motion (relative to end-range) recorded in this study (namely during decelerating) and appeared to differentiate this cohort from other athletic populations. Consequently, repetitive end-range hip internal rotation may be the primary precursor to symptomatic FAI in hockey goaltenders and provides the most plausible account for the high incidence of FAI in these athletes. Resection techniques should, therefore, focus on enhancing internal rotation in goaltenders, compared with flexion and adduction. While the butterfly posture can require significant levels of hip motion, recovering from a save and, in particular, decelerating during skating are also demanding on goaltenders' hip joints. Therefore, it appears critical to consider and accommodate a variety of sport-specific hip postures to comprehensively diagnose, treat, and rehabilitate FAI.","output":"Femoroacetabular Impingement in Elite Ice Hockey Goaltenders: Etiological Implications of On-Ice Hip Mechanics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of lives globally. However, the disease has presented more extreme challenges for developing countries that are experiencing economic crises. Studies on COVID-19 symptoms and gut health are scarce and have not fully analyzed possible associations between gut health and disease pathophysiology. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate a potential association between gut health and COVID-19 severity in the Lebanese community, which has been experiencing a severe economic crisis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive Lebanese patients. Participants were interviewed and gut health, COVID-19 symptoms, and different metrics were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: Analysis of the data showed that 25% of participants were asymptomatic, while an equal proportion experienced severe symptoms, including dyspnea (22.7%), oxygen need (7.5%), and hospitalization (3.1%). The mean age of the participants was 38.3 0.8 years, and the majority were males (63.9%), married (68.2%), and currently employed (66.7%). A negative correlation was found between gut health score and COVID-19 symptoms (Kendalls tau-b = -0.153, P = 0.004); indicating that low gut health was associated with more severe COVID-19 cases. Additionally, participants who reported unhealthy food intake were more likely to experience severe symptoms (Kendalls tau-b = 0.118, P = 0.049). When all items were taken into consideration, multiple ordinal logistic regression models showed a significant association between COVID-19 symptoms and each of the following variables: working status, flu-like illness episodes, and gut health score. COVID-19 severe symptoms were more common among patients having poor gut health scores (OR:1.31, 95%CI:1.07C1.61; P = 0.008), experiencing more than one episode of flu-like illness per year (OR:2.85, 95%CI:1.58C5.15; P = 0.001), and owning a job (OR:2.00, 95%CI:1.1C3.65; P = 0.023).

The information about measures of prevention and control was collected from official websites and platforms of the governments. Data cleaning and statistical analysis were performed with softwares of EpiData 3.1, Excel 2019 and SAS 9.4. Results: A total of 171 imported COVID-19 cases had been reported as of 30 March, 2020 in Shanghai, including 170 confirmed cases and 1 asymptomatic infection case. Among them, cases of Chinese nationality accounted for 71.3% (122/171) and cases of foreign nationality accounted for 28.7% (49/171). The median age of the cases was 23 years (P(25), P(75): 18, 35 years), and the male to female ratio of the cases was 1.31. Students accounted for 56.6% (97/171). About 45.6% (78/171) of the cases fell ill before arriving in Shanghai. The cases with mild or common clinical manifestation accounted for 96.5% (165/171) and no significant difference in clinical type was observed between overseas Chinese cases and foreign cases. The epidemic curve by diagnosis date reached peak on March 24, and the number of the cases gradually declined due to the closed-loop management process of joint port prevention and control mechanism. The 171 imported COVID-19 cases were mainly from 24 countries and regions, including the United Kingdom (64 cases, 37.3%), the United States (32 cases, 18.6%), France (19 cases, 11.0%) and Italy (16 cases, 9.4%). About 40.4% of the cases (69/171) planned to continue travelling to 21 other provinces and municipalities in China. Customs quarantine and community observation/detection points identified 43.9% (75/171) cases and 31.0% (53/171) cases, respectively. Conclusions: The imported COVID-19 cases in early phase in Shanghai were mainly young population and students accounted for high proportion. The imported risk of COVID-19 was consistent with the severity of the epidemic in foreign countries.

By linear regression analysis, variables associated with FEV(1)/FVC were identified in the training cohort (n = 2969). Using the variables as predictors, a nomogram was created to predict the FEV(1)/FVC ratio and validated in the test cohort (n = 1272). RESULTS: Older age ( coefficient [95% CI], ? 0.153 [? 0.183, ? 0.122]), male sex (? 1.904 [? 2.749, ? 1.056]), current or past smoking history (? 3.324 [? 4.200, ? 2.453]), and the presence of dyspnea (? 2.453 [? 3.612, ? 1.291]) or overweight (0.894 [0.191, 1.598]) were significantly associated with the FEV(1)/FVC ratio.

This study aimed to explore community perceptions of COVID-19 and their experiences towards health services utilization during the pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. METHODS: The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from a mix of rural and urban settings in all districts (n = 8) of the Province 2 of Nepal. Virtual interviews were conducted between July and August 2020 in local languages. The data were analyzed using thematic network analysis in NVivo 12 Pro. RESULTS: The findings of this research are categorized into four global themes: i) Community and stakeholders' perceptions towards COVID-19; ii) Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on health services delivery; iii) Community perceptions and experiences of health services during COVID-19; and iv) COVID-19: testing, isolation, and quarantine services. Most participants shared their experience of being worried and anxious about COVID-19 and reported a lack of awareness, misinformation, and stigma as major factors contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Maternity services, immunization, and supply of essential medicine were found to be the most affected areas of health care delivery during the lockdown. Participants reported that the interruptions in health services were mostly due to the closure of health services at local health care facilities, limited affordability, and involvement of private health sectors during the pandemic, fears of COVID-19 transmission among health care workers and within health centers, and disruption of transportation services. In addition, the participants expressed frustrations on poor testing, isolation, and quarantine services related to COVID-19, and poor accountability from the government at all levels towards health services continuation/management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to compare rHDU outcomes between the two main UK waves of COVID-19 infection and evaluate the impact of the alpha variant on second wave outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre, retrospective analysis of all patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to the rHDU of our teaching hospital for respiratory support during the first and second main UK waves. RESULTS: In total, 348 patients were admitted to rHDU. In the second wave, mortality (26.7% s vs 50.7% first wave, (2)=14.7, df=1, p=0.0001) and intubation rates in those eligible (24.3% s vs 58.8% first wave, (2)=17.3, df=2, p=0.0002) were improved compared with the first wave.

Evolution in this field has helped in the introduction of various initiatives related to public health informatics. Surveillance systems in the area of health informatics utilizing social media information have been developed for early prediction of disease outbreaks and to monitor diseases. In the past few years, the availability of social media data, particularly Twitter data, enabled real-time syndromic surveillance that provides immediate analysis and instant feedback to those who are charged with follow-ups and investigation of potential outbreaks. In this paper, we review the recent work, trends, and machine learning(ML) text classification approaches used by surveillance systems seeking social media data in the healthcare domain. We also highlight the limitations and challenges followed by possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. METHODS: To study the landscape of research in health informatics performing surveillance of the various health-related data posted on social media or web-based platforms, we present a bibliometric analysis of the 1240 publications indexed in multiple scientific databases (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed) from the year 2010C2018. The papers were further reviewed based on the various machine learning algorithms used for analyzing health-related text posted on social media platforms. FINDINGS: Based on the corpus of 148 selected articles, the study finds the types of social media or web-based platforms used for surveillance in the healthcare domain, along with the health topic(s) studied by them. In the corpus of selected articles, we found 26 articles were using machine learning technique. These articles were studied to find commonly used ML techniques. The majority of studies (24%) focused on the surveillance of flu or influenza-like illness (ILI). Twitter (64%) is the most popular data source to perform surveillance research using social media text data, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (33%) being the most used ML algorithm for text classification. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of online data in surveillance systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems. However, social media based surveillance systems have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc. Our paper mentions future directions, which can be useful for researchers working in the area.

SETTING: The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth 1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. PRACTICE INNOVATION: The new COVID-19 \\"module\\" pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and \\"zero contact\\" pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform \\"WeChat.\\" This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. EVALUATION: With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. RESULTS: The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. CONCLUSION: The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.","output":"Pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care practice in a module hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Obesity is a risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia. Studies have demonstrated poor symptom control in obese patients undergoing fundoplication. The ideal operation remains elusive. However, addressing both obesity and the anatomic abnormality should be the goal. METHODS This study retrospectively identified 19 obese (body mass index [BMI], >30 kg/m(2)) and morbidly obese (BMI, >40 kg/m(2)) patients who presented between December 2007 and November 2011 for management of large or recurrent paraesophageal hernia. All the patients underwent a combined primary paraesophageal hernia repair and longitudinal gastrectomy. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to collect preoperative, operative, and short-term postoperative results. Quantitative data were analyzed using Student's t test and qualitative data with (2) testing. RESULTS Laparoscopy was successful for all 19 patients. The mean preoperative BMI was 37.8  4.1 kg/m(2), and the mean operative time was 236  80 min. Preoperative endoscopy showed that 5 patients who had undergone prior fundoplication experienced anatomic failures, whereas the remaining 14 patients had type 3 and one type 4 paraesophageal Hernia. Mesh was used to reinforce the hiatus in 15 of the 19 cases. The postoperative complications included pulmonary embolism (n = 1) and pulmonary decompensation (n = 2) due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mean hospital stay was 5.3  3 days. Upper gastrointestinal esophagography was performed for all the patients, with no short-term recurrence of paraesophageal hernia. Weight loss was seen for all the patients during the first month, with a mean BMI drop of 2.7  1 kg/m(2). All the patients experienced near to total resolution of their preoperative symptoms within the first month. CONCLUSION Combined laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair and longitudinal gastrectomy offer a safe and feasible approach for the management of large or recurrent paraesophageal hernias in well-selected obese and morbidly obese patients. In a short-term follow-up period, this approach demonstrated effective symptom control and weight loss.","output":"Combined paraesophageal hernia repair and partial longitudinal gastrectomy in obese patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a newly diagnosed entity that has been identified for about 6 months With the US now being theprevalent nation affected, we aimed to identify factors that were relevant to survival and hematologic events inCOVID patients Our group had primarily been assessing COVID-19-confirmed patients as per PCR at OchsnerMedical Center in Louisiana;we primarily studied patients who were admitted between January 2020 to May 2020 Main events that are currently being studied include factors such as mortality, length of stay, and bleeding orthrombotic events Secondary endpoints included factors such as influence on blood type and also amount oftransfusions required by these patients Our overall analysis of 1,773 patients yielded a number of 60 patients whomwe were able to identify as having an active cancer diagnosis This disproportionate number of patients may berelated to factors such as reluctance to visit the hospital among cancer patients, a phenomenon noted similarly inCardiology, where the number of admissions for cardiac causes had declined suddenly during this pandemictimeline One half of our population was African American and included an even proportion of males and females The age range of patients was between 35-93 years The most common malignancies that were noted to co-occur with COVID-19 in our population seemed to be lung, prostate, and hematologic malignancies Although finalanalyses regarding mortality are to be completed, the proportion of patients who had died with a diagnosis of cancer was around 50% per collection of our current data Twenty three out of 60 (38%) patients required bloodtransfusions In comparison to other reports that had reported bleeding events and thrombotic events, our reportrevealed a much lower rate of bleeding events (5/60) and thrombotic events (5/60) We plan to repeat our analysisto assess for any confounders in identifying these events, as noted, since some earlier literature had reportedbetween one quarter to two thirds of patients having a thrombotic event Our analysis also looks at other descriptivevariables such as use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, absolute counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes, platelets, and coagulation markers Also, our assessment includes a study in assessment of any delays noted inchemotherapy dates for these patients","output":"COVID-19 in relation to hematologicevents and mortality in subset of inpatient cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death globally, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) being its most prevalent subtype. Due to the heterogeneity of LUAD, patients given the same treatment regimen may have different responses and clinical outcomes. Therefore, identifying new subtypes of LUAD is important for predicting prognosis and providing personalized treatment for patients. Pyroptosis-related genes play an essential role in anticancer, but there is limited research investigating pyroptosis in LUAD. In this study, 33 pyroptosis gene expression profiles and clinical information were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. By bioinformatics and machine learning analyses, we identified novel subtypes of LUAD based on 10 pyroptosis-related genes and further validated them in the GEO dataset, with machine learning models performing up to an AUC of 1 for classifying in GEO. A web-based tool was established for clinicians to use our clustering model (http://www.aimedicallab.com/tool/aiml-subphe-luad.html). LUAD patients were clustered into 3 subtypes (A, B, and C), and survival analysis showed that B had the best survival outcome and C had the worst survival outcome. The relationships between pyroptosis gene expression and clinical characteristics were further analyzed in the three molecular subtypes. Immune profiling revealed significant differences in immune cell infiltration among the three molecular subtypes. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were performed based on the differential genes of the three subtypes, indicating that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in multiple cellular and biological functions, including RNA catabolic process, mRNA catabolic process, and pathways of neurodegeneration-multiple diseases. Finally, we developed an 8-gene prognostic model that accurately predicted 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival.

We aimed to identify studies systematically that describe the incidence and risks factors of CAPA, and to assess its outcome. Methods: Two authors independently searched ScienceDirect, PubMed, CNKI, MEDLINE (OVID), and MedRXIV from December 31, 2019 to Feb 27, 2021. We included observational cohort studies that investigated patients with CAPA admitted to an ICU. We assessed the quality of all included studies using the NewcastleCOttawa Scale). The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021242179). Results: Twenty-nine cohort studies with 2095 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU and 264 patients who developed to CAPA were included (Pooled incidence: 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11C0.17). The overall mortality and case fatality rate of CAPA were 0.07 (0.05C0.09) and 0.51 (0.44C0.58), respectively. Patients with COVID?19 would develop CAPA at 7.28 days after mechanical ventilation (range, 5.48C9.08). Compared with patients without CAPA, those with CAPA had a significantly lower median body mass index (27.32 vs . 28.97 kg/m 2 , P = 0.034), higher median creatinine level (127.94 vs . 88.23 mol/L, P = 014), and were more likely to receive corticosteroids therapy (41.0% vs. 38.0%, risk ratio [RR] = 1.98, 95% CI=1.08C3.63) and renal replacement therapy (42.0% vs . 28.2%, RR = 1.61, 95% CI=1.04C2.50) during admission. Remarkably, patients with CAPA were associated significantly with a 1.66?fold higher mortality (RR = 1.66, 95% CI=1.31C2.12) without significant heterogeneity and publication bias.

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care pandemic hospital. Sixty COVID-19 patients with cerumen in their external auditory canals were included in the study. Swabs were taken from the external auditory canal of the patients by an experienced otolaryngologist with the test swab. Sampling was done by rotating the sample swab 360 10 times in each external auditory canal for a total of 20 times. After collection, swabs were placed into 2 mL of the sterile viral transport medium (various manufacturers), then transported and tested as soon as possible after collection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the cerumen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples of any of the 60 patients with positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSION: Cerumen cleaning is one of the most common procedures performed by otolaryngologists, and care should be taken during the procedure or due to the possibility of infection from the resulting contaminants. The cerumen contains the secretions of the glands in the external auditory canal and may contain certain pathogens that are actively found in the body.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 1 and December 1, 2020, in Iran. The study population consisted of patients who used the service. Three hundred-ninety-six patients were enrolled in the study by convenience sampling. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire. The face, comprehensibility, and content validity of the questionnaire were tested and met. The reliability of this questionnaire was confirmed (r = 0.9). Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were conducted. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 software. RESULTS: In total, 396 patients responded to the online questionnaire. The mean age of patients was 37  10.31 years. More than half of them had an academic degree (65.40 %). Teleconsultation was considered satisfactory by 172 patients (43.43 %), while more than half of the patients (56.57 %) were unsatisfied with teleconsultation. In terms of \\"quality of care provided\\" and \\"patient information privacy\\" components, around 41 % of patients were satisfied.

This research was fixed some relevant objectives like (i) to evaluate the changes of heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr and Fe) and microbial contamination (TVC, TC and FC) of river water (ii) to identify the magnitude of human health hazard during lockdown compared to pre lockdown and unlock phase. Total 33 water samples were collected in three periods. During lockdown, TVC, TC and FC showed the gradual decreasing trend in this stretch. All samples exceed the concentration of microbes compared to recommended standard in three periods. Among all heavy metals, Zinc, iron, chromium found their abandoned presence in the river water. Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) showed 100% sample water of highly polluted (HPI > 150) type for drinking and other purpose.

These ligands were designed to provide a pH-dependent relaxivity response upon complexation with Mn2+ in aqueous solution. The protonation constants of the ligands and the stability constants of the Mn2+ complexes were determined using potentiometric titrations complemented by spectrophotometric experiments. The deprotonations of the sulfonamide groups of the ligands are characterized by protonation constants of log KiH = 10.36 and 10.59 for DPASAm3- and HNO2ASAm2-, respectively. These values decrease dramatically to log KiH = 6.43 and 5.42 in the presence of Mn2+, because of the coordination of the negatively charged sulfonamide groups to the metal ion. The higher log KiH value in [Mn(DPASAm)]- is related to the formation of a seven-coordinate complex, while the metal ion in [Mn(NO2ASAm)]- is six-coordinated. The X-ray crystal structure of Na[Mn(DPASAm)(H2O)]2H2O confirms the formation of a seven-coordinate complex, where the coordination environment is fulfilled by the donor atoms of the two picolinate groups, the amine N atom, the N atom of the sulfonamide group, and a coordinated water molecule. The lower conditional stability of the [Mn(NO2ASAm)]- complex and the lower protonation constant of the sulfonamide group results in complex dissociation at relatively high pH (<7.0). However, protonation of the sulfonamide group in [Mn(DPASAm)]- falls into the physiologically relevant pH window and causes a significant increase in relaxivity from r1p = 3.8 mM-1 s-1 at pH 9.0 to r1p = 8.9 mM-1 s-1 at pH 4.0 (10 MHz, 25 C).","output":"Mn2+ Complexes Containing Sulfonamide Groups with pH-Responsive Relaxivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus.

Immunohistochemistry analysis of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) was carried out. The expression of apoptosis-associated genes and proteins, such as cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease-3 (Caspase-3), Survivin, Bax, Bcl-2, BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. TET inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. The mechanism underlying this effect might be mediated by TET-upregulated Caspase-3, Bax, and Bid and downregulated by Bcl-2, Survivin, and PARP. Taken together, this study supported the fact that TET is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC, thereby providing experimental evidence for its use in the treatment of breast cancer.","output":"Anticancer Activity of Tetrandrine by Inducing Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer Cell Line MDA-MB-231 In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Only a few studies evaluate the presence of spermatozoa intraoperatively. The study aimed to assess whether the heterogenicity of testicular histopathology and seminiferous tubules can predict the outcome of microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) in men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA).The study comprised a retrospective analysis of 94 patients with azoospermia who were referred from 2016 to 2017. Under optical magnification, they were classified into 2 groups based on the diameter of tubules intraoperatively, namely homogeneous tubules and heterogeneous tubules. Postoperatively, patients were divided into 2 groups of heterogeneous histopathology and homogeneous histopathology according to the 8 histopathological classification subgroups. The sperm retrieval rate was the main outcome.Testicular spermatozoa were successfully retrieved in 27 men (28%). The sperm retrieval rate in those with heterogeneous histopathology was higher than men with homogeneous histopathology (47% vs 12%; P < .001). The sperm retrieval rate of each histopathological subgroup in men who had the heterogeneous histopathology was higher, compared with the homogeneous histopathology (Sertoli cell only [SCO]: 30% vs 6%; maturation arrest [MA]: 38% vs 0%; tubular hyalinization: 42% vs 20%, respectively). Under the optical magnification, the sperm retrieval rate was significantly higher in men with heterogeneous vs homogeneous tubules (65% vs 15%, P < .001). Moreover, the sperm retrieval rate of the contralateral testicular was higher in men who had heterogeneous tubules, compared with the homogeneous tubules (25% vs 3%; P = .036).Heterogenicity of histopathology is an effective predictor in men with histopathological information available from a previous diagnostic biopsy or conventional TESE attempt preoperatively for successful sperm retrieval. Homogeneous tubules seem beneficial for some patients to perform a limited (superficial) contralateral micro-TESE after no spermatozoa were identified initially.","output":"Heterogenicity of testicular histopathology and tubules as a predictor of successful microdissection testicular sperm extraction in men with nonobstructive azoospermia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Media sosial menjadi salah satu pilihan masyarakat dalam mencari informasi dan hiburan.

In particular, a simulation-based risk analysis approach enables scenario evaluation and comparison to guide decision making and action prioritization under uncertainty. We develop a simulation model to characterize the risks and uncertainties associated with infections resulting from aerosol exposure in in-person classes. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to model a semester of courses in a real college with approximately 11,000 students embedded within a larger university. To have practical impact, risk cannot focus on only infections as the end point of interest, we estimate the risks of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths of students and faculty in the college. We incorporate uncertainties in disease transmission, the impact of policies such as masking and facility interventions, and variables outside of the colleges control such as population-level disease and immunity prevalence. We show in our example application that universal use of masks that block 40% of aerosols and the installation of near-ceiling, fan-mounted UVC systems both have the potential to lead to substantial risk reductions and that these effects can be modeled at the individual room level. These results exemplify how such simulation-based risk analysis can inform decision making and prioritization under great uncertainty.","output":"COVID-19 aerosol transmission simulation-based risk analysis for in-person learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused the closure of university campuses around the world and migration of all learning, teaching, and assessment into online domains.

However adaptive pressure eventually leads to changes in phenotype that involve non-neutral mutations. The relation between neutrality and adaptation has been studied in the context of RNA before and here we further study transitional mutations in the context of degenerate (plastic) RNA sequences and genetic assimilation. We propose quasineutral mutations, i.e. mutations which preserve an element of the phenotype set, as minimal mutations and study their properties. We also propose a general probabilistic interpretation of genetic assimilation and specialize it to the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA sequences. RESULTS: We show that degenerate sequences i.e. sequences with more than one structure at the MFE level have the highest evolvability among all sequences and are central to evolutionary innovation. Degenerate sequences also tend to cluster together in the sequence space. The selective pressure in an evolutionary simulation causes the population to move towards regions with more degenerate sequences, i.e. regions at the intersection of different neutral networks, and this causes the number of such sequences to increase well beyond the average percentage of degenerate sequences in the sequence space. We also observe that evolution by quasineutral mutations tends to conserve the number of base pairs in structures and thereby maintains structural integrity even in the presence of pressure to the contrary. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that degenerate RNA sequences play a major role in evolutionary adaptation.","output":"Degeneracy and genetic assimilation in RNA evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical Information Patient Initials or Identifier Number: R Relevant Clinical History and Physical Exam: A 64-year-old lady with underlying dyslipidemia presented to our emergency department with typical chest pain. Immediate electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus rhythm, ST elevation at lead 1, aVL and V1, hyperacute T wave at V2 till V3 with ST depression at leads II, III and aVF. Hence a diagnosis of acute anterolateral myocardial infarction, Killip 1 was given and urgent referral to cardiologist was made. Subsequently, she was subjected for primary angioplasty. Relevant Test Results Prior to Catheterization: Blood results showed sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, urea of 3.2 mmol/L and creatinine of 67 mmol/L. Liver enzymes were within normal limits with aspartate transaminase of 38 U/L and alkaline phosphatase of 91 U/L. Creatinine kinase was 330 U/L but increased to 2861 U/L during subsequent day. In addition, COVID-19 RTK antigen was negative. Relevant Catheterization Findings: Coronary angiogram revealed mild disease at proximal right coronary artery and proximal left circumflex. Minimal disease was noted at distal left main stem, but severe disease was observed from proximal left anterior descending till mid left anterior descending. Heterogenous plague suggesting thrombus was seen at ostial first diagonal as well. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Interventional Management Procedural Step: Right femoral assess was obtained with 7Fr sheath, and SL 3.5 7Fr guiding catheter was engaged to left coronary artery. Intracoronary heparin and tirofiban were given prior to wiring. First diagonal was wired with Sion Blue while left anterior descending was wired with Runthrough Floppy. Post-wiring both vessels, coronary flow remained TIMI 3 and hence we decided to proceed with IVUS. From IVUS, noted fibrous elastic plague with heavy thrombus burden. Intracoronary streptokinase was given and noted improvement of thrombus from IVUS. BMW wired to left circumflex. Lesion predilated with scoring balloon and associated with no reflow events, resolved post vasodilators. Left main stem was stented with Onyx 3.5 x 26 mm and deployed at 16 atm. Both side branches wires were rewired into same branches via Crusade microcatheter. LMS stent was post dilated with NC Euphora 4.5 mm at nominal pressure. Noted impingement of both ostium diagonal and circumflex branches. Balloon kissing inflation was performed for both LAD/Diagonal bifurcation and LMS/LAD/circumflex bifurcation. POT was performed post balloon kissing inflation with NC Euphora 3.5 mm and 4.5 mm for both LAD and LMS respectively.

Fragments formed during proteolysis in solution digestion were distinguished from naturally occurring peptides by using an 18O stable isotope labeling strategy. RESULTS: We detected 16 previously unknown circulating fragments of proBNP peptides (9 of which are located in the N-terminal and 7 in the C-terminal region), revealing a more advanced state of degradation than previously known.

The Great Bay Estuary (New Hampshire, USA) is an important ecological, commercial, and recreational resource where upstream WWTFs have recently been under pressure to reduce nitrogen loading to the estuary and consequently upgrade treatment systems. Therefore, we investigated the distribution and abundance of 18 PPCPs and three flame retardants within the Great Bay Estuary and WWTFs discharging to the estuary to examine how WWTF type influenced PPCP removal. All 21 analytes were frequently detected at g/L to ng/L concentrations in influent and effluent and ng/kg in sludge. WWTFs with enhanced nutrient removal and longer solids retention times correlated to higher PPCP removal, indicating facility upgrades may have benefits related to PPCP removal. Understanding PPCP fate during treatment and in downstream waters informs our ability to assess the environmental and ecological impacts of PPCPs on estuarine resources and develop mitigation strategies to better protect marine ecosystems from emerging contaminant exposure.

Efforts are being made to understand the potential cross-protective immunity of memory T cells, induced by prior encounters with seasonal coronaviruses, in providing protection against severe COVID-19. In this study we assessed T-cell responses directed against highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2. Epitope mapping revealed 16 CD8(+) T-cell epitopes across the nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and open reading frame (ORF)3a proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and five CD8(+) T-cell epitopes encoded within the highly conserved regions of the ORF1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative sequence analysis showed high conservation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab T-cell epitopes in seasonal coronaviruses. Paradoxically, the immune responses directed against the conserved ORF1ab epitopes were infrequent and subdominant in both convalescent and unexposed participants. This subdominant immune response was consistent with a low abundance of ORF1ab encoded proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Overall, these observations suggest that while cross-reactive CD8(+) T cells likely exist in unexposed individuals, they are not common and therefore are unlikely to play a significant role in providing broad preexisting immunity in the community. IMPORTANCE T cells play a critical role in protection against SARS-CoV-2. Despite being highly topical, the protective role of preexisting memory CD8(+) T cells, induced by prior exposure to circulating common coronavirus strains, remains less clear. In this study, we established a robust approach to specifically assess T cell responses to highly conserved regions within SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with recent observations we demonstrate that recognition of these highly conserved regions is associated with an increased likelihood of milder disease. However, extending these observations we observed that recognition of these conserved regions is rare in both exposed and unexposed volunteers, which we believe is associated with the low abundance of these proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. These observations have important implications for the likely role preexisting immunity plays in controlling severe disease, further emphasizing the importance of vaccination to generate the immunodominant T cells required for immune protection.","output":"Limited Recognition of Highly Conserved Regions of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 epidemic has substantially limited human activities and affected anthropogenic emissions.

An important barrier to further increased use is a lack of understanding about which additional resources are required to conduct a high-quality adaptive clinical trial, compared to a traditional fixed design. The Costing Adaptive Trials (CAT) project investigated which additional resources may be required to support adaptive trials. METHODS: We conducted a mock costing exercise amongst seven Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) in the UK. Five scenarios were developed, derived from funded clinical trials, where a non-adaptive version and an adaptive version were described. Each scenario represented a different type of adaptive design. CTU staff were asked to provide the costs and staff time they estimated would be needed to support the trial, categorised into specified areas (e.g. statistics, data management, trial management). This was calculated separately for the non-adaptive and adaptive version of the trial, allowing paired comparisons. Interviews with 10 CTU staff who had completed the costing exercise were conducted by qualitative researchers to explore reasons for similarities and differences. RESULTS: Estimated resources associated with conducting an adaptive trial were always (moderately) higher than for the non-adaptive equivalent. The median increase was between 2 and 4% for all scenarios, except for sample size re-estimation which was 26.5% (as the adaptive design could lead to a lengthened study period). The highest increase was for statistical staff, with lower increases for data management and trial management staff. The percentage increase in resources varied across different CTUs. The interviews identified possible explanations for differences, including (1) experience in adaptive trials, (2) the complexity of the non-adaptive and adaptive design, and (3) the extent of non-trial specific core infrastructure funding the CTU had. CONCLUSIONS: This work sheds light on additional resources required to adequately support a high-quality adaptive trial. The percentage increase in costs for supporting an adaptive trial was generally modest and should not be a barrier to adaptive designs being cost-effective to use in practice.

We used anonymized test results from individuals visiting general practitioners and analysed during 2018. Analytical quality was assured by EQA performance, daily average monitoring and by assessing longitudinal accuracy between 2018 and 2020 (using trueness verifiers from Dutch EQA). Per test, outliers by biochemically related tests were excluded, data were transformed to a normal distribution (if necessary) and means and standard deviations were calculated, stratified by age and sex. In addition, the reference limit estimator method was also used to calculate reference intervals using the same dataset. Finally, for standardized tests reference intervals obtained were compared with the published NUMBER results. Reference intervals were calculated using data from 509,408 clinical requests. For biochemical tests following a normal distribution, similar reference intervals were found between Vall dHebron and the Dutch study. For creatinine and urea, reference intervals increased with age in both populations. The upper limits of Gamma-glutamyl transferase were markedly higher in the Dutch study compared to Vall dHebron results. Creatine kinase and uric acid reference intervals were higher in both populations compared to conventional reference intervals. Medical test results following a normal distribution showed comparable and consistent reference intervals between studies. Therefore a simple indirect method is a feasible and cost-efficient approach for calculating reference intervals. Yet, for generating standardized calculated reference intervals that are traceable to higher order materials and methods, efforts should also focus on test standardization and bias assessment using commutable trueness verifiers.","output":"Indirect determination of biochemistry reference intervals using outpatient data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is insufficient data on the longevity of immunity acquired after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Despite obesity being preventable, over a quarter of the UK adult population is currently considered clinically obese (typically body mass index 35 kg/m(2)). Access to treatment for people with severe obesity is limited by long wait times and local availability. Online and group-based interventions provide means of increasing the accessibility of obesity prevention and treatment services. However, there has been no prior review of the effectiveness of group-based interventions delivered online for people with severe obesity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review protocol is to provide an evaluation of the effectiveness and usability of different types of online, group-based interventions for people with severe obesity. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study (PICOS) frameworks were used to structure this review. The review will systematically search 7 databases: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, APA PsycNet, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases. Two authors (MM-I and LB) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of identified articles, select studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria, and extract data into a standardized form. Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved by a third reviewer (EM) if necessary. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 2 tool and a descriptive analysis will be used to evaluate effectiveness and usability. RESULTS: The systematic review has not yet been started. It is expected to be completed and submitted for publication by December 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will summarize the effectiveness and usability of online, group-based interventions for people with obesity.

Establishing treatment or care plans for these patients must account for their disease interactions, finite self-management abilities, and even conflicting treatment recommendations from clinical practice guidelines. Despite existing insight into how primary care physicians (PCPs) approach care decisions for their patients in general, less is known about how PCPs make care planning decisions for more complex populations particularly within a medical home setting. We therefore sought to describe factors affecting physician decision-making when care planning for complex patients with multimorbidity within the team-based, patient-centered medical home setting in the integrated healthcare system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). METHODS: This was a qualitative study involving semi-structured telephone interviews with PCPs working > 40% time in VHA clinics. Interviews were conducted from April to July, 2020. Content was analyzed with deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: 23 physicians participated in interviews; most were MDs (n = 21) and worked in hospital-affiliated clinics (n = 14) across all regions of the VHAs national clinic network. We found internal, external, and relationship-based factors, with developed subthemes describing factors affecting decision-making for complex patients with multimorbidity. Physicians described tailoring decisions to individual patients; making decisions in keeping with an underlying internal style or habit; working towards an overarching goal for care; considering impacts from patient access and resources on care plans; deciding within boundaries provided by organizational structures; collaborating on care plans with their care team; and impacts on decisions from their own emotions and relationship with patient. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs described internal, external, and relationship-based factors that affected their care planning for high-risk and complex patients with multimorbidity in the VHA. Findings offer useful strategies employed by physicians to effectively conduct care planning for complex patients in a medical home setting, such as delegation of follow-up within multidisciplinary care teams, optimizing visit time vs frequency, and deliberate investment in patient-centered relationship building to gain buy-in to care plans.

Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to elucidate them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medications used against SARS-CoV-2 may have a greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids.

Using routine hospital data, we aimed to examine the spatial distribution, temporal trends and climatic risk factors of paediatric ARIs in Vietnam. METHODS: Data from hospitalised paediatric (<16 years) patients with ARIs residing in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) between 2005 and 2010 were retrieved from the two main Childrens Hospitals and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC. Spatial mapping and time series analysis were performed after disaggregating data into upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 155 999 paediatric patients admitted with ARIs (33% of all hospital admissions). There were 68 120 URIs (14%) and 87 879 LRIs (19%). The most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARI), pneumonia (21%), bronchitis (18%) and bronchiolitis (16%). A significant increasing trend over time was found for both URIs (mean weekly incidence per 1000 population, I=3.12), incidence rate ratio for 1-week increase in time (RR 1.0, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17) for URI and (I=4.02, RR 1.08 (95% CI 1.006 to 1.16)) for LRI. The weekly URI incidence peaked in MayCJune and was significantly associated with lags in weekly URI incidence and the average humidity, rainfall and water level. The weekly LRI incidence exhibited significant seasonality (P<0.0001), with an annual peak in SeptemberCOctober and was significantly associated with lags in weekly LRI incidence and lags in weekly average temperature, rainfall and water level.

From SIR type models only the model without vital dynamics has an exact analytic solution, which can be obtained in an exact parametric form. The SIR model with vital dynamics, the simplest extension of the basic SIR model, does not admit a closed form representation of the solution. However, in order to perform the comparison with the epidemiological data accurate representations of the time evolution of the SIR model with vital dynamics would be very useful. In the present paper, we obtain first the basic evolution equation of the SIR model with vital dynamics, which is given by a strongly nonlinear second order differential equation. Then we obtain a series representation of the solution of the model, by using the Adomian and Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Methods to solve the dynamical evolution equation of the model. The solutions are expressed in the form of infinite series. The series representations of the time evolution of the SIR model with vital dynamics are compared with the exact numerical solutions of the model, and we find that, at least for a specific range of parameters, there is a good agreement between the Adomian and Laplace-Adomian semianalytical solutions, containing only a small number of terms, and the numerical results.","output":"Series solution of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model with vital dynamics via the Adomian and Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appeal for more solidarity is a recurring pattern in political discussions of how to cope with the crises the European Union (EU) confronts.

This study aimed firstly to compare CDUS detection of significant sac abnormalities with CTA. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare financial estimates of the, predominantly CDUS based, local and Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) protocols, the risk stratified European Society of Vascular Surgery (ESVS) protocol, and the CTA based National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) protocol. METHODS: Agreement between CDUS and CTA was assessed for detection of significant sac abnormalities. Surveillance protocols were extrapolated from published guidelines and applied to infrarenal EVAR patients active on local surveillance at a large, single centre. Surveillance intensity was dependent on presence of endoleak and subsequent risk of treatment failure in accordance with surveillance recommendations. Estimates for each surveillance protocol were inclusive of a range of published incidences of endoleak, contrast associated acute kidney injury (AKI), and excess hospital bed days, and estimated for a hypothetical five year surveillance period. RESULTS: The kappa coefficient between CDUS and CTA for detecting sac abnormalities was 0.68. Maximum five year surveillance cost estimates for the 289 active EVAR patients were 272 359 for SVS, 230 708 for ESVS, 643 802 for NICE, and 266 777 for local protocols, or 1 270, 1 076, 3 003, and 1 244 per patient. Differences in endoleak incidence accounted for a 1.1 to 1.4 fold increase in costs. AKI incidence accounted for a 3.3 to 6.2 fold increase in costs. CONCLUSION: A combined CTA and CDUS EVAR surveillance protocol, with CTA reserved for early seal assessment and confirmatory purposes, provides an economical approach without compromising detection of sac abnormalities. AKI, as opposed to direct imaging costs, accounted for the largest differences in surveillance cost estimates.","output":"A Comparison of Computed Tomography Angiography and Colour Duplex Ultrasound Surveillance Post Infrarenal Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Financial Implications and Impact of Different International Surveillance Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate diagnosis to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the clinical management of this lethal infection. Recently, many low-cost and easy-to-use rapid test kits (RTK) have been developed in many countries for the massive screening of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, evaluating the accuracy and reliability of an RTK is critical. The current study was conducted on 157 individuals to evaluate the performance accuracy of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection kits using different clinical samples compared with qRT-PCR results. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients for qRT-PCR and RTK tests, and then buccal and nasal, and nasal swabs were collected for RTK tests separately. The nasal and buccal swabs showed high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%) compared with the qRT-PCR results. Meanwhile, for nasal, the sensitivity was 96% with 98% specificity, and nasopharyngeal swabs showed 98% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Fishers exact test revealed statistical significance (p < 0.05) between nasopharyngeal, nasal and buccal, and nasal swabs compared with qRT-PCR results. The study concludes that different clinical samples used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 showed high sensitivities and specificities compared with qRT-PCR. The RTKs using nasal and buccal, nasopharyngeal, and nasal swabs are valuable tools for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially when molecular detections are available with limited access and a high infectivity rate, when the timely detection of virus cases is urgently needed.

OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. METHODS: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. RESULTS: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs.

We aimed to evaluate the patterns and effects of on-admission hyperglycemia and inflammatory response in a level 1 trauma center. We hypothesized that higher initial readings of blood glucose and cytokines are associated with severe injuries and worse in-hospital outcomes in trauma patients. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted for adult trauma patients who were admitted and tested for on-admission blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18 and hs-CRP. Patients were categorized into four groups [non-diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic normoglycemic, diabetic hyperglycemic (DH) and stress-induced hyperglycemic (SIH)]. The inflammatory markers were measured on three time points (admission, 24 h and 48 h). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for the correlation for the inflammatory markers. Pearson's correlation test and logistic regression analysis were also performed. RESULTS During the study period, 250 adult trauma patients were enrolled. Almost 13% of patients presented with hyperglycemia (50% had SIH and 50% had DH). Patients with SIH were younger, had significantly higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), higher IL-6 readings, prolonged hospital length of stay and higher mortality. The SIH group had lower Revised Trauma Score (p = 0.005), lower Trauma Injury Severity Score (p = 0.01) and lower GCS (p = 0.001). Patients with hyperglycemia had higher in-hospital mortality than the normoglycemia group (12.5% vs 3.7%; p = 0.02). A significant correlation was identified between the initial blood glucose level and serum lactate, IL-6, ISS and hospital length of stay. Overall rate of change in slope 88.54 (95% CI:-143.39-33.68) points was found more in hyperglycemia than normoglycemia group (p = 0.002) for IL-6 values, whereas there was no statistical significant change in slopes of age, gender and their interaction. The initial IL-6 levels correlated with ISS (r = 0.40, p = 0.001). On-admission hyperglycemia had an adjusted odds ratio 2.42 (95% CI: 1.076-5.447, p = 0.03) for severe injury (ISS > 12) after adjusting for age, shock index and blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS In trauma patients, on-admission hyperglycemia correlates well with the initial serum IL-6 level and is associated with more severe injuries. Therefore, it could be a simple marker of injury severity and useful tool for patient triage and risk assessment.

They can help to balance the need to maintain normal life and economic activities as much as possible while still avoiding exponentially growing case numbers. However, a majority of citizens need to be willing to install such an app for it to be effective. Hence, knowledge about drivers for app uptake is crucial. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to add to our understanding of underlying psychological factors motivating app uptake. More specifically, we investigated the role of concern for ones own health and concern to unknowingly infect others. METHODS: A two-wave survey with 346 German-speaking participants from Switzerland and Germany was conducted. We measured the uptake of two decentralized contact tracing apps officially launched by governments (Corona-Warn-App, Germany; SwissCovid, Switzerland), as well as concerns regarding COVID-19 and control variables. RESULTS: Controlling for demographic variables and general attitudes toward the government and the pandemic, logistic regression analysis showed a significant effect of self-focused concerns (odds ratio [OR] 1.64, P=.002). Meanwhile, concern of unknowingly infecting others did not contribute significantly to the prediction of app uptake over and above concern for ones own health (OR 1.01, P=.92). Longitudinal analyses replicated this pattern and showed no support for the possibility that app uptake provokes changes in levels of concern. Testing for a curvilinear relationship, there was no evidence that too much concern leads to defensive reactions and reduces app uptake. CONCLUSIONS: As one of the first studies to assess the installation of already launched corona tracing apps, this study extends our knowledge of the motivational landscape of app uptake. Based on this, practical implications for communication strategies and app design are discussed.","output":"Self-Focused and Other-Focused Health Concerns as Predictors of the Uptake of Corona Contact Tracing Apps: Empirical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate diagnosis at an early stage of infection is essential for the successful management of any contagious disease. The COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a pandemic that has affected 214 countries affecting more than 30.8 million people causing 0.957 million deaths as of third week of September, 2020. The primary diagnosis of the infection is done either by the molecular technique of RT-qPCR by detecting portions of the RNA of the viral genome or through immunodiagnostic tests by detecting the viral proteins or the antibodies produced by the host. As the demand for the test increased rapidly many naive manufacturers entered the market with novel kits and more and more laboratories also entered the diagnostic arena making the test result more error-prone. There are serious debates globally and regionally on the sensitivity and specificity of these tests and about the overall accuracy and reliability of the tests for decision making on control strategies. The significance of the test is also complexed by the presence of asymptomatic carriers, re-occurrence of infection in cured patients as well as by the varied incubation periods of the infection and shifting of the viral location in the host tissues. In this paper, we review the techniques available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and probable factors that can reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the different test methods currently in vogue.

Rural patients presented for clinical care at older ages and had less annual visits to clinic. Persons travelled relatively long distances to seek SCD care and those travelling longer had less health maintenance visits.

Prevalence of leg ulcers did not vary between rural and urban patients but was higher in males than in females. Females also had lower odds of having respiratory events but there was no sex difference in history of painful crises. Persons with more severe genotypes lived in higher poverty and travelled longer for healthcare services. Persons in areas with higher annual rainfall, higher mean temperatures and living farther from factories had less painful crises and respiratory events.

This symptom even causes concern for patients who have recovered and have been discharged. Therefore, it is obligatory to test and monitor variations in their lungs' function after recovery. In this study, we evaluated the pulmonary function of 64 patients with severe COVID-19, six weeks to 3 months after discharge. Pulmonary function parameters were measured by spirometry and body box according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society and under the supervision of an adult pulmonologist. According to the forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and total lung capacity (TLC) values, it was found that 3.1% of people had an obstructive pattern, 40.63% of patients had the restrictive pattern, and 6.25% of improved individuals showed a mixed pattern. Furthermore, the study of diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) index revealed that 13.3%, 25%, and 53% of cases had mild, moderate, and severe disorders of gas exchange, respectively. In addition, determining the maximum amount of inspiratory muscles (PI max) and expiratory muscles (PE max) disclosed that the rate of these two indicators in 62.5% and 71.88% of the subjects were less than 50%, respectively. In general, the results of the present study suggest that pulmonary function test and follow-up of patients' condition are not only recommended but seems to be essential after recovery due to the large percentage of patients with the restricted pattern a few weeks after recovery.

In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity. Objective: The aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected. Methods: RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling [Formula: see text] the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution [Formula: see text] was used to represent the trend of daily variations of [Formula: see text]. When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Welchs t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when [Formula: see text]. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase [Formula: see text] was used to quantify the difference between two values. Results: Google Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both periods 1 and 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets ([Formula: see text] for Italian regions, and [Formula: see text] for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference. Conclusion: In the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method.","output":"Reliability of Google Trends: Analysis of the Limits and Potential of Web Infoveillance During COVID-19 Pandemic and for Future Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective vaccines are essential for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

We collected demographics, medical history, and safety information within 7 d after doses 1 and 2 (D1, D2). Associations between characteristics and reactions were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS. We studied 741 transplant recipients who underwent BNT162b2 (54%) or mRNA-1273 (46%) vaccination. Median (interquartile range) age was 60 (44C69) y, 57% were female, and 10% were non-White. Although local site reactions decreased after D2 (85% D1 versus 78% D2, P < 0.001), systemic reactions increased (49% D1 versus 69% D2, P < 0.001). Younger participants were more likely to develop systemic symptoms after D1 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per 10 y = (0.85)0.90(0.94), P < 0.001) and D2 (aIRR per 10 y = (0.91)0.93(0.96), P < 0.001).

Currently, the COVID-19 vaccine has been used in many countries, but it is still unable to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection despite patients receiving full vaccination doses. Therefore, we aimed to appraise the booster effect of the different platforms of vaccines, including inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), viral vector vaccine (AZD122), and mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) in healthy adults who received the full dose of inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). The booster dose was safe with no serious adverse events. Moreover, the immunogenicity indicated that the booster dose with viral vector and mRNA vaccine achieved a significant proportion of Ig anti-receptor binding domain (RBD), IgG anti-RBD, and IgA anti-S1 booster response. In contrast, inactivated vaccine achieved a lower booster response than others. Consequently, the neutralization activity of vaccinated serum had a high inhibition of over 90% against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and their variants (B.1.1.7-alpha, B.1.351-beta, and B.1.617.2-delta).

In this study, we used serum samples (n = 792) from pigs of precisely known infection status and a multiplex fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay and/or enzyme-linked immunoassay platform to characterize the antibody response to PEDV whole-virus (WV) particles and recombinant polypeptides derived from the four PEDV structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Antibody assay cutoff values were selected to provide 100% diagnostic specificity for each target. The earliest IgG antibody response, mainly directed against S1 polypeptides, was observed at days 7 to 10 postinfection. With the exception of nonreactive protein E, we observed similar antibody ontogenies and patterns of seroconversion for S1, N, M, and WV antigens. Recombinant S1 provided the best diagnostic sensitivity, regardless of the PEDV strain, with no cross-reactivity detected against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), or porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) pig antisera. The WV particles showed some cross-reactivity to TGEV Miller and TGEV Purdue antisera, while N protein presented some cross-reactivity to TGEV Miller. The M protein was highly cross-reactive to TGEV and PRCV antisera.

However, when studies restricted their analyses to current smokers, the risks for COVID-19 severity and death are inconsistent. This meta-analysis explored the association between current smoking and the risk for mortality based on the studies that reported all three categories of smoking (current, former, and never smokers) to overcome the limitation of the previous meta-analyses which former smokers might have been classified as non-smokers. METHODS We searched PubMed and Embase up to 1 January 2021. We included studies reporting all three categories of smoking behaviors of COVID-19 patients and mortality outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to examine relationships in the data. RESULTS A total of 34 articles with 35,193 COVID-19 patients was included. The meta-analysis confirmed the association between current smoking (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.58) and former smoking (OR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.53-2.03) with COVID-19 mortality. We also found that the risk for COVID-19 death in current smokers does not vary by age, but significantly drops by age in former smokers. Moreover, current smokers in non-high-income countries have higher risks of COVID-19 death compared with high-income countries (OR 3.11, 95% CI: 2.04-4.72 vs. OR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91-1.43; p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS Current and former smokers are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Tobacco control should be strengthened to encourage current smokers to quit and prevent the initiation of smoking. Public health professionals should take the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to promote smoking prevention and cession. IMPLICATIONS This study makes an important contribution to the existing literature by distinguishing between current and former smoking and their separate effects on COVID-19 mortality. We also explore the effects by age of patients and country income level. Findings from this study provide empirical evidence against misinformation about the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Active smokers are at higher risk of COVID-19 death: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Creating nanosized pores in layered materials can increase the abundant active surface area and boost potential applications of energy storage devices. Herein, a unique synthetic strategy based on the polyaniline (PANI) doped two-dimensional (2D) cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH/P) nanomaterials are being designed, and the formation of pores at low temperature (80 C) is developed. It is found that the optimized concentration of PANI creates the nanopores on the CoFe-LDH nanosheets among all other polymers. The well-ordered pores of CoFe-LDH/P allow the high accessibility of the redox-active sites and promote effective ion diffusion. The optimized CoFe-LDH/P2 cathode reveals a specific capacitance 1686 (1096 Cg-1 ) and 1200 Fg-1 (720 Cg-1 ) at 1 and 30 Ag-1 respectively, a high rate capability (71.2%), and a long cycle life (98% over 10000 cycles) for supercapcitor applications. Charge storage analysis suggested that the CoFe-LDH/P2 electrode displays like a capacitive-type storage mechanism (69% capacitive at 1 mVs-1 ). Moreover, an asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor (CoFe-LDH/P2//AC) was fabricated, delivering the excellent energy density (75.9 Wh kg-1 at 1124 W kg-1 ) with outstanding stability (97.5%) over 10000 cycles.

CA1 compares predictive synaptic signals from CA3 with synaptic signals from EC3, which reflect actual sensory inputs. The new CA1 pyramidal model presented here shows that the distal-proximal segregation of synaptic inputs from EC3 versus CA3, along with other biophysical features, enable such pyramids to serve as comparators that switch output encoding from a brief burst, for a match, to prolonged tonic spiking, for a mismatch. By including often-overlooked features of CA1 pyramidal neurons, this new model allows simulation of pharmacological effects that can eliminate either the match (phasic mode) response or the mismatch (tonic mode) response. These simulations reveal that dysfunctions can arise from either too much or too little ACh stimulation of the muscarinic receptors that control KCNQ channels. Additionally, a dysfunction caused by administration of an NMDA antagonist could be rescued by simultaneous administration of a KCNQ channel agonist, such as retigabine.","output":"Simulations reveal how M-currents and memory-based inputs from CA3 enable single neuron mismatch detection for EC3 inputs to the CA1 subfield of hippocampus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noncoding RNAs including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been documented to play prominent role in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD).

Compliance is essential for SCIT to obtain maximal benefit as it is a long-term treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the level of real-life SCIT compliance in pediatric patients and the associated factors. Additional aims were to determine how SCIT compliance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and why some patients dropped out SCIT. METHOD: Pediatric patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or venom allergy that received SCIT between September 2012 and July 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 201 children (66.7% male) with a median (interquartile range) age of 12.8 years (9.4C15.2) at the time of the first SCIT injection. The overall compliance rate before COVID-19 pandemic was 86.1%. Short SCIT follow-up time and venom anaphylaxis were found to be risk factors for drop out. The leading causes of drop outs were moving to another city/country (32.1%), symptom improvement (17.8%), treatment ineffectiveness (14.2%), and adverse reactions (14.2%). Among the 108 patients that were still receiving SCIT during the COVID-19 pandemic, 31 (28.7%) dropped out the therapy. The most frequent reasons for drop-out were fear of being infected with COVID-19 (35.4%) and thinking that the AIT practise stopped due to COVID-19 pandemic (29%). Male gender and older age were found to be the independent risk factors for drop-out of SCIT. CONCLUSIONS: Real life compliance in children was found 13.9% and it was higher than adults.

METHODS Clinical records from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2012 were reviewed and analyzed. Angiograms were used to calculate the percentage reduction in tumor vascularity, and relevant clinical and operative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients underwent preoperative spinal tumor embolization (24 metastatic and 13 primary lesions) and were included in the study. One complication resulted in transient lower extremity weakness and was attributed to post-embolization swelling, which fully resolved after surgical resection. The transient neurological complication rate was 1/37 (3%) and the permanent rate was 0/37 (0%). The average surgical estimated blood loss (EBL) was 1946 mL (100-7000 mL) and the average operative time was 330 min (range 164-841 min). After embolization, tumor blush was reduced by 83% on average. Average pre- and postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores were 2.10 and 1.36, respectively (p=0.03).

METHODS Arteries were assigned to one of three categories based on the degree of MRA diagnostic quality of vasospasm (quality score): 0, bad  2, good. Furthermore each artery was assigned to one of four categories based on the degree of vasospasm severity (SV score): 0, no vasospasm  3, severe. The value of the difference between DSA-SV score and MRA-SV score was defined as the DIF score. CMRA and SMRA were compared for each arterial region with regard to quality score and DIF score. RESULTS The average CMRA and SMRA quality score were 1.46 and 1.79; the difference was statistically significant. The average CMRA and SMRA DIF score were 1.08 and .60; the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm is more accurate by SMRA than by CMRA. The advantages are its noninvasive nature and its ability to detect cerebral vasospasm.","output":"Improvement of the diagnostic accuracy of MRA with subtraction technique in cerebral vasospasm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a respiratory disease with a case fatality rate of up to 35%. Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18-55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 185-300 kg/m2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1a??a??107 plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1a??a??108 PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-?3-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 FINDINGS: From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime-boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1-3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=086 [95% CI 06960-09427], p=00001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime-boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose-effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

In recent years, leading researchers on molecular farming have given more priority to the area of animal-free therapeutic proteins such as parenteral and oral vaccines. Although plant-based platforms have considerable advantages over traditional systems such as bacterial and animal systems, there are several obstacles to commercial-scale production, especially with regards to improving the quality and quantity of plant-produced biologics and industrial materials. One of the biggest barriers to commercialization of this technology is the intense scrutiny of these new plant varieties by regulatory agencies and the public as well as the high costs associated with their regulatory approval.","output":"Potential of plants to produce recombinant protein products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This evaluation describes efforts taken by MIECHV administrators and staff during the pandemic using data collected from 60 MIECHV staff surveys and nine statewide weekly focus groups. DESCRIPTION: The Florida Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Initiative funds perinatal home visiting for pregnant women and families with infants throughout the state. Florida MIECHV has shown resilience to disasters and times of crises in the past, while generating a culture of adaptation and continuous quality improvement among local implementing agencies. Florida MIECHV responded to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis within the first few days of the first reported case in Florida by providing guidance on virtual home visits and working remotely. ASSESSMENT: Findings highlight the role of administrative leadership and communication, staff willingness/morale, logistical considerations, and the needs of enrolled families who face hardships during the pandemic such as job loss, limited supplies, food insecurity, technology limitations, and stress. Home visitors support enrolled families by connecting them with resources, providing public health education and delivering evidence-based home visiting curricula virtually. They also recognized the emotional burden surrounding COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties along with achieving work-life balance by caring for their own children. CONCLUSION: This evaluation helped in understanding the impact of the pandemic on this maternal and child health program and fundamentals of transition to virtual home visiting services.

Additionally, immune cells from the central nervous system will acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype, protecting central functions from age-induced cognitive decline.

The primary effector mechanisms of the immune system leading to tissue destruction during EAE remain still controversial. T-cells, microglia, and macrophages infiltrating the brain parenchyma are suggested to be involved. To clarify the role of these cells during disease Lewis rats were immunised with different immunisation protocols: Immunisation with myelin basic protein (MBP) in complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) containing high dose of mycobacterial components induced severe disease, whereas immunisation with low dose of mycobacterial components induced only mild disease. Severely and mildly diseased animals were analysed with respect to infiltration of T-cells, macrophages and upregulation of MHC class II molecules on microglia in the brain. All immunised rats showed high T-cell infiltration accompanied by microglia activation. The degree of disease and the infiltration of macrophages varied with dose of adjuvant. Lowering the dose of adjuvant prevented the development of disease but also the influx of peripheral macrophages into the brain without affecting the peripheral T-cell response to the autoantigen. Thus, appearance of (autoreactive) T-cells in the brain and microglia activation were probably not sufficient for development of disease. It can be concluded that peripheral macrophages play an essential or even key role in the pathogenesis of active EAE.","output":"On the role of peripheral macrophages during active experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important diagnosis in critical care.

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINHAL, EMBASE, and web of science were searched from 2008 until November 2018. All terms related to VAP diagnostics in the intensive treatment unit were used to conduct the search. We adopted a checklist from the critical appraisal skills programme checklist for diagnostic studies to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: We identified 2441 records, of which 178 were selected for full-text review. Following methodological examination and quality assessment, 44 studies were included in narrative data synthesis. Thirty-two (72.7%) studies utilised a sole microbiological reference standard; the remaining 12 studies utilised a composite reference standard, nine of which included a mandatory microbiological criterion.

MPI1-9, GC376 and 11a all contain an aldehyde for the formation of a reversible covalent hemiacetal adduct with the MPro active site cysteine and 10-1, 10-2 and 10-3 contain a labile ester to exchange with the MPro active site cysteine for the formation of a thioester. Our data revealed that all these inhibitors are inert toward TMPRSS2 and furin. Diaryl esters also showed low inhibition of cathepsins. However, all aldehyde inhibitors displayed high potency in inhibiting three cathepsins. Their determined IC50 values vary from 4.1 to 380 nM for cathepsin B, 0.079 to 2.3 nM for cathepsin L, and 0.35 to 180 nM for cathepsin K. All aldehyde inhibitors showed similar inhibition levels toward cathepsin L. A cellular analysis indicated high potency of MPI5 and MPI8 in inhibiting lysosomal activity, which is probably attributed to their inhibition of cathepsins. Among all aldehyde inhibitors, MPI8 shows the best selectivity toward cathepsin L. With respect to cathepsins B and K, the selective indices are 192 and 150, respectively. MPI8 is the most potent compound among all aldehyde inhibitors in cellular MPro inhibition potency and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Vero E6 cells. Cathepsin L has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. By selectively inhibiting both SARS-CoV-2 MPro and the host cathepsin L, MPI8 potentiates dual inhibition effects to synergize its overall antiviral potency and efficacy.

Methods: A modified compartmental SEIR stochastic model was used to calculate peak cases at various levels of effectiveness of prevention of transmission. Health-care constraints were evaluated using a Delphi study. We developed \\"q-metric\\" to evaluate the epidemic. Key constraints were matched against scenarios generated, and a monitoring mechanism was devised. Results: Continuing lockdown (\\"q-metric\\" of >50) until mid-August was theoretically the most effective solution to end the epidemic. Lockdown might however be lifted earlier owing to various compulsions. The key constraints were identified as trained manpower and ventilators. It was estimated that shortfall of specialists to operate ventilators for COVID-19 intensive care units was approximately 40,000. This requires re-purposing of other specialists and short-term training to meet the surge. The shortage of ventilators is around 40,000-50,000. Procuring beyond those numbers would be infructuous owing to limits of training manpower. After lifting lockdown, the aim should be to contain the epidemic within the availability of key constraints.

Although TLR7 and TLR8 show a highly degree of sequence homology, their biological response to small molecule binding is very different. Aiming to understand the mechanism of selective profiles of small molecule modulators against TLR7 and TLR8, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations on three imidazoquinoline derivatives bound to the receptors separately. They are Resiquimod (R), Hybrid-2 (H), and Gardiquimod (G), selective agonists of TLR7 and TLR8. Our MD trajectories indicated that in the complex of TLR7-R and TLR7-G, the two chains forming the TLR7 dimer tended to remain open conformation, while the rest systems maintained in the closed format. The agonists R, H, and G developed conformational deviation mainly on the aliphatic tail. Furthermore, we attempted to quantify the selectivity between TLR7 and TLR8 by binding free energies via MM-GBSA method. It showed that the three selected modulators were more favorable for TLR7 than TLR8, and the ranking from the strongest to the weakest was H, R and G, aligning well with experiment data. In the TLR7, the flexible and hydrophobic aliphatic side chain of H has stronger van der Waals interactions with Val381 and Phe351 but only pick up interaction with one amino acid residue i.e. Tyr353 of TLR8. Unsurprisingly, the positively charged side chain of G has less favor interaction with Ile585 of TLR7 and Val573 of TLR8 explaining G is weak agonist in both TLR7 and TLR8. All three imidazoquinolines can form stable hydrogen bonds with Asp555 of TLR7 and the corresponding Asp543 of TLR8. In brief, the set of total 400ns MD studies sheds light on the potential selective mechanisms of agonists towards TLR7 and TLR8, indicating the van der Waals interaction as the driving force for the agonists binding, thus provides us insights for more potent and selective modulators to cooperate with the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket.","output":"Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the selectivity mechanism of structurally similar agonists to TLR7 and TLR8"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wanting and liking are both components of food reward, but they manifest in fundamentally different neural substrates.

Soft nature sounds and loud restaurant noises were employed to induce emotional relaxation and arousal respectively. One hundred and one healthy university students completed a repeated-measure design of the LFPQ; once with each soundscape playing in the background. Generalized linear mixed model analyses detected a significant interaction effect between soundscape and food type on choice frequency, yet the post hoc analyses did not reach significance.

This study was conducted to elucidate the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in the bacterial population in Thailand. Multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDR A. baumannii) isolates were characterized phenotypically, and the molecular epidemiology of clinical isolates in 11 tertiary hospitals was investigated at a country-wide level. METHODS: A total of 135 nonrepetitive MDR A. baumannii isolates collected from tertiary care hospitals across 5 regions of Thailand were examined for antibiotic susceptibility, resistance genes, and sequence types. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to characterize the spread of regional lineages. RESULTS: ST2 belonging to IC2 was the most dominant sequence type in Thailand (65.19%), and to a lesser extent, there was also evidence of the spread of ST164 (10.37%), ST129 (3.70%), ST16 (2.96%), ST98 (2.96%), ST25 (2.96%), ST215 (2.22%), ST338 (1.48%), and ST745 (1.48%). The novel sequence types ST1551, ST1552, ST1553, and ST1557 were also identified in this study. Among these, the blaoxa-23 gene was by far the most widespread in MDR A. baumannii, while the blaoxa-24/40 and blaoxa-58 genes appeared to be less dominant in this region. The results demonstrated that the predominant class D carbapenemase was blaOXA-23, followed by the class B carbapenemase blaNDM-like, while the mcr-1 gene was not observed in any isolate. Most of the MDR A. baumannii isolates were resistant to ceftazidime (99.23%), gentamicin (91.85%), amikacin (82.96%), and ciprofloxacin (97.78%), while all of them were resistant to carbapenems. The results suggested that colistin could still be effective against MDR A. baumannii in this region. CONCLUSION: This is the first molecular epidemiological analysis of MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates at the national level in Thailand to date.

To assess the effects of emergency remote teaching (ERT), we evaluated the expectations and, subsequently, the experiences of university students about online education. This study employed a simple prospective design as its method. We assessed the expectations of 1,904 students from different discipline areas (1,106 women and 798 men; age M = 21.56; SD = 3.07) during the beginning of the first semester, March 2020 (T1), and their experiences at the end of the same academic period, September 2020 (T2). We used convenience non-probability sampling. Participants responded to the questionnaire on Expectations toward virtual education in higher education for students and the questionnaire on virtual education experiences in higher education. The results showed that students responses reflected low expectations regarding peer relationships and comparison with face-to-face education (T1). This perception was maintained during the evaluation of experiences (T2). Students reported positive experiences regarding online teaching and learning, online assessment, and their self-efficacy beliefs at T2. Statistically significant differences between measurements were found, with the expertise presenting higher averages than expectations. Furthermore, differences by gender were identified, reporting a positive change in the scores of women. In addition, results reflected differences according to the disciplinary area, showing Social Sciences and Medical and Health Sciences students a more significant size effect.

However, few studies have explored its effect on the risk of hospital admission for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to analyze associations between mean temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR), temperature change between neighboring days (TCN), and daily admissions for RA from 2015 to 2019 in Anqing, China. Subgroup analyses based on age, gender, rheumatoid factors, and admission route were performed. In total, 1456 patients with RA were hospitalized. Regarding the cumulative-lag effects of extreme cold temperature (5th percentile = 3), the risks of admissions for RA were increased and highest at lag 0C11 (RR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.23C5.86). Exposing to low (5th percentile = 1.9) and high (95th percentile = 14.2) DTRs both had increased risks of RA admission, with highest RRs of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03C1.91) and 1.24 (95% CI: 1.0C1.53) at lag 0 day, respectively. As for TCN, the marginal risk of admission in RA patients was found when exposed to high TCN (95th percentile = 2.9) with the largest single-day effect at lag 10 (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01C1.23). In subgroup analyses, females were more susceptible to extreme cold temperature, low and high DTRs, and high TCN.

The present study evaluated the clinical and nutritional characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the relationship between nutritional risk at admission and in-hospital mortality. Methods: : A retrospective, observational study was conducted in two hospitals in Hubei, China. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were typed as mild/moderate, severe, or critically ill. Clinical data and in-hospital death were collected. Nutritional risk was assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) via objective parameters at admission. Results: : 295 patients were enrolled, including 66 severe patients and 41 critically ill patients. 25 deaths were observed, making 8.47% in the whole population and 37.88% in the critically ill subgroup. Patients had significant differences in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory biomarkers among three types of disease severity. Patients with lower GNRI and PNI score, as well as higher CONUT, had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated the good prognostic implication of GNRI and CONUT score. The multivariate logistic regression showed that baseline nutritional status, assessed by GNRI, PNI, or CONUT score, was a prognostic indicator for in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: : Despite variant assessment tools, poor nutritional status was associated with in-hospital death in patients infected with COVID-19.

RECENT FINDINGS The neurologic examination has served as the primary monitor for secondary brain injury in patients admitted to the neurocritical care unit. However, the International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care concluded that frequent bedside examinations are not sufficient to detect and prevent secondary brain injury and that integration of multimodality monitoring with advanced informatics tools will most likely enhance our assessments compared to the clinical examinations alone. This article reviews the invasive and noninvasive technologies used to monitor focal and global neurophysiologic cerebral alterations.

Both the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) and International Pediatric Endosurgery Group (IPEG) converted to a virtual format for their 2020 annual meetings. The purpose of this article is to review the successful implementation of the APSA and IPEG virtual meetings and reflect upon lessons learned for future virtual conferences. METHODS: Logistics, structure, and attendance statistics were reviewed. Informal interviews were conducted with key stakeholders and the number of presenters and participants were analyzed. Finally, post-meeting attendee surveys were conducted to elicit feedback after both virtual meetings. RESULTS: The meetings were organized in different ways, with APSA spreading a mix of scientific and clinical educational content over several months and IPEG keeping the meeting compressed, similar to previous in-person versions. Both meetings were free and therefore attracted a high proportion of participants (720 for APSA and 834 for IPEG). The meetings were felt to be educationally appropriate by most, although timing and lack of Continuing Medical Education (CME) opportunities were detractors. Most attendees said they would be willing to pay fees similar to in-person amounts. IPEG compressed presentations into four 2-hour sessions spread over 4 weeks, but also made material available on-line through a proprietary application. There was a broad range of international attendees. IPEG attracted a larger percentage of non-members than did APSA (3:1 nonmember to member ratio). Both societies reported net losses, largely due to lost registration revenue and non-refundable costs from having to switch from an in-person meeting. CONCLUSIONS: The main advantage of the virtual meeting was increased participation while disadvantages included the lack of networking. The key lessons learned from the meetings include methods to increase interactivity, adjustments of technical logistics, and creation of enduring material. In the future, hybrid conferences will likely become more prevalent with advantages of both platforms.

Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) is a histologic hallmark of CKD. Hematuria is a common symptom in many human kidney diseases. Free hemoglobin may affect tubular epithelial cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). EpithelialCmesenchymal transition (EMT) of the tubular epithelial cells has been shown to play an important role in the IFTA development. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic hematuria on the CKD progression in 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6NE) rat model of CKD. 5/6 NE rats were treated with oral warfarin (0.5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (control). The animals were monitored for 26 weeks, while prothrombin time (PT), serum creatinine (SCr), and hematuria were measured weekly. Staining for iron, trichrome, and EMT (vimentin, E-cadherin, smooth muscle actin) markers was performed on the remnant kidneys. ROS were detected in the kidneys by protein carbonyl assay and immunohistochemistry for heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), at the end of the study. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Warfarin treatment resulted in a PT increase 1.5C2.5 times from control and an increase in hematuria and SCr. Histologically, warfarin-treated animals had more iron-positive tubular epithelial cells and increased IFTA as compared to control (42.9  17% vs. 18.3  2.6%). ROS were increased in the kidney in warfarin-treated rats. The number of tubules that show evidence of EMT was significantly higher in warfarin-treated 5/6NE as compared to control 5/6NE rats. The number of apoptotic tubular epithelial cells was higher in warfarin-treated 5/6 NE rats. Chronic hematuria results in increased iron-positive tubular epithelial cells, EMT, apoptosis, and more prominent IFTA in CKD rats.

In France, a few people have downloaded and are using the StopCovid contact tracing app. Among them, students in the health domain are especially concerned. Exploring their usage and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people. OBJECTIVE: To investigate health-related students' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices about the StopCovid app. METHODS: A field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France, between September 25th and October 16th, 2020. Quota sampling method was used and descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it at the time of the survey. Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210). Among those who had not heard about the app, after a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (38/72) would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be a better communication (71.4%, 227/318).

While an equally stressed partner could plausibly amplify stress by making the situation seem more real and worthy of distress, we find that social validation during co-experienced stressors reduces reactivity. Specifically, the psychological experience of shared reality calms some people down. In Study 1, 70 undergraduate females who jointly faced a stressful event with someone else reported feeling less anxious when the other person felt the same way about the stressor, relative to when the other person appraised the situation in the opposite way or provided no indication of their appraisal. These findings were reflected in participants physiological reactivity, especially in the parasympathetic nervous system. In Study 2, we generalize these findings to co-experienced stressors in the daily lives of 102 heteronormative romantic couples in the New York City area. In line with tend-and-befriend theory, we found that shared reality during co-experienced stressors reduced anxiety for almost all females (99% of the sample) and for a minority of males (42% of the sample).

Several critical genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are specifically expressed in GT.

Here, we investigated and compared the landscape of chromatin accessibility in Artemisia annua leaf and GT using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) technique. We identified 5413 GT high accessible and 4045 GT low accessible regions, and these GT high accessible regions may contribute to GT-specific biological functions. Several GT-specific artemisinin biosynthetic genes, such as DBR2 and CYP71AV1, showed higher accessible regions in GT compared to that in leaf, implying that they might be regulated by chromatin accessibility. In addition, transcription factor binding motifs for MYB, bZIP, C2H2, and AP2 were overrepresented in the highly accessible chromatin regions associated with artemisinin biosynthetic genes in glandular trichomes. Finally, we proposed a working model illustrating the chromatin accessibility dynamics in regulating artemisinin biosynthetic gene expression.

The differences of above indexes in the two groups were compared and analyzed. In addition, 55 patients with other viral pneumonia were selected as the control group who admitted to the hospital from August 1 to November 30, 2019. The changes of laboratory indexes of COVID-19 group and control group were observed. RESULTS In the 215 patients, 206 patients survived and 9 patients died. The average age of survival group was significantly lower than that in the death group, and the average length of hospital stay was significantly longer than the death group. (1) Clinical features: the proportion of underlying diseases in the death group was significantly higher than that in the survival group, such as dyspnea, sore throat, shiver, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, renal disease, and surgical history. There were no significant differences in other symptoms, signs and underlying diseases between the two group.

Myocardial injury, caused directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be triggered by inflammatory processes that lead to damage to the heart tissue. Since one of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, strategies to control inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been considered.

WIN did not modify angiotensin-converting enzyme II protein levels, nor reduced viral infection and replication in hiPSC-CMs. On the other hand, WIN reduced the levels of interleukins six, eight, 18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) released by infected cells, and attenuated cytotoxic damage measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine the association between moral distress and the mental health of nurses working at four selected hospitals in Iran during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 296 nurses working at the selected hospitals in Bushehr and Shiraz (south of Iran) at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. The collected data were analyzed via logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The mean scores for nurses' moral distress were low (54.3124.84). The results of this study indicated more symptoms of mental issues among nurses (73.60%). Moreover, a significant association was observed between mental health and moral distress. Among the examined demographic variables, only gender had a significant association with mental health (p-value = 0.014). CONCLUSION The results of this study indicated that an increase in moral distress would lead to a significant increase in mental health issues of the examined nurses. Nurse managers and hospital policymakers should develop strategies to enhance nurses' level of mental health, as well as providing adequate emotional and family support for nurses. Considering the intensifying role of gender in this association, timely interventions are necessary to reduce the negative effects of workplace pressure/stress on female nurses.","output":"The association between moral distress and mental health among nurses working at selected hospitals in Iran during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate the influence of learners characteristics on their engagement during online education due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A recent study found that median levels of BACs in human blood have increased 174% during COVID from pre-COVID levels, with BACs being detected in 98% of blood samples. Although the parent BACs are not readily excreted into urine, we have identified several BAC metabolites in anonymous human urine samples. Formation of these metabolites requires -oxidation and oxidative C-C cleavage of BAC alkyl chains followed by -oxidation to produce a series of chain-shortened carboxylic acid (COOH) BAC metabolites. Here, we aim to elucidate the metabolic route(s) that can account for the observed urinary metabolites of BACs. Our approach includes LC-MS-based investigation of metabolite profiles in microsomes, hepatocytes, and recombinant CYPs in comparison with those observed in human urine. BACs of the alkyl chain lengths found in commercial mixtures (C12, C14, and C16) served as substrates. Authentic metabolite standards were synthesized and confirmed by NMR and LC-MS/MS. Selective CYP inhibitors were employed to assign specific CYP isoform contributions to metabolite formation. RESULTS As an extension of our previous work, we confirmed that NADPH-dependent -oxidation in microsomes and recombinant CYPs produced -OH and -COOH metabolites, as well as -1 oxidized products, of all BAC chain lengths. We further found that the responsible CYPs (2D6, 4F2, 4F11, and 4F12) are all capable of performing C-C cleavage of BAC side chains' terminal carbons. The resulting products were chain-shortened -COOH BACs having lost 1 or 2 carbons (-CH2 or -C2H4). In hepatocytes, subsequent -oxidation of the -COOH C10, C12, C14, and C16 BAC metabolites (having lost 0 or 2 carbons during CYP metabolism) produces a series of even-carbon -COOH products (C4, C6, and C8) given the successive 2 carbon removal (-C2H4) from the even-carbon starting chain lengths. Additionally, hepatocytes produce a series of odd-carbon -COOH products (C5, C7, and C9) that logically originate from -oxidation of -COOH C11, C13, and C15 BAC metabolites (having lost 1 carbon during CYP metabolism). The -COOH BAC metabolites produced in hepatocytes were the same as those detected in human urine samples, and the relative abundance among the various chain lengths of -COOH products was similar between human hepatocytes and urine. In most urine samples, C8, C10, and C12 were the most abundant COOH metabolites of even-carbon length, and C9 was most abundant among the odd-carbon series. In hepatocytes, addition of HET0016 and quinidine to inhibit CYP4F/CYP2D6 abolished all metabolite formation, including the -oxidation products. CONCLUSION The above data confirm that CYP4F and/or CYP2D6 are required to initiate BAC metabolism. The relative abundance of - and -oxidized products (-COOH BACs C4 - C16) observed in urine was consistent with the human cellular metabolism of BACs observed in hepatocytes. While parent BACs are commonly found in human blood, they are not readily excreted to urine. Thus, we propose to expand monitoring of human urine samples for chain-shortened -COOH BAC metabolites as a practical surrogate for assessing BAC exposure in the general population.","output":"Metabolism of Benzalkonium Chloride by CYP-Mediated -Oxidation and C-C Cleavage Followed by -Oxidation in Humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) not only affects the respiratory tract but also influence the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neurological symptoms such as loss of smell and taste. Growing literature indicates largely distributed brain alterations encompassing subcortical micro- and macro-bleeds, cerebral swelling and haemorrhage in gray and white matter tissue. A systematic review was performed to synthesise the potential evidence of the brain correlates of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using electronic databases for studies reporting neuroimaging abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Identified case series, cohort studies, and case control studies on SARS-CoV-2 effects on the brain were critically appraised for methodological quality. A narrative synthesis of the findings from the included studies is presented. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included in the review, including 5 case series, 8 cohort studies and 14 case control studies. The findings revealed predominant involvement of the olfactory system with disruptions across four olfactory structures. Abnormalities also extended to the corpus callosum, cingulate cortex, and insula, jointly implicating the olfactory brain network. CONCLUSION: Alterations in olfactory areas, along with neighbouring brain regions, including prefrontal and limbic regions were associated to contraction of SARS-CoV-2.

The present study analyzes outcomes of left main stenting versus coronary bypass grafting (CABG) in a nationwide registry in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). METHODS: All cases suffering from CCS and left main coronary artery disease treated either with CABG or stent, were identified within the database of the German bureau of statistics. Logistic or linear regression models were used with 20 baseline patient characteristics as potential confounders to compare both regimens. RESULTS: In 2018, 1318 cases with left main stenosis were treated with CABG and 8,920 with stent. Patients assigned for stenting were older (72.58  9.87 vs. 68.63  9.40, p < 0.001) and at higher operative risk, as assessed by logistic EuroSCORE (8.77  8.45 vs. 4.85  4.65, p < 0.001). After risk adjustment, no marked differences in outcomes were found for in-hospital mortality and stroke (risk adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for stent instead of CABG: aOR mortality: 1.08 [95% CI 0.66; 1.78], p = 0.748; aOR stroke: 0.59 [0.27; 1.32], p = 0.199). Stent implantation was associated with a reduced risk of relevant bleeding (aOR 0.38 [0.24; 0.61], p < 0.001), reduced prolonged ventilation time (aOR 0.54 [0.37 0.79], p = 0.002), and postoperative delirium (aOR 0.16 [0.11; 0.22], p < 0.001). Furthermore, stent implantation was associated with shorter hospital stay (? 6.78 days [? 5.86; ? 7.71], p < 0.001) and lower costs (? 10,035 [? 11,500; ? 8570], p < 0.001).

The exact role of EXOC6/6B in pancreatic -cell function and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) required further investigations. Herein, we showed that EXOC6/6B is associated with the risk of T2D and is essential to maintain the function of pancreatic -cell. Our study suggests that EXOC6/6B are crucial regulators for insulin secretion and for exocytosis machinery in -cells. ABSTRACT: EXOC6 and EXOC6B (EXOC6/6B) components of the exocyst complex are involved in the secretory granule docking. Recently, EXOC6/6B were anticipated as a molecular link between dysfunctional pancreatic islets and ciliated lung epithelium, making diabetic patients more prone to severe SARS-CoV-2 complications. However, the exact role of EXOC6/6B in pancreatic -cell function and risk of T2D is not fully understood. Herein, microarray and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) expression data demonstrated the expression of EXOC6/6B in human pancreatic islets. Expression of EXOC6/6B was not affected by diabetes status. Exploration of the using the translational human pancreatic islet genotype tissue-expression resource portal (TIGER) revealed three genetic variants (rs947591, rs2488071 and rs2488073) in the EXOC6 gene that were associated (p < 2.5  10(?20)) with the risk of T2D. Exoc6/6b silencing in rat pancreatic -cells (INS1-832/13) impaired insulin secretion, insulin content, exocytosis machinery and glucose uptake without cytotoxic effect. A significant decrease in the expression Ins1, Ins1, Pdx1, Glut2 and Vamp2 was observed in Exoc6/6b-silenced cells at the mRNA and protein levels. However, NeuroD1, Gck and InsR were not influenced compared to the negative control. In conclusion, our data propose that EXOC6/6B are crucial regulators for insulin secretion and exocytosis machinery in -cells. This study identified several genetic variants in EXOC6 associated with the risk of T2D. Therefore, EXOC6/6B could provide a new potential target for therapy development or early biomarkers for T2D.","output":"EXOC6 (Exocyst Complex Component 6) Is Associated with the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes and Pancreatic -Cell Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Onychophagia, commonly referred to as nailbiting is a chronic condition that is repetitive and compulsive in nature, and generally seen in both children and young adults.

Several viral proteins domain swap to increase their structural complexity or functional avidity. The main protease (M(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus proteolyzes viral polyproteins and has been a target for anti-SARS drug design. Domain swapping in the -helical C-terminal domain of M(pro) (M(pro)C) locks M(pro) into a hyperactive octameric form that is hypothesized to promote the early stages of viral replication. However, in the absence of a complete molecular understanding of the mechanism of domain swapping, investigations into the biological relevance of this octameric M(pro) have stalled. Isolated M(pro)C can exist as a monomer or a domain-swapped dimer. Here, we investigate the mechanism of domain swapping of M(pro)C using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations recapitulate several experimental features of M(pro)C folding. Further, we find that a contact between a tryptophan in the M(pro)C domain-swapping hinge and an arginine elsewhere forms early during folding, modulates the folding route, and promotes domain swapping to the native structure. An examination of the sequence and the structure of the tryptophan containing hinge loop shows that it has a propensity to form multiple secondary structures and contacts, indicating that it could be stabilized into either the monomer- or dimer-promoting conformations by mutations or ligand binding. Finally, because all residues in the tryptophan loop are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mutations that modulate domain swapping may provide insights into the role of octameric M(pro) in the early-stage viral replication of both viruses.","output":"The Molecular Mechanism of Domain Swapping of the C-Terminal Domain of the SARS-Coronavirus Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare the efficacy of pulsed-dose corticosteroids (250 mg methylprednisolone, 3 days) and tocilizumab in treating COVID-19-related hyperinflammation.

We examined the relation of serum LL-37 levels to the severity of bronchiolitis and viral etiology. Methods We performed a 17-center prospective cohort study in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis over 3 winters (2011-2014). Site teams collected clinical data, nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to test nasopharyngeal aspirates for 16 viruses. We tested serum for LL-37. Severity of bronchiolitis was defined by intensive care use and hospital length of stay. Viral etiology was defined as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or rhinovirus (RV), including coinfections with other viruses. Results The median age of the 1005 enrolled infants was 3 months (interquartile range, 2-6 months). After adjustment for 12 variables, LL-37 levels in the lowest quartile, compared with the highest, were associated both with intensive care use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.97; P = .01) and longer hospital stay (1.34; P < .001). In separate multivariable models, infants with LL-37 levels in the lowest 3 quartiles, compared with the highest, were more likely to have RSV (eg, aOR, 2.6 [lowest quartile]; P < .001 [all quartiles]).

We have previously shown that C57BL/6J (B6) mice lose their natural resistance to footpad infection with ectromelia virus (ECTV) due to impaired maturation and recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells to the draining popliteal lymph node (dLN). More recently, we have also shown that in young B6 mice infected with ECTV, the recruitment of NK cells is dependent on a complex cascade whereby migratory dendritic cells (mDCs) traffic from the skin to the dLN, where they produce CCL2 and CCL7 to recruit inflammatory monocytes (iMOs). In the dLN, mDCs also upregulate NKG2D ligands to induce interferon gamma (IFN\\\\) expression by group 1 innate lymphoid cells (G1\\\\ILCs), mostly NK in cells but also some ILC1. In response to the IFN\\\\, the incoming uninfected iMOs secret CXCL9 to recruit the critical NK cells. Here, we show that in aged B6 mice, the trafficking of mDCs to the dLN in response to ECTV is decreased, resulting in impaired IFN\\\\ expression by G1\\\\ILCs, reduced accumulation of iMOs, and attenuated CXCL9 production by iMOs, which likely contributes to decrease in NK cell recruitment. Together, these data indicate that defects in the mDC response to viral infection during aging result in a reduced innate immune response in the dLN and contribute to increased susceptibility to viral disease in the aged.","output":"Defective early innate immune response to ectromelia virus in the draining lymph nodes of aged mice due to impaired dendritic cell accumulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) demonstrate potential positive effects on reproduction.

Q-Griffithsin is produced at high titer in E. coli and purified to anticipated clinical grade without conventional chromatography or the need for any fixed downstream equipment. The process is thus both low-cost and highly flexible, facilitating low sales prices and agile modifications of production capacity, two key features for pandemic response. The simplicity of this process is enabled by a novel unit operation that integrates cellular autolysis, autohydrolysis of nucleic acids, and contaminant precipitation, giving essentially complete removal of host cell DNA as well as reducing host cell proteins and endotoxin by 3.6 and 2.4 log10 units, respectively. This unit operation can be performed rapidly and in the fermentation vessel, such that Q-GRFT is obtained with 100% yield and >99.9% purity immediately after fermentation and requires only a flow-through membrane chromatography step for further contaminant removal. Using this operation or variations of it may enable improved bioprocesses for a range of other high-value proteins in E. coli.

In order to explore the mechanism of reaction, we conducted a combined theoretical and experimental study on a one-pot conversion of styrene oxide, carbon dioxide, and aniline. In experiments, two isomer products, 3,5-diphenyl-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one and 3,4-diphenyl-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one, were observed. The computational results show that the parallel mechanism is more favored in thermodynamics and in kinetics due to the instability of isocyanate and hardness of its generation.

It also highlights some of the key lessons learned for the benefit of other agencies moving into supporting national health security efforts. RESULTS: The Itad team found strong evidence that the IHR Project is well aligned with, and responding to, partners capability strengthening needs and that the three workstreams C systems coordination, workforce development and technical systems strengthening are implementing relevant and appropriate action to support national priorities. The IHR Project is also aligned with and complementary to other relevant UK development assistance although the Project could strengthen the strategic collaboration with WHO, US CDC and other UK government projects in countries. The Itad team also found that the IHR Project could be more effective if the technical assistance activities were accompanied by relevant materials and equipment while maintaining its supportive role. There was evidence of where technical assistance in the form of training and follow-up mentoring had led to improvements in practice and in IHR compliance, but these were not being systematically captured by the Projects routine reporting.

Data show that females are more likely to be a victim of abuse and violence than males (20% vs. 5C10%). Such abuses lead to long-term psychophysical and relational consequences and victims are often afraid of asking for support from both parents and professionals. This case report shows the story of a 17-year-old adolescent, Sara, involved by her mother in a strategic counseling process, to solve BDSM-type sexual addiction (slavery and discipline, domination and submission, sadism and masochism), self-aggressive behavior, and alcohol abuse issues. The strategic counseling process is structured in 15 sessions and was based on problem-solving techniques and corrective behavioral strategies. During the sessions, it emerged that Sara had been a victim of sexual violence at the age of 6 and that she had never talked about the rape with anyone. At the age of 12, she began to experience social anxiety and shame, feelings that led her to use alcohol and seek violent sexual partners and bondage relationships. During the counseling sessions, Sara elaborated on her trauma, becoming more aware of her resources and her desires, and she learned to manage the sense of guilt and shame associated with the violence suffered, through alternative strategies. At the end of the process, Sara normalized her relationship with sex and alcohol, regaining her identity.","output":"Sexual Violence and Trauma in Childhood: A Case Report Based on Strategic Counseling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological drugs generated via recombinant techniques are uniquely positioned due to their high potency and high selectivity of action.

Primary care COVID patients in West London deemed medium risk were recruited into the virtual ward. Patients were monitored for 14 days by telephone or by both the Huma app and telephone. Information on number of phone calls, duration of phone calls and duration of time spent reviewing the app data was recorded. RESULTS: The amount of time spent reviewing one patient in the telephone only arm of the study was 490 min, compared with 280 min spent reviewing one patient who was monitored via both the Huma app and telephone. Based on employed clinicians monitoring patients, this equates to a 0.04 reduction of full-time equivalent staffing I.e. for every 100 patients, it would require 4 less personnel to remotely monitor them.

METHODS: Based on a list of institutional actors that participated in the national conference Future Forum Public Health (Zukunftsforum Public Health) and a targeted online search by the authors, supra-regional institutions and organizations with a public health focus were identified. All actors were screened independently by  2 authors. Community-level actors as well as those without a direct public health focus were excluded. Additional actors were identified via a snowballing process. In order to cluster the actors thematically, a category system was formed inductively. RESULTS: Out of a total of 645 screened actors, 307 (47.6%) were included and subsequently assigned to 12 main and 30 subcategories. Professional associations (n = 60) made up the largest category, followed by civil society (n = 49) and state actors (n = 40).

Social cognition research illustrates four phases of response to these challenges. First, the Cognitive Miser approach introduced methods less prone to experimenter or participant interference: looking time as attention, categorical memory for who said what. Next, the Motivated Tactician approach addressed replicability by identifying moderator variables, primarily goals and motivations. For example, interdependence (Fiske) and threat (Taylor) are prominent motivations in our respective research. The third wave, perceivers as Activated Actors, translated mental states to behavior, using theory-guided prediction. In intergroup bias, for example, Fiske's Stereotype Content Model predicts patterns of discriminatory behavior distinctive to each combination of stereotypic warmth and competence. Going beyond reported behavior, distinctive activations emerged in brain-imaging and muscle responses. In health psychology, Taylor's Positive Illusions theory predicts people cope with life-threatening illness by viewing the odds optimistically, the self positively, and possible control affirmatively. Again, the social cognitive processes interplay with psycho-physiology. Recently, social cognitive approaches have increasingly addressed inequality: health disparities, bias interventions, power dynamics, class effects, social morality, and intent inferences.

Currently, over three million people have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection but SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) via the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 by antibody would cause a directly neutralizing effect against virus. In the current study, we selected the ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the targeting epitope for neutralizing antibody screening. We performed site-directed screening by phage display and finally obtained one IgG antibody (4A3) and several domain antibodies. Among them, 4A3 and three domain antibodies (4A12, 4D5, and 4A10) were identified to act as neutralizing antibodies due to their capabilities to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-positive cells. The domain antibody 4A12 was predicted to have the best accessibility to all three ACE2-interfaces on the spike homotrimer. Pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays showed that all four antibodies could potently protect host cells from virus infection.

Methods: Using samples from NADIM clinical trial (NCT03081689), in which resectable stage IIIA NSCLC patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with nivolumab, we have evaluated the capacity of ctDNA levels before treatment initiation to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by calculating Harrells C-statistic and we compare its predictive value with classical survival surrogates as the pathological response and clinical response assessed according to RECIST criteria v.1.1. The ctDNA was analyzed by NGS, using the Oncomine Pan-Cancer Cell-Free Assay? (Thermo Fisher Scientific?). To explore the prognostic value of the amount of ctDNA at baseline, for each positive plasma sample, we calculated the sum of the mutant allele frequency (MAF) for all detected mutations. Patients who died from COVID19 were excluded from this analysis. Results: In our study, clinical responses based on RECIST criteria were not predictive for OS or PFS. On the contrary, in the multivariate analysis, patients with low ctDNA levels (<1% MAF), in the baseline sample, had significantly improved PFS and OS than patients in whom the opposite situation occurred (adjusted HR: 0.22;95%CI: 0.06-0.75;P=0.016 and adjusted HR: 0.04;95%CI: 0.00-0.45;P=0.008 for PFS and OS, respectively).

We collected convalescent plasma from donors with high titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies effectively blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In a randomized clinical trial of 86 COVID-19 patients, no overall clinical benefit of 300 mL convalescent plasma was found in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Using a comprehensive translational approach, we unraveled the virological and immunological responses following plasma treatment which helps to understand which COVID-19 patients may benefit from this therapy and should be the focus of future studies. Convalescent plasma treatment in this patient group did not improve survival, had no effect on the clinical course of disease, nor did plasma enhance viral clearance in the respiratory tract, influence anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody development or serum proinflammatory cytokines levels. The vast majority of patients already had potent neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at hospital admission and at comparable titers as the carefully selected plasma donors.

We describe the rapid deployment of remotely delivered mind-body services to people with cancer during COVID-19, rates of participation, and acceptability from patients' perspectives. METHODS: Eligible participants were patients with cancer age &#8805; 18 years enrolled in a single academic cancer center's online patient portal. Interventions included mind-body group therapy sessions in fitness, meditation, yoga, dance, tai chi, and music delivered using Zoom video conferencing. Sessions were 30-45 min and led by an integrative medicine clinician. Following each session, participants were asked to complete a three-item questionnaire assessing (1) satisfaction with the class session, (2) reduction in stress/anxiety, and (3) likelihood of recommending the class to others. Patients could also provide comments in real-time using the Zoom chat function. RESULTS: Among 5948 unique visits, the most frequently attended classes were fitness (n = 2513, 42.2%) followed by meditation (n = 1176, 19.8%) and yoga (n = 909, 15.3%). Of these visits, 3902 (65.6%) had an associated completed questionnaire. Across class types, a large majority of participants reported being extremely satisfied (n = 3733, 95.7%), experiencing extreme reductions in anxiety/stress (n = 3268, 83.8%), and being extremely likely to recommend the class to others (n = 3605, 92.4%). Fitness had the highest endorsement among class types (all p values < 0.001). Themes from the chat responses included gratitude, expressions of helpfulness, and feelings of connection. CONCLUSION: High utilization of and satisfaction with these virtual mind-body services demonstrate the significant potential of remote delivery to facilitate patient access to services.","output":"Rapid deployment of virtual mind-body interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak: feasibility, acceptability, and implications for future care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped non-segmented negative sense RNA virus that belongs to Orthopneumovirus genus of the Pneumoviridae family in the order Mononegavirales.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has endured a significant burden of zoonotic disease impacts. To address zoonotic disease threats in ECOWAS, a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) was conducted over five days in December 2018 to prioritize zoonotic diseases of greatest regional concern and develop next steps for addressing these priority zoonoses through a regional, multisectoral, One Health approach. METHODS: The OHZDP Process uses a mixed methods prioritization process developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the OHZDP workshop, representatives from human, animal, and environmental health ministries from all 15 ECOWAS Member States used a transparent and equal process to prioritize endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases of greatest regional concern that should be jointly addressed by One Health ministries and other partners. After the priority zoonotic diseases were identified, participants discussed recommendations and further regional actions to address the priority zoonoses and advance One Health in the region. RESULTS: ECOWAS Member States agreed upon a list of seven priority zoonotic diseases for the region C Anthrax, Rabies, Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (for example, Marburg fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever), zoonotic influenzas, zoonotic tuberculosis, Trypanosomiasis, and Yellow fever. Participants developed recommendations and further regional actions that could be taken, using a One Health approach to address the priority zoonotic diseases in thematic areas including One Health collaboration and coordination, surveillance and laboratory, response and preparedness, prevention and control, workforce development, and research. CONCLUSIONS: ECOWAS was the first region to use the OHZDP Process to prioritize zoonotic disease of greatest concern. With identified priority zoonotic diseases for the region, ECOWAS Member States can collaborate more effectively to address zoonotic diseases threats across the region using a One Health approach. Strengthening national and regional level multisectoral, One Health Coordination Mechanisms will allow ECOWAS Member States to advance One Health and have the biggest impact on improving health outcomes for both people and animals living in a shared environment.","output":"Prioritizing zoonotic diseases using a multisectoral, One Health approach for The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute and chronic wound infection has become a major worldwide healthcare burden leading to significantly high morbidity and mortality.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate individuals' health anxiety and emotion regulation during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to some variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between emotion regulation and health anxiety. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was conducted on 874 individuals reached online through the google e-forms. The participants were administered the \\"Health Anxiety Scale and Emotion Regulation Scale\\" to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, Mann- Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Spearman Correlation Coefficient were used. RESULTS In the current study, healthy anxiety scores of the participants were analyzed depending on some variables. Health anxiety was found to be higher in women, 18-30 age group, singles, students, and groups with physical and mental health problems. The research also found that there is a low and negative relationship between health anxiety and cognitive reappraisal. It is understood that men's suppression scores are higher than women. There is no significant difference between suppressing emotions and health anxiety. It was found that educators received the highest scores in terms of cognitive reappraisal. The cognitive reappraisal level of the group without mental disorder was found to be higher than the other group. CONCLUSION According to the results of the research, more supportive services should be provided for the groups with the higher health anxiety. Considering that especially students and young people are affected more, it can be said that mental health preventive services should be included more in these groups. At the same time, the fact that men have higher emotion suppression scores than women shows that this situation should also be taken into consideration in mental health services.","output":"Health Anxiety and Emotion Regulation during the Period of COVID-19 Outbreak in Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, an infectious respiratory disease, is a global health crisis and severely taxed healthcare systems.

The goal of management strategies is to improve arterial oxygenation, however each management strategy presents risk to patients from iatrogenic injury. Intravenous oxygen therapeutics present an appealing option to improve arterial oxygenation without these risks. We used a two-hit murine model of acute lung injury to evaluate the effect of intravenous dodecafluoropentane (NanO2) on oxygen saturation and bronchoalveolar lavage cell count and protein. Mice were given intratracheal lipopolysaccharide and 20 hours later were intubated and ventilated with high tidal volumes. NanO2 was given by bolus injection at the initiation of mechanical ventilation and again at 2 hours, while oxygen saturation was measured every 15 minutes. At the conclusion of the experiment (4 hours), a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. There was no difference in mean O2 saturation at time zero, however the difference between the mean O2 saturation immediately prior to injection and the mean first O2 saturation after injection in the control saline group were 91% and 83%, mean difference ?7.5%; whereas mean O2 saturation in the NanO2 treated group rose from 89% to 91%, mean difference +2.5%, net difference 10% [95% CI: 2.7,17.3], p=0.01). There was a statistically significant difference in cell count, but not protein, on the bronchoalveolar lavage analysis.

On the global scale, there is a general lack of consensus on how maternal care quality is defined, conceptualized, and measured. Much of the literature addressing this problem has focused primarily on defining, conceptualizing, and measuring clinical indicators of maternal care quality. Less attention has been given in this regard to perceived maternal care quality among women which is known to influence care utilization and adherence. Therefore, there is a need to map the literature focused on defining, conceptualizing, and measuring perceived maternal care quality across low-, middle-, and high-income country contexts. METHODS: This scoping review protocol will follow the Arksey and OMalley methodological framework. A comprehensive search strategy will be used to search for articles published from inception to 2020 in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and WHO Global Index Medicus. Gray literature will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen articles by title and abstract, then by full-text based on pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A third reviewer will arbitrate any discrepancies. This protocol outlines a four-step analytic approach that includes numerical, graphical, tabular, and narrative summaries to provide a comprehensive description of the body of literature. DISCUSSION: The findings from this scoping review will provide a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on perceived maternal care quality. The findings are expected to inform future work on building consensus around the definition and conceptualization of perceived maternal care quality, and lay the groundwork for future research aimed at developing measures of perceived maternal care quality that can be applied across country contexts.

The relative percentage of the CD8 + effector memory subset was increased in both convalescent moderate and severe cases, but NKT-CD160 and marginal zone B clusters were decreased. Innate immune responses were attenuated reflected by decreased expression of genes involved in interferon-gamma, leukocyte migration and neutrophil mediated immune response in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Functions of T cell were strengthened in convalescent COVID-19 patients by clear endorsement of increased expression of genes involved in biological processes of regulation of T cell activation, differentiation and cellCcell adhesion. In addition, T cell mediated immune responses were enhanced with remarkable clonal expansions of TCR and increased transition of CD4 + effector memory and CD8 + effector-GNLY in severe subjects. B cell immune responses displayed complicated and dual functions during convalescence of COVID-19, providing a novel mechanism that B cell activation was observed especially in moderate while humoral immune response was weakened. Interestingly, HLA class I genes displayed downregulation while HLA class II genes upregulation in both T and B cell subsets in convalescent individuals.

PATIENT(S): 1,347 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 positive results registered consecutively between February 26 and November 5, 2020. INTERVENTION(S): The patients' information was collected from their medical records, and multivariable regression analyses were performed, controlling for maternal age and the clinical presentation of the infection.

RESULT(S): The IVF group included 74 (5.5%) women whereas the spontaneous pregnancy group included 1,275 (94.5%) women. The operative delivery rate was high in all patients, especially in the IVF group, where cesarean section became the most frequent method of delivery (55.4%, compared with 26.1% of the spontaneous pregnancy group).

There were 19 (4.4%), 53 (12.3%), 140 (32.5%) and 209 (50.8%) patients with ANC count <200, 200C500, 501C1000 and 1001C1500  109 cells/L, respectively. Severe neutropenia (<500 109/L) was recorded in 72 (16.7%) patients. Fever >380C was present in 208/431 (48.3%) patients. Blood cultures were positive in 10 (2.3%), with Brucella melitensis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter spp. identified in 4, 3 and 2 patients, respectively; 5/10 patients with positive blood cultures were < 3 months of age. Overall, 55/431 (12.7%) and 65/431 (15.1%) patients were diagnosed with SBIs and bacterial infections, respectively. Nasal washings-PCR for respiratory viruses was positive in 139/293 (47.4%) patients tested. An infectious etiology (bacterial and/or viral) was diagnosed in 190/431 (44.1%) patients. Three patients were diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Resolution of neutropenia was achieved in 111/208 (53.4%) evaluable patients (63%, 50.6% and 48% of patients aged 0C3, 4C12 and >12 months, respectively and 56.8%, 53.5% and 52% of patients with severe, moderate and mild neutropenia, respectively). Conclusions Acute neutropenia is common in immunocompetent children < 2 years of age and is frequently associated with viral infections. We showed a substantial involvement of bacterial infections and particularly SBIs in the etiology of acute neutropenia. After a 1-month follow-up, resolution of neutropenia occurred in half of the patients, without association with age subgroups and with neutropenia severity.","output":"The Etiologic, Microbiologic, Clinical and Outcome Characteristics of Immunocompetent Young Children < 2 Years of Age Hospitalized with Acute Neutropenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperkalemia has been associated with cardiac abnormalities and muscular disorders.

Since there is no universal definition of the term clinical academic, and clinical academic roles are estimated to make up less than 0.1% of the workforce, the aim of this study was to determine whether consultants, advanced practitioners and their managers consider these to be clinical academic roles. If so, this could potentially increase the critical mass of this important cadre of the workforce, raise the profile of advanced and expert practice, and help legitimise the scholarly component of the role. Methods: The study design was a national survey of consultants, advanced practitioners and managers of these roles, at band 7 or above and practising in the UK. This convenience sample was recruited via social media (Twitter) in MarchCApril 2021 (during the COVID pandemic), with a link to the survey (in Google Forms), and weekly reminders. To ensure face and content validity, the survey content was derived from an earlier post by the senior author seeking definitions of the term clinical academic (that generated 25 replies, 61 retweets and 112 likes) and was piloted with 3 clinical academic consultants and advanced practitioners prior to data collection. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis of the open questions. Results: Of the 56 responses, 28.6% (n = 16) were from consultants;58.9% (n = 33) advanced practitioners;10.7% (n = 6) combined manager and consultant/advanced practitioner;and 1.8% (n = 1) manager. The majority of respondents (78.6%, n = 44) were allied health professionals, including 50% (n = 28) physiotherapists, and 80.4% (n = 45) of participants identified as female and 85.7% (n = 48) as white. Forty-nine respondents (87.5%) reported direct patient contact, with their own clinical caseload, and the most prevalent clinical settings were: secondary care (60.7%);tertiary care (23.2%);higher education (17.9%);primary care (12.5%) and community (10.7%). When considering whether consultants should be considered clinical academics, 35.7% (n = 20) answered yes;46.4% (n = 26) possibly;and 16.1% (n = 9) no. Meanwhile the responses considering whether advanced practitioners should be clinical academics were: 17.9% (n = 10) yes;62.5% (n = 35) possibly;and 16.1% (n = 9) no. A plethora of open comments justified these responses. Conclusion(s): Whilst twice as many respondents considered consultants to be clinical academics compared with advanced practitioners, participants most-commonly favoured the option of possibly, with a minority rejecting this notion. As practice evolves, consultants and advanced practitioners must contribute to developing the evidence-base for the profession, and are ideally placed to identify clinically-important research questions. Further work needs to be done to support clinicians to prioritise and deliver the research pillar in their roles. Impact: The shortage of clinical academic healthcare staff will inevitably limit the development of the evidence needed to improve patients outcomes and service delivery. As practice evolves, it is vital to understand the term clinical academic and determine whether consultants and advanced practitioners are included in this group, to promote and legitimise the research component of these roles.

General practices are responsible for assessing most ambulatory patients. However, they face several challenges managing COVID-19 patients and those with non-COVID-19 conditions. To support general practices and early identify severe courses, in April 2020 we designed a software tool for the structured surveillance of high-risk home-quarantined COVID-19 patients in general practice (CovidCare) including several telephone monitorings. This study presents the qualitative results of a mixed-methods process evaluation study on CovidCare. Methods: In a qualitative process evaluation study conducted between March and May 2021, we explored the perspectives of seven general practitioners (GPs) and twelve VERAHs (medical care assistants with special training) on CovidCare using semi-structured interviews based on the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance). We used deductive qualitative content analysis employing the RE-AIM framework to assess the utilization and implementation of CovidCare. Results: Overall, most health care professionals were satisfied with CovidCare. They highlighted 1) a good orientation for the management of COVID-19 patients especially due to a high level of uncertainty at the beginning of the pandemic, 2) the possibility to gain new knowledge and 3) the structured data collection as facilitators for the implementation of CovidCare. Moreover, CovidCare reduced the workload for GPs while some VERAHs perceived a higher workload as they were responsible for large parts of the CovidCare management. However, CovidCare positively affected the VERAHs job satisfaction as most patients provided positive feedback and felt less anxious about coping with their disease. Previous experience with the software and an easy integration into daily practice were considered to be crucial utilisation drivers. Time and personnel resources were identified as main barriers. Participants suggested a less comprehensive version of CovidCare, the expansion of inclusion criteria as well as an app for the patients self-management to further improve CovidCare. Conclusion: The COVID-19 surveillance and care tool for COVID-19 patients with increased risk was perceived as useful by GPs and VERAHs. Supportive remote health care tools such as CovidCare are a viable means to maintain a comprehensive and continuous health care during a pandemic and may strengthen the primary care system.

Coagulopathy is reflective of more severe disease and anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalized patients. However, the prevalence of thrombosis on the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unclear, including whether this is sufficiently addressed by conventional anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We aimed to identify the rate of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19, to inform recommendations for diagnosis and management. A systematic review was conducted to assess the incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19. Observational studies and registries reporting thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients were included. Information extracted included patient demographics, use of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation, method of identifying thrombotic complications, and reported patient outcomes. In 28 studies including 2928 patients, thrombotic complications occurred in 34% of ICU-managed patients, with deep venous thrombosis reported in 16.1% and pulmonary embolism in 12.6% of patients, despite anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, and were associated with high mortality. Studies adopting systematic screening for venous thrombosis with Duplex ultrasound reported a significantly higher incidence of venous thrombosis compared to those relying on clinical suspicion (56.3% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). Despite thromboprophylaxis, there is a very high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 on the ICU. Systematic screening identifies many thrombotic complications that would be missed by relying on clinical suspicion and should be employed, with consideration given to increased dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, whilst awaiting results of prospective trials of anticoagulation in this cohort.","output":"Thrombotic complications in 2928 patients with COVID-19 treated in intensive care: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have made it possible to reliably produce automatic transcripts of clinician-patient conversations.

Human OSCC CAL-27 cells were randomly divided into four groups: control group, HMME group, laser group, and HMME-PDT group. Cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 method. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry. GEO database was used to screen differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs), and TCGA database was performed to verify DEM expression in OSCC and normal tissues. The effects of HMME-PDT on DEM expression were assayed by real-time PCR, and the expressions of miRNAs target genes were measured by western blot. Fluorescence probes were used to determine the production of singlet oxygen (1O2). Compared with the other three groups, HMME-PDT dramatically inhibited CAL-27 cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cycle arrest. The expressions of miR-21 and miR-155 were significantly upregulated in OSCC. HMME-PDT downregulated the expression of miR-21 but had no obvious effect on miR-155. HMME-PDT remarkably upregulated the levels of P53 and miR-21 target proteins, such as PDCD4, RECK, and SPRY2. 1O2 was generated during HMME-PDT, and inhibition of 1O2 production could reverse the regulation of HMME-PDT on P53, miR-21, and its target proteins, thus restoring cell viability. HMME-PDT can significantly inhibit the growth of OSCC cells, and the mechanism of this effect is related to the regulation of the P53-miR-21-PDCD4 axis via 1O2 induced by HMME-PDT.","output":"Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether mediated photodynamic therapy inhibits oral squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the P53-miR-21-PDCD4 axis via singlet oxygen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pachynomidae is a poorly known heteropteran group currently considered as a distinct family closely related to Reduviidae.

De Ritis ratio is also known as Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio. The main outcome was poor prognosis, a composite of mortality, severity, the need for ICU care, and intubation. The effect measure was odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences. We generated sensitivity and specificity, negative and positive likelihood ratio (NLR and PLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under curve (AUC). Results: There were eight studies with 4,606 patients. De Ritis ratio was elevated in 44% of the patients. Patients with poor prognosis have higher De Ritis ratio [mean difference 0.41 (0.31, 0.50), p < 0.001;I2: 81.0%] and subgroup analysis showed that non-survivors also have higher De Ritis Ratio [mean difference 0.47 (0.46, 0.48), p < 0.001;I2: 0%].

Here we describe an alternative approach using exosomes, the only biologically normal nanovesicle. In contrast to LNPs, which elicited pronounced cellular toxicity, exosomes had no adverse effects in vitro or in vivo at any dose tested. Moreover, mRNA-loaded exosomes were characterized by efficient mRNA encapsulation (90%), high mRNA content, consistent size, and a polydispersity index under 0.2. Using an mRNA encoding the red light-emitting luciferase Antares2, we observed that mRNA-loaded exosomes were superior to mRNA-loaded LNPs at delivering functional mRNA into human cells in vitro. Injection of Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes also led to strong light emission following injection into the vitreous fluid of the eye or into the tissue of skeletal muscle in mice. Furthermore, we show that repeated injection of Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes drove sustained luciferase expression across six injections spanning at least 10 weeks, without evidence of signal attenuation or adverse injection site responses. Consistent with these findings, we observed that exosomes loaded with mRNAs encoding immunogenic forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins induced long-lasting cellular and humoral responses to both.

Such circumstances can present as clusters of poisonings, including severe toxicity and death following exposure to unexpected illicit substances.

METHODS The Prescription, Recreational and Illicit Substance Evaluation (PRISE) program established by the New South Wales Ministry of Health includes State-based hospital toxicology services, Poisons Information Centre, Forensic & Analytical Science Service and emergency services to identify clusters of severe and unusual toxicity associated with substance use. PRISE criteria include a known cluster (geographically or situationally related) of people with acute severe toxicity, especially when accompanied by a toxidrome that is inconsistent with the history of exposure. A timely comprehensive drug screen and quantification is performed in eligible cases and the results are related to the clinical features. The need for a public health response is then considered. Four individuals inhaled a white powder that was sold as cocaine and developed severe toxicity that was not consistent with cocaine which prompted transfer to hospital for further management. RESULTS LSD was confirmed in four subjects, and the concentrations in 3 of the individuals were 0.04-0.06 mg/L which are among the highest reported in the literature. Common clinical features were hallucinations, agitation, vomiting, sedation, hypertension, and mydriasis. One subject required intubation and admission to the intensive care unit, two required overnight admission, and the fourth was discharged following oral diazepam after observation. No subject suffered persistent injury.

However, little is known about the characteristics of care planning among Chinese ageing families. It is also of interest to reflect how recent events such as COVID-19 pandemic may affect their views of the future care planning. From a family systems perspective, this study explored the extent, processes, and contents of intergenerational care planning of Chinese ageing families in Hong Kong. Dyadic interviews were conducted with 60 adult child-older parent pairs, and individual interviews were conducted with another 33 adult children. Intergenerational discrepancies in extent and processes of care planning, intergenerational congruence of care expectations and struggles, facilitating role of family capital and hindering role of cultural capital in care planning were primary themes. Although both generations demonstrated strong awareness of future eldercare needs, they were found engaged in different levels and processes of care planning. Adult childrens level of engagement in planning activities may influence parents extent and contents of care planning. Intergenerational transmission of eldercare values contributed to intergenerational congruence of care expectations but also led to similar struggles and ambivalent attitudes toward future care. Moreover, family capital was found to facilitate family care planning while Chinese cultural values that emphasize family care may hinder both generations efforts in care planning. The findings will deepen our understanding on characteristics of intergenerational care planning in Asian Chinese communities and inform services to improve adult children and ageing parents preparation for future eldercare.","output":"Future Eldercare Planning Among Chinese Aging Families in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preparedness for mass casualty events is essential at local, national and global levels.

This study investigated the temporal progression of clinical variables of in-hospital liver injury in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: COVID-19 patients (n = 1361) were divided into no, mild and severe liver injury (nLI, mLI and sLI) groups. Time courses of laboratory variables were time-locked to liver-injury onset defined by alanine aminotransferase level. Predictors of liver injury were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of mLI was 39.4% and sLI was 9.2%. Patients with escalated care had higher prevalence of sLI (23.2% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.05). sLI developed 9.4 days after hospitalization. sLI group used more invasive ventilation, anticoagulants, steroids, and dialysis (p < 0.05). sLI, but not mLI, had higher adjusted mortality odds ratio (= 1.37 [95% CI 1.10, 1.70], p = 0.005). Time courses of the clinical variables of the sLI group differed from those of the nLI and mLI group. In the sLI group, alanine aminotransferase, procalcitonin, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase showed similar temporal profiles, whereas white-blood-cell count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, respiration and heart rate were elevated early on, and lymphocyte and SpO2 were lower early on. The top predictors of sLI were alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, respiration rate, ferritin, and lymphocyte, yielding an AUC of 0.98, 0.92, 0.88 and 0.84 at 0, ? 1, ? 2 and ? 3 days prior to onset, respectively.

Inflammasomes activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with COVID-19 severity. Here, we show a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation. N protein facilitates maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and induces proinflammatory responses in cultured cells and mice. Mechanistically, N protein interacts directly with NLRP3 protein, promotes the binding of NLRP3 with ASC, and facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. More importantly, N protein aggravates lung injury, accelerates death in sepsis and acute inflammation mouse models, and promotes IL-1 and IL-6 activation in mice. Notably, N-induced lung injury and cytokine production are blocked by MCC950 (a specific inhibitor of NLRP3) and Ac-YVAD-cmk (an inhibitor of caspase-1). Therefore, this study reveals a distinct mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induces excessive inflammatory responses.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread escalating the situation to an international pandemic.

The research site was traced for two years to monitor the evolution of the proposed model during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The successive independent samples data (in 2020 and 2021, respectively) were collected in Shizhu county, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used with a survey of 1,472 wellness tourists (N-2020 = 494, N-2021 = 978) to test research hypotheses empirically. Additionally, independent sample t-test and multi-group SEM analysis were used to compare the mean difference of variables and coefficients' difference between 2020 and 2021. Findings This study reveals that REWT can increase self-perceived health, resulting in a positive influence on place attachment. By tracing the research site and comparing the successive independent samples data, we found a stronger recovery experience effect of wellness tourism on place attachment alongside a weaker effect on self-perceived health in 2021. The positive relationship between self-perceived health and place attachment is significantly strengthened when health goals are salient.

High levels of autonomy, clear strategies, complimentary route networks, appropriate resources and minimal cannibalisation are identified as the primary attributes required for a successful AWA operation. Legacy airlines whose AWA strategy failed in the past often did not operate with all these essential attributes, which resulted in their AWAs undermining and competing directly with their own operations.","output":"Review of Airline-within-Airline strategy: Case studies of the Singapore Airlines Group and Qantas Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The direct laryngoscopy technique using a Macintosh blade is the first choice globally for most anaesthetists. In case of an unanticipated difficult airway, the complication rate increases with the number of intubation attempts. Recently, McGrath MAC (McGrath) video laryngoscopy has become a widely accepted method for securing an airway by tracheal intubation because it allows the visualisation of the glottis without a direct line of sight. Several studies and case reports have highlighted the benefit of the video laryngoscope in the visualisation of the glottis and found it to be superior in difficult intubation situations. The aim of this study was to compare the first-pass intubation success rate using the (McGrath) video laryngoscope compared with conventional direct laryngoscopy in surgical patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The EMMA trial is a multicentre, open-label, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Consecutive patients requiring tracheal intubation are randomly allocated to either the McGrath video laryngoscope or direct laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. The expected rate of successful first-pass intubation is 95% in the McGrath group and 90% in the Macintosh group. Each group must include a total of 1000 patients to achieve 96% power for detecting a difference at the 5% significance level. Successful intubation with the first attempt is the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints are the time to intubation, attempts for successful intubation, the necessity of alternatives, visualisation of the glottis using the Cormack & Lehane score and percentage of glottic opening score and definite complications.

We found that preventing people from moving within the simulated room and efficacious mask usage appear to have the greatest effects on reducing infection risk, but multiple concurrent interventions are required to minimize the proportion of susceptible individuals infected. Social distancing had little effect on reducing transmission if individuals were randomly relocated within the room to simulate activity-related movements during the gathering.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is transmitted via air droplets. In medical environments that use traditional hermetic ventilation systems, medical personnel who come in contact with patients are more susceptible to infection compared to regular staff; therefore, the air flow and air quality of hermetic negative pressure isolation wards are highly critical. For this purpose, the study proposes a full-outer-air-intake natural air-conditioning system for negative pressure isolation wards. This innovative system draws in large amounts of fresh external air to greatly improve the air exchange rate in wards; negative pressure environments can be implemented depending on requirements to solve the issue of nosocomial infections in traditional negative pressure isolation wards that draw air from within the hospital. This greatly reduces the probability of nosocomial infection and infection via air droplets; furthermore, the system's intake and exhaust paths are completely isolated, solving the issue of air cross-contamination. Based on the results from the experiment site, this innovative system was designed and implemented based on the guidelines of hospital facilities and achieved air exchange per hour in excess of 12 times/hour, reaching a maximum of 54.5 times/hour. Indoor CO2 concentration was 576 ppm, negative pressure was -14 Pa, indoor temperature was 23.3C, indoor humidity was 54.1%, and sensible heat exchange efficiency (?s) was 105.88% which effectively reduced ventilation load.

Public prevention and control measures, along with efforts from all sectors of society, were undertaken to control and eliminate disease transmission. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes Chinese citizens' response to the epidemic, the preventive measures they implemented to avoid being infected, and the public strategies that were carried out by the government, health workers, etc. We also discuss the efficacy of these measures in controlling the epidemic in China. METHODS: Information on the responses and behaviors of Chinese citizens were collected through a cross-sectional, internet-based survey using Dingxiang Doctor's public account on WeChat. Information on public strategies implemented by all sectors of society to control the epidemic and data on new COVID-19 cases were collected from the internet, mainly from government websites. Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 10,304 participants responded to the survey, with 10,198 valid responses; 74.1% (n=7557) were female and 25.9% (n=2641) were male. Overall, 98.2% (n=10,013) of participants paid high or very high attention to the epidemic, with WeChat being their main information source (n=9400, 92.2%). Over half the participants (n=5878, 57.7%) were confident that the epidemic could be curbed in China; 92.4% (n=9427) opened windows for ventilation more frequently than usual; 97.9% (n=9986) used masks in public; 95.7% (n=9759) avoided large crowds and stayed at home as much as possible; and 97.9% (n=9988) washed their hands more often than usual.

The purpose of our study was to use a survey to assess the global effects of COVID-19 on colorectal practice and surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A panel of International Society of University Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ISUCRS) selected 22 questions, which were included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to ISUCRS fellows and other surgeons included in the ISUCRS database and was advertised on social media sites. The questionnaire remained open from April 16 to 28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 287 surgeons completed the survey. Of the 287 respondents, 90% were colorectal specialists or general surgeons with an interest in colorectal disease. COVID-19 had affected the practice of 96% of the surgeons, and 52% were now using telemedicine. Also, 66% reported that elective colorectal cancer surgery could proceed but with perioperative precautions. Of the 287 respondents, 19.5% reported that the use of personal protective equipment was the most important perioperative precaution. However, personal protective equipment was only provided by 9.1% of hospitals. In addition, 64% of surgeons were offering minimally invasive surgery. However, 44% reported that enough information was not available regarding the safety of the loss of intra-abdominal carbon dioxide gas during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, 61% of the surgeons were prepared to defer elective colorectal cancer surgery, with 29% willing to defer for &#8804; 8 weeks.

In patients with severe COVID-19, we assessed the association between chronic ACEI/ARB use and the occurrence of kidney, lung, heart, and liver dysfunctions and the severity of the inflammatory reaction as evaluated by biomarkers kinetics, and their association with disease outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study on consecutive patients with newly diagnosed severe COVID-19. Independent predictors were assessed through receiver operating characteristic analysis, time-series analysis, logistic regression analysis, and multilevel modeling for repeated measures. RESULTS: On the 149 patients included in the study 30% (44/149) were treated with ACEI/ARB. ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with the following biochemical variations: phosphorus >40 mg/L (odds ratio [OR], 3.35, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-6.14), creatinine >10.1 mg/L (OR, 3.22, 2.28-4.54), and urea nitrogen (UN) >0.52 g/L (OR, 2.65, 95% CI, 1.89-3.73). ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with acute kidney injury stage &#8805;1 (OR, 3.28, 95% CI, 2.17-4.94). The daily dose of ACEI/ARB was independently associated with altered kidney markers with an increased risk of +25 to +31% per each 10 mg increment of lisinopril-dose equivalent. In multivariable multilevel modeling, UN >0.52 g/L was independently associated with the risk of acute respiratory failure (OR, 3.54, 95% CI, 1.05-11.96).

METHODS: Patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation were randomized into two groups: In the first group, designated the \\"non POC\\" group, the management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy was based on the clinical experience of the anesthesiologist; in the second group, designated the \\"POC\\" group, the management of perioperative bleeding, and coagulopathy was based on the ROTEM results. RESULTS: After performing an interim statistical analysis, the project was prematurely terminated as the results were significantly in favor of the POC approach.

ObjectiveIdentify subgroups of youth with ASD/NDD based on the pandemic impact on symptoms and service changes, as well as predictors of outcomes. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis is a naturalistic observational study conducted across 14 North American and European clinical and/or research sites. Parent responses on the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey Initiative (CRISIS) adapted for Autism and Related Neurodevelopmental Conditions (AFAR) were cross-sectionally collected from April to October 2020. The sample included 1275, 5-21 year-old youth with ASD and/or NDD who were clinically well-characterized prior to the pandemic. Main Outcomes and MeasuresTo identify impact subgroups, hierarchical clustering analyzed eleven AFAR factors measuring pre- to pandemic changes in clinically relevant symptoms and service access. Random forest classification assessed the relative contribution in predicting subgroup membership of 20 features including socio-demographics, pre-pandemic service, and clinical severity along with indices of COVID-19 related experiences and environments empirically-derived from AFAR parent responses and global open sources. ResultsClustering analyses revealed four ASD/NDD impact subgroups. One subgroup - broad symptom worsening only (20% of the aggregate sample) - included youth with worsening symptoms that were above and beyond that of their ASD/NDD peers and with similar service disruptions as those in the aggregate average. The three other subgroups showed symptom changes similar to the aggregate average but differed in service access: primarily modified services (23%), primarily lost services (6%), and average services/symptom changes (53%). Pre-pandemic factors (e.g., number of services), pandemic environments and experiences (e.g., COVID-19 cases, related restrictions, COVID-19 Worries), and age emerged in unique combinations as distinct protective or risk factors for each subgroup. Together they highlighted the role of universal risk factors, such as risk perception, and the protective role of services before and during the pandemic, in middle childhood. Conclusions and RelevanceConcomitant assessment of changes in both symptoms and services access is critical to understand heterogeneous impact of the pandemic on ASD/NDD youth.

The main reason is that social behavior is complex and time-consuming. We are currently using the nests built by animals living together, a species-typical behavior naturally occurring in standard housing conditions, to monitor them. Here, we provide an example of its use to evaluate social deficits and the long-term effects of a neonatal tactile-proprioceptive sensorial treatment from postnatal day 1 to 21, in male and female adult mice modeling Alzheimers disease compared to mice with normal aging. Social nesting was worse in the mutants, mostly in males, since the number of days needed to build a perfect nest was longer or unsuccessful in a three-day test. Early life intervention was successful. Social nesting, easily included in housing routines, can be a useful tool to assess animal welfare, monitor disease progress, and evaluate potential risk factors and effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies. Other advantages, such as being a noninvasive, painless, simple, short, and low-cost, rend social nesting feasible to be implemented in most animal department settings. ABSTRACT: The assessment of welfare and disease progression in animal models is critical. Most tools rely on evaluating individual subjects, whereas social behaviors, also sensitive to acute illness, chronic diseases, or mental health, are scarcely monitored because they are complex and time-consuming. We propose the evaluation of social nesting, a species-typical behavior naturally occurring in standard housing conditions, for such behavioral monitoring. We provide an example of its use to evaluate social deficits and the long-term effects of neonatal tactile-proprioceptive sensorial stimulation from postnatal day 1 to 21, in male and female adult 3xTg-AD mice for Alzheimers disease compared to sex- and age-matched non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging. Social nesting was sensitive to genotype (worse in 3xTg-AD mice), sex (worse in males), profile, and treatment (distinct time to observe the maximum score and incidence of the perfect nest). Since social nesting can be easily included in housing routines, this neuroethological approach can be useful for animal welfare, monitoring the diseases progress, and evaluating potential risk factors and effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies. Finally, the noninvasive, painless, simple, short time, and low-cost features of this home-cage monitoring are advantages that make social nesting feasible to be successfully implemented in most animal department settings.","output":"Social Nesting, Animal Welfare, and Disease Monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Biological data are lacking with respect to risk of vertical transmission and mechanisms of fetoplacental protection in maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objective: To quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal and neonatal biofluids, transplacental passage of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and incidence of fetoplacental infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted among pregnant women presenting for care at 3 tertiary care centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Women with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results positive for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from April 2 to June 13, 2020, and follow-up occurred through July 10, 2020. Contemporaneous participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as a convenience sample from pregnant women with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, defined by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal plasma or respiratory fluids and umbilical cord plasma, quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in maternal and cord plasma, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the placenta. Results: Among 127 pregnant women enrolled, 64 with RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 31.6 [5.6] years) and 63 with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 33.9 [5.4] years) provided samples for analysis. Of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23 (36%) were asymptomatic, 22 (34%) had mild disease, 7 (11%) had moderate disease, 10 (16%) had severe disease, and 2 (3%) had critical disease. In viral load analyses among 107 women, there was no detectable viremia in maternal or cord blood and no evidence of vertical transmission. Among 77 neonates tested in whom SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified in cord blood, 1 had detectable immunoglobuilin M to nucleocapsid. Among 88 placentas tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any. In antibody analyses among 37 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G was detected in 24 women (65%) and anti-nucleocapsid was detected in 26 women (70%). Mother-to-neonate transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower than transfer of anti-influenza hemagglutinin A antibodies (mean [SD] cord-to-maternal ratio: anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G, 0.72 [0.57]; anti-nucleocapsid, 0.74 [0.44]; anti-influenza, 1.44 [0.80]; P < .001). Nonoverlapping placental expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 was noted. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, there was no evidence of placental infection or definitive vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Transplacental transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was inefficient. Lack of viremia and reduced coexpression and colocalization of placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 may serve as protective mechanisms against vertical transmission.","output":"Assessment of Maternal and Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load, Transplacental Antibody Transfer, and Placental Pathology in Pregnancies During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-posters have been increasingly incorporated into medical education conferences over the past few years, but since the disruption to the 'traditional' conference circuit as a result of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 they have become a necessary tool for larger national and international conferences to support ongoing scholarship dissemination.

These biological processes in cells have essential functions in many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and virus-related diseases. The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) microenvironment within cells is thought to be the driving force for initiating the formation of micro-compartments with a liquid-like property, becoming an important organizing principle for MLOs to mediate organism responses. In this review, we comprehensively elucidated the formation of these MLOs and the relationship between biological functions and associated diseases. The mechanisms underlying the influence of protein concentration and valency on phase separation in cells are also discussed.

METHODS: In September 2015, a collaborative practice agreement between pharmacists and transplant providers at an academic medical center for management of PTHG was developed. The goal of the pharmacist-run service was to reduce hospitalizations by providing care to patients in the acute phase of hyperglycemia while they transitioned back to their primary care provider or endocrinologist. For continuous quality improvement, preimplementation data were collected from August 2014 to August 2015 and compared to postimplementation data collected from August 2017 to August 2018. The primary endpoint was hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia within 90 days post transplantation. Secondary endpoints included emergency department (ED) visits due to hypoglycemia and the number of interventions performed, number of encounters completed, and number of ED visits or admissions for hypoglycemia. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical data, and a Student t test was used to compare continuous data. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: Forty-three patients in the preimplementation group were compared to 35 patients in the postimplementation group. There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia in the postimplementation versus the preimplementation group (9 vs 1, P < 0.05); there was a reduction in ED visits due to hyperglycemia (5 vs 0, P = 0.06). There were no ED visits or hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia in either group. Clinical transplant pharmacists performed an average of 8.3 (SD, 4.4) encounters per patient per 90 days. CONCLUSION: A collaborative practice agreement was created and successfully implemented. A pharmacist-managed PTHG program could be incorporated into the standard care of kidney transplant recipients to help minimize rehospitalizations due to hyperglycemia.","output":"Implementing a pharmacist-led transition of care model for posttransplant hyperglycemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology, and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org. The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on ultrasound lung images. In addition, it grants medical staff the option to (bulk) upload their own screenings in order to contribute to the growing public database of pathological lung ultrasound images.

Method: A total of 426 patients who had tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 from August 1 to 31, 2020 were selected for the study. Informed consent was obtained and a questionnaire including the patients age, gender, symptoms, and past polymerase chain reaction (PCR) status was filled by the patient. Samples were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on Roche Cobas e601. Results: The mean age of the patients was 42.4316.67 years. One hundred and five (24.6%) were PCR positive, while 321 (75.4%) were PCR negative. Most patients were males 241 (56.6%) while 185(43.3%) were females. Over 185(43.3%) patients presented with symptoms, and the rest of the patients 241 (56.6%) were asymptomatic.

At a time when elective surgeries are being suspended and questions are being raised about how the remaining procedures on COVID-19 positive patients can be performed safely, it is important to consider the potential role of robotic assisted surgery within the current pandemic. Recently, several robotic assisted surgery societies have issued their recommendations. To date, however, no specific recommendations are available for cardiothoracic robotic assisted surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. Here, we discuss the potential risks, benefits, and preventive measures that need to be taken into account when considering robotic assisted surgery for cardiothoracic indications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. It is suggested that robotic assisted surgery might have various advantages such as early recovery after surgery, shorter hospital stay, and reduced loss of blood and fluids as well as smaller incisions. However, electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices, as well as CO2 insufflation should be managed with caution to prevent the risk of aerosolization of viral particles.","output":"Cardiothoracic robotic assisted surgery in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: People's adherence to control measures is imperative in the fight against COVID-19.

Since coagulopathy has been observed over the entire clinical course, thrombosis might be a clue to understanding the specific pathology in COVID-19. Currently, there is limited epidemiological data of COVID-19-associated thrombosis in the Japanese population and none regarding variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we elucidate the risk factors and the pattern of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods: The patients consecutively admitted to Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest (VOC/VOI) carrying the spike protein mutants E484K, N501Y, or L452R were identified by PCR-based analysis. All thrombotic events were diagnosed by clinical symptoms, ultrasonography, and/or radiological tests. Results: Among the 516 patients, 32 patients experienced 42 thromboembolic events. Advanced age, severe respiratory conditions, and several abnormal laboratory markers were associated with the development of thrombosis. While thrombotic events occurred in 13% of the patients with a severe respiratory condition, those events still occurred in 2.5% of the patients who did not require oxygen therapy. Elevated D-dimer and ferritin levels on admission were independent risk factors of thrombosis (adjusted odds ratio 9.39 and 3.11, 95% confidence interval 2.08C42.3, and 1.06C9.17, respectively). Of the thrombotic events, 22 were venous, whereas 20 were arterial. While patients with thrombosis received anticoagulation and antiinflammatory therapies with a higher proportion, the mortality rate, organ dysfunctions, and bleeding complications in these patients were higher than those without thrombosis. The incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 became less frequent over time, such as during the replacement of the earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2 by VOC/VOI and during increased use of anticoagulatory therapeutics. Conclusion: This study elucidated that elevated D-dimer and ferritin levels are useful biomarkers of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. The comparable incidence of arterial thrombosis with venous thrombosis and the development of thrombosis in less severe patients required further considerations for the management of Japanese patients with COVID-19. Further studies would be required to identify high-risk populations and establish appropriate interventions for thrombotic complications in COVID-19.","output":"Arterial and Venous Thrombosis Complicated in COVID-19: A Retrospective Single Center Analysis in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosis of any infectious disease is vital for opportune treatment and to prevent dissemination. RT-qPCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are ideal in a hospital environment. However, mass testing requires cheaper and simpler tests, especially in settings that lack sophisticated machinery. The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60-93% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests. A series of simple modifications to standard RT-LAMP published methods to stabilize pH fluctuations due to salivary acidity resulted in a significant improvement in reliability, opening new avenues for efficient, low-cost testing of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Low saliva pH can yield false positives results in simple RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic has demonstrated a need for remote learning and virtual learning applications such as virtual reality (VR) and tablet-based solutions.

AIM OF STUDY: In the clinical studies, FFYH was very effective for the treatment of influenza, but the mechanism of action against influenza A virus remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza A virus in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was investigated for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CPE inhibition assay and HA assay were used to evaluate the in vitro antiviral effects of FFYH against influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. Mice were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of FFYH in vivo with ribavirin and lianhuaqingwen as positive controls. RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA transcription of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-?3, IP10, and IL-1? mRNA. ELISA was used to examine the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-?3, IP10, and IL-1? in sera. The blood parameters were analyzed with auto hematology analyzer. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was also investigated. RESULTS: FFYH showed a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity against H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 influenza A viruses. Furthermore, FFYH dose-dependently increased the survival rate, significantly prolonged the median survival time of mice, and markedly reduced lung injury caused by influenza A virus. Also, FFYH significantly improve the sick signs, food taken, weight loss, blood parameters, lung index, and lung pathological changes. Moreover, FFYH could markedly inhibit the inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-?3, IP10, IL-10, and IL-1? mRNA or protein via inhibition of the TLR7/MyD88/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway in vivo. CONCLUSION: FFYH not only showed a broad-spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity in vitro, but also exhibited a significant protective effect against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicated that the in vivo antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza virus may be attributed to suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines via regulating the TLR7/MyD88/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway.

Bans of highly hazardous pesticides (HHP) reduce the number of suicides. We aimed to identify these pesticides by reviewing data from major hospitals across the country and from forensic toxicology laboratories. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 10 hospitals for pesticide poisoned patients and two forensic laboratories of Nepal from April 2017 to February 2020. The poison was identified from the history, referral note, and clinical toxidrome in the hospitals and from gas chromatography analysis in the laboratories. Data on demographics, poison, and patient outcome were recorded on a data collection sheet. Simple descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS Among hospital cases (n = 4148), the commonest form of poisoning was self-poisoning (95.8%) while occupation poisoning was rare (0.03%). Case fatality was 5.3% (n = 62). Aluminum phosphide (n = 38/62, 61.3%) was the most commonly identified lethal pesticide for deaths. Forensic toxicology laboratories reported 2535 deaths positive for pesticides, with the compounds most commonly identified being organophosphorus (OP) insecticides (n = 1463/2535; 57.7%), phosphine gas (n = 653/2535; 25.7%; both aluminum [11.8%] and zinc [0.4%] phosphide) and organochlorine insecticides (n = 241/2535; 9.5%). The OP insecticide most commonly identified was dichlorvos (n = 273/450, 60.6%). CONCLUSION The data held in the routine hospital medical records were incomplete but suggested that case fatality in hospitals was relatively low. The pesticides identified as causing most deaths were dichlorvos and aluminum phosphide. Since this study was completed, dichlorvos has been banned and the most toxic formulation of aluminum phosphide removed from sale.

MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (-CoV) subgroup 2c share >65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are significant drug and vaccine targets. BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c -CoVs. We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE). This virus replicates efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge. Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice.

As part of a larger investigation on COVID-19 mortality impact, this study aims to estimate the Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) in 17 countries and territories across the world (Australia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cyprus, France, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Peru, Norway, England & Wales, Scotland, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United States [USA]). METHODS: Age- and sex-specific COVID-19 death numbers from primary national sources were collected by an international research consortium. The study period was established based on the availability of data from the inception of the pandemic to the end of August 2020. The PYLL for each country were computed using 80 years as the maximum life expectancy. RESULTS: As of August 2020, 442,677 (range: 18C185,083) deaths attributed to COVID-19 were recorded in 17 countries which translated to 4,210,654 (range: 112C1,554,225) PYLL. The average PYLL per death was 8.7 years, with substantial variation ranging from 2.7 years in Australia to 19.3 PYLL in Ukraine. North and South American countries as well as England & Wales, Scotland and Sweden experienced the highest PYLL per 100,000 population; whereas Australia, Slovenia and Georgia experienced the lowest. Overall, males experienced higher PYLL rate and higher PYLL per death than females. In most countries, most of the PYLL were observed for people aged over 60 or 65 years, irrespective of sex. Yet, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Israel, Peru, Scotland, Ukraine, and the USA concentrated most PYLL in younger age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the role of PYLL as a tool to understand the impact of COVID-19 on demographic groups within and across countries, guiding preventive measures to protect these groups under the ongoing pandemic. Continuous monitoring of PYLL is therefore needed to better understand the burden of COVID-19 in terms of premature mortality.

Whether this is due to waning of immunity to SARS-COV-2 remains unclear. AimWe aimed to investigate dynamics of antibody isotype responses among vaccinated naive (VN) and naturally infected (NI) individuals. MethodsWe followed up antibody levels in COVID-19 mRNA-vaccinated subjects without prior infection (VN, n=100) at two phases: phase-I (P-I) at [~]1.4 and phase-II (P-II) at [~]5.3 months. Antibody levels were compared to those of unvaccinated and naturally infected subjects (NI, n=40) at [~]1.7 (P-1) and 5.2 (P-II) months post-infection. Neutralizing antibodies (NTAb), anti-S-RBD-IgG, -IgM, and anti-S-IgA isotypes were measured. ResultsVN group produced significantly greater antibody responses (p<0.001) than NI group at P-I except for IgM. In VN group, a significant waning in antibody response was observed in all isotypes. There was about [~] a 4-fold decline in NTAb levels (p<0.001), anti-S-RBD-IgG ([~]5-folds, p<0.001), anti-S-RBD-IgM ([~]6-folds, p<0.001), and anti-S1-IgA (2-folds, p<0.001).

Whilst previous research has examined the impact of national lockdowns on transmission, there has been limited research examining the marginal effect of differences in localised restrictions or how these effects vary between socioeconomic contexts. We therefore examined how Tier 3 restrictions in England implemented between October-December 2020, which included additional restrictions on the hospitality sector and people meeting outdoors affected COVID-19 case rates, compared to Tier 2 restrictions, and how these effects varied by level of deprivation.MethodsWe used data on weekly reported COVID-19 cases for 7201 neighbourhoods in England and adjusted these for changing case-detection rates to provide an estimate of weekly SARS-CoV-2 infections in each neighbourhood. We identified those areas that entered Tier 3 restrictions at two time points in October and December, and constructed a synthetic control group of similar places that had entered Tier 2 restrictions, using calibration weights to match them on a wide range of covariates that may influence transmission. We then compared the change in weekly infections between those entering Tier 3 to the synthetic control group to estimate the proportional reduction of cases resulting from Tier 3 restrictions compared to Tier 2 restrictions, over a 4-week period. We further used interaction analysis to estimate whether this effect differed based on the level of socioeconomic deprivation in each neighbourhood and whether effects were modified by the prevalence of a new more infectious variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) in each area.ResultsThe introduction of Tier 3 restrictions in October and December was associated with a 14% (95% CI 10% to 19%) and 20% (95% CI 13% to 29%) reduction in infections respectively, compared to the rates expected if only Tier 2 restrictions had been in place in those areas. We found that effects were similar across levels of deprivation and limited evidence that Tier 3 restrictions had a greater effect in areas where the new more infectious variant was more prevalent.DiscussionCompared to Tier 2 restrictions, additional restrictions on hospitality and meeting outdoors introduced in Tier 3 areas in England had a moderate effect on transmission and these restrictions did not appear to increase inequalities.","output":"Evaluating the impacts of tiered restrictions introduced in England, during October and December 2020 on COVID-19 cases: a synthetic control study*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In the retrospective study the number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. (1) Lymphopenia and drastic reduction of CD4+ T cell counts in COVID-19 patients have been linked with poor clinical outcome too. (2) We present a case of a patient with well controlled HIV infection with stable absolute CD4 count but significant drop during COVID infection CASE PRESENTATION: A 67 year-old-man with history of HIV on ARV therapy with undetectable viral load, panhypopituitarism with central hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism, recurrent DVT/PE on AC therapy, BPH, overactive bladder, stable angina presented with 3 days of fever, chills, diarrhea and malaise to ER. He received first dose of Moderna vaccine 2 weeks before admission. VS -saturation 79% on RA, and 96% on NRB mask, HR 122 beats/min, BP 159/87 mmHg, RR 18/min, T 101. PE unremarkable. Labs: Covid PCR +, WBC 15.3 K/cmm, ferritin 585.8 ng/ml, LDH 489 U/LAST 122 U/l, ALT 100U/L, CRP quant 321 mg/L, D dimer 1287 D-DU ng/ml, HIV RNA quant undetectable, CD4 67 cell/Ul, previous CD4 568 cmm 2 weeks prior admission. CXR:b/l patchy infiltrates. He was treated with dexamethasone, therapeutic Lovenox and received 1 U of convalescent plasma. His oxygen saturation improved, overall course was uneventful and patient was discharged home. CD4 count improved to 523 cmm 2 months later. DISCUSSION: It is shown that HIV infection does not increase the occurrence of COVID-19 and there is no increase in morbidity and mortality (2). The exact influence of COVID-19 on absolute T4 cells subset in HIV and their significance is presently unknown. Our patient had stable absolute CD4 count for years. He was compliant with ART and HIV viral load was undetectable. However, there was a drastic decline in his CD4 count that occurred during an acute COVID infection although he was on the same medications. CD4 recovered to baseline after COVID infection resolved. CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique case with such a dramatic drop of absolute CD4 count in acute COVID infection and further investigation on CD4 cells and it effects on HIV infection will need to be studied.

One open question is whether genetics could influence the severity of symptoms. Considering the limited data on cancer patients, we analyzed public data repositories limited to investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expressions and genetic variants to identify the basis of individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Gene expression and variant data were retrieved from Tissue Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression, and gnomAD. Differences in gene expression were tested with Mann-Whitney U-test. Allele frequencies of germline variants were explored in different ethnicities, with a special focus on ACE2 variants located in the binding site to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions in healthy tissues showed a higher expression in the age class 20 to 59 years (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.0001) regardless of gender. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were more expressed in tumors from males than females (both FDR < 0.0001) and, opposite to the regulation in tissues from healthy individuals, more expressed in elderly patients (FDR = 0.005; FDR < 0.0001, respectively). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions were higher in cancers of elderly patients compared with healthy individuals (FDR < 0.0001). Variants were present at low frequency (range 0% to 3%) and among those with the highest frequency, the variant S19P belongs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding site and it was exclusively present in Africans with a frequency of 0.2%. The mechanisms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulation could be targeted for preventive and therapeutic purposes in the whole population and especially in cancer patients.

The most common approaches rely on nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from swabs, followed by RNA extraction, reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. Although swab-based PCR is sensitive, swabbing is invasive and unpleasant to administer, reducing patient compliance for regular testing and resulting in an increased risk of improper sample collection. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a non-invasive one-step RT-qPCR assay performed directly on saliva specimens. The University of Nottingham Asymptomatic Testing Service (UoNATS) protocol simplifies sample collection and bypasses the need for RNA extraction, additives, or extraneous processing steps, thus helping to encourage more regular testing and reducing processing time and costs. We have evaluated the assay against the performance criteria specified by the UK regulatory bodies and attained accreditation (BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). We observed a sensitivity of 1 viral copy per microlitre of saliva and demonstrated a concordance of >99.4% between our results and those of other accredited testing facilities.

The household transmissibility of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts in Guangzhou, China, using a statistical transmission model. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive contact tracing dataset from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 (defined as the probability that an infected individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual) among household and non-household contacts, using a statistical transmission model. We considered two alternative definitions of household contacts in the analysis: individuals who were either family members or close relatives, such as parents and parents-in-law, regardless of residential address, and individuals living at the same address regardless of relationship. We assessed the demographic determinants of transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2020, and Feb 18, 2020, we traced 195 unrelated close contact groups (215 primary cases, 134 secondary or tertiary cases, and 1964 uninfected close contacts). By identifying households from these groups, assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days, a maximum infectious period of 13 days, and no case isolation, the estimated secondary attack rate among household contacts was 124% (95% CI 98-154) when household contacts were defined on the basis of close relatives and 171% (133-218) when household contacts were defined on the basis of residential address. Compared with the oldest age group (&#8805;60 years), the risk of household infection was lower in the youngest age group (<20 years; odds ratio [OR] 023 [95% CI 011-046]) and among adults aged 20-59 years (OR 064 [95% CI 043-097]). Our results suggest greater infectivity during the incubation period than during the symptomatic period, although differences were not statistically significant (OR 061 [95% CI 027-138]). The estimated local reproductive number (R) based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was 05 (95% CI 041-062) in Guangzhou. The projected local R, had there been no isolation of cases or quarantine of their contacts, was 06 (95% CI 049-074) when household was defined on the basis of close relatives. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Older individuals (aged &#8805;60 years) are the most susceptible to household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to case finding and isolation, timely tracing and quarantine of close contacts should be implemented to prevent onward transmission during the viral incubation period.

The pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 encephalopathy and neuro-PASC are unknown. We sought to establish biochemical evidence of CNS injury in those patients and their association with neuropsychiatric manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia. METHODS: We recruited hospitalized, posthospitalized, and nonhospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with neurologic symptoms in addition to healthy control (HC) subjects. Plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL), plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (pGFAP), and plasma SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid antigen (pN Ag) were measured by HD-X Simoa analyzer (Quanterix) and compared with neuropsychiatric symptoms, patient-reported quality-of-life measures, and standardized cognitive assessments. Neuroglial scores (pGFAP/pNfL) were calculated to estimate the relative contribution of astroglial and neuronal involvement. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 64 study participants, including 9 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy (CE), 9 posthospitalization neuro-PASC (PNP) patients, 38 nonhospitalized neuro-PASC (NNP) patients, and 8 HC subjects. Patients with CE were older, had higher pNfL and pGFAP concentrations, and more frequent pN Ag detection than all neuro-PASC groups. PNP and NNP patients exhibited similar PASC symptoms, decreased quality-of-life measures, and cognitive dysfunction, and 1 of the 38 (2.6%) NNP patients had pN Ag detectable 3 weeks postsymptoms onset. Patients with neuro-PASC presenting with anxiety/depression had higher neuroglial scores, which were correlated with increased anxiety on quality-of-life measures. DISCUSSION: pNfL, pGFAP, and pN Ag measurements indicate neuronal dysfunction and systemic involvement in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N Ag in blood 3 weeks after symptoms onset in a nonhospitalized patient suggests that prolonged antigenic stimulation, or possibly latent infection, may occur. Anxiety was associated with evidence of astroglial activation in patients with neuro-PASC. These data shed new light on SARS-Cov-2 neuropathogenesis and demonstrate the value of plasma biomarkers across the COVID-19 disease spectrum.","output":"Plasma Biomarkers of Neuropathogenesis in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 and Those With Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recurrent outbreak of coronaviruses and variants underscores the need for broadly reactive antivirals and vaccines.

The epitope including the fusion peptide and S2 cleavage site recognized by 76E1 was significantly conserved among -, -, - and - coronaviruses. We uncovered a novel mechanism of antibody neutralization that the epitope of 76E1 was proportionally less exposed in the prefusion trimeric structure of spike protein but could be unmasked by binding to the receptor ACE2. Once the epitope exposed, 76E1 inhibited S2 cleavage, thus blocked the membrane fusion process.

There is no standard treatment for patients who progress on temozolomide and patients are best treated within investigational clinical protocols. Patients harbouring tumours with functional O(6) methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA repair enzyme have particularly poor prognosis with median overall survival of 12.7 months, compared to 21.7 months for patients with hypermethylated MGMT promoter. The pre-clinical studies have shown that Bortezomib depletes the MGMT enzyme, restoring the tumour s susceptibility to Temozolomide, if the chemotherapy is administered in the precise schedule when the MGMT enzyme is depleted. Additionally, Bortezomib shows an antitumour effect by blocking autophagy flux. Based on the promising pre-clinical results, a non-randomized, open label phase IB/II clinical trial was designed. The primary endpoints include assessment of safety of Bortezomib administered with Temozolomide for phase IB and median progression free survival, overall survival as well as progression free rate at 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Recurrent glioblastoma patients with unmethylated MGMT promotor, progressing at least 12 weeks after completion of postoperative radiotherapy, with adequate organ function, performance status Karnofsky 70 or better and radiologically measurable lesions are screened for study inclusion. The experimental treatment consists of Bortezomib 1.3mg/m(2) administered IV on days 1, 4, 7, during each 4-week chemotherapy cycle with per oral Temozolomide at 200mg/m(2) 5 days/week every 4 weeks starting on day 3. Study group will be compared to historical controls on conventional management. The sample size was calculated to 63 patients, ten of them were included in the phase IB. RESULTS: The phase IB of the trial was completed in 2019 and the combination of Temozolomide and Bortezomib was shown to be safe and well tolerated. Until April 2021 a total number of 23 patients were included into the trial. The patients are treated at 4 different referral university hospitals in Norway. A clinical treatment benefit with both radiological tumor volume response and stable disease were observed. The patient inclusion in the trial is delayed due COVID-19. The majority of observed side effects are mild or moderate. The grade 3 or 4 adverse effects included thrombocytopenia, ataxia, muscle weakness, delirium and hyperglycemia. Patients that progressed under the treatment received another line of therapy according to the institutional practice. CONCLUSION: A combination of Bortezomib and Temozolomide administered in a defined time sequence to achieve sensitization of glioblastoma to alkylating agent is safe and feasible and may represent a novel treatment option for patients with this devastating disease.","output":"P14.09 BORTEM-17: A Phase IB/II Single-Arm, Control Non-Randomized, Multicentre, Open Label Clinical Trial for Recurrent Glioblastoma with unmethylated MGMT promoter (NCT03643549)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, locally and internationally after it started in Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the spread of this infectious disease in the world, health care workers are taking place as the main people in the screening and treatment of the disease. The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between anxiety and depression levels with perceived stress and coping strategies in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this study, 200 participants were included. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BDI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) were applied. Results: Mean scores for BDI and BAI were 9.2+/-8.9 and 8.2+/-9.2, respectively. BDI scores of 33 (16.5%) of 200 participants were &gt;=17. 62% of the participants had minimal depression, 21.5% of the participants had mild depression, 13.5 % of the participants had moderate depression, and 3% of the participants had severe depression according to BDI scores. 60.5% of the participants had minimal anxiety, 25.5% of the participants had mild anxiety, 8.5% of the participants had moderate anxiety and 5.5% of the participants had severe anxiety according to BAI scores. BAI and BDI scores of the female participants were statistically higher than the male participants. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between BAI and BDI scores and PSS-10 scores. A statistically significant difference was found in the averages of BAI and BDI, PSS-10 COPE 3 (Focus on and venting of emotions), 7 (Religious coping) and 13 (Acceptance) subscales levels in occupational groups. A statistically significant difference was found in BDI levels in the clinical units during the pandemic. Conclusion: This study indicated that different coping strategies can be used in health care workers regarding anxiety, depression and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. While problem-solving and emotion-focused adaptive coping mechanisms help reduce symptoms, maladaptive and negative coping mechanisms can cause symptoms to exacerbate. Thus, training should be given to developing attitudes of health care workers to cope with stress.","output":"The Relationship between Anxiety and Depression Levels with Perceived Stress and Coping Strategies in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El objetivo de este estudio es analizar el desarrollo de la educacin virtual en Educacin Infantil durante la pandemia por la COVID-19.

To answer these questions, we conducted a series of large-scale crowdsourced behavioral experiments with different sources of face imagery.

The goal of this study was to develop such a framework to (1) facilitate patient-specific optimization of TCM parameters and (2) enable future virtual imaging trials (VITs) with more clinically realistic image quality and x-ray flux distributions. The framework was created by developing a TCM module and integrating it with an existing CT simulator (DukeSim). The developed module utilizes scanner-calibrated TCM parameters and two localizer radiographs to compute the mAs for each simulated CT projection. This simulation pipeline was validated in two parts. First, DukeSim was validated in the context of a commercial scanner with TCM (SOMATOM Force, Siemens Healthineers) by imaging a physical CT phantom (Mercury, Sun Nuclear) and its computational analogue. Second, the TCM module was validated by imaging a computational anthropomorphic phantom (ATOM, CIRS) using DukeSim with real and module-generated TCM profiles. The validation demonstrated DukeSim's realism in terms of noise magnitude, noise texture, spatial resolution, and image contrast (with average differences of 0.38%, 6.31%, 0.43%, and -9 HU, respectively). It also demonstrated the TCM module's realism in terms of projection-level mAs and resulting noise magnitude (2.86% and -2.60%, respectively).

Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time. CONCLUSION: The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment. The approach may lead to a paradigm shift in conducting real-time global genomics-based surveillance in settings with limited access to health care.","output":"Pathogen surveillance in the informal settlement, Kibera, Kenya, using a metagenomics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore the challenges and experiences of Prehospital Emergency Personnel in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran.

One of these changes results in assembly of two heptad repeat sequences (HRA and HRB) from each protomer into a six-helix bundle (6HB) motif. To assist in distinguishing pre- and post-fusion conformations of the Pneumovirinae F proteins, and as extension of previous work (Palomo et al., 2014), a general strategy was designed to obtain polyclonal and particularly monoclonal antibodies specific of the 6HB motif of the Pneumovirinae fusion protein.

Amendments to working practices can lead to the amount, duration and/or proximity of interactions being changed, ultimately altering the dynamics of disease spread. These modifications could be specific to the type of business being operated. Methods: We use a data-driven approach to parameterise an individual-based network model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the working population, stratified into work sectors. The network is comprised of layered contacts to consider risk of spread in multiple encounter settings (workplaces, households, social and other). We analyse several interventions targeted towards working practices: mandating a fraction of the population to work from home, using temporally asynchronous work patterns and introducing measures to create \`COVID-secure' workplaces. We also assess the general role of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures and demonstrate the impact of all these interventions across a variety of relevant metrics. Results: The progress of the epidemic can be significantly hindered by instructing a significant proportion of the workforce to work from home. Furthermore, if required to be present at the workplace, asynchronous work patterns can help to reduce infections when compared with scenarios where all workers work on the same days, particularly for longer working weeks. When assessing COVID-secure workplace measures, we found that smaller work teams and a greater reduction in transmission risk led to a flatter temporal profile for both infections and the number of people isolating, and reduced the probability of large, long outbreaks. Finally, following isolation guidance and engaging with contact tracing alone is an effective tool to curb transmission, but is highly sensitive to adherence levels. Conclusions: In the absence of sufficient adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, our results indicate a high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 spreading widely throughout a worker population. Given the heterogeneity of demographic attributes across worker roles, in addition to the individual nature of controls such as contact tracing, we demonstrate the utility of a network model approach to investigate workplace-targeted intervention strategies and the role of test, trace and isolation in tackling disease spread.","output":"A network modelling approach to assess non-pharmaceutical disease controls in a worker population: An application to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The automated comparison of protein-ligand binding sites provides useful insights into yet unexplored site similarities.

The objective of this research was to understand how the learning of pharmacy students at the University of Alberta was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 397 pharmacy students in years one through three. Students responded to three short-answer reflection questions: (1) how has the COVID-19 pandemic situation affected your learning; (2) from a pharmacy and pharmacy school perspective, what have you learned since the COVID-19 pandemic began; and (3) from a personal perspective, what have you learned about yourself since the COVID-19 pandemic began? A thematic analysis was undertaken of students' responses to these reflection questions. RESULTS: A total of 53 students responded to the survey (response rate 13%). Two major themes were identified across all three reflection questions, with several subthemes: remote learning (learning environment, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, assessment) and mental health (appreciation, stress, extroversion, motivation). Adaptability, routine, professional identity, and the role of the pharmacist were also identified as less prevalent themes. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy students' responses led to the identification of several themes related to their learning given the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data were collected at diagnosis of COVID-19 and during follow-up and compared with the Campania regional population (extracted by National Health System COVID-19 database C https://covid-19.iss.it). Results: A total of 30 LT patients developed Sars-CoV-2 infection (76.6% male, median age 62.6yrs). Sixteen (53.3%) were symptomatic;no differences in LT indications, immunosuppression and comorbidities were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Common COVID-19 symptoms were fever (46.6%), cough (36.6%), fatigue (36.6%) and anosmia (36.6%). Twenty-five (83.4%) patients were managed at home, while 5 (16.6%) required hospitalization (2 were admitted to ICU, 2 developed ARDS and 2 died). Immunosuppressors were modified only in hospitalized patients incidence rate of Sars-CoV-2 infection was similar between LT patients and general population (3.28% vs 4.37%, p=0.1) while symptomaticity rate was higher in LT patients (46.67% vs 15.87%, p<0.00). Hospitalization rate was higher in LT patients than in general population (16.67% vs 4.54%, p=0.001), with similar median length of stay (11 vs 20 days, p=0.32). Lethality rate was higher in LT patients than in general population (6.67% vs 1.76%, p=0.041). According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (fully adjusted-OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.00-1.04], p=0.005) and female sex (fully adjusted-OR 0.31 [95% CI 0.13-0.73], p=0.007) showed positive and negative association, Sars-CoV-2 infection in LT patients.

Selected epitopes are involved in proteinCprotein interactions in the S protein complexes with neutralizing antibodies and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The recombinant proteins were used for immunization of mice (three doses with 2-week intervals), and the immunogenicity of protein antigens and ability of the resulting sera to interact with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and RBD produced in eukaryotic cells were examined. All recombinant proteins showed high immunogenicity; the highest titer in the RBD binding assay was demonstrated by the serum obtained after immunization with the protein containing epitope 414-425. At the same time, the titers of sera obtained against other proteins in the RBD and inactivated virus binding assays were significantly lower than the titers of sera obtained with the previously produced four proteins containing the loop-like epitopes 452-494 and 470-491, the conformation of which was fixed with a disulfide bond.

However, the extreme trace amount of tissue samples in different stages have limited in portraying the characterization of early-stage cancer. Therefore, we focused on and presented comprehensive proteomic and phosphoproproteomic profiling of the trace FFPE samples from early-stage gastrointestinal cancer, and then explored the potential biomarkers of early-stage gastrointestinal cancer. METHODS: In this study, a quantitative proteomic method with chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyse the proteomic difference between the trace early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EESCC) and early-stage duodenum adenocarcinoma cancer (EDAC). RESULTS: We identified ~ 6000 proteins and > 10,000 phosphosites in single trace FFPE samples. Comparative analysis disclosed the diverse proteomic features of tumor tissues compared with paired normal tissue of EESCC and EDAC, and revealed the difference of EESCC and EDAC was derived from their origin normal tissue. The distinct separation of EESCC and EDAC illustrated the functions of cell cycle (RB1 T373, EGFR T693) in EESCC, and the positive impacts of apoptosis, metabolic processes (MTOR and MTOR S1261) in EDAC. Furthermore, we deconvoluted the immune infiltration of early-stage gastrointestinal cancer, in which higher immune cell signatures were detected in EDAC, and showed the specific cytokines in EESCC and EDAC. We performed kinases-substates relationship analysis and elucidated the specific proteomic kinase characterization of EESCC and EDAC, and proposed the medicative effects and corresponding drugs for EESCC and EDAC at the clinic.

We have studied the relationship between the HLA-class II typing of 87 health workers and the level of antibodies produced 30 days after vaccination.

Evidence is accumulating that these glycans play key roles in different aspects of helminth infection including interactions with immune cells for recognition and evasion of host defences. Moreover, antigenic properties of glycans can be exploited for improving the efficacy of anti-helminthic vaccines.

Besides work and social life, health care is affected on many levels. In particular, there is concern that attendance in health care programs will drop or hospital admissions will be delayed due to COVID-19-related anxieties, especially in children. Therefore, we compared the number of weekly visits to 78 German pediatric institutions between 2019 and 2020. ResultsWe found no significant differences during the first ten weeks of the year.

Numerous studies have pointed-out the main role of monocyte activation. In addition neutrophils alterations appear to differ pathophysiologically from the changes that occur in Influenza Virus (IV) infection. Due to the overlap of symptoms between these two entities, the search of analytical markers that help in early diagnostic orientation is considered of crucial importance. Changes in cell function, phenotype, and morphology in circulating leukocytes can be translated into numerical data obtained from an automated analyzer. The objective of our study is to generate an Artificial Intelligence Model from conventional hematological blood count parameters which be able to discriminate between CV and IV infection, in a fast and efficient maner. Methods This is a retrospective single-center study, performed between January-April 2020. The patients (n = 816) were divided into two groups: Patients who came for suspected COVID and had a positive RT-PCR (n = 408) and patients with a diagnosis of influenza confirmed by RT-PCR (n = 408). The database was divided into two random subgroups (n = 654) to train the model and another (n = 162) to validate it. The first hemogram on admission to the Emergency Department of these patients was performed on a Beckman-Coulter? DXH-900 equipment. Total white blood cells, absolute neutrophils, absolute lymphocytes, absolute monocytes, monocyte distribution wide (MDW) and Cell Morphological Data (CMDs) based on the impedance, conductivity and light scattering of these leukocyte subpopulations have been used to construct the model. Five algorithms have been evaluated using the R studio Software and the Caret (Classification and Regression Training) package: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Recursive partitioning (Rpart). Results The evaluation of the different models was based on the comparison of the efficacy obtained through a cross validation (10x). It was decided to choose the SVM model by presenting a median of the area under the ROC curve of 0,841. No data preprocessing was performed, and the parameters chosen for the model were: sigma = 0,014, C = 1 and Number of Support Vectors = 458. Parameters with greater importance (>80%) in the model, were CMDs based on Neutrophil Light Scattering (SDLNE, SDLAN, SDMNE and MNLNE). The analysis of results was performed using a confusion matrix, where the model predicts the diagnosis of each patient in the validation subgroup (Table 2). A ROC curve with an area of 0,892 was obtained, with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 85%, respectively (Fig 1). Conclusions The creation of prediction algorithms from hemogram parameters allow to discriminate between COVID 19 infection and influenza A and B with a high specificity and sensitivity in a fast way. This could be a great advance for the early diagnostic orientation and guide clinical decisions as soon as possible with the consequent clinical benefit.

Results The complete transcriptome of L. japonica was de novo-assembled and annotated, generating a total of 195850 unigenes, of which 84657 could be functionally annotated. 70 candidate genes involved in flowering transition were identified and the flowering regulatory network of five pathways was constructed in L. japonica . The mRNA transcripts of AGL24 and SOC1 exhibited a downward trend during flowering transition and followed by a gradual increase during the flower development. The transcripts of AP1 was only detected during the floral development, whereas the transcript level of FLC was high during the vegetative stages. The expression profiles of AGL24 , SOC1 , AP1 and FLC genes indicate that these key integrators might play the essential and evolutionarily conserved roles in control of flowering switch across the plant kingdom. We also identified 54 L. japonica genes encoding enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Most highly expressed genes centered on the MEP pathway, suggesting that this plastid pathway might represent the major pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis in L. japonica . In addition, 33 and 31 key genes encoding enzymes involved in the carotenogenesis and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were identified, respectively. PSY transcripts gradually increased during the flower development, supporting its role as the first rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid skeleton production. The expression level of most anthocyanin biosynthetic genes was dramatically decreased during the flower developmental stages, consistent with the decline in the contents of anthocyanin.

METHODS We searched various electronic databases and the grey literature for relevant studies published from January 1990 to December 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies and case-control studies that included data on health care workers wearing N95 respirators and surgical masks to prevent acute respiratory infections were included in the meta-analysis. Surrogate exposure studies comparing N95 respirators and surgical masks using manikins or adult volunteers under simulated conditions were summarized separately. Outcomes from clinical studies were laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, influenza-like illness and workplace absenteeism. Outcomes from surrogate exposure studies were filter penetration, face-seal leakage and total inward leakage. RESULTS We identified 6 clinical studies (3 RCTs, 1 cohort study and 2 case-control studies) and 23 surrogate exposure studies. In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RCTs: odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.24; cohort study: OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.03-6.41; case-control studies: OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.25-3.36); (b) influenza-like illness (RCTs: OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19-1.41); or (c) reported workplace absenteeism (RCT: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.57-1.50).

Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PLpro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with ubiquitin, facilitating the design of PLpro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels for interferon (IFN)- and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate immune-suppressive DUB activity of PLpros is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the context of rational vaccine development. Author Summary Although zoonotic coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have pandemic potential, therapeutics and vaccines that counteract this public health threat are not currently available. Coronaviruses typically employ multiple strategies to evade the hosts innate immune response, which may enhance clinical disease and/or reduce the efficacy of modified live vaccines. The MERS-CoV-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) is not only crucial for the expression of functional replicase proteins, but has also been postulated to antagonize ubiquitination-dependent steps during the activation of the innate immune response. Here, we report the generation of engineered MERS-CoVs mutants in which PLpros deubiquitinating (DUB) activity was specifically disrupted without affecting virus viability. In this manner, we could demonstrate that the DUB activity of PLpro suppresses the interferon response in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Strikingly, in the lungs of mice infected with DUB-negative MERS-CoV, innate immune responses were induced at an earlier stage of infection than in wt virus-infected mice. This group also showed a clearly increased survival, indicating that the DUB activity is an important MERS-CoV virulence factor. This proof-of-concept study establishes that the engineering of DUB-negative coronaviruses, which elicit a more effective immune response in the host, is a viable strategy for vaccine development.","output":"The deubiquitinating activity of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease delays the innate immune response and enhances virulence in a mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post COVID-19, mucormycosis occurred after the SARS-CoV-2 has rampaged the human population and is a scorching problem among the pandemic globally, particularly among Asian countries.

In this review, we explored the potential therapeutic role of volatile anesthetics during mechanical ventilation in the late stages of the disease. COVID-19 is thought to hit the human body via five major mechanisms: direct viral damage, immune overactivation, capillary thrombosis, loss of alveolar capillary membrane integrity, and decreased tissue oxygenation. The overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines will eventually lead to the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs, which will lead to ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure resulting from ARDS is thought to be the most common cause of death in COVID-19. The literature suggests that these effects could be directly countered by using volatile anesthetics for sedation. These agents possess multiple properties that affect viral replication, immunity, and coagulation. They also have proven benefits at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Based on the comprehensive understanding of the literature, short-term sedation with volatile anesthetics may be beneficial in severe stages of COVID-19 ARDS and trials to study their effects should be encouraged.","output":"Sedating mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with volatile anesthetics: insights on the last-minute potential weapons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarize the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments (LREs). Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced and may lack optimal organization and governance, especially concerning surgical health systems. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients. Inclusion criteria: This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery. Methods: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.

Studies show that there is an intensive relationship between insulin and gonadal function. As per Rotterdam Criteria, there are four major phenotypes of PCOS with different presentation. Early detection of Insulin Resistance (IR) and consequential prevention of Metabolic Syndrome (MS) associated with PCOS may lead to better prospect for the disease. Aim: To find the pattern of IR in all the phenotypes of PCOS in relation to Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), Body Mass Index (BMI) and Testosterone and thereby, providing data for designing phenotype specific treatment of the disease. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, fasting insulin and fasting glucose were analysed to calculate HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment) and Testosterone for total 144 female subjects of reproductive age group (18-40 years). Subjects were classified in to four groups as per Rotterdam Criteria. Complete PCOS (PCO-COM), PCO with Oligo/Anovulation (PCO-O), Anovulation with Hyperandrogenism (O-HA), and PCO with Hyperandrogenism (PCO-HA). Regression analysis was done to find the relation among the study variables. ANOVA was used to analyse the significant variance among the groups. Results: IR was found to be maximum among O-HA phenotype (2.40.37) and lowest among PCO-HA phenotypes (1.30.22). Regression analysis shows that there exist significant associations between IR and BMI (t=4.96, p=0.001) as well as between IR and WHR (t=2.97, p=0.003). No independent association between testosterone and IR was observed. Conclusion: Significant difference of IR, WHR, and BMI was observed among the four phenotypes of PCOS. Due to increased IR, O-HA and PCO-COM phenotypes are more predisposed to Cardiometabolic consequences of PCOS.","output":"Phenotypic variation of insulin resistance among polycystic ovarian syndrome patients in semiurban North Indian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human Sapoviruses (SaVs) has been reported as one of the causative agents of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. An outbreak of SaVs affected 482 primary school students during spring activities from February 24 to March 11, 2019 in Shenzhen City, China. Our study was aimed at determining the epidemiology of the outbreak, investigating its origins, and making a clear identification of the SaVs genetic diversity. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation was conducted for this AGE outbreak. Stool samples were collected for laboratory tests of causative agents. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and conventional RT-PCR were used for detecting and genotyping of SaVs. The nearly complete genome of GII.8 SaV strains were amplified and sequenced by using several primer sets designed in this study. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to characterize the genome of GII.8 SaV strains. RESULTS: The single factor analysis showed that the students who were less than 1.5 m away from the vomitus in classroom or playgroundwere susceptible (P < 0.05). Seven of 11 fecal samples from patients were positive for GII.8 SaV genotype. In this study, we obtained the genome sequence of a SaV GII.8 strain Hu/SaV/2019008Shenzhen/2019 /CHN (SZ08) and comprehensively analyzed the genetic diversity. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the GII.8 strain SZ08 formed an independent branch and became a novel variant of GII.8 genotype. Strain SZ08 harbored 11 specific amino acid variations compared with cluster A-D in full-length VP1. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified SaVs as the causative agents for the AGE outbreak. Strain Hu SZ08 was clustered as independent branch and there was no recombination occurred in this strain SZ08. Further, it might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Constant surveillance is required to monitor the emerging variants which will improve our knowledge of the evolution of SaVs among humans.","output":"An outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with a novel GII.8 sapovirus variant-transmitted by vomit in Shenzhen, China, 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 75-year-old woman with a history of postoperative chemotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma and a history of Helicobacter pylori eradication for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was admitted to the department of hematology and oncology for the treatment of anemia 2 weeks after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

Through a literature review and the perspective of members of a national TB Think Tank task team, we describe the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on TB patients and services as well as the potential long-term setback to TB control in South Africa (SA). Strategies to mitigate risk and impact are explored, together with opportunities to leverage synergies from both diseases to the benefit of the National TB Programme (NTP). With the emergence of COVID-19, activities to address this new pandemic have been prioritised across all sectors. Within the health system, the health workforce and resources have been redirected away from routine services towards the new disease priority. The social determinants of health have deteriorated during the lockdown, potentially increasing progression to TB disease and impacting negatively on people with TB and their households, resulting in additional barriers to accessing TB care, with early reports of a decline in TB testing rates. Fewer TB diagnoses, less attention to adherence and support during TB treatment, poorer treatment outcomes and consequent increased transmission will increase the TB burden and TB-related mortality. People with TB or a history of TB are likely to be vulnerable to COVID-19. Modifications to current treatment practices are suggested to reduce visits to health facilities and minimise the risks of COVID-19 exposure. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact on TB control in TB-endemic settings such as SA. However, there are COVID-19-related health systems-strengthening developments that may help the NTP mitigate the impact of the pandemic on TB control. By integrating TB case finding into the advanced screening, testing, tracing and monitoring systems established for COVID-19, TB case finding and linkage to care could increase, with many more TB patients starting treatment. Similarly, integrating knowledge and awareness of TB into the increased healthcare worker and community education on infectious respiratory diseases, behavioural practices around infection prevention and control, and cough etiquette, including destigmatisation of mask use, may contribute to reducing TB transmission. However, these potential gains could be overwhelmed by the impact of increasing poverty and other social determinants of health on the burden of TB.","output":"Opportunities from a new disease for an old threat: Extending COVID-19 efforts to address tuberculosis in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to neutralize the virus in vitro and prevent disease in animal challenge models on reexposure. However, the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics and longevity is conflicting. METHODS: The COVID-19 Staff Testing of Antibody Responses Study (Co-Stars) prospectively enrolled 3679 healthcare workers to comprehensively characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor-binding domain, and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies in parallel. Participants screening seropositive had serial monthly serological testing for a maximum of 7 months with the Meso Scale Discovery Assay. Survival analysis determined the proportion of seroreversion, while 2 hierarchical gamma models predicted the upper and lower bounds of long-term antibody trajectory. RESULTS: A total of 1163 monthly samples were provided from 349 seropositive participants. At 200 days after symptoms, >95% of participants had detectable S antibodies, compared with 75% with detectable N antibodies. S antibody was predicted to remain detectable in 95% of participants until 465 days (95% confidence interval, 370C575 days) using a continuous-decay model and indefinitely using a decay-to-plateau model to account for antibody secretion by long-lived plasma cells. S-antibody titers were correlated strongly with surrogate neutralization in vitro (R(2) = 0.72). N antibodies, however, decayed rapidly with a half-life of 60 days (95% confidence interval, 52C68 days). CONCLUSIONS: The Co-Stars data presented here provide evidence for long-term persistence of neutralizing S antibodies. This has important implications for the duration of functional immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the rapid decay of N antibodies must be considered in future seroprevalence studies and public health decision-making.

This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020. The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate. Using a modification of the Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities. Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to achieve an effective social distancing. This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence. We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19.

ACE2 and its close homolog angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE) are currently discussed candidate genes, in which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could alter binding or entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhance tissue damage in the lung or other organs. This could increase the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genotyping of SNPs in the genes ACE2 and ACE in 297 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 253 SARS-CoV-2-negative tested patients. We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding demographics and clinical characteristics. For ACE2 rs2285666, the GG genotype or G-allele was significantly associated with an almost two-fold increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and a three-fold increased risk to develop serious disease or COVID-19 fatality. In contrast, the ACE polymorphism was not related to infection risk or severity of disease. In a multivariable analysis, the ACE2 rs2285666 G-allele remained as an independent risk factor for serious disease besides the known risk factors male gender and cardiovascular disease.

A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was carried out during July 2020 in University Clinical Hospital Center Bezanijska Kosa in Belgrade, Serbia that included 62.8% of all HCWs. Besides serological testing for IgG antibodies, data about HCWs intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination if a vaccine became available were collected. This cohort of HCWs was followed up until the end of October 2021 to assess the number of vaccinated and PCR-positive staff. In the cross-sectional study, 18.3% HCWs had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies without difference with IgG-negative HCWs regarding age, gender, profession type, and years of service. Before vaccines became available, a significantly higher percentage of IgG-positive HCWs compared to IgG-negative HCWs was unsure whether to be vaccinated (62.5% vs. 49.0%), and significantly fewer stated that they would not be vaccinated (16.7% vs. 25.1%). When the vaccines became available in Serbia, among IgG-negative HCWs, those who stated clear positive (yes) and clear negative (no) attitude toward vaccination before the immunization period had begun were vaccinated at 28% and 20%, respectively, while 51% of unsure HCWs received a vaccine (p = 0.006).

However, administration of intramuscular epinephrine in addition to nebulised selective 2-agonist is recommended for acute severe or life-threatening asthma in many prehospital guidelines. We conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy of epinephrine in comparison to selective 2-agonist in acute asthma. METHODS We included peer-reviewed publications of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled children or adults in any healthcare setting and compared epinephrine by any route to selective 2-agonist by any route for an acute asthma exacerbation. The primary outcome was treatment failure, including hospitalisation, need for intubation or death. RESULTS Thirty-eight of 1140 studies were included. Overall quality of evidence was low. Seventeen studies contributed data on 1299 participants to the meta-analysis. There was significant statistical heterogeneity, I2=56%. The pooled Peto's OR for treatment failure with epinephrine versus selective 2-agonist was 0.99 (0.75 to 1.32), p=0.95. There was strong evidence that recruitment age group was associated with different estimates of the odds of treatment failure; with studies recruiting adults-only having lower odds of treatment failure with epinephrine. It was not possible to determine whether epinephrine in addition to selective 2-agonist improved outcomes. CONCLUSION The low-quality evidence available suggests that epinephrine and selective 2-agonists have similar efficacy in acute asthma. There is a need for high-quality double-blind RCTs to determine whether addition of intramuscular epinephrine to inhaled or nebulised selective 2-agonist improves outcome.

In this study, we present the preliminary results of the first clinical study with a newly developed urine foaming test (UFT). METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Istanbul. After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee, urine samples were taken from three groups of patients whose informed consent was obtained. The groups were created according to the COVID-19 Diagnostic Guide of Ministry of Health: A: outpatients with suspected COVID-19, B: inpatients for follow-up and treatment, C: patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU). Also, 30 healthy volunteers were included as the control group D. Urine samples taken from all groups were delivered to the laboratory. 2.5 ml urine sample was added to the test tube and shaken for 15 seconds and the level of foam formed was visually evaluated according to the color scale. Other data of the patients were obtained from the hospital information management system and the physician caring for the patient. The clinical status, PCR test results, computed tomography (CT), if any, laboratory tests, and UFT results were compared and the level of statistical significance was expressed as p0.05 in the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Performance characteristics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the UFT, were statistically calculated according to the RT-PCR result and/or CT. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed between UFT distributions of the control, outpatient, inpatient and ICU patients (p=0.0001). The results of UFT orange and red in inpatients and ICU patients were statistically significantly higher than in the control and outpatient groups. The diagnostic accuracy of UFT was detected in all group, the pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 87C95%) and specificity was 89% (95% CI: 80C98%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that the UFT is useful, particularly in predicting the clinical severity of COVID-19. The UFT could be recommended as a point of care test, rapid and non-invasive method in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19.","output":"The urine foaming test in COVID-19 as a useful tool in diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up: Preliminary results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Osler developed the 1st journal club in 1875 to reduce financial barriers to keeping up with global medical progress Journal clubs have since become a widely accessible tool to improve patient safety & quality care However, maintaining competence today is limited by exponentially increasing complexity & volume while resources stay siloed In response the #RadOnc Twitter journal club was created in 2014 to accelerate knowledge translation across boundaries Its lung cancer projects have included discussions on globally relevant articles, dual hashtags, & crowdsourced summaries to enhance to enhance clinical knowledge, online communication, & critical appraisal Methods: We reviewed data from the journal club since 2014 The format included free article access, a weekend-long asynchronous chat, & a live hour including article authors Targeted invitations were sent prior with introductions posted to a blog Curated open-access summaries were created using Wakelet to facilitate discussions & allow future referencing Dual hashtags (#RadOnc #jc) were tested in 2020 Single & dual hashtag data from January & February was analyzed and compared against chat transcripts to determine if dual hashtags appropriately focused content Selected chats of immediate relevance were thematically analyzed for publication to guide local standards of practice Results: Fifteen chats (37% ) had direct relevance to lung cancer (including palliative/supportive care, SCLC, & NSCLC) with all attended by article authors The most recent lung cancer chat had 496 tweets & 2 9 million impressions Altmetric scores ranged from 15 to 227 (top 5%) We identified 1853 tweets with # RadOnc and 1256 (68%) used #RadOnc #jc Dual hashtags were used by 122/558 (22%) Participants spanned 13 countries (radiation oncologists (54/122, 44%), trainees (15/122, 12%), other physicians (9/122, 7%), patients (5/122, 4%), physicists (2/122, 2%), & radiation therapists (1/122, 1%)) Chats averaged 19 dual hashtag tweets/hr compared to 9 other #radonc tweets/hr (p=0 036) Most dual hashtag content was related to the journal club (542/542 for January & 713/714 for February) Two recent chats resulted in publications in academic journals Conclusion: #RadOnc #jc has overcome limitations of traditional journal clubs & remained at the forefront of changing online practices to sustainably facilitate active global lung cancer discussions This includes use of dual hashtags that are feasible to filter conversations & enable a chat within the hashtag of a growing community of practice It has nurtured diverse perspectives including multidisciplinary experts, patients, & trainees from HICs & LMICs for rich digitized peer review & discussion This informed the publication of the first crowdsourced global oncology guidelines for the COVID19 pandemic & emerging standard techniques for SCLC Aggregation through Wakelet summaries may further reduce the reading burden Together, #RadOnc #jc is becoming a platform for rapid knowledge translation & creation by encouraging & amplifying the voices of the global oncology community through crowdsourcing, rapid review, and open-access publication We continue to assess its outcomes for quality improvement including reviewing our lung cancer specific data, chat metrics, author & article impact, & engagement including feedback from all stakeholders working towards improving cancer care Keywords: Social Media, global oncology, Medical Education","output":"P09.34 Curating Online Journal Clubs to Advance Global Oncology Lung Cancer Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still the most lethal gynecological cancer.

Here, we examined the effect of wearing a face mask on the ability to recognise facial expressions of emotion. In a within-subjects design, 100 UK-based undergraduate students were shown facial expressions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral expression; these were either posed with or without a face mask, or with a face mask artificially imposed onto them. Participants identified the emotion portrayed in the photographs from a fixed choice array of answers and rated their confidence in their selection. While overall accuracy was higher without than with masks, the effect varied across emotions, with a clear advantage without masks in disgust, happiness, and sadness; no effect for neutral, and lower accuracy without masks for anger and fear. In contrast, confidence was generally higher without masks, with the effect clear for all emotions other than anger. These results confirm that emotion recognition is affected by face mask wearing, but reveal that the effect depends on the emotion being displayedwith this emotion-dependence not reflected in subjects confidence. The disparity between the effects of mask wearing on different emotions and the failure of this to be reflected in confidence ratings suggests that mask wearing not only effects emotion recognition, but may also create biases in the perception of facial expressions of emotion of which perceivers are unaware. In addition, the similarity of results between the Imposed Mask and Posed Mask conditions suggests that prior research using artificially imposed masks has not been deleteriously affected by the use of this manipulation.

However, the relationship between microbiota and COVID-19 severity progression is still being assessed. This study aimed to analyse the diversity and taxonomic composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, to determine its association with COVID-19 clinical outcome. Methods and Findings Samples came from a retrospective cohort of adult patients with COVID-19, hospitalised in a tertiary centre. To study the nasopharyngeal microbiota, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing. Raw sequences were processed by QIIME2. The associations between the microbiota, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all-cause mortality were analysed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI), adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity. 177 patients were included: median age 68.0 years, 57.6% males, 59.3% had a Charlson comorbidity index 3, and 89.2% with pneumonia. The microbiota  diversity indexes were lower in patients with a fatal outcome, and this association persisted after adjustment for the main confounders; whereas the  diversity analysis showed a significant clustering, grouping the patients with a fatal outcome. After multivariate adjustment, the presence of Selenomonas spp., Filifactor spp., Actinobacillus spp., or Chroococcidiopsis spp., was associated with a reduced risk of IMV (adjusted OR 0.06[95%CI 0.01C0.0.47], p = 0.007).

Describe results from a scoping review related to personal factors, organizational and workplace factors, and nursing professional development factors related to hospice and palliative care nurses 2. Recognize characteristics of hospice and palliative care nurses (HPCNs) that are associated with burnout and strategies to mitigate burnout Background and Objective Burnout among HPCNs has been rising throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and threatens patient safety and quality of care. The extant literature provides insight into burnout within the interdisciplinary hospice and palliative care team, but little attention has been given among HPCNs specifically. We conducted a scoping review to examine burnout among HPCNs and unify disparate findings. Study Identification Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we systematically searched 8 major databases from 2015 to 2020. Studies were included if they focused on HPCN experiences of burnout, were published in English within the last 5 years with the exception of seminal works, and were discoverable in electronic databases. Exclusion factors included articles that were not focused solely on hospice and palliative nursing, specifically focused on burnout (ie, depression, compassion fatigue, workplace environment), or research articles. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two authors extracted data from the full-text inclusion studies. Results were presented in tabular summary and descriptive summary of quantitative findings. Results Among 1,893 studies, 8 met inclusion criteria. All studies were quantitative, classified as level IV within the rating system for hierarchy of evidence for literature, and spanned across 6 countries. HPCNs working across settings such as inpatient, outpatient, community, and inpatient hospice were represented. Results of studies were coalesced into 3 overarching categories: personal factors, organizational or workplace factors, and nursing professional development factors. Each of these categories was then divided into three cross-cutting subcategories: contributory and noncontributory factors, mitigating factors, and workplace issues. Conclusions and Implications for Practice, Policy, and Research Burnout among HPCNs may not be entirely preventable, but the recognition of contributory and mitigating factors should be taken into consideration by professional nurses and organizations. Additional research is needed to test workplace interventions suggested in the literature, including whether resilience or self-care measures affect burnout in HPCNs.

By analyzing an original dataset that covers the 2002?15 period and additional debt?economic growth data going up to the year 2020, we are able to suggest three conclusions. First, in the absence of debt, good governance matters in improving economic growth. Second, some dimensions of governance are better predictors of economic performance than others?as the ?good enough governance? literature has in recent years suggested. Third, under no circumstances is debt government growth beneficial for the economic performance of African countries.

We assessed whether a percutaneous device that reduces the diameter of the coronary sinus improved outcomes across multiple endpoints in a phase II trial. METHODS: We conducted a novel analysis performed as a post hoc efficacy analysis of the COSIRA (Coronary Sinus Reducer for Treatment of Refractory Angina) trial, which enrolled patients with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class 3-4 refractory angina. We used four domains: symptoms (CCS Angina Scale), functionality (total exercise duration), ischaemia (imaging) and health-related quality of life. For all domains, we specified a meaningful threshold for change. The primary endpoint was defined as a probability of &#8805;80% that the reducer exceeded the meaningful threshold on two or more domains (group-level analysis) or that the average efficacy score in the reducer group exceeded the sham control group by at least two points (patient-level analysis). RESULTS: We randomised 104 participants to either a device that narrows to coronary sinus (n=52) or a sham implantation (n=52). The reducer group met the prespecified criteria for concordance at the group level and demonstrated improvement in symptoms (0.59 CCS grade, 95% credible interval (CrI)=0.22 to 0.95), total exercise duration (+27.9%, 95% CrI=2.8% to 59.8%) and quality of life (stability +11.2 points, 95% CrI=3.3 to 19.1; perception +11.0, 95% CrI=3.3 to 18.7).

In order to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Using a suite of ribosome profiling techniques2-4, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral transcripts.

Putative targets to prevent systemic inflammatory response syndrome include antagonism of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and CD44 receptors in vascular endothelial cells. Proteoglycan-4 is a mucinous glycoprotein that interacts with CD44 and toll-like receptor 4 resulting in a blockade of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3 pathway. We hypothesized that endothelial cells induced into a sepsis phenotype would have less interleukin-6 expression after recombinant human proteoglycan 4 treatment in vitro. DESIGN: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure interleukin-6 protein and gene expression. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, human lung microvascular endothelial cells, and transgenic mouse (wild type) (Cd44(+/+)/Prg4(+/+)), Cd44(C/C) (Cd44(tm1Hbg)Prg4(+/+)), Prg4(GT/GT) (Cd44(+/+) Prg4(tm2Mawa/J)), and double knockout (Cd44(tm1Hbg) Prg4(tm2Mawa/J)) lung microvascular endothelial cells. INTERVENTIONS: Cells were treated with 100 or 250 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide-Escherichia coli K12 and subsequently treated with recombinant human proteoglycan 4 after 30 minutes. Interleukin-6 levels in conditioned media were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gene expression was measured via reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction with CCt analysis. Additionally, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with 1:10 diluted plasma from 15 patients with sepsis in culture media. After 30 minutes, either 50 or 100 g/mL recombinant human proteoglycan 4 was administered. Interleukin-6 protein and gene expression were assayed. Proteoglycan 4 levels were also compared between control and sepsis patient plasma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell, human lung microvascular endothelial cell, and mouse lung microvascular endothelial cell treated with lipopolysaccharide had significantly increased interleukin-6 protein compared with controls. Recombinant human proteoglycan-4 significantly reduced interleukin-6 in human and mouse endothelial cells. Interleukin-6 gene expression was significantly increased after lipopolysaccharide treatment compared with controls. This response was reversed by 50 or 100 g/mL recombinant human proteoglycan-4 in 80% of sepsis samples in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and in 60C73% in human lung microvascular endothelial cells.

Although related direct medical costs can be substantial, especially if hospitalisations occur, several studies suggested that indirect costs due to the loss of productivity may represent an even higher economic burden. The aim of this study was to assess the costs arising from lost productivity due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses in Switzerland. METHODS Analyses were based on data collected in 2016 and 2017 by the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (SFOPH). The available information covered details on the physicians collecting the data, patients' characteristics, symptoms, treatments, and inability to work (in terms of physician-recorded workdays lost for own sickness or caregiving). The cost of lost productivity, estimated using the human capital approach, was calculated as the number of workdays lost due to influenza-like illnesses multiplied by the mean salary for one working day. Salary differences across sex, age and region were considered. Extrapolation to the national level was performed by adjusting for the size of the Swiss population, the age and sex distribution, the regional distribution, the number of Sentinel general physician contacts and the specialisation of the physician. RESULTS At the Swiss national level, the estimated total yearly number of cases of inability to work due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses was 101,287 in 2016 and 86,373 in 2017. In subgroups defined by year, gender, region and age class, numbers of cases per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 12 to 2396. The total number of workdays lost in Switzerland, considering degree of employment and visit day, were estimated to be 324,118 in 2016 and 278,121 in 2017. The number of workdays lost was generally higher in men (53.7% of the total in 2016 and 55.6% of the total in 2017) than women. The estimated total costs due to inability to work, calculated using a human capital approach and including the caregiving costs, were CHF 115 million in 2016 and CHF 103 million in 2017, equivalent to CHF 1.4 million per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSION The costs of lost productivity due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses in Switzerland are substantial and may vary considerably between different years, regions and age classes. As the present analyses could not consider all causes of lost productivity (e.g., short-term inability to work not requiring a physician consultation, hospitalisations, early retirement, premature death), the total indirect costs due to influenza or influenza-like illnesses can be expected to be higher than the presented estimates.","output":"Productivity losses due to influenza and influenza-like illness in Switzerland: results of the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network in a non-pandemic era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The outcome of well-performed clinical research is essential for evidence-based patient management during pandemics. However, conducting clinical research amidst a pandemic requires researchers to balance clinical and research demands. We seek to understand the values, experiences, and beliefs of physicians working at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform clinical research planning. We aim to understand whether pandemic settings affect physician comfort with research practices, and how physician experiences shape their understanding of research in a pandemic setting. METHODS: A survey tool was adapted to evaluate familiarity and comfort with research during a pandemic. A cross-sectional, online questionnaire was distributed across Canadian research networks early in the COVID-19 outbreak. The survey was administered between March 11th and 17th, 2020, during a time of local transmission but prior to the surge of cases. We aimed to recruit into the survey physicians in infectious disease and critical care research networks across Canada. RESULTS: Of the 133 physician respondents, 131 (98%) considered it important to conduct clinical research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were more accepting of adaptations to the research process in during a pandemic compared to in a non-pandemic setting, including conducting research with deferred consent (&#967;2 = 8.941, 95% CI: -0.264, -0.085, p = 0.003), using non-identifiable observational data with a waiver of consent with a median score of 97 out of 100 (IQR: 79.25-100) vs median 87 out of 100 (IQR: 63-79) (95% CI: -12.43, 0.054, p = 0.052).

The risk of exposure became maximum at the examination of patients, particularly in the collection of respiratory specimens. Effective interventions to reduce the risk are needed. Methods A one-person booth consisting of curtain walls, frames, and fan-HEPA filter-unit (FFU) was designed. Using the airstream from/to FFU, it has dual functions as a positive/negative pressure machine to prevent pathogens in patient's cough to reach the medical staff inside/outside the booth, respectively. The curtain walls and positioning of the patient and staff were aerodynamically optimized for the best control of the airstream. Results The positive pressure booth is to isolate a staff inside to safely deal with a surge in the number of patients in situations like influenza pandemics. The negative pressure booth is to isolate a patient inside to protect a staff outside from dangerous contagious respiratory infectious diseases including COVID-19. A calculated airflow of the positive pressure machine efficiently pushed back bio-particles discharged from a person outside the booth. The bio-particles of a cough from a person inside the negative pressure booth was sucked into the FFU for filtration immediately after the discharge. The booth needed a short front curtain of a stair-cut shape, and a patient and a staff facing each other needed to be positioned at an angle 45 to the airstream for optimization of the airflow. Conclusions The booth named Barriflow? would prevent the bioparticles of a patient's cough to reach the medical staff due to an aerodynamically designed airstream from the FFU and curtains surrounding it.

METHODS: Fourteen children with MIS-C hospitalized at Necker-Enfants Malades for cardiac management during the first three COVID-19 waves (March 2020-March 2021) were included. All had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology and proven cardiac involvement assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.

RESULTS: All admission Galectin-3 measurements were comprised within the reference interval, both in patients with and without cardiogenic shock, and did not vary between admission, discharge and first follow-up clinic. Both median admission BNP and NT-proBNP were higher in children with cardiogenic shock than without. Median admission NT-proBNP was higher than its predictive positive value in heart failure in both groups of children, while median BNP was below its negative predictive value in children without cardiogenic shock but with cardiac dysfunction.

METHODS This study performs a fixed-effects panel data analysis of Italian Regions and Autonomous provinces between the years 2001 and 2017, to investigate the effects of health sector-FD on availability, accessibility, and utilisation of healthcare services in Italy. RESULTS FD decreases availability of staff and hospital beds, decreases utilisation of care, measured by hospitalisation rates, and increases interregional patients' mobility for healthcare purposes, a finding suggesting increased disparities in access to healthcare. These effects seem to be stronger for public - rather than private - services, and are more prominent in poorer areas.

Methods In 2017, a general surgery resident in postgraduate year 4 travelled from VGH to HCCR Polanco for the initial exchange, followed by a trauma fellow. The surgical case volumes in a month at VGH and a month at HCCR Polanco were compared. At the end of the exchange, a 36-item Likert style questionnaire was administered to the Mexican surgeons and residents who interacted with the Canadian resident and fellow during the exchange. Results The most commonly performed procedures on the VGH acute care surgery service were laparoscopic cholecystectomy (35%) and laparoscopic appendectomy (17%). The most commonly performed procedures on the VGH trauma service were chest tube insertions (24%) and tracheostomies (24%). The most commonly performed procedures at HCCR Polanco were surgery for penetrating abdominal trauma (19%) and extremity trauma (13%).

The archetypal members of the MTBC, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, cause human tuberculosis and bovine tuberculosis, respectively. Although M. tuberculosis and M. bovis share over 99.9% genome identity, they show distinct host adaptation for humans and animals; hence, while the molecular basis of host adaptation is encoded in their genomes, the mechanistic basis of host tropism is still unclear. Exploration of the in vitro phenotypic consequences of known genetic difference between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis offers one route to explore genotypeCphenotype links that may play a role in host adaptation. The TbD1 (Mycobacterium tuberculosis deletion 1 region) locus encompasses the mmpS6 and mmpL6 genes. TbD1 is absent in M. tuberculosis modern lineages (Lineages 2, 3, and 4) but present in ancestral M. tuberculosis (Lineages 1 and 7), Mycobacterium africanum lineages (Lineages 5 and 6), newly identified M. tuberculosis lineages (Lineages 8 and 9), and animal adapted strains, such as M. bovis. The function of TbD1 has previously been investigated in M. tuberculosis, where conflicting data has emerged on the role of TbD1 in sensitivity to oxidative stress, while the underlying mechanistic basis of such a phenotype is unclear. In this study, we aimed to shed further light on the role of the TbD1 locus by exploring its function in M. bovis. Toward this, we constructed an M. bovis TbD1 knockout (TbD1) strain and conducted comparative transcriptomics to define global gene expression profiles of M. bovis wild-type (WT) and the TbD1 strains under in vitro culture conditions (rolling and standing cultures).

The etiopathogenesis of KD is not fully understood. The present review synthesizes the recent advances in the pathophysiology and treatment options of KD. According to different studies, the genetic, infections and autoimmunity factors play a major role in pathogenesis. Several susceptibility genes (e.g. caspase 3) and cytokines (e.g. IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) have been identified in KD. Patients with high cytokine levels are predisposed to KD shock syndrome. The importance of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease is unclear. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may induce in children and adults an abnormal systemic inflammatory response.

This comprehensive review discusses the safety, indications, clinical efficacy, and dosing of droperidol for use in the emergency department (ED) setting. SUMMARY: In 2001 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated a boxed warning in the labeling of droperidol after reports of QT interval prolongation associated with droperidol use. Since that time, it has been difficult to access droperidol in the United States; as a result, many practicing clinicians lack experience in its clinical use. Multiple studies have been conducted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of droperidol use in ED patients. Results consistently show the safety of droperidol and its clinical efficacy when used as an analgesic, antiemetic, and sedative. Now that droperidol is more widely available for use in the US market, pharmacists and prescribers need to reliably translate safety and efficacy data compiled since 2001 to help ensure appropriate and effective use of the medication. CONCLUSION: Droperidol is an effective and safe option for the treatment of acute agitation, migraine, nausea, and pain for patients in the ED setting.

Retirement homes are particularly vulnerable due to the higher mortality risk of infected elderly individuals. Once an outbreak occurs, suppressing the spread of the virus in retirement homes is challenging because the residents are in contact with each other, and isolation measures cannot be widely enforced. Regular testing strategies, on the other hand, have been shown to effectively prevent outbreaks in retirement homes. However, high frequency testing may consume substantial staff working time, which results in a trade-off between the time invested in testing, and the time spent providing essential care to residents. Thus, developing an optimal testing strategy is crucial to proactively detect infections while guaranteeing efficient use of limited staff time in these facilities. Although numerous efforts have been made to prevent the virus from spreading in long-term care facilities, this is the first study to develop testing strategies based on formal optimization methods. This paper proposes two novel optimization models for testing schedules. The models aim to minimize the risk of infection in retirement homes, considering the trade-off between the probability of infection and staff workload. We employ a probabilistic approach in conjunction with the optimization models, to compute the risk of infection, including contact rates, incidence status, and the probability of infection of the residents. To solve the models, we propose an enhanced local search algorithm by leveraging the symmetry property of the optimal solution. We perform several experiments with realistically sized instances and show that the proposed approach can derive optimal testing strategies.","output":"Modeling COVID-19 optimal testing strategies in long-term care facilities: An optimization-based approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease that can rapidly escalate to respiratory failure and death.

Informed by the Technology Acceptance Model and a larger mixed methods study, a cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to students (aged between 18 and 34 years of age) at a University in Ontario. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify attitude-based profiles that exist among the sample while general linear modeling was applied to identify the association between latent classes and future symptom checker use for self-triage. Of the 1,547 students who opened the survey link, 1,365 did not use a symptom checker in the past year and were thus identified as non-users. After removing missing data (remaining sample = n = 1,305), LCA revealed five attitude-based profiles: tech acceptors, tech rejectors, skeptics, tech seekers, and unsure acceptors. Tech acceptors and tech rejectors were the most and least prevalent classes, respectively. As compared to tech rejectors, tech seekers and unsure acceptors were the latent classes with the highest and lowest odds of future symptom checker use, respectively. After controlling for confounders, the effect of latent classes on symptom checker use remains significant (p-value < .0001) with the odds of future use in tech acceptors being 5.6 times higher than the odds of future symptom checker use in tech rejectors [CI: (3.458, 9.078); p-value < .0001]. Attitudes towards AI and symptom checker functionality result in different population profiles that have different odds of using symptom checkers for self-triage.

The use of real-time genomic epidemiology has enabled the tracking of SARS-CoV-2 circulation patterns worldwide, thus informing evidence-based public health decision making, including implementation of travel restrictions and vaccine rollout strategies. However, insufficient capacity for local genetic sequencing in Ukraine and other Lower and Middle-Income countries limit opportunities for similar analyses. Herein, we report local sequencing of 24 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patient samples collected in Kyiv in July 2021 using Oxford Nanopore MinION technology. Together with other published Ukrainian SARS-COV-2 genomes sequenced mostly abroad, our data suggest that the second wave of the epidemic in Ukraine (February-April 2021) was dominated by the Alpha variant of concern (VOC), while the beginning of the third wave has been dominated by the Delta VOC. Furthermore, our phylogeographic analysis revealed that the Delta variant was introduced into Ukraine in summer 2021 from multiple locations worldwide, with most introductions coming from Central and Eastern European countries.

Nevertheless, a previous zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is still causing concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and neighbour countries. The MERS-CoV has been reported from respiratory samples in more than 27 countries, and around 2500 cases have been reported with an approximate fatality rate of 35%. After its emergence in 2012 intermittent, sporadic cases, nosocomial infections and many community clusters of MERS continued to occur in many countries. Human-to-human transmission resulted in the large outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. The inherent genetic variability among various clads of the MERS-CoV might have probably paved the events of cross-species transmission along with changes in the inter-species and intra-species tropism. The current review is drafted using an extensive review of literature on various databases, selecting of publications irrespective of favouring or opposing, assessing the merit of study, the abstraction of data and analysing data. The genome of MERS-CoV contains around thirty thousand nucleotides having seven predicted open reading frames. Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the four main structural proteins. The surface located spike protein (S) of betacoronaviruses has been established to be one of the significant factors in their zoonotic transmission through virus-receptor recognition mediation and subsequent initiation of viral infection.

However, Taiwan is a country with a low COVID-19 threat, and people's daily lives have remained mostly unchanged during this period. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the trend of trauma incidence and the service of trauma care is affected by the relatively minor COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. DESIGN: A single-institute, retrograde cohort study. SETTING: An observational study based on the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). PARTICIPANTS: Trauma patients presented to the emergency department of CGMH in the period of 1 January to 30 June 2020 (week 1 to week 26) were designated as the COVID-19 group, with 1980 patients in total. Patients of the same period in 2015-2019 were designated as the pre-COVID-19 group, with 10 334 patients overall. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is the incidence of trauma admission. Differences in trauma mechanism, severity, location and outcome were also compared in both groups. RESULTS: A decrease in trauma incidence during March and April 2020 was noticed. Significant change (p<0.001) in trauma mechanisms was discovered, with decreased burn (5.8% vs 3.6%) and assault (4.8% vs 1.2%), and increased transport accidents (43.2% vs 47.2%) and suicide (0.2% vs 1.0%) in the COVID-19 cohort. A shift in injury locations was also found with a 5% decrement of workplace injuries (19.8% vs 14.8%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The limited COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan has led to a decreased incidence of trauma patients, and the reduction is mostly attributed to the decline in workplace injuries.","output":"How much could a low COVID-19 pandemic change the injury trends?

We also describe the problems triggered by this ideology: the need to shift from dead imagination (culture, difference, etc.) to unearthing the groundwater of the economy and globalization in the way interculturality functions.

However, the consequences of lockdown on psychotic symptoms have not yet been investigated. Methods: An online survey was run from April 13 to May 11, 2020;a total of 728 French subjects from the general population participated. We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of self-isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and anomalous perceptual perceptions were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale. Measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, emotion regulation, and perseverative thinking were also included. Results: Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables, loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27). Neither length of self-isolation nor the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with psychotic experiences in the final models. Conclusions: No evidence was found between a significant impact of self-isolation on psychotic symptoms in the general population in France one month after the lockdown.

In recent times, popularity of external fixators has decreased with the use of mini-plates, often only used in major trauma, for example gunshot wounds. This is a case series of patients who have been treated by external fixation for medication related osteonecrosis (MRONJ) of the jaw and could be a fairly simple alternative to major reconstructive surgery in such cases. This method of treatment has been particularly useful during the Covid-19 pandemic as a non-aerosol generating procedure. METHOD: A single centre, retrospective study of 5 cases between December 2018 - December 2020. The MRONJ cases were graded using the AAOMS classification. All cases treated with external fixation of mandible were included. Pre-operative condition, medical history, treatment complications, pain management, length of treatment and follow-up results were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 5 cases treated for MRONJ, 4 of these had pathological fractures. All were AAOMS stage 3. The mean duration of treatment was 78 days, with regular clinical reviews monitoring progress. Of these cases, 4 cases healed well with significant improvement or closure of intraoral and extra-oral wounds.

The epitope (398)HEEAIYDDV(406) was deleted in SH strain (isolated by our lab) and different between CV777 and YZ strain (isolated by our lab). To study the characters of this epitope, four peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of SH and CV777 and used in the study. The result showed that the 398(th) amino acid maybe an important amino acid of the epitope. Biological information analysis showed that the three B cell linear epitopes are highly conserved among different PEDV isolates. In addition, McAb 1C9, which attached to the epitope (398)HEEAIYDDV(406), showed variant reactivity with PEDV CV777, SH, YZ and MS strains. McAb 1C9 reacted with PEDV strains CV777 and YZ, but not with SH which had a deletion from 399 to 410 amino acids in N-protein (No. MK841494). Among the three McAbs, 6A11, 3F10 and 1C9, only 6A11 reacted with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in immunofluorescence assay, therefore the other two could be used to distinguish TGEV and PEDV.

LLD impacts well-being, with loneliness and small social networks being typical. It has also been linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk of developing dementia. Safety and efficacy of pharmacological treatments for LLD have been debated, and cognitive dysfunction often persists even after remission. Various cognitive interventions have been proposed for LLD. Among these, one has received special attention: foreign language learning could serve as a social intervention that simultaneously targets brain structures affected in LLD. Lifelong bilingualism may significantly delay the onset of cognitive impairment symptoms by boosting cognitive reserve. Even late-life foreign language learning without lifelong bilingualism can train cognitive flexibility. It is then counterintuitive that the effects of language learning on LLD have never been examined. In order to create a theoretical basis for further interdisciplinary research, this paper presents a status quo of current work through two meta-analyses investigating cognitive functioning in LLD on the one hand and in senior bilinguals or seniors following a language course on the other hand. While LLD was consistently associated with cognitive dysfunction, inconsistent results were found for bilingualism and language learners.

In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search. We also searched for unpublished data by contacting the corresponding authors of the included studies and pharmaceutical companies involved in conducting studies on eplerenone monotherapy in primary hypertension. The search had no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We selected randomized placebo-controlled trials studying adult patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies in people with secondary or gestational hypertension and studies where participants were receiving multiple antihypertensives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Three review authors independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. A fourth independent review author resolved discrepancies or disagreements. We performed data extraction and synthesis using a standardized format on Covidence. We conducted data analysis using Review Manager 5. MAIN RESULTS A total of 1437 adult patients participated in the five randomized parallel group studies, with treatment durations ranging from 8 to 16 weeks. The daily doses of eplerenone ranged from 25 mg to 400 mg daily. Meta-analysis of these studies showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 9.21 mmHg (95% CI -11.08 to -7.34; I2 = 58%) and a reduction of diastolic pressure of 4.18 mmHg (95% CI -5.03 to -3.33; I2 = 0%) (moderate quality evidence).There may be a dose response effect for eplerenone in the reduction in systolic blood pressure at doses of 400 mg/day. However, this finding is uncertain, as it is based on a single included study with low quality evidence. Overall there does not appear to be a clinically important dose response in lowering systolic or diastolic blood pressure at eplerenone doses of 50 mg to 400 mg daily. There did not appear to be any differences in the number of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or the number of patients with at least one adverse event in the eplerenone group compared to placebo. However, only three of the five included studies reported adverse events. Most of the included studies were of moderate quality, as we judged multiple domains as being at unclear risk in the 'Risk of bias' assessment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Eplerenone 50 to 200 mg/day lowers blood pressure in people with primary hypertension by 9.21 mmHg systolic and 4.18 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, with no difference of effect between doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. A dose of 25 mg/day did not produce a statistically significant reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and there is insufficient evidence for doses above 200 mg/day. There is currently no available evidence to determine the effect of eplerenone on clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality or morbidity in hypertensive patients. The evidence available on side effects is insufficient and of low quality, which makes it impossible to draw conclusions about potential harm associated with eplerenone treatment in hypertensive patients.","output":"Eplerenone for hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simplified model of the belt motion with small strains is proposed.

The mutation represents a 40-kb intragenic deletion allele of the dystonin gene on chromosome 1 with exactly defined deletion borders. It was demonstrated by Western blot, mass spectrometry, and immunohistology that mice with a homozygous mutation were entirely devoid of the dystonin protein. Pathomorphological lesions were restricted to the brain stem and spinal cord and consisted of swollen, argyrophilic axons and dilated myelin sheaths in the white matter and, less frequently, total chromatolysis of neurons in the gray matter. Axonal damage was detected by amyloid precursor protein and nonphosphorylated neurofilament immunohistology. Axonopathy in the central nervous system (CNS) represents the hallmark of this disease. Mice with the dystonin mutation also showed suppurative inflammation in the respiratory tract, presumably due to brain stem lesion-associated food aspiration, whereas skeletal muscles showed no pathomorphological changes.

Stress and trauma-related disorders lead to a prominent inflammatory response in humans, and in pre-clinical models. However, mechanisms underlying the induction of neuroinflammatory response in PTSD and anxiety disorders are not clearly understood. The present study investigated the mechanism underlying the activation of proinflammatory NLRP3 inflammasome and IL1 in mouse models of stress. METHODS: We used two mouse models of stress, i.e., mice subjected to physical restraint stress with brief underwater submersion, and predator odor stress. Mice were injected with MCC950, a small molecule specific inhibitor of NLRP3 activation. To pharmacologically inhibit BTK, a specific inhibitor ibrutinib was used. To validate the observation from ibrutinib studies, a separate group of mice was injected with another BTK-specific inhibitor LFM-A13. Seven days after the induction of stress, mice were examined for anxious behavior using open field test (OFT), lightCdark test (LDT), and elevated plus maze test (EPM). Following the behavior tests, hippocampus and amygdale were extracted and analyzed for various components of NLRP3Ccaspase 1CIL1 pathway. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also used to assess the induction of NLRP3CCaspase 1CIL-1 pathway in stressed mice. RESULTS: Using two different pre-clinical models of stress, we demonstrate heightened anxious behavior in female mice as compared to their male counterparts. Stressed animals exhibited upregulation of proinflammatory IL1, IL-6, Caspase 1 activity and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in brain, which were significantly higher in female mice. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation led to anxiolysis as well as attenuated neuroinflammatory response. Further, we observed induction of activated Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK), an upstream positive-regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in hippocampus and amygdala of stressed mice. Next, we conducted proof-of-concept pharmacological BTK inhibitor studies with ibrutinib and LFM-A13. In both sets of experiments, we found BTK inhibition led to anxiolysis and attenuated neuroinflammation, as indicated by significant reduction of NLRP3 inflammasome and proinflammatory IL-1 in hippocampus and amygdala. Analysis of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated peripheral induction of NLRP3Ccaspase 1CIL1 pathway in stressed mice. CONCLUSION: Our study identified BTK as a key upstream regulator of neuroinflammation, which drives anxiogenic behavior in mouse model of stress. Further, we demonstrated the sexually divergent activation of BTK, providing a clue to heightened neuroinflammation and anxiogenic response to stress in females as compared to their male counterparts. Our data from the pharmacological inhibition studies suggest BTK as a novel target for the development of potential clinical treatment of PTSD and anxiety disorders. Induction of pBTK and NLRP3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of stressed mice suggest the potential effect of stress on systemic inflammation.

The questionnaire was anonymized and contained questions about variables such as sociodemographic and professional characteristics, recent history of traveling abroad, presence of a chronic disease history, level of knowledge about Covid-19, ways of obtaining information, and measures taken in their daily and professional lives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered following the information form. Results: In the specified timeframe, 1249 doctors who completed the questionnaire in full were included in the study. Of the study participants, 50.4% reported that they were psychologically affected by current events related to Covid-19. The mean score of the HADS anxiety subscale was 7.342 (standard deviation [SD] = 4.756) and the mean score of the depression subscale was 5.64 (SD = 4.236). It was observed that physicians who state being affected psychologically have lower levels of knowledge and higher anxiety and depression scores than physicians who declare not to be affected. In addition, it was found that being of the female gender, having a mental illness, having a family member with a chronic illness, and living with one's family are associated with increased levels of anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The anxiety levels of physicians in Turkey having to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic increase significantly as is the case in other parts of the world. It will be beneficial to take necessary precautions for physicians with characteristics that may be related to anxiety. It is important to create and maintain psychosocial support programs for all physicians.

The purpose of this review was to build upon 2 prior systematic reviews to critique, analyze, and synthesize the evidence pertaining to the impact of family caregiver and dyad interventions on stroke survivor and family caregiver outcomes. CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMed, and reference lists were searched from December 1, 2016 through March 31, 2021. Using PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), articles were identified that tested outcomes from stroke family caregiver or dyad interventions that targeted the health or well-being of family caregivers. Data from the articles were abstracted into tables for analysis, then compared with recommendations from the 2 prior systematic reviews. A total of 18 articles met inclusion criteria (10 caregiver interventions; 8 dyad interventions) representing sample sizes ranging from 7 to 349 caregivers or dyads. Most were randomized controlled trials (n=13); 2 were cluster randomized trials; and 3 were single-group quasi-experimental designs. Of the 18 studies, 8 had <50 caregivers or dyads and 5 were small feasibility studies that reported data trends rather than testing for significance. Only 6 studies reported significant survivor outcomes. Eleven studies reported significant caregiver outcomes, the most common being burden. A number of survivor and caregiver outcomes were not significant, or only significant for certain subgroups. The limited number of studies, small sample sizes, and conflicting results, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact of these interventions on outcomes. Based on the available evidence from these 18 studies, recommendations from the 2 prior reviews were generally supported.

However, scarce data was presented this day. Our study was conducted to determine the prevalence of ED and its associated factors among Thai patients with COVID-19. Methods Sexually active males with COVID-19, hospitalized between May and July 2021 at one university hospital in Bangkok, were screened for erectile dysfunction by the International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5). Demographic data and COVID-19 treatment history were collected. Mental health status, including depression and anxiety, was evaluated with the Thai Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively. The sample size was calculated, and logistic regression was used to analyze the association. Results One hundred fifty-three men with COVID-19 were recruited. ED prevalence was 64.7%, of which severity was mostly mild. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, BMI, and medical comorbidities, portrayed a significant association between ED and mental health status. Higher risk of ED was found in participants with major depression [adjusted OR 8.45, 95% CI: 1.01-70.96, P=0.049] and higher GAD-7 total score [adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.31, P=0.039].

The lockdown affected transportation, access to health care facilities, and availability of medicines and consumables as well as outpatient and inpatient services. We aimed to analyze the effect of lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with kidney diseases in India. Methods: We surveyed 19 major hospitals (8 in the public and 11 in the private sector) to determine the effect of lockdown on the care of patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis after the first 3 weeks of lockdown. Results: The total number of dialysis patients in these centers came down from 2517 to 2404. Approximately 710 (28.2%) patients missed 1 or more dialysis sessions, 69 (2.74%) required emergency dialysis sessions, 104 (4.13%) stopped reporting for dialysis, and 9 (0.36%) were confirmed to have died. Outpatient attendance in the surveyed hospital came down by 92.3%, and inpatient service reduced by 61%. Tele-consultation was started but was accessed by only a small number of patients. Conclusion: Lack of preparedness before lockdown resulted in an interruption in health care services and posed an immediate adverse effect on the outcome of dialysis patients and patients with kidney disease in India.

Increasing the temperature of the aqueous phase used to prepare the parent emulsion leads to an increase in average void and interconnect size in the resulting porous material. Additionally, the presence in the aqueous phase of small quantities of organic additives that are capable of partitioning between the two emulsion phases also affects the morphology of the porous material obtained. The additives examined were tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), all of which were found to increase the average void and interconnect diameters. It is suggested that THF and, to a lesser extent, PEG enhance Ostwald ripening, resulting in emulsion coarsening over time. Evidence for this was gleaned from NMR experiments to determine the rates of water diffusion in each emulsion. However, methanol was shown not to affect the rate of water diffusion. An alternative mechanism by which methanol could affect the emulsion stability is by depleting surfactant from the interface. However, higher levels of surfactant in emulsions containing methanol did not have a significant effect on morphology. To explain this, we suggest that methanol may result in depletion of surfactant from the emulsion interface, however additional surfactant serves not only to replace this depleted surfactant but also to increase the number of w/o micelles in the continuous phase. These facilitate transport of water between droplets, thus negating the effect of replacing the surfactant lost from the interface.","output":"Tailoring the morphology of emulsion-templated porous polymers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial challenges for public health officials who must communicate pandemic-related risks and recommendations to the public.

The results of our study suggest that risk perceptions may vary across preferences for conservative or liberal bias; however, our results do not support differences in the mitigation behavior across patterns of media use. Further, our findings do not support the notion of echo chambers, but rather suggest that people with lower information-seeking behavior may be more strongly influenced by politicized COVID-19 news. Risk estimates converge at higher levels of information seeking, suggesting that high information seekers consume news from sources across the political spectrum.

Such evasion is related to the unstable nature of its RNA, in particular the S glycoprotein encoding gene, which raises great challenges with regard to the control of the disease, along with the lack of proof reading mechanisms of the RNA polymerase. The emergence of new variants might be a reason for the endemic outbreaks that are being reported in Tunisia, in addition to poor vaccination techniques and ineffective prophylactic programs. In the present study, partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene and the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of 2 Tunisian isolates, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16, identified in 2016, were determined. Specific mutations were found in S1 gene as well as in 3UTR region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that both isolates are closely related to the Algerian strains, and formed a common cluster within the genotype I. In addition, these isolates were non-recombinant ones, confirming that they are unique variants. Based on their S1 gene sequences, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16 strains were distant from the H120 vaccine strain, commercially used in Tunisia along with the variant vaccine 793B type (4/91). A comparison between nucleotide sequences of their 3UTR region and S1 gene showed a difference in IBV classification.

AIM: To identify correlates of adults' mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium and to assess the role of meaningful activities in particular. METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey for assessing mental health (General Health Questionnaire), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), meaning in activities (Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey), and demographics was conducted during the first Belgian lockdown between April 24 and May 4, 2020. The lockdown consisted of closing schools, non-essential shops, and recreational settings, employees worked from home or were technically unemployed, and it was forbidden to undertake social activities. Every adult who had access to the internet and lived in Belgium could participate in the survey; respondents were recruited online through social media and e-mails. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify key correlates. RESULTS: Participants (N = 1781) reported low mental health (M = 14.85/36). In total, 42.4% of the variance in mental health could be explained by variables such as gender, having children, living space, marital status, health condition, and resilience (= -.33).

Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a pre-fusion membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs. Research in context Evidence before this study The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the major antigen that notably induces neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry. Many COVID-19 vaccines are under development, among them viral vectors expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit many benefits. Viral vector vaccines have the potential of being used as both live or inactivated vaccines and they can induce Th1 and Th2-based immune responses following different immunization regimens. Additionally, viral vector vaccines can be handled under BSL-2 conditions and they grow to high titers in cell cultures or other species restricted-hosts. For a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, several viral vectors are being tested, such as adenovirus, measles virus and Modified vaccinia Ankara. Added value of this study The NDV vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 described in this study has advantages similar to those of other viral vector vaccines. But the NDV vector can be amplified in embryonated chicken eggs, which allows for high yields and low costs per dose. Also, the NDV vector is not a human pathogen, therefore the delivery of the foreign antigen would not be compromised by any pre-existing immunity in humans. Finally, NDV has a very good safety record in humans, as it has been used in many oncolytic virus trials. This study provides an important option for a cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Implications of all the available evidence This study informs of the value of a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, for this NDV based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufactures in the U.S. and worldwide would have the capacity to rapidly produce hundreds of millions of doses to mitigate the consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as vaccine candidate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnancy comprises a unique immunological condition, to allow fetal development and to protect the host from pathogenic infections.

Sheep are a commonly farmed domestic ruminant that have not been thoroughly investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we performed in vitro and in vivo studies which consisted of infection of ruminant-derived cells and experimental challenge of sheep to investigate their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that sheep-derived kidney cells support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the experimental challenge of sheep demonstrated limited infection with viral RNA shed in nasal and oral swabs at 1 and 3-days post challenge (DPC); viral RNA was also detected in the respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues at 4 and 8 DPC.

We studied in the early phase of pandemic consecutive patients (N = 383) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whose subsequent clinical course was classified as mild or severe, the latter being characterized by admission to intensive therapy unit or death. Five host gene polymorphisms (MERTK rs4374383, PNPLA3 rs738409, TLL-1 rs17047200, IFNL3 rs1297860, and INFL4 rs368234815) were assessed by using whole nucleic acids extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Specific protease cleavage sites of TLL-1 on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were predicted in silico. Male subjects and older patients were significantly at higher risk for a severe outcome (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively). By considering patients 65 years, after adjusting for potential confounding due to sex, an increased risk of severe outcome was found in subjects with the GG genotype of PNPLA3 (adj-OR: 4.69; 95% CI = 1.01C22.04) or TT genotype of TLL-1 (adj-OR=9.1; 95% CI = 1.45C57.3). In silico evaluation showed that TLL-1 is potentially involved in the Spike protein cleavage which is essential for viral binding and entry into the host cells using the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Subjects carrying a GG genotype in PNPLA3 gene might have a constitutive upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and be more prone to tissue damage when infected by SARS-CoV-2. The TT genotype in TLL-1 gene might affect its protease activity on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, enhancing the ability to infect or re-infect hosts cells. The untoward effect of these variants on disease course is evident in younger patients due to the relative absence of comorbidities as determinants of prognosis. In the unresolved pathogenetic scenery of COVID-19, the identification of genetic variants associates with more prolonged course or with a severe outcome of infection would support the development of predictive tools useful to stratify subjects by risk class at presentation. Moreover, the individuation of key genes could contribute to a better understanding of the pathways involved in the pathogenesis, giving the basis for rational therapeutic approaches.","output":"PNPLA3 and TLL-1 Polymorphisms as Potential Predictors of Disease Severity in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article.","output":"Correction to: The tree that hides the forest: cryptic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in the Palaearctic vector Obsoletus/Scoticus complex (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) at the European level."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The ENDOSTROKE registry aims to accompany the spreading use of endovascular stroke treatment (EVT) in academic and non-academic hospitals. This analysis focuses on preprocedural imaging, patient handling and referral, as well as on different treatment modalities in mechanical recanalization. METHODS Data for this study were from observational registry study in 12 stroke centers in Germany and Austria with online assessment of prespecified variables concerning endovascular stroke therapy. RESULTS Data from 734 patients undergoing EVT were analyzed. Preferred imaging modality prior to EVT was CT (83 %) and CTA (78 %). In 95 %, EVT was performed under general anesthesia. In 55 % of patients, a combination of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and EVT was used, followed by pure EVT (25 %), intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis plus EVT (13 %) and IV + IA thrombolysis plus EVT (7 %). Intrahospital time delay until start of EVT was 91 and 99 min in anterior and vertebrobasilar circulation stroke, respectively. Average duration of EVT was 60 min. Overall thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 2/3 recanalization rate was 85 %. Stent retrievers were used in 75 %, being associated with higher recanalization rates than non-stent retrievers. Hemorrhagic complications (symptomatic and asymptomatic) occurred in 12 %. Overall vessel occlusion time was approximately 60 min longer in patients being referred from a primary care hospital for EVT. CONCLUSION This study gives an overview of procedure-related factors in current EVT practice. It gives estimates on preprocedural imaging modalities, periprocedural handling, and treatment combinations used for EVT.

Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Participants (N = 320; 54.7% male; mean age of 32 years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period beginning within 1 month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. RESULTS The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. CONCLUSIONS Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic.","output":"Drinking to Cope During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of External and Internal Factors in Coping Motive Pathways to Alcohol Use, Solitary Drinking, and Alcohol Problems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robust severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nasal turbinate (NT) accounts for high viral transmissibility, yet whether neutralizing IgA antibodies can control it remains unknown.

METHODS The canine durotomy repair model was used. This well-characterized model assesses the ability of sealants to achieve intraoperative watertight seals of the dura mater, as well as long-term safety and efficacy. This study included 27 mongrel dogs and had a 28-day duration. RESULTS The 3 sealants were 100% effective in preventing CSF leakage intraoperatively at 15 mm Hg. The 2 fibrin sealants were 100% effective in postoperative sealing; the PEG hydrogel was not. Microscopically, the tissue changes induced by Evicel at the durotomy site were similar in nature except for foamy macrophages seen only with the PEG hydrogel. The extent and severity of adhesions at 28 days were less with the fibrin sealants than with the PEG hydrogel. CONCLUSION Evicel, a fibrin sealant, was safe and effective in achieving and maintaining a watertight seal of the dura.

Here we show that hypoxia decreases the attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to epithelial cells. In Vero E6 cells, hypoxia reduces the protein levels of ACE2 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which might in part explain the observed reduction of the infection rate. In addition, hypoxia inhibits the binding of the spike to NCI-H460 human lung epithelial cells by decreasing the cell surface levels of heparan sulfate (HS), a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2. This interaction is also reduced by lactoferrin, a glycoprotein that blocks HS moieties on the cell surface. The expression of syndecan-1, an HS-containing proteoglycan expressed in lung, is inhibited by hypoxia on a HIF-1-dependent manner.

The rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ currents, mediated by channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) and KCNQ1 + KCNE1, respectively, are two main currents responsible for ventricular repolarization. The common cause for drugs to induce LQTS is through impairing the hERG channel. For the recent emergence of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, several drugs have been investigated as potential therapies; however, there are concerns about their QT prolongation risk. Here, we studied the effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir on hERG channels. Our results showed that although chloroquine acutely blocked hERG current (IhERG), with an IC50 of 3.0 M, hydroxychloroquine acutely blocked IhERG 8-fold less potently, with an IC50 of 23.4 M. Azithromycin and remdesivir did not acutely affect IhERG When these drugs were added at 10 M to the cell culture medium for 24 hours, remdesivir increased IhERG by 2-fold, which was associated with an increased mature hERG channel expression. In addition, these four drugs did not acutely or chronically affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels. Our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work demonstrates that, among off-label potential COVID-19 treatment drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, the former two drugs block hERG potassium channels, whereas the latter two drugs do not. All four drugs do not affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1. As hERG and KCNQ1 + KCNE1 are two main K+ channels responsible for ventricular repolarization, and most drugs that induce long QT syndrome (LQTS) do so by impairing hERG channels, these data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns.","output":"COVID-19 Drugs Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, but Not Azithromycin and Remdesivir, Block hERG Potassium Channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies address the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on food consumption and health, focusing on one or two measurements.

There is also a requirement for local airway susceptibility factors that, together with TH2 polarization, results in hyperresponsiveness, variable airflow obstruction, and, over time, remodeling of the airway wall. Asthma has strong genetic and environmental components that interact both in the induction and subsequent expression of the disease phenotypes. Multiple genes are involved and probably interact. Whole genome screens are beginning to identify gene-rich regions of special relevance to asthma and atopy, although a novel disease-related gene has yet to be discovered from these. By contrast, there are a plethora of candidate genes whose function in relation to disease pathophysiologic mechanisms and response to treatment are known. Two examples are polymorphisms involving IL-4 receptors and the enzymes controlling cysteinyl leukotriene production. Abnormal signaling between the epithelium, which is in contact with the environment, and the underlying (myo)fibroblasts and dendritic cells indicating reactivation of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, which is involved in fetal lung development and branching, provide a basis for asthma that encapsulates both TH2 polarization and airway wall remodeling.

These new findings, together with the observation that COVID-19 triggers a cytokine storm capable of injuring the endothelium and disrupting its antithrombogenic properties, favor an indirect mechanism of endothelial injury mediated, locally, by an augmented inflammatory reaction to infected nonendothelial cells such as the bronchial and alveolar epithelium and, systemically, by the excessive immune response to infection.

Microsphere-linked 70-mer probes were hybridized in 3M TMAC buffer to biotinylated single-stranded (ss) DNA for subsequent analysis in a Luminex? system. When mismatches interrupted contiguous matching stretches of 6 nt or longer, it had a strong impact on hybridization. Contiguous matching stretches are more important than the same number of matching nucleotides separated by mismatches into several regions. dInosine, but not 5-nitroindole, substitutions at mismatching positions stabilized hybridization remarkably well, comparable to N (4-fold) wobbles in the same positions. In contrast to shorter probes, 70-nt probes with judiciously placed dInosine substitutions and/or wobble positions were remarkably mismatch tolerant, with preserved specificity.

METHODS: Forty-eight patients with COPD underwent both low-dose conventional (supine position) and upright CT (standing position) during inspiration and expiration breath-holds and a pulmonary function test (PFT) on the same day. We measured the IAA and EAA in each position. RESULTS: For the trachea to the third-generation bronchi, the IAA was significantly larger in the standing position than in the supine position (4.1C4.9% increase, all p < 0.05). The EAA of all bronchi was significantly larger in the standing position than in the supine position (9.7C62.5% increases, all p < 0.001). The correlation coefficients of IAA in the standing position and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were slightly higher than those in the supine position. The correlation coefficients of EAA or EAA/IAA in the standing position and residual volume, and the inspiratory capacity/total lung capacity ratio were higher than those in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: Airway lumen areas were larger in the standing position than in the supine position. IAAs reflect airway obstruction, and EAAs reflect lung hyperinflation.

Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus. The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication. Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals. All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug). All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189.

Understanding the processes which underlie the psychological and behavioral responses of people with EDs during this time are key to ensure tailored support in these unprecedented circumstances. Methods: People with lifetime EDs (n = 32) were recruited through social media from May to June 2020 during a period of strict infection control measures in the United Kingdom (i.e., \\"lockdown,\\" \\"social distancing\\"). They completed open-ended questions in an online anonymous questionnaire that invited them to reflect on how various aspects of their lives have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including ED symptoms and coping strategies. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Most respondents reported that their ED worsened or resurfaced. Isolation, low mood, anxiety, lack of structure, disruption to routines, and media/social media messages around weight and exercise seemed to contribute to this. There was a clear sense that individuals struggled with which aspects of psychological distress to prioritize, i.e., mood vs. ED cognitions and behaviors, particularly as attempts to cope with one often exacerbated the other. Nonetheless, some participants reported \\"silver linings\\" of the pandemic. Conclusions: In this self-selected sample, deterioration or recurrence of ED symptoms were the norm.

Despite being more likely to report a long-term illness that requires medication when compared to their white counterparts, individuals from ethnic minority communities are less likely to engage with regular medication reviews, with inequalities negatively affecting their access. It is important to understand what barriers may exist that impact the access of those from ethnic minority communities and to identify measures that may act to facilitate improved service accessibility for these groups. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between June and August 2021 using the following formats as permitted by governmental COVID-19 restrictions: in person, over the telephone or via video call. Perspectives on service accessibility and any associated barriers and facilitators were discussed. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Reflexive thematic analysis enabled the development of themes. QSR NVivo (Version 12) facilitated data management. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research Authority (ref: 21/HRA/1426). RESULTS: In total 20 participants from ethnic minority communities were interviewed; these participants included 16 UK citizens, 2 refugees and 2 asylum seekers, and represented a total of 5 different ethnic groups. Three themes were developed from the data regarding the perceived barriers and facilitators affecting access to medication reviews and identified approaches to improve the accessibility of such services for ethnic minority patients. These centred on (1) building knowledge and understanding about medication reviews; (2) delivering medication review services; and (3) appreciating the lived experience of patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have important implications for addressing inequalities that affect ethnic minority communities. Involving patients and practitioners to work collaboratively in coproduction approaches could enable better design, implementation and delivery of accessible medication review services that are culturally competent.

Expression of sIL7R is determined by exclusion of the alternative exon 6 from IL7R transcripts, and our previous work revealed that the MS risk allele of the SNP rs6897932 within this exon enhances the expression of sIL7R by promoting exclusion of exon 6. sIL7R potentiates the activity of IL7, leading to enhanced expansion of T cells and increased disability in the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model of MS. This role in modulating T cell-driven immunity positions sIL7R as an attractive therapeutic target whose expression could be reduced for treatment of MS or increased for treatment of cancers. In this study we identified novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that effectively control the inclusion (anti-sIL7R ASOs) or exclusion (pro-sIL7R ASOs) of this exon in a dose-dependent fashion. These ASOs provided excellent control of exon 6 splicing and sIL7R secretion in human primary CD4+ T cells. Supporting their potential for therapeutic targeting, we showed that lead anti-sIL7R ASOs correct the enhanced exon 6 exclusion imposed by the MS risk allele of rs6897932, whereas lead pro-sIL7R ASOs phenocopy it.

With this, we assessed the unequal impact of the pandemic in 2020 on life expectancy across Chilean municipalities for men and women and analyzed previous mortality trends since 2010. ResultsLife expectancy declined for both men and women in 2020. Urban areas were the most affected, with males losing 1.89 and females 1.33 in 2020. The strength of the decline in life expectancy correlated with indicators of social deprivation and poverty. Also, inequality in life expectancy between municipalities increased, largely due to excess mortality among the working-age population in socially disadvantaged municipalities. ConclusionsNot only do people in poorer areas live shorter lives, they also have been substantially more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased population health inequalities.

Objective To determine T-cell responses to the Omicron spike protein in anti-CD20-treated patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) before and after a third messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants In this prospective cohort study conducted from March 2021 to November 2021 at the University Hospital Geneva, adults with MS receiving anti-CD20 treatment (ocrelizumab) were identified by their treating neurologists and enrolled in the study.

Main Outcomes and Measures Quantification of CD4 and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins of the vaccine strain as well as the Delta and Omicron variants, comparing frequencies before and after the third vaccine dose. Results Of 20 included patients, 11 (55%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 45.8 (37.8-53.3) years. Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell memory against all variants were maintained in 9 to 12 patients 6 months after their second vaccination, albeit at lower median frequencies against the Delta and Omicron variants compared with the vaccine strain (CD8 T cells: Delta, 83.0%; 95% CI, 73.6-114.5; Omicron, 78.9%; 95% CI, 59.4-100.0; CD4 T cells: Delta, 72.2%; 95% CI, 67.4-90.5; Omicron, 62.5%; 95% CI, 51.0-89.0).

Accurate detection can be developed through the synergistic integration effect among SERS-active substrate, the appropriate laser wavelength, and the target analyte. In this study, gold nanocavities (Au NC) and Au nanoparticles upon ZrO(2) nano-bowls (Au NPs/pZrO(2)) were tested and used as SERS-active substrates in detecting SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus containing S protein as a surface capsid glycoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus) and vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudo-type lentivirus (VSV-G pseudovirus) to demonstrate their virus detection capability. The optimized Au NCs and Au NPs/pZrO(2) substrates were then verified by examining the repetition of measurement, reproducibility, and detection limit. Due to the difference in geometry and composition of the substrates, the characteristic peak-positions of live SARS-CoV-2 S and VSV-G pseudoviruses in the obtained Raman spectra vary, which were also compared with those of inactivated ones.

The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises. Managerial summary: The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.","output":"Startups in times of crisis C A rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine official healthcare informatics applications in Saudi Arabia in the context of their role in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This is a case study of official healthcare informatics programs and applications (apps) developed in Saudi Arabia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The qualitative content analysis (QCA) method was used. Data collection consisted of two components: a desktop review of documents and actual testing of the programs. According to the QCA method, we developed a matrix for abstracting information on different apps and programs in order to categorize the data. The compilation of information and discussion were based on information summarized in the matrix. RESULTS: Six apps in total were developed before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, three of the apps, SEHA, Mawid, and Sehaty were modified to address different aspects of the pandemic. Both SEHA and Mawid included information about COVID-19 awareness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, three official apps were developed: Tawakkalna, Tetamman, and Tabaud. The Tawakkalna app is mandatory for all citizens and residents to activate when visiting stores and institutions. It has a wide range of COVID-19 and other health-related functions. The Tetamman app provides COVID-19 test results and allows one to check his or her daily symptoms. It also has an educational content library and provides alerts. The Tabaud app notifies individuals if they have been exposed to COVID-19. The features, advantages, and disadvantages of all of the apps were examined.

Evidence supporting its quality and safety is required. AIMS: Assess the efficacy and safety of telephone clinics in delivering care to established oncology patients and assess patient and health professionals' preference (telephone vs face-to-face clinics). METHODS: Retrospective chart audit in the month preceding and month following introduction of telephone clinics at the Gold Coast University hospital and a patient and health professional questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1212 clinical encounters occurred in the month post the introduction of telephone clinics (vs 1208 encounters prior). There were no statistically significant differences in 24-h (18 vs 22, p = 0.531) or 7-day admissions (50 vs 46, p = 0.665) comparing encounters in the month prior to the introduction of telephone clinics vs the month post, but there was a statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality post systemic therapy in favour of the post-telephone clinic period (7 vs 0 patients, p = 0.008). Of the 222 patients who undertook the questionnaire, 42.3% preferred telephone clinics (95% CI 35.97-48.97), 25.2% preferred face-to-face clinics (95% CI 19.92-31.39) and 32.4% did not prefer one method over another. Of the 24 health professionals who undertook the questionnaire, 70.8% felt patients preferred phone clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, patients and clinicians viewed telephone clinics favourably. Nevertheless, a large portion of patients still prefer face-to-face clinics. Services should be tailored to individual preferences.

This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students' understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning.

CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other's mini game concepts.

Thus, the current study was conducted to investigate a potential inactivating method using both ozone (O-3) and ultraviolet C (UVC). Individual and integrated effects of O-3 and UVC were compared. A solution containing approximately 4 similar to 7.3 x 10(6) CFU/mL of Salmonella typhimurium bacteria was used to produce bacteria droplets. These droplets were exposed to O-3 and UVC to determine the reduction rate of bacteria. The exposure times were set as 1 and 30 minutes. Ozone concentrations were 100 and 200 ppmv. UVC-LEDs were used as a UVC source. Peak wavelength of the UVC-LED was 275 nm and the irradiation dose was 0.77 mW/cm(2). In terms of O-3 and UVC-LED interaction, 194 ppmv styrene was used as a target compound to be removed. Considering the O-3 and UVC-LED interaction, the presence of O-3 could reduce the performance of the UVC-LED, and UVC-LED could also reduce significant amount of O-3. The sequence of O-3 and UVC-LED treatment was as follows: O-3 was exposed at first, then UVC-LED, and this order showed the best reduction ratio ( > 99.9%). Therefore, if O-3 and UVC-LED is used to disinfect Salmonella typhimurium bacteria contained in droplets, bacteria should be separately exposed to O-3 and UVC-LED in order to improve the inactivation efficiency.","output":"A Study on the Effect of Integrated Ozone and UVC-LED Approaches on the Reduction of Salmonella typhimurium Bacteria in Droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 pandemic has forced important changes in health care worldwide. Stroke care networks have been affected, especially during peak periods. We assessed the impact of the pandemic and lockdowns in stroke admissions and care in Latin America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multinational study (7 countries, 18 centers) of patients admitted during the pandemic outbreak (March-June 2020). Comparisons were made with the same period in 2019. Numbers of cases, stroke etiology and severity, acute care and hospitalization outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Most countries reported mild decreases in stroke admissions compared to the same period of 2019 (1187 vs. 1166, p = 0.03). Among stroke subtypes, there was a reduction in ischemic strokes (IS) admissions (78.3% vs. 73.9%, p = 0.01) compared with 2019, especially in IS with NIHSS 0-5 (50.1% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.03). A substantial increase in the proportion of stroke admissions beyond 48 h from symptoms onset was observed (13.8% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001). Nevertheless, no differences in total reperfusion treatment rates were observed, with similar door-to-needle, door-to-CT, and door-to-groin times in both periods.

Dust samples and tracheal and choanal cleft swabs were collected from four meat chicken flocks at 10, 14, 21 and 31 days post vaccination (dpv) and tested for IBV and NDV genome copies (GC) by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. IBV and NDV GC were detected in all sample types throughout the study period. Detection rates for choanal cleft and tracheal swabs were comparable, with moderate and fair agreement between sample types for IBV (McNemars = 0.27, kappa = 0.44) and NDV (McNemars = 0.09; kappa = 0.31) GC respectively. There was no significant association for IBV GC in swabs and dust samples (R(2) = 0.15, P = 0.13) but NDV detection rates and viral load in swabs were strongly associated with NDV GC in dust samples (R(2) = 0.86 and R(2) = 0.90, P<0.001). There was no difference in IBV and NDV GC in dust samples collected from different locations within a poultry house. In conclusion, dust samples collected from any location within poultry house show promise for monitoring IBV and NDV GC in meat chickens at a population level and choanal cleft swabs can be used for detection of IBV and NDV GC instead of tracheal swabs in individual birds.","output":"Comparison of tracheal and choanal cleft swabs and poultry dust samples for detection of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus genome in vaccinated meat chicken flocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"West Java is in the five line on the list of provinces in Indonesia with the most COVID-19 cases, as Bandung Metropolitan Area (BMA) is the second most densely populated showing the highest number after Jakarta Greater Area Bandung Metropolitan Area consist of Bandung City, Cimahi City, Bandung Regency, and West Bandung Regency Then, an intense movement of people created between the connected city and regency Bandung City became the epicenter of movement BMA, since it is the province capital city, business, and education center This fact, putting BMA at the highest risk not only for the pandemic but also socioeconomic issues The spatial time series risk forecasting information is an essential for the decision-maker to develop a day by day policy aimed for combating the COVID-19 pandemic issue In this study, the pandemic risk is calculated by combining vulnerability, hazard, and geodemography information Infimap provides the People in Pixels geodemographic data, added not only the exposure of population distribution to COVID-19 but also the ratio of age Beside those data, the daily distribution of COVID-19 cases, network data, business point, health facility point, residentials area, geodemographic (People in Pixels), and daily COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports is also been used in this study The daily vulnerability and hazard data created since the first case on March 4th until August 21st The hazard area is create based on the expected travel area of positive COVID-19 patient While the vulnerability area is create using Spatial Multi Criteria Analysis (SMCA) of following data: service area of hospital, groceries (local market), and workspace Further, the time series data of hazard and vulnerability area was inputted to develop the forecasting model based on the machine learning pipeline of Gaussian algorithm As a result, this study shows the possibility to predict the future risk area of COVID-19 until the next 100 days condition, based on spatial timeseries forecasting model ? 2020 SPIE","output":"A spatial time series forecasting for mapping the risk of COVID-19 pandemic over Bandung Metropolitan Area, West Java, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Intra-procedural assessment of reperfusion during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for emergent large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke is traditionally based on subjective evaluation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). However, semi-quantitative diagnostic tools which encode hemodynamic properties in DSAs, such as angiographic parametric imaging (API), exist and may be used for evaluation of reperfusion during MT. The objective of this study was to use data-driven approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with API maps, to automatically assess reperfusion in the neuro-vasculature during MT procedures based on the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scale. METHODS DSAs from patients undergoing MTs of anterior circulation LVOs were collected, temporally cropped to isolate late arterial and capillary phases, and quantified using API peak height (PH) maps. PH maps were normalized to reduce injection variability. A CNN was developed, trained, and tested to classify PH maps into 2 outcomes (mTICI 0,1,2a/mTICI 2b,2c,3) or 3 outcomes (mTICI 0,1,2a/mTICI 2b/mTICI 2c,3), respectively. Ensembled networks were used to combine information from multiple views (anteroposterior and lateral). RESULTS The study included 383 DSAs. For the 2-outcome classification, average accuracy was 81.0% (95% CI, 79.0-82.9%), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.86 (0.84-0.88).

There has been a concern for postponing or avoiding use of Rituximab (RTX) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the course and outcomes of COVID-19 in PwMS receiving RTX. METHODS: PwMS receiving RTX who contracted COVID-19 were closely monitored by tele-consultation and/or evaluated during hospital visits. Those requiring hospitalization for oxygen therapy or admission to ICU or expiring due to COVID-19 were considered to have severe disease. Those without desaturation and manageable at home were considered to have mild disease. Disease course and outcomes were noted. RESULTS: Twelve out of 62 (19.4%) PwMS on RTX therapy developed COVID-19. Four (age 35-49 years; mean 43.5) had severe COVID; three of whom had Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS). One PwMS expired. Two had prolonged fever lasting >1 month. One demonstrated features of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Interval from last RTX infusion (average dose 750mg) to COVID-19 onset ranged 1-4 (mean 3.7) months. Eight PwMS had mild COVID-19 (age 26-54 years; mean 37.7); six had RRMS and two SPMS. RTX dose was lower (average dose 625 mg) and infusion to COVID-19 onset duration was longer, ranging 4-20 (mean 9.5) months. Four patients, two each from mild and severe COVID-19 groups had neurological deterioration, but none had true relapses. CONCLUSION: RTX treated PwMS may have unpredictable disease outcomes if they contract COVID-19, but may be at risk of severe disease and persistent infection. In our series higher age, SPMS, shorter interval from RTX infusion to COVID-19 onset and higher dose of RTX were noted amongst those developing severe disease. RTX should be use cautiously during the COVID-19 pandemic and if unavoidable, less frequent and lower doses should be considered.

The pandemic has drastically changed students behavior and family preferences due to mental stress and the emotional life attached to it. Consequently, it becomes a prerequisite, and emergencies need to examine the choice characteristics influencing the selection of EI during the COVID19 pandemic situation. The purpose of this study is to critically examine institutional influence and pandemic influence due to COVID19 that affects students choice about an engineering institution (EI) and consequently to explore relationships between institutional and pandemic influence. The findings of this quantitative research, conducted through a self-reported survey, have revealed that institutional and pandemic influence have governed EI choice under the COVID19 pandemic. Second, pandemic influence is positively affected by institutional influence. The study demonstrated that EIs will have to reposition themselves to normalize pandemic influence by tuning institutional characteristics that regulate situational influence and new enrollments.

We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The finding that MMA decreases the average ICU length of stay by 5.4 days and up to 9 days in older patients suggests that implementation of this treatment protocol could allow a healthcare system to manage 60% more COVID-19 patients with the same number of ICU beds.","output":"A multi-mechanism approach reduces length of stay in the ICU for severe COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Thromboembolism and the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy is a surface- or cavity-enhanced variant of Raman scattering spectroscopy that allows the detection of analytes with a sensitivity down to single molecules. This method involves the use of SERS-active surfaces or cavities capable of concentrating incident radiation into small mode volumes containing the analyte. Here, we have engineered an ultranarrow metalCdielectric nano-cavity out of a film of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and a silver surface, held together by interaction between reduced protein sulfhydryl groups and silver. The concentration of light in this nano-cavity allows the label-free recording of the characteristic Raman spectra of protein samples smaller than 1 pg. This is sufficient for the ultrasensitive detection of viral protein antigens at physiologically relevant levels. Moreover, the protein SERS signal can be increased by several orders of magnitude by coating the RBD film with a nanometer-thick silver shell, thereby raising the cavity Q-factor. This ensures a sub-femtogram sensitivity of the viral antigen detection. A simple theoretical model explaining the observed additional enhancement of the SERS signal from the silver-coated protein is proposed. Our study is the first to obtain the characteristic Raman and SERS spectra of the RBD of S glycoprotein, the key SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen, directly, without the use of Raman-reporter molecules. Thus, our approach allows label-free recording of the characteristic spectra of viral antigens at concentrations orders of magnitude lower than those required for detecting the whole virus in biological media. This makes it possible to develop a high-performance optical detection method and conformational analysis of the pathogen and its variants.","output":"Label-Free Detection of the Receptor-Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein at Physiologically Relevant Concentrations Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid treatments such as dexamethasone are commonly used to treat tendinopathy but with mixed outcomes. Although this treatment can cause tendon rupture, it can also stimulate the tendon to heal. However, the mechanisms behind corticosteroid treatment during tendon healing are yet to be understood. PURPOSE: To comprehend when and how dexamethasone treatment can ameliorate injured tendons by using a rat model of Achilles tendon healing. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: An overall 320 rats were used for a sequence of 6 experiments. We investigated whether the drug effect was time-, dose-, and load-dependent. Additionally, morphological data and drug administration routes were examined. Healing tendons were tested mechanically or used for histological examination 12 days after transection. Blood was collected for flow cytometry analysis in 1 experiment. RESULTS: We found that the circadian rhythm and drug injection timing influenced the treatment outcome. Dexamethasone treatment at the right time point (days 7-11) and dose (0.1 mg/kg) significantly improved the material properties of the healing tendon, while the adverse effects were reduced. Local dexamethasone treatment did not lead to increased peak stress, but it triggered systemic granulocytosis and lymphopenia. Mechanical loading (full or moderate) is essential for the positive effects of dexamethasone, as complete unloading leads to the absence of improvements. CONCLUSION: We conclude that dexamethasone treatment to improve Achilles tendon healing is dose- and time-dependent, and positive effects are perceived even in a partly unloaded condition. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings are promising from a clinical perspective, as the positive effect of this drug was seen even when given at lower doses and in a moderate loading condition, which better mimics the load level in patients with tendon ruptures.","output":"Dexamethasone Enhances Achilles Tendon Healing in an Animal Injury Model, and the Effects Are Dependent on Dose, Administration Time, and Mechanical Loading Stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) produced an advisory list identifying essential critical infrastructure workers (ECIW) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response.

This study aimed to assess the characteristics of kidney injury and its association with disease progression and death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This is a retrospective study. Two representative cohorts were included. Cohort 1 involved severe and critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from Wuhan, China. Cohort 2 was all patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shenzhen city (Guangdong province, China). Any kidney injury was defined as the presence of any of the following: hematuria, proteinuria, in-hospital AKI, or prehospital AKI. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. The primary outcome was death at the end of follow-up. The secondary outcome was progression to critical illness during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 555 patients were enrolled; 42% of the cases (229 of 549) were detected with any kidney injury, 33% of the cases (174 of 520) were detected with proteinuria, 22% of the cases (112 of 520) were detected with hematuria, and 6% of the cases (29 of 520) were detected with AKI. Of the 29 patients with AKI, 21 cases were recognized as in-hospital AKI, and eight were recognized as prehospital AKI. Altogether, 27 (5%) patients died at the end of follow-up. The death rate was 11% (20 of 174) in patients with proteinuria, 16% (18 of 112) in patients with hematuria, and 41% (12 of 29) in the AKI settings. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria (hazard ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 15.94), hematuria (hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 13.81), and in-hospital AKI (hazard ratio, 6.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.42 to 19.31) were associated with death.

Yet, the underlying mechanism why the morphogen receptor LRP2 is essential for OFT development remained unexplained. Studying LRP2-deficient mouse models, we now show that LRP2 is expressed in the cardiac progenitor niche of the anterior second heart field (SHF) that contributes to elongation of the OFT during separation into aorta and pulmonary trunk. Loss of LRP2 in mutant mice results in depletion of a pool of sonic hedgehog-dependent progenitor cells in the anterior SHF due to premature differentiation into cardiomyocytes as they migrate into the OFT myocardium. Depletion of this cardiac progenitor cell pool results in aberrant shortening of the OFT, the likely cause of CAT formation in affected mice. Our findings identified the molecular mechanism whereby LRP2 controls maintenance of progenitor cell fate in the anterior SHF essential for OFT separation, and why receptor dysfunction is a novel cause of conotruncal malformation.","output":"LRP2 controls sonic hedgehog-dependent differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells during outflow tract formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is recommended within 7 days of intubation for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. A quality improvement project aimed to decrease time to tracheostomy to 7 days after intubation for eligible patients requiring tracheostomy in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). LOCAL PROBLEM: From January 2017 to June 2018, approximately 85% of tracheostomies were performed >7 days after intubation. The tracheostomy was placed a median of 10 days after intubation (range: 1C57). METHODS: Quality improvement principles were applied at an American College of Surgeons-verified level I trauma centre to introduce and analyse interventions to improve tracheostomy timing. Using the electronic health record, we analysed changes in tracheostomy timing, hospital length of stay (LOS), ventilator-associated pneumonia and peristomal bleeding rates for three subgroups: patients with TBI, trauma patients and all SICU patients. INTERVENTIONS: In July 2018, an educational roll-out for SICU residents and staff was launched to inform them of potential benefits of early tracheostomy and potential complications, which they should discuss when counselling patient decision-makers. In July 2019, an early tracheostomy workflow targeting patients with head injury was published in an institutional Trauma Guide app. RESULTS: Median time from intubation to tracheostomy decreased for all patients from 14 days (range: 4C57) to 8 days (range: 1C32, p0.001), and median hospital LOS decreased from 38 days to 24 days (p<0.001, r=0.35).

This study explored the perceptions and experiences of cigar-smoking cessation and assistance received from healthcare providers among forty Black young-adult cigar smokers (ages 21C29). Semi-structured in-depth phone interviews were transcribed and coded. Qualitative data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. Participants mostly smoked cigarillos, large cigars, and blunts. Overall, many regular cigarillo smokers reported interest in quitting eventually, while large-cigar and blunt smokers shared less interest in quitting because they perceived low harm from smoking these products. The reasons for cigar-smoking cessation were health concerns and financial constraints. Most of the participants who attempted to quit cigars did not use any cessation aids. The reasons for relapse included nicotine withdrawal, stress, and easy access. Additionally, most participants reported their healthcare providers did not ask whether they smoked cigars, and even when they knew, little assistance for cigar-smoking cessation was provided. Informing Black cigar smokers of the harm of cigar smoking and encouraging healthcare providers to screen for and assist with cigar-smoking cessation may alleviate the health burden of cigar smoking in this population.","output":"Cigar-Smoking-Cessation Interest and Experience among Black Young Adults: A Semi-Structured In-Depth Interview Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the ability of animals to cope with a changing environment is critical in a world affected by anthropogenic disturbance.1 Individual foraging strategies may influence the coping ability of entire populations, as these strategies can be adapted to contrasting conditions, allowing populations with foraging polymorphisms to be more resilient toward environmental change.2,3 However, environmentally dependent fitness consequences of individual foraging strategies and their effects on population dynamics have not been conclusively documented.4,5 Here, we use biologging data from endangered Galpagos sea lion females (Zalophus wollebaeki) to show that benthically foraging individuals dig after sand-dwelling prey species while pelagic foragers hunt in more open waters. These specialized foraging behaviors result in distinct and temporally stable patterns of vibrissae abrasion. Using vibrissae length as a visual marker for the benthic versus pelagic foraging strategies, we furthermore uncovered an environment-dependent fitness trade-off between benthic and pelagic foragers, suggesting that the foraging polymorphism could help to buffer the population against the negative effects of climate change. However, demographic projections suggest that this buffering effect is unlikely to be sufficient to reverse the ongoing population decline of the past four decades.6 Our study shows how crucial a deeper understanding of behavioral polymorphisms can be for predicting how populations cope within a rapidly changing world.

Possible evolutionary processes for such relationships include mutant lineages escaping host control or diversity, per se, creating too many immune system targets. Another possibility is social heterosis where mutations and replicative errors create clonal lineages varying in intrinsic capability for successful dispersal; improved environmental buffering; resource extraction or effective defence against immune systems. Rather than these capabilities existing in one genome, social heterosis proposes complementary synergies occur across lineages in close proximity. Diverse groups overcome host defences as interacting social genomes with group genetic tool kits exceeding limited individual plasticity. To assess the possibility of social heterosis in viral infections and cancer progression, we conducted extensive literature searches for examples consistent with general and specific predictions from the social heterosis hypothesis. Numerous studies found supportive patterns in cancers across multiple tissues and in several families of RNA viruses. In viruses, social heterosis mechanisms probably result from long coevolutionary histories of competition between pathogen and host. Conversely, in cancers, social heterosis is a by-product of recent mutations.

In this paper we aimed to provide an overview on the diversity of control for these diseases in Europe. A non-EU regulated cattle disease was defined as an infectious disease of cattle with no or limited control at EU level, which is not included in the European Union Animal health law Categories A or B under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/2002. A CP was defined as surveillance and/or intervention strategies designed to lower the incidence, prevalence, mortality or prove freedom from a specific disease in a region or country. Passive surveillance, and active surveillance of breeding bulls under Council Directive 88/407/EEC were not considered as CPs. A questionnaire was designed to obtain country-specific information about CPs for each disease. Animal health experts from 33 European countries completed the questionnaire. Overall, there are 23 diseases for which a CP exists in one or more of the countries studied. The diseases for which CPs exist in the highest number of countries are enzootic bovine leukosis, bluetongue, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhoea and anthrax (CPs reported by between 16 and 31 countries). Every participating country has on average, 6 CPs (minCmax: 1C13) in place. Most programmes are implemented at a national level (86%) and are applied to both dairy and non-dairy cattle (75%). Approximately one-third of the CPs are voluntary, and the funding structure is divided between government and private resources. Countries that have eradicated diseases like enzootic bovine leukosis, bluetongue, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine viral diarrhoea have implemented CPs for other diseases to further improve the health status of cattle in their country. The control of non-EU regulated cattle diseases is very heterogenous in Europe.

Being able to forecast future demands would be a valuable support for hospitals to prevent high demand, particularly in a system with limited resources where use of ED services for non-urgent visits is an important issue. DESIGN: Time-series cohort study. SETTING: We collected all ED visits between January 2014 and December 2019 in the five larger hospitals in Milan. To predict daily volumes, we used a regression model with autoregressive integrated moving average errors. Predictors included were day of the week and year-round seasonality, meteorological and environmental variables, information on influenza epidemics and festivities. Accuracy of prediction was evaluated with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily all-cause EDs visits. RESULTS: In the study period, we observed 2 223 479 visits. ED visits were most likely to occur on weekends for children and on Mondays for adults and seniors. Results confirmed the role of meteorological and environmental variables and the presence of day of the week and year-round seasonality effects. We found high correlation between observed and predicted values with a MAPE globally smaller than 8.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Results were used to establish an ED warning system based on past observations and indicators of high demand. This is important in any health system that regularly faces scarcity of resources, and it is crucial in a system where use of ED services for non-urgent visits is still high.","output":"Time-series cohort study to forecast emergency department visits in the city of Milan and predict high demand: a 2-day warning system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Os mecanismos pelos quais a produ??o in vitro de embri?es (PIVE) bovinos gera embri?es com excessivo acmulo lipdico, com elevado estresse celular e com reduzida criotolerancia ainda s?o desconhecidos.

This preliminary study used a Deep Learning (DL) technique namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify and predict the ECG signals from four different classes: normal, sudden death, arrhythmia, and supraventricular arrhythmia. The classification and prediction process includes pulse extraction, image reshaping, training dataset, and testing process. In general, the training accuracy achieved up to 95% after 100 epochs. However, the prediction of each ECG single type shows a differentiation. Among the four classes, the results show that the predictions for sudden death ECG waveforms are the highest, i.e., 80 out of 80 samples are correct (100% accuracy). In contrast, the lowest is the prediction for normal sinus ECG waveforms, i.e., 74 out of 80 samples are correct (92.5% accuracy). This is due to the image features of normal sinus ECG waveforms being almost similar to the image features of supraventricular arrhythmia ECG waveforms. However, the model has been tuned to achieve an optimal prediction.

However, its effects against pulmonary injury promoted by copper are not explored and remain unclear so far. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the protective effect of melatonin against copper-induced lung damage.

The extent of tissue damage was assessed by tissue oxidative stress parameters, metal estimation and histological analysis. Copper-challenged rats showed altered oxidative stress variables. In addition, metal analysis revealed increased copper accumulation in the lungs and histological staining results further indicated severe tissue injury and inflammatory cell infiltration in copper-exposed rats. To this side, treatment with melatonin showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities evidenced by reduced oxidative stress, tissue inflammation and collagen deposition as compared to copper-exposed animals. Moreover, spectral findings suggested melatonin treatment modulated the frequency sift, as compared to copper-challenged animals.

Proteome-wide identification of proteinCprotein interactions (PPIs) has proven valuable in the systematic understanding of the genome-phenome relationship. However, the PPIs of C. parvum are largely unknown because of the limited experimental studies carried out. Therefore, we took full advantage of three bioinformatics methods, i.e., interolog mapping (IM), domain-domain interaction (DDI)-based inference, and machine learning (ML) method, to jointly predict PPIs of C. parvum. Due to the lack of experimental PPIs of C. parvum, we used the PPI data of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), which owned the largest number of PPIs in Apicomplexa, to train an ML model to infer C. parvum PPIs. We utilized consistent results of these three methods as the predicted high-confidence PPI network, which contains 4,578 PPIs covering 554 proteins. To further explore the biological significance of the constructed PPI network, we also conducted essential network and protein functional analysis, mainly focusing on hub proteins and functional modules. We anticipate the constructed PPI network can become an important data resource to accelerate the functional genomics studies of C. parvum as well as offer new hints to the target discovery in developing drugs/vaccines.","output":"Proteome-wide prediction and analysis of the Cryptosporidium parvum proteinCprotein interaction network through integrative methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Construction is a key sector of the national economy, one that is inextricably linked to all other sectors.

This study sought to compare the status and issues of growth and improvement in housing development in medium term across Russian regions. Statistical methods of economics were used to verify the official statistics available for 1990C2019. Overview of residential housing commissioned over the period identified four stages of the housing industrys development in the country. Thus, it was found out that since 2018, as abolition of the Federal Law No. 93-FZ was impending, and amendments were on the way regarding equity construction with use of escrow accounts, people started to commission more and more detached houses. 56% of all detached houses were commissioned in rural areas. Overall, cities account for 70% of new residential construction, rural areas for 30%. Housing construction varies from region to region depending on how developed the local investment and construction infrastructure is as well as on transport accessibility, income, and purchasing power of the locals.

There is consensus that nutritional access to vitamin D can be estimated by measuring serum concentrations of 25OHD and vitamin D deficiency can thus be considered as calcifediol deficiency. However, the threshold for vitamin D/calcifediol sufficiency remains a matter of debate. Vitamin D/calcifediol deficiency has been associated with musculoskeletal effects but also multiple adverse extra-skeletal consequences. If these consequences improve or if they can be treated with vitamin D supplementation is still unclear. Observational studies suggest a higher infection risk in people with low calcifediol levels. There is also a consistent association between serum calcifediol and cardiovascular events and deaths, but large-scale, long-term intervention studies did not show any benefit on cardiovascular outcomes from supplementation, at least not in subjects without clear vitamin D deficiency. Cancer risk also did not change with vitamin D treatment, although there are some data that higher serum calcifediol is associated with longer survival in cancer patients. In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and low birth weight. Although preclinical studies showed that the vitamin D endocrine system plays a role in certain neural cells as well as brain structure and function, there is no evidence to support a beneficial effect of vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases.

LVX-loaded microspheres were fabricated by solvent evaporation technique. Central Composite Design (CCD) was adopted to optimize the microspheres, with desired particle size, drug loading, and drug entrapment efficiency, for targeting alveolar macrophages via non-invasive pulmonary delivery. Structural characterization studies by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the absence of any possible chemical interaction between the drug and the polymer used for the preparation of microspheres. In addition, the optimized drug-loaded microspheres exhibited desired average aerodynamic diameter of 2.13  1.24 m and fine particle fraction of 75.35  1.42%, indicating good aerosolization properties. In vivo data demonstrated that LVX-loaded microspheres had superior lung accumulation, as evident by a two-fold increase in the area under the curve AUC(0C24h), as compared with plain LVX. Furthermore, LVX-loaded microspheres prolonged drug residence time in the lung and maintained a relatively high drug concentration for a longer time, which contributed to a reduced leakage in the systemic circulation. In conclusion, inhalable LVX-loaded microspheres might represent a plausible delivery vehicle for targeting pulmonary tuberculosis via enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of LVX while minimizing its systemic off-target side effects.","output":"Pulmonary Targeting of Levofloxacin Using Microsphere-Based Dry Powder Inhalation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to evaluate a complex relation structure represented by a graph, considering a high dimensional dataset in the Symbolic Data Analysis domain.

The authors seek to develop a conceptual model based on farmers' know-how to address crop damage by T. absoluta at a local and regional levels in order to determine how to confront this problem in the tomato-growing region of Schica, Colombia. Design/methodology/approach: Community-Based System Dynamics (CBSD) is a participatory research methodology in which a group of stakeholders identifies relevant variables and the cause-effect relations among them which are then arranged into a causal loop diagram. The authors implemented this methodology in a workshop, focused on the farmers' insights related to the pest situation at the local and regional level, to achieve a causal loop diagram that explained pest dynamics and their potential management. Findings: The relevant factors for the presence of T. absoluta, seen in the causal loop diagram, vary regionally and locally. At the local level, the pest impacts tomato production, farmers' well-being and their cash flow, while at the regional level, it affects market dynamics and environment and promotes regional coordination among farmers. Farmers propose product innocuity as a key regional objective. They also proposed establishing a planting calendar and census of greenhouses to control the pest throughout the region and the tomato supply. Research limitations/implications: First, the synthesized model could not be validated with the farmers due to the COVID 19 epidemic. However, the authors held sessions with experts to analyze each result. Second, decision-makers from the local government did not participate in the workshop. Nevertheless, the approach of the workshop was aimed at understanding the mental models of the farmers since they are the ones who decide how pests are managed. Finally, even though farmers showed interest in projects aimed at proposing area-wide, long-term and wide pest control strategies, there is a risk that they will not adopt the proposed changes, due to risk aversion. Originality/value: CBSD has not been applied to agricultural systems to analyze impacts from pests at the local and regional levels. The results of this study contribute to designing future interventions for pest control in the region, along with the factors which may turn out to be side effects or unwanted results. To design pest control interventions at a regional level, a sound understanding of the variables or factors that control the system dynamics at various levels is required. This study represents the first step towards that end. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A participative system methodology to model pest dynamics in an agricultural setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is capable of binding peptides derived from intracellular proteins and displaying them at the cell surface. The recognition of these peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T-cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer, which leverage this mechanism, can greatly benefit from structural analyses of pMHC complexes. Several attempts have been made to use molecular docking for such analyses, but pMHC structure remains too challenging for even state-of-the-art docking tools. To overcome these limitations, we describe the use of an incremental meta-docking approach for structural prediction of pMHC complexes. Previous methods applied in this context used specific constraints to reduce the complexity of this prediction problem, at the expense of generality. Our strategy makes no assumption and can potentially be used to predict binding modes for any pMHC complex. Our method has been tested in a re-docking experiment, reproducing the binding modes of 25 pMHC complexes whose crystal structures are available. This study is a proof of concept that incremental docking strategies can lead to general geometry prediction of pMHC complexes, with potential applications for immunotherapy against cancer or infectious diseases.","output":"General Prediction of Peptide-MHC Binding Modes Using Incremental Docking: A Proof of Concept"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of infectious diseases including Avian Flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (hereafter SARS) on international tourist arrivals in Asian countries using both single datasets and panel data procedures.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pragmatic, two-armed, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial conducted during 2019 in a primary care setting. INTERVENTION The PCD tool (PatientWisdom) invited patients to identify preferences, values, goals, and barriers to care. Patients were randomized to a standard pre-visit email or facilitated enrollment with dedicated outreach to encourage use of the tool. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes of interest were post-visit patient communication and patient activation measured by the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT) and Patient Activation Measure (PAM), respectively. Outcomes were evaluated using treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) principles. KEY RESULTS A total of 301 patients were enrolled. Facilitated enrollment resulted in a five-fold increase in uptake of the PCD tool.

However, examples of on-job mentorship programs for nurses in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop an on-job nursing mentorship programme using a compassionate framework aimed at improving nurses experience and thus enhancing patient experience in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. METHODS: Designed as an intervention development study, it was completed between January 2018CDecember 2019. The programme was developed by a team composed of service and nursing leadership, director patient experience of care and a compassion specialist using a theory of change model. The package followed a series of steps, a) identification of a framework, b) creation of working group c) needs assessment and d) multiple meetings to frame the model followed by implementing the preconditions for roll-out of the programme with the frontline staff. RESULTS: The eventual outcome was improving the patients experience of compassion while the intermediate outcome was to have nurses demonstrate compassionate care. The pre-conditions were identified as: recruitment of staff with appropriate skills for pediatric care, provision of compassionate experience to the frontline nurses by addressing their specific pain points, development of competent head nurses as supervisors and creation of a compassionate culture. To ensure the pre-conditions, various interventions were planned with some implemented through the course of the study while others are in the process of being rolled out. These involved, inclusion of pediatric compassion specific module during orientation of new hires, creation of space to talk about compassionate skills with staff, provision of trainings and mentorship to create competent head nurses, and creating a culture that promoted and recognized compassionate care values. CONCLUSION: The approach helped to delineate feasible pathways for an on-job compassionate mentorship programme enhancing routine supervisors' role as facilitators of compassionate care.

The main challenge lies in identifying risks of climate change, appropriate response measures, and prioritizing them to control climate change. The paper aims to determine the perception of climate finance among the public while assessing India's current situation concerning climate change. A well-structured questionnaire was prepared, and data were collected from 253 respondents in Chennai city from December 2020 to February 2021 using a convenience sampling method. A chi-square tool was used to examine the association between the demographic profiles of the respondents and the respondents' perception of climate change-related activities. Type of family, age, and number of family members are significantly associated with most statements connected to the perception of climate finance. The majority of the respondents had insufficient knowledge about climate change policies.

We identified sexually dimorphic miRNA expression throughout gestation in human placentae. Next-generation sequencing identified miRNA expression profiles in first and third trimester uncomplicated pregnancies using tissue obtained at chorionic villous sampling (n = 113) and parturition (n = 47). Sequencing analysis identified 986 expressed mature miRNAs from female and male placentae at first and third trimester (baseMean>10). Of these, 11 sexually dimorphic (FDR < 0.05) miRNAs were identified in the first and 4 in the third trimester, all upregulated in females, including miR-361-5p, significant in both trimesters. Sex-specific analyses across gestation identified 677 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs at FDR < 0.05 and baseMean>10, with 508 DE miRNAs in common between female-specific and male-specific analysis (269 upregulated in first trimester, 239 upregulated in third trimester). Of those, miR-4483 had the highest fold changes across gestation. There were 62.5% more female exclusive differences with fold change>2 across gestation than male exclusive (52 miRNAs vs 32 miRNAs), indicating miRNA expression across human gestation is sexually dimorphic. Pathway enrichment analysis identified significant pathways that were differentially regulated in first and third trimester as well as across gestation.

Six novel ferrocene-based thiosemicarbazones have been synthesized through the condensation reaction of acetyl ferrocene with differently substituted thiosemicarbazide. Furthermore, we used state-of-the-art computational docking approach to explore the theoretical aspects for possible antiviral potential of our synthesized compounds. All the six compounds were docked with M(pro) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is very crucial protein for viral replication. Among the six derivatives, compounds 2 and 4 showed higher binding affinities with binding energy of ? 6.7 and ? 6.9 kcal/mol, respectively. The visualization of intermolecular interactions between synthesized derivatives and M(pro) protein illustrated that each of compounds 2 and 4 forms two hydrogen bonds accompanied by important hydrophobic interactions. The comparison of binding affinities with some recently approved drugs like remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine molecules are also made. The calculated binding energies of remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine molecules with M(pro) of COVID-19 was found to be ? 7.00, ? 5.20 and ? 5.60 kcal/mol, respectively.

However, little is known about the interrelationships between major respiratory viruses (and their species), host systemic metabolism, and disease pathobiology. METHODS In an ongoing multicenter prospective cohort study, we profiled the serum metabolome in 113 infants (63 RSV-only, 21 RV-A, and 29 RV-C) hospitalized with bronchiolitis. We identified serum metabolites that are most discriminatory in the RSV-RV-A and RSV-RV-C comparisons using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis. We then investigated the association between discriminatory metabolites with acute and chronic outcomes. RESULTS In 113 infants with bronchiolitis, we measured 639 metabolites. Serum metabolome profiles differed in both comparisons (Ppermutation <0.05). In the RSV-RV-A comparison, we identified 30 discriminatory metabolites, predominantly in lipid metabolism pathways (e.g., sphingolipids and carnitines). In multivariable models, these metabolites were significantly associated with the risk of clinical outcomes (e.g., tricosanoyl sphingomyelin, OR for recurrent wheezing at age 3 years = 1.50; 95%CI 1.05-2.15). In the RSV-RV-C comparison, the discriminatory metabolites were also primarily involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., glycerophosphocholines [GPCs], 12,13-DiHome). These metabolites were also significantly associated with the risk of outcomes (e.g., 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC, OR for positive pressure ventilation use during hospitalization=0.47; 95%CI 0.28-0.78).

A major opportunity to reduce emissions is to improve building construction, and in particular the effectiveness of building envelope, which leads to a decrease in operational energy consumption. Improving the performance of a building's thermal envelope can substantially reduce energy consumption from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning while maintaining occupant comfort. In previous work, a computational model of a biomimetic building fa?ade design was found to be effective in temperate climates in an office context. Through a case study example based on animal fur and blood perfusion, this paper tests the hypothesis that biomimetic building facades have a broader application in different building typologies across a range of climate zones. Using bioinspiration for innovation opens new ideas and pathways for technological development that traditional engineering design does not provide. This study exemplifies the process in a building fa?ade, integrating a new form of insulation, heating and cooling. Methods of mathematical modelling and digital simulation methods were used to test the energy reduction potential of the biomimetic fa?ade was tested in a set of operational applications (office, school, and aged care) and across different climate zones (tropical, desert, temperate, and cool continental). Results indicated that the biomimetic fa?ade has potential to reduce energy consumption for all building applications, with the greatest benefit shown in residential aged care (67.1% reduction). Similarly, the biomimetic building fa?ade showed potential to reduce operational services energy consumption in all climate zones, with the greatest energy reductions achieved in the tropical (55.4% reduction) and humid continental climates (55.1% reduction). Through these results the hypothesis was confirmed suggesting that facades engineered to mimic biological functions and processes can improve substantially decrease building operational energy consumption and can be applied in different building classifications and different climate zones. These results would significantly decrease operational greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetime of a building and provide substantial savings in energy bills. Such facades can contribute to the further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in a broad range of contexts in the built environment and other areas of technology and design. The flexibility and adaptability of biomimetic facades exemplify how biological strategies and characteristics can augment and improve performance in different environments, since the organisms that inspire innovation are already well-adapted to the conditions on earth. This study also exemplified a method by which other biomimetic building envelope features may be assessed. Further work is suggested to assess economic viability and constructability of the proposed facades.

We demonstrate that these scaffolds, which are directly loaded with EGF following lyophilization maintain equivalent properties to scaffolds loaded passively via diffusion into water-swollen microgels, including EGF release profiles and cell migration studies that did not significantly differ. Further, these heterogeneous scaffolds exhibit a significant increase in cellular migration in vitro and quicker re-epithelialization in vivo.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the association of basal metabolic index (body mass index (BMI)) with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), dialysis, upgrade to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. Independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with its 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively. Results: A total of 176 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included. The mean age was 62.2 years, with 51% being male patients. The mean BMI for non-surviving patients was significantly higher compared to patients surviving on the seventh day of hospitalization (35 vs. 30 kg/m2, P = 0.022). Similarly, patients requiring IMV had a higher BMI (33 vs. 29, P = 0.002) compared to nonintubated patients. The unadjusted OR for patients with a higher BMI requiring IMV (56% vs. 28%, OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.6 - 7.0, P = 0.002) and upgrade to ICU (46% vs. 28%, OR;2.2, 1.07 - 4.6, P = 0.04) were significantly higher compared to patients with a lower BMI. Similarly, patients with a higher BMI had higher in-hospital mortality (21% vs. 9%, OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3 - 8.2, P = 0.01) compared to patients with a normal BMI. Despite a numerical advantage in the lower BMI group, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the need for dialysis (5% vs. 13%, OR: 3.8, 13% vs. 4%, 1.1 - 14.1, P = 0.07). aORs controlled for baseline comorbidities and medications mirrored the overall results, except for the need to upgrade to ICU.

We aimed to share our experience at a single center with an emphasis on collective decision making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A suspected case was defined as the presence of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and/or positive contact history. SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were defined as confirmed COVID-19. Between March 12, 2020, and May 15, 2020, all children presenting with fever, cough, or respiratory difficulty were investigated for COVID-19. A total of 719 children were examined at outpatient clinics, and 495 were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for suspicion of COVID-19. A team was organized for monitoring and treating patients either as outpatients or hospitalization. Patients were evaluated in terms of age, gender, travel history, epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Sixty patients were hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19. Forty-three patients were diagnosed as probable or confirmed COVID-19. 21 of 43 patients (48.8%) were PCR confirmed. The remaining 22 were diagnosed by epidemiologic history, clinical assessment, and computerized thorax tomography (CT) findings.

Proposed drugs with activity against SARS-CoV-2 include compounds with positive charges at physiologic pH, making them potential targets for the organic cation secretory transporters of kidney and liver, i.e., the basolateral organic cation transporters, OCT1 and OCT2; and the apical multidrug and toxin extruders, MATE1 and MATE2-K. We selected several compounds proposed to have in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine, tilorone, pyronaridine, cetylpyridinium, and miramistin) to test their interaction with OCT and MATE transporters. We used Bayesian machine learning models to generate predictions for each molecule with each transporter and also experimentally determined IC50 values for each compound against labeled substrate transport into CHO cells that stably expressed OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2-K using three structurally distinct substrates (atenolol, metformin and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) to assess the impact of substrate structure on inhibitory efficacy. For the OCTs substrate identity influenced IC50 values, although the effect was larger and more systematic for OCT2. In contrast, inhibition of MATE1-mediated transport was largely insensitive to substrate identity. Unlike MATE1, inhibition of MATE2-K was influenced, albeit modestly, by substrate identity. Maximum unbound plasma concentration/IC50 ratios were used to identify potential clinical DDI recommendations; all the compounds interacted with the OCT/MATE secretory pathway, most with sufficient avidity to represent potential DDI issues for secretion of cationic drugs. This should be considered when proposing cationic agents as repurposed antivirals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Drugs proposed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics based on in vitro activity data against SARS-CoV-2 include compounds with positive charges at physiological pH, making them potential interactors with the OCT/MATE renal secretory pathway. We tested seven such molecules as inhibitors of OCT1/2 and MATE1/2-K. All the compounds blocked transport activity regardless of substrate used to monitor activity.

Some responses to such failures seem to assume that codes of conduct will ensure or at least increase the likelihood that ethical management will be practised. Codes of conduct are general principles and rules of normative standards, including ethical standards, and guides for action of agents in particular roles. Nurse managers seem to stride two roles. Contra some accounts of the roles of a professional (nurse) and that of a manager, it is claimed that there is no intrinsic incompatibility of the roles though there is always the possibility that it could become so and likewise for codes of conduct. Codes of conduct can be used to support nurse managers in making practical decisions via an 'outside in' approach with an emphasis on the use of principles and an 'inside out' approach with an emphasis on the agent's character. It is claimed that both approaches are necessary, especially as guides to ethical action. However, neither is sufficient for action because judgement and choice will always be required (principles always underdetermine action) as will a conducive environment that positively influences good judgement by being supportive of the basic principles and values of healthcare institutions. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has created a unique set of circumstances in which the practical judgement, including ethical judgement, of nurse managers at all levels is being tested.

We compared the prevalence of mental health illness and disability reported in Kerala with national estimates. We also mapped the most recently available health human resource and infrastructure available in Kerala for mental health care. Basic descriptive statistics were computed for both sets of indicators using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: In 2002, Kerala had 194 persons per hundred thousand population with mental retardation and intellectual disability which increased to 300 persons per hundred thousand population in 2018. The number of individuals with mental health illness in the state increased from 272 person per hundred thousand to 400 persons per hundred thousand in the time period of 2002 to 2018. There were 5.53 beds available per ten thousand persons for treatment in Kerala in 2018. CONCLUSION: Kerala experienced a rapid rise in mental health morbidity between 2002 and 2018. The most recently reported health human resource and infrastructure availability in the state appears to be inadequate to cater to the requirements of mental health care, even as improvements and upgradations are underway. Service and system design changes will have to be mapped and evaluated over time.

Recent studies suggest lower complication rates following a modified version of this technique using a partially endoscopic-assisted approach, whereas little is known about the quality of life (QoL) in the long-term evaluation of these patients. Methods A retrospective study and analysis of patients undergoing hernia repair using an open CS (OCS) and endoscopically assisted CS (ECS) technique, respectively, from 2011 to 2016 at the Rostock University Medical Center. Patients underwent a mesh-based sublay reinforcement following a distinct CS with closure of the linea alba. Patient characteristics, technical details, and short-term postoperative outcomes were determined by a physician chart review. A health-related QoL survey (EQ-5D) including a pain assessment was evaluated at a median of 19.5 months postoperatively. Results Thirty-five patients had a CS: 25 OCS and 10 ECS. Perioperative variables were comparable except for the median defect size (169 cm2 OCS vs. 86 cm2 ECS; p < 0.05) and maximum width of hernia (25 vs. 13 cm). Hospitalization lasted 16.6 days in the OCS group and 7.9 days in the endoscopic group (p = 0.04). Wound complications occurred in 24% of OCS and 10% of ECS patients.

In 2020, there were approximately 592 000 new cancer cases and 260 000 cancer deaths. Considering the heterogeneities across Brazil, this study aimed to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer-related hospital admissions at a national and regional level. METHODS: The national, regional, and state-specific monthly average of cancer-related hospital admission rates per 100 000 inhabitants and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from March to July (2019: pre-COVID-19; and 2020: COVID-19 period). Thematic maps were constructed to compare the rates between periods and regions. RESULTS: Cancer-related hospital admissions were reduced by 26% and 28% for clinical and surgical purposes, respectively. In Brazil, the average hospitalization rates decreased from 13.9 in 2019 to 10.2 in 2020 per 100,000 inhabitants, representing a rate difference of ?3.7 (per 100,000 inhabitants; 95% CI: ?3.9 to ?3.5) for cancer-related (clinical) hospital admissions. Surgical hospital admissions showed a rate decline of ?5.8 per 100,000 (95% CI: ?6.0 to ?5.5). The reduction in cancer-related admissions for the surgical procedure varies across regions ranging between ?2.2 and ?10.8 per 100 000 inhabitants, with the most significant decrease observed in the south and southeastern Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantial decrease in cancer-related hospital admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic with marked differences across regions. Delays in treatment may negatively impact cancer survival in the future; hence, cancer control strategies to mitigate the impact are needed.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Cancer-Related Hospitalizations in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Student learning in upper division thermal physics has not been studied to the same extent as in other courses like electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.

Limited reports of acute airway compromise in patients with recent novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) suggest this may be a rare and late complication in COVID-19 patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old Guatemalan male with no known past medical history, unclear vaccination status, no smoking or alcohol history presented to the emergency department with complaints of worsening sore throat, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, bloody vomitus, and subjective fever for two hours prior to arrival. He was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 3 weeks prior. History was limited by severe respiratory distress. On physical exam, the patient was afebrile. He had muffled voice, stridor, and a normal uvula. Labs were significant for leukocytosis, and respiratory panel positive for SARS-CoV-2. X-ray of chest and neck were unremarkable. Patient was given dexamethasone and antibiotics. Given concern for airway compromise and possible epiglottitis, the patient was urgently intubated. First attempt with video laryngoscopy was unsuccessful due to extensive edema and erythema of the hypopharyngeal tissues, then re-attempted successfully with a smaller endotracheal tube. The epiglottis could not be visualized. CT neck showed diffuse inflammation with enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils;epiglottis was obscured given presence of the endotracheal tube;no abscess seen. Differential included bacterial or viral epiglottitis, idiopathic angioedema reaction, and post-COVID reaction. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of presumed epiglottitis and continued on dexamethasone for 40 hours and empiric antibiotics. He had rapid resolution of airway edema, was successfully extubated on day 4 of admission, and discharged home on day 6 with a 10-day course of cephalexin. DISCUSSION: Most mild, symptomatic cases of COVID-19 typically resolve within 2-3 weeks. This late presentation raises concern for epiglottitis as a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The time course additionally suggests possible post-viral superinfection of the epiglottis and upper airway from other causes. Confirmation via direct visualization or imaging was not possible in this patient but he was treated presumptively for epiglottitis given his concerning physical exam findings. In cases of acute respiratory distress, airway management should supersede diagnostic evaluation due to the risk of rapid respiratory compromise. CONCLUSIONS: There are many known etiologies of acute airway obstruction, including epiglottitis, but it is important to consider COVID-19 as another possible etiology. While direct visualization is the gold standard for confirmation, diagnosis should not precede emergent intubation in cases of severe respiratory distress. REFERENCE #1: ?aytemel B, K?l??

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male. The assigned interventions were completed by 896 children (intervention: n=467, 96.3%; control: n=429, 91.5%). The 2-week change in square-root-transformed self-reported anxiety scores was greater in the intervention (-0.23, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.20) vs control group (0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16; unadjusted difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.08; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in square-root-transformed eye strain in the intervention group (-0.08, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) compared to controls (0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.09; difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03; P=.02).

SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 antagonizes host interferon signaling by inhibition of mRNA nuclear export through its interactions with the ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae1)Cnucleoporin 98 (Nup98) complex. Here, we confirmed the direct tight binding of Orf6 to the Rae1-Nup98 complex, which competitively inhibits RNA binding. We determined the crystal structures of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 Orf6 C-termini in complex with the Rae1CNup98 heterodimer. In each structure, SARS-CoV Orf6 occupies the same potential mRNA-binding groove of the Rae1CNup98 complex, comparable to the previously reported structures of other viral proteins complexed with Rae1-Nup98, indicating that the Rae1CNup98 complex is a common target for different viruses to impair the nuclear export pathway. Structural analysis and biochemical studies highlight the critical role of the highly conserved methionine (M58) of SARS-CoVs Orf6.

Evidence of the benefits of vitamin C (VC) for the treatment of sepsis is accumulating. However, data revealing the targets and molecular mechanisms of VC action against sepsis are limited. In this report, a bioinformatics analysis of network pharmacology was conducted to demonstrate screening targets, biological functions, and the signaling pathways of VC action against sepsis. As shown in network assays, 63 primary causal targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified from the data, and four optimal core targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified. These core targets were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK1), proto-oncogene c (JUN), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). In addition, all biological processes (including a top 20) and signaling pathways (including a top 20) potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis were identified. The hub genes potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis and interlaced networks from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Mapper assays were highlighted.

A review was performed to identify the relevant publications available up to May 15, 2020. Since the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the case fatality rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) has stood at 0.69% worldwide and 0.4% in Italy. Based on the current information, most patients have exhibited good prognoses in terms of after-effects or sequelae and low mortality rate. Patients that became critically ill were primarily in the elderly population or had chronic underlying diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. Among all working sectors, HCWs, since they are front-line caregivers for patients with COVID-19, are considered to be in the high-risk population. Increased age and a number of comorbidity factors have been associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. The most frequent complications of COVID-19 reported that can cause fatality in patients were SARS, cardiac arrest, secondary infections and septic shock, in addition to acute kidney failure and liver failure.

This is particularly true of the larger 12-mm ports that require deep fascial closure to avoid port-site herniation. We investigated whether using radially expanding trocars not requiring fascial closure compared to conventional cutting trocars for the 12-mm port in transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repairs had any effect on postoperative analgesic requirements and return to work or normal activity. METHODS The number of days analgesia was required postoperatively and the number of days taken to return to normal activity was recorded for 143 consecutive patients who underwent TAPP hernia repair by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Exactly the same operative technique was used in these patients with the exception of the 12-mm port site entry. In group 1 (104 patients), a conventional cutting trocar was used requiring deep fascial closure. In group 2 (39 patients), a radially expanding trocar was used and the fascial defect was not closed. RESULTS Analgesia was required for an average of 10.5 days in group 1 and 2.4 days in group 2 (P < 0.001). The average time to return to work or to normal activity was 23.4 days in group 1 and 15.6 days in group 2 (P = 0.004). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the patients' age, sex, or operating time. CONCLUSION Using the laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair as a standardised operation, changing from 12-mm fascial port closure to a technique that uses port dilation (not requiring a potentially \\"tight\\" deeper fascial closure) in a similar group of patients shows that there is a significant reduction in postoperative analgesic requirement and an earlier return to productive work or normal lifestyle. Perhaps dilating ports should replace those larger 10-, 12-, and 15-mm ports that require deeper sutures in all laparoscopic surgical operations.","output":"Radially expanding laparoscopic trocar ports significantly reduce postoperative pain in all age groups."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has challenged the medical community. While diagnostic and therapeutic efforts have been focused on respiratory complications of the disease, several ocular implications have also emerged. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in tears of the infected patients, and reports suggest that the ocular surface could serve as a portal of entry and a reservoir for viral transmission. Clinically, COVID-19 has been associated with mild conjunctivitis, which can be the first and only symptom of the disease. Subtle retinal changes like hyperreflective lesions in the inner layers on optical coherence tomography (OCT), cotton-wool spots, and microhemorrhages have also been reported. In addition, COVID-19 has been associated with an increased incidence of systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus and Kawasaki disease, which are particularly relevant for ophthalmologists due to their potentially severe ocular manifestations. Several treatment strategies are currently under investigation for COVID-19, but none of them have been proved to be safe and effective to date. Intensive care unit patients, due to risk factors like invasive mechanical ventilation, prone position, and multiresistant bacterial exposure, may develop ocular complications like ocular surface disorders, secondary infections, and less frequently acute ischemic optic neuropathy and intraocular pressure elevation. Among the array of drugs that have shown positive results, the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has raised a concern due to their well-known retinal toxic effects.

Physiotherapists' perceptions and willingness are two key factors that influence the provision of remote physiotherapy. AIM: To investigate physiotherapists' perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the barriers that may hinder the use of telerehabilitation in this sector. METHODS: The following methods were used: (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. In the cross-sectional survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 747 physiotherapists who were working in the governmental health sector. The questionnaire included four sections: perceptions of telerehabilitation, comfort with technology, willingness to use telerehabilitation, and barriers to using telerehabilitation. Six interviews were conducted with physiotherapy managers to explore the barriers and facilitators of telerehabilitation practice. DATA ANALYSIS: In this study, descriptive data analysis was conducted, and a cross-tabulation technique was used to find the associations between the variables, in which chi-square tests were used to identify the significance of the results, where p < 0.05. Thematic content analysis was used for the interviews. RESULTS: Only 273 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 36.5%. Most of the respondents (237; 86.8%) considered telerehabilitation a viable option to deliver healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) (156; 57.1%), 89% (243) of the respondents were willing to integrate telerehabilitation into their conventional practice, as cultural and social norms were not against the use of telerehabilitation systems. The results indicate that the more the physiotherapists used the internet and email in their work and the more comfortable they were with technology, the more willing they were to use telerehabilitation systems (p = 0.01). The physiotherapy managers reported that patients' privacy and the confidentiality of their data were considered barriers. CONCLUSION: In Kuwait, physiotherapists show overall positive perceptions towards and a willingness to use telerehabilitation to facilitate patients' access to physiotherapy services. There are several barriers to employing telerehabilitation.

The anti-inflammatory influence of near-daily physical activity in lowering C-reactive protein, total blood leukocytes, interleukin-6, and other inflammatory cytokines may play a key role in lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, sarcopenia, and dementia. Moderate exercise training causes favorable perturbations in immunity and a reduction in incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). During each bout of moderate exercise, an enhanced recirculation of immunoglobulins, neutrophils, and natural killer cells occurs that persists for up to 3-h post-exercise. This exercise-induced surge in immune cells from the innate immune system is transient but improves overall surveillance against pathogens. As moderate exercise continues on a near-daily basis for 12C15 weeks, the number of symptoms days with URTI is decreased 25%C50% compared to randomized sedentary controls.

The species mean NRA values ranged from 0.37 to 8.34 mols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Species in the vegetated zone growing closest to recent guano deposits had the highest NRA values, (mean = 4.47) whereas plants growing farther below the cliff had significantly lower values (mean = 0.55). A similar pattern was detected in a duplicate set of plants induced with 15 mM KNO(3); vegetation zone means for NRA ranged from 5.08 to 0.98 mols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Maximally induced species NRA values were highest in the first zones below the cliff and decreased downslope.

Individuals who walk at least 10 000 steps per day are likely to meet recommended physical activity guidelines. Very little is known about the physical activity levels of doctors at work, in particular those working in emergency departments (EDs). OBJECTIVES: To determine how many steps per shift were taken by doctors in a South African (SA) ED. Secondary objectives were to assess what factors influenced the number of steps taken. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study in a tertiary academic teaching hospital ED in Johannesburg over a 1-month period. Doctors wore pedometers during their day shifts in the ED and the number of steps taken during their shifts was measured, as well as the number and triage category of patients seen and whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) number of steps taken per shift was 6 328 (4 646 - 8 409). The number of steps taken exceeded the 10 000-step target in only 11.7% of shifts. The overall mean (standard deviation (SD)) number of steps per hour was 744 (490). Factors that significantly increased the number of steps taken included shift duration, number of patients seen who were triaged yellow, and performance of CPR in a shift. Each additional hour of shift led to a mean (SD) increase of 575 (115) steps. Each additional yellow patient seen led to a mean (SD) increase of 118 (108) steps. The mean (SD) number of steps for a shift with CPR was significantly higher (8 309 (850) steps) than for a shift without CPR (6 496 (384) steps). CONCLUSIONS: Doctors working in an SA ED are not achieving the daily recommended number of steps while at work. The increased risk of ill health and burnout in an already high-risk specialty heightens the importance of exercise and physical activity that needs to be achieved outside the workplace.","output":"Let's get physical: A prospective pedometer study of doctors working in a South African emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author criticizes the decision making practices of political leaders regarding the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming that they only follow science if it fits to their agenda or policies.","output":"We're following the science (but not if it's inconvenient)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread over more than 100 countries all over the world.

Given its acute and often self-limiting course, it is likely that components of the innate immune system play a central part in controlling virus replication and determining clinical outcome. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with notable activity against a broad range of viruses, including RNA viruses1,2. NK cell function may be altered during COVID-19 despite increased representation of NK cells with an activated and adaptive phenotype3,4. Here we show that a decline in viral load in COVID-19 correlates with NK cell status and that NK cells can control SARS-CoV-2 replication by recognizing infected target cells. In severe COVID-19, NK cells show defects in virus control, cytokine production and cell-mediated cytotoxicity despite high expression of cytotoxic effector molecules. Single-cell RNA sequencing of NK cells over the time course of the COVID-19 disease spectrum reveals a distinct gene expression signature. Transcriptional networks of interferon-driven NK cell activation are superimposed by a dominant transforming growth factor-? (TGF?) response signature, with reduced expression of genes related to cell-cell adhesion, granule exocytosis and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In severe COVID-19, serum levels of TGF? peak during the first two weeks of infection, and serum obtained from these patients severely inhibits NK cell function in a TGF?-dependent manner. Our data reveal that an untimely production of TGF? is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and may inhibit NK cell function and early control of the virus.","output":"Untimely TGF? responses in COVID-19 limit antiviral functions of NK cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an important role in reproduction and pathological reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the antigenicity of the protein is better than spike (S) protein. This study was to find a highly specific and antigenic recombinant SCoV nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein, and to provide a basis for further researches on early diagnosis of SARS. METHODS Full length cDNA of SCoV nucleocapsid (SCoVN) protein was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into yeast expression vector pPIC3.5K to construct plasmid of pPIC3.5K-SCoVN. The plasmid was linearized and then transformed into Pichia pastoris (P.pastoris) GS115 (His-Mut+) by electroporation. His(+)Mut(+) recombinant strains were identified by PCR and cultivated on MM/MD plates. The influence of different factors on biomass and rSCoVN protein production during induction phase, such as various induction media, dissolved oxygen (DO) and different final concentrations of methanol, was subsequently studied. The expression level and activation were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot respectively. RESULTS All of the recombinants were His(+)Mut(+) after transformation of P.pastoris with linearized plasmids. The BMMY medium was optimal for recombinant ScoVN (rSCoVN) protein expression and growth of the recombinant strains. The final optimal concentration of methanol was 20 mL/L, the DO had a significant effect on rSCoVN protein expression and growth of recombinant strains. The rSCoVN protein expressed in recombinant strains was about 8% of the total cell protein, 520 mg/L of rSCoVN protein was achieved, and a maximum cell A at 600 nm of 62 was achieved in shake flask culture. The rSCoVN protein had a high specificity against mouse-anti-SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but had no cross-reaction with normal human serum. The biological activity of rSCoVN expressed in P.pastoris was about 4-fold higher than that expressed in E.coli when the same rSCoVN protein quantity was used. CONCLUSION Active recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein can be successfully expressed in recombinant methylotrophic yeast P.pastoris GS115.

Discriminatory power was compared to predictions based on conventional pc-ASPECTS ratings. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed non-contrast CTs and clinical data of 172 pc-stroke patients. 90 days outcome was dichotomized into good and poor using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) cut-offs. Predictive performance was assessed for outcome differentiation at mRS 2, 3, 4 and survival prediction (mRS  5) using random forest algorithms. Results were compared to conventional pc-ASPECTS and clinical parameters. Models were evaluated in a nested fivefold cross-validation approach. RESULTS Receiver operating characteristic areas under the curves (ROC-AUCs) of the test sets using conventionally rated pc-ASPECTS reached 0.63 for mRS  4 to 0.68 for mRS  5 and 0.73 for mRS  5 to 0.85 for mRS  2 if clinical data were considered. Pure imaging-based machine learning classifier ROC-AUCs were lowest for mRS  4 (0.81) and highest for mRS  5 (0.87).

Demographic, clinical, and admission laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before May 19(th), 2020. Using patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH, derivation cohort), multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to construct the Ventilation in COVID Estimator (VICE) and Death in COVID Estimator (DICE) risk scores. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were ventilation status and death. RESULTS: The entire cohort included 1042 patients (median age, 64 years; 56.8% male). The derivation and validation cohorts for the risk scores included 578 and 464 patients, respectively. We found seven factors to be independently predictive for ventilation requirement (diabetes mellitus, dyspnea, alanine aminotransferase, troponin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase), and 10 factors to be predictors of in-hospital mortality (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic statin use, albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, and procalcitonin). Using these factors, we constructed the VICE and DICE risk scores, which performed with C-statistics of at least 0.8 in our cohorts. Importantly, the chronic use of a statin was associated with protection against death due to COVID-19.

Results: Two hundred and forty-seven respondents (mean age 32  7 years), mainly with relapsingCremitting MS, from all Italian regions participated. Participants felt more worried, confused, sad, and vulnerable because of the disease during the pandemic in comparison to their self-evaluation of the period before the COVID-19 outbreak. Similarly, their perception of control over MS decreased during the pandemic in comparison to the retrospective evaluation of the period before the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0.01).

This study aimed to estimate the willingness to be vaccinated and the socio-demographic and motivational correlates among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in French Guiana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 22 to March 26, 2021 among a sample of HCWs in French Guiana. They were asked about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake and vaccines attitudes. Factors associated with willingness to get vaccinated have been analyzed with ordinal logistic regression, using Stata software. Results: A total of 579 HCWs were interviewed, including 220 physicians and 200 nurses most often working in hospital (54%) or in the liberal sector (22%). Overall, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24.3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 11.2% were unsure. HCWs were more willing to get vaccine if they were older, were worried about COVID-19 and were confident in the management of epidemic. Conversely, participants were less likely to have been vaccinated or willing to if they were nurses or of another non-medical profession, born in French Guiana, feared adverse effects, or if they did not trust pharmaceutical companies and management of the epidemic by authorities. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern among HCWs in French Guiana when considering the current active epidemic with Gamma VOC. General vaccine hesitancy and concerns about future side effects in particular represent important barriers.

We reviewed available literature to reach an evidenced-based consensus on the expected duration of viral shedding. DESIGN: We queried 4 scholarly repositories and search engines for studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding dynamics by PCR and/or culture available through September 8, 2020. We calculated the pooled median duration of viral RNA shedding from respiratory and fecal sources. RESULTS: The review included 77 studies on SARS-CoV-2. All studies reported PCR-based testing and 12 also included viral culture data. Among 28 studies, the overall pooled median duration of RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 18.4 days (95% CI, 15.5C21.3; I(2) = 98.87%; P < .01). When stratified by disease severity, the pooled median duration of viral RNA shedding from respiratory sources was 19.8 days (95% CI, 16.2C23.5; I(2) = 96.42%; P < .01) among severely ill patients and 17.2 days (95% CI, 14.0C20.5; I(2) = 95.64%; P < .01) in mild-to-moderate illness. Viral RNA was detected up to 92 days after symptom onset. Viable virus was isolated by culture from ?6 to 20 days relative to symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV-2 RNA shedding can be prolonged, yet high heterogeneity exists. Detection of viral RNA may not correlate with infectivity since available viral culture data suggests shorter durations of shedding of viable virus. Additional data are needed to determine the duration of shedding of viable virus and the implications for risk of transmission.","output":"Understanding viral shedding of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Review of current literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We tested the proposal that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the AMPAR subunit GluA1 is required for LTP.

The aim of this study was to validate and verify the GeneFinder(TM) COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius? instrument and compare to the national reference method. METHODS: GeneFinder(TM) COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit was evaluated against the routine WHO in- house Real-Time PCR assay, which is also the national reference method in the Netherlands and used in our laboratory. The sensitivity was tested using the analytical panel from Qnostics (Glasgow, United Kingdom) and the specificity was tested with patient material comprising of other seasonal respiratory viruses. In addition, 96 clinical samples initially analyzed by routine Real-Time PCR were tested using the GeneFinder(TM) COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius? instrument. RESULTS: The GeneFinder(TM) COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit had a similar performance compared to routine in-house testing, with a limit of detection of 500 dC/mL for the RdRp-gene and E gene. Meanwhile, the N gene showed a limit of detection of 50 dC/mL. The SARS-CoV-2 test was highly specific and detected no other respiratory viruses.

METHODS: The study included 660 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed positive pediatric patients (aged 3C15 years) diagnosed at King Abdullah Specialist Children Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data were retrospectively retrieved from January to July 2020 from electronic medical records and included patients' epidemiological and clinical features. Patients were then followed-up via phone calls to document any symptoms encountered after the first visit. Patients were categorized into three main groups according to age (3-6 years, 7-10 years, 11-15 years). RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients (43.6%) had asymptomatic infections. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported manifestations accounting for 39.2% and 19.8%, respectively. The most frequently reported otolaryngology symptoms were sore throat (17.3%) and rhinorrhea (14.4%). Moreover, 10.4% and 13.1% of children aged 7-15 years old experienced smell and taste disturbances, respectively.

Herein, our objective was to investigate the characteristics of laboratory findings of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This was a retrospective study and included 80 T2DM patients of Jinling Hospital from 2010C2020, as well as 76 COVID-19 patients without T2DM and 55 COVID-19 patients with T2DM who were treated at Huoshen hill Hospital from February 11 to March 18, 2020. We then compared the differences in laboratory test results between the three groups. RESULTS: The levels of lymphocytes, uric acid (UA), and globulin in the T2DM group were significantly higher. In contrast, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)levels were lower than those in the COVID-19 (p  0.05) and COVID-19 + T2DM groups (p  0.05).

METHODS: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. RESULTS: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients.

Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. CONCLUSION: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD.

Research involving Nipah infectious clones has never been reported to have occured at the WIV. These patient samples have been previously reported to contain reads from several other viruses: Influenza A, Spodoptera frugiperda rhabdovirus and Nipah. Previous authors have interpreted the presence of these virus sequences as indicative of co-infections of the patients in question by these pathogens or laboratory contamination. However, our analysis shows that NiV genes are encapsulated in synthetic vectors, which we infer was for assembly of a NiV infectious clone. In particular, we document the finding of internal N, P-V-W-C and L protein coding sequences as well as coverage of the G and F genes. Furthermore, the format of Hepatitis D virus ribozyme and T7 terminator downstream of the 5-prime end of the NiV sequence is consistent with truncation required at the end of the genome for a full length infectious clone. This indicates that research at WIV was being conducted on an assembled NiV infectious clone.

METHODS: Ventilated patients in sinus rhythm with COPD and/or heart failure (ejection fraction  40%) were studied. Echocardiography was performed immediately before and during a 30-min spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) using a T-tube. Patients who failed were treated according to echocardiography results before undergoing a second SBT. RESULTS: Twelve of 59 patients failed SBT, all of them developing WIPO. Patients who succeeded SBT had lower body weight (? 2.5 kg [? 4.8; ? 1] vs. + 0.75 kg [? 2.95; + 5.57]: p = 0.02) and cumulative fluid balance (? 2326 ml [? 3715; + 863] vs. + 143 ml [? 2654; + 4434]: p = 0.007) than those who developed WIPO. SBT-induced central hemodynamic changes were more pronounced in patients who developed WIPO, with higher E wave velocity (122 cm/s [92; 159] vs. 93 cm/s [74; 109]: p = 0.017) and E/A ratio (2.1 [1.2; 3.6] vs. 0.9 [0.8; 1.4]: p = 0.001), and shorter E wave deceleration time (85 ms [72; 125] vs. 147 ms [103; 175]: p = 0.004). After echocardiography-guided treatment, all patients who failed the first SBT were successfully extubated. Fluid balance was then negative (? 2224 ml [? 7056; + 100] vs. + 146 ml [? 2654; + 4434]: p = 0.005). Left ventricular filling pressures were lower (E/E: 7.3 [5; 10.4] vs. 8.9 [5.9; 13.1]: p = 0.028); SBT-induced increase in E wave velocity (+ 10.6% [? 2.7/ + 18] vs. + 25.6% [+ 12.7/ + 49]: p = 0.037) and of mitral regurgitation area were significantly smaller.

AIM To determine prevalence of CPE in hospital drains exposed to in-patients with CPE, relatedness of drain and patient CPE, and risk factors for drain contamination. METHODS We cultured sink and shower drains in patient rooms and communal shower rooms exposed to 310 in-patients with CPE colonization/infection at 10 hospitals. Using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing, in-patient and corresponding drain CPE were compared. Risk factors for drain contamination were assessed using multi-level modelling. FINDINGS Of 1,209 exposed patient room and communal shower room drains, 53 (4%) yielded 62 CPE isolates in 7 (70%) hospitals. Of 49 CPE isolates in patient room drains, 4 (8%) were linked to prior room occupants. Linked drain/room occupant pairs included Citrobacter freundii ST18 isolates separated by 8 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), related blaKPC-containing IncN3-type plasmids (different species), related blaKPC-3-containing IncN-type plasmids (different species), and related blaOXA-48-containing IncL/M-type plasmids (different species). In one hospital, drain isolates from 8 rooms on 2 units were Enterobacter hormaechei separated by 0-6 SNVs. Shower drains were more likely to be CPE-contaminated than hand hygiene (OR 3.45, 95%CI 1.66-7.16) or patient use (OR 13.0, 95%CI 4.29-39.1) sink drains. Hand hygiene sink drains were more likely to be CPE-contaminated than patient use sink drains (OR 3.75, 95%CI 1.17-12.0). CONCLUSION Drain contamination was uncommon but widely dispersed.

In Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG and Rrp4 but not Csl4 show preference for poly(rA). Archaeal DnaG contains N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of unknown function flanking a TOPRIM domain. We found that the NT and TOPRIM domains have comparable, high conservation in all archaea, while the CTD conservation correlates with the presence of exosome. We show that the NTD is a novel RNA-binding domain with poly(rA)-preference cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA. Consistently, a fusion protein containing full-length Csl4 and NTD of DnaG led to enhanced degradation of A-rich RNA by the exosome. We also found that DnaG strongly binds native and in vitro transcribed rRNA and enables its polynucleotidylation by the exosome.

Based on our data, we propose that archaeal DnaG is an RNA-binding protein, which, in the context of the exosome, is involved in targeting of stable RNA for degradation.","output":"Archaeal DnaG contains a conserved N-terminal RNA-binding domain and enables tailing of rRNA by the exosome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pregnant women have been classified as at risk for COVID-19 due to previous experience with influenza and other coronaviruses The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the complications and death in women of childbearing age and pregnant women with suspected COVID-19","output":"COVID-19 mortality among pregnant women in Mexico: a retrospective cohort study.

In this study, we explored COVID-19 testing and the impact of the pandemic among participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV cohort, predominantly composed of lowincome minorities living with and without HIV. Methods: Between July and August 2020, a telephone survey was administered to 299 Miami Adult Studies on HIV participants to assess COVID-19 testing, prevention behaviors, and psychosocial stressors. Health care utilization, antiretroviral adherence, food insecurity, and substance use during the pandemic were compared with those of their last cohort visit (7.8 6 2.9 months earlier). Results: Half of surveyed participants had been tested for COVID-19, 8 had tested positive and 2 had been hospitalized. PLWH (n = 183) were 42% times less likely than HIV-uninfected participants to have been tested. However, after adjustment for age, employment, COVID-19 symptoms, mental health care, and substance use, the effect of HIV status was no longer significant. PLWH were more likely to have seen a health care provider, use face coverings, and avoid public transportation and less likely to be food insecure and drink hazardously. There were significant changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic when compared with those before. Conclusion: PLWH, compared with their HIV-uninfected peers, were more likely to engage in preventive measures and health care during the pandemic, potentially reducing their exposure to COVID-19. There were no reported changes in antiretroviral adherence or health care utilization, but there were changes in substance use;these need to be monitored as this crisis progresses.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among these populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Guided by the health belief model, a cross-sectional study design was employed among 335 participants, and primary data were collected through an online survey. Measured using DASS-21, anxiety, depression, and stress were the dependent variables. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses-logistic regression was used to predict independently associated variables. STATA was used to execute all data analyses. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers were 10.15, 9.25, and 2.39%, respectively. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among those aged 21-30 years old, who had completed a university degree, were married, and had quarantined for 14 days. Conversely, the risk of anxiety and depression was high among those who had bad perceived health status, high perceived susceptibility, and negative stigma perception. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers was relatively low compared to the general population. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among young people, educated people, and those under effective quarantine, but the risk was high among those who had negative perceptions about their health, stigma, and susceptibility to the disease.","output":"Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Repatriated Indonesian Migrant Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and hypercoagulable conditions that predispose patients to thrombosis such as the prothrombin gene ( F2) rs1799963 (G20210A), factor V Leiden ( F5) rs6025 (G1691A) and PAI-1 (rs1799768) Patients: NCP-diagnosed 62 previously healthy patients were enrolled for the investigation of the thrombophilia-related polymorphisms Materials &amp;methods: The frequency of genotypes were compared with healthy control group frequencies from other studies Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the severe patient group and the healthy population regarding the investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) Conclusion: This study is the first to rule out the relationship of rs1799963, rs6025 and rs1799768 with severe NCP","output":"Investigation of the relationship between inherited thrombophilia and novel coronavirus pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may help avoid intubation of hypoxemic patients suffering from COVID-19; however, it may also contribute to delaying intubation, which may increase mortality. Here, we aimed to identify the predictors of HFNC failure among patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective study in China from January 15 to March 31, 2020. Two centers in Wuhan (resource-limited centers) enrolled 32 patients, and four centers outside Wuhan enrolled 34 cases. HFNC failure was defined as the requirement of escalation therapy (NIV or intubation). The ROX index (the ratio of SpO(2)/FiO(2) to the respiratory rate) was calculated. Results: Among the 66 patients, 29 (44%) cases experienced HFNC failure. The ROX index was much lower in failing patients than in successful ones after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h of HFNC. The ROX index was independently associated with HFNC failure (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45C0.94) among the variables collected before and 1 h after HFNC. To predict HFNC failure tested by ROX index, the AUC was between 0.73 and 0.79 for the time points of measurement 1C24 h after HFNC initiation. The HFNC failure rate was not different between patients in and outside Wuhan (41% vs. 47%, p = 0.63). However, the time from HFNC initiation to intubation was longer in Wuhan than that outside Wuhan (median 63 vs. 22 h, p = 0.02). Four patients in Wuhan underwent intubation due to cardiac arrest; in contrast, none of the patients outside Wuhan received intubation (13 vs. 0%, p = 0.05). The mortality was higher in Wuhan than that out of Wuhan, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (31 vs. 12%, p = 0.07). Conclusion: The ROX index can be used to predict HFNC failure among COVID-19 patients to avoid delayed intubation, which may occur in the resource-limited area.","output":"High-Flow Nasal Cannula for COVID-19 Patients: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is one of the most effective reperfusion strategies for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) despite myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, causing one of the causes of most cardiomyocyte injuries and deaths. The pathological processes of myocardial I/R injury include apoptosis, autophagy, and irreversible cell death caused by calcium overload, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Eventually, myocardial I/R injury causes a spike of further cardiomyocyte injury that contributes to final infarct size (IS) and bound with hospitalization of heart failure as well as all-cause mortality within the following 12 months. Therefore, the addition of adjuvant intervention to improve myocardial salvage and cardiac function calls for further investigation. Phytochemicals are non-nutritive bioactive secondary compounds abundantly found in Chinese herbal medicine. Great effort has been put into phytochemicals because they are often in line with the expectations to improve myocardial I/R injury without compromising the clinical efficacy or to even produce synergy. We summarized the previous efforts, briefly outlined the mechanism of myocardial I/R injury, and focused on exploring the cardioprotective effects and potential mechanisms of all phytochemical types that have been investigated under myocardial I/R injury. Phytochemicals deserve to be utilized as promising therapeutic candidates for further development and research on combating myocardial I/R injury.

METHODS: We employed user-centered and participatory design methods to understand the problems and develop a solution by engaging the stakeholder team (including caregivers, physicians, researchers, clinical informaticists, nurses, developers, nutritionists, pharmacists, and interpreters) and nonCEnglish-speaking caregiver participants. RESULTS: Considering the lack of interpreter service accessibility and advancement in translation technology, our team will develop and test an integrated, multimodal (voice-interactive and text-based) patient portal communication and translation app to enable nonCEnglish-speaking caregivers to communicate with providers using their preferred languages. For this initial prototype, we will focus on the Spanish language and Spanish-speaking families to test technical feasibility and evaluate usability.

However, these important data are limited to developed nations and lacking in resource-limited countries, like Ethiopia. METHODS: We compared receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG antibodies in 40 SARS-CoV-2 na?ve participants and 25 participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We measured the antibody response in post-vaccination blood samples from both groups of participants collected at four different post-vaccination time points: 8- and 12-weeks after each dose of the vaccine administration using an in-house developed ELISA. RESULTS: We observed a high level of anti-RBD IgG antibodies titers 8-weeks after a single dose administration (16/27; 59.3%) among na?ve participants, albeit dropped significantly (p<0.05) two months later, suggesting the protective immunity elicited by the first dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine will likely last for a minimum of three months. However, as expected, a significant (p<0.001) increase in the level of anti-RBD IgG antibodies titers was observed after the second dose administration in all na?ve participants. By contrast, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine-induced anti-RBD IgG antibody titers produced by the P.I participants at 8- to 12-weeks post-single dose vaccination were found to be similar to the antibody titers seen after a two-dose vaccination course among infection-na?ve participants and showed no significant (p>0.05) increment following the second dose administration. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings show that a single ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals elicits similar antibody responses to that of double dose vaccinated na?ve individuals. Age and sex were not associated with the level of vaccine-elicited immune responses in both individuals with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to assess the need for a booster dose to extend the duration and amplitude of the specific protective immune response in Ethiopia settings, especially following the Omicron pandemic.","output":"A single dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine elicits high antibody responses in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection comparable to that of double dose vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection na?ve individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two decades of intensive research in lanthanide-based molecular nanomagnets have brought the magnetic memory in molecules from liquid helium to liquid nitrogen temperature.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether increased interleukin (IL)-6 levels can predict right ventricular (RV) systolic impairment in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS This prospective, observational study included 100 consecutive patients hospitalized with mild and moderate COVID-19. All the patients underwent chest computerized tomography, detailed laboratory tests including IL-6, and two dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with assessment of 2D conventional and Doppler echocardiography parameters and RV systolic functions. RESULTS After the elimination of six patients with exclusion criteria, the remaining patients were classified into two groups, namely normal RV systolic functions (n=60) and impaired RV systolic functions (n=34). IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with impaired RV systolic functions than in those with normal RV systolic functions (20.3, 4.6, p<0.001, respectively). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and RV derived tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) S' measurements were similar between the two groups. RV fractional area change was significantly lower, and RV TDI derived index of myocardial performance was significantly higher in patients with impaired RV systolic functions. In multivariate analysis, IL-6 levels independently predicted deterioration in RV systolic function at a significant level (odds ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.20, p=0.003). CONCLUSION IL-6 is an independent predictor of RV systolic impairment in patients hospitalized with mild and moderate COVID-19 suggesting a possible pathogenetic mechanism.

METHODS: All mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated on ICU between March 2020 and January 2021 were included. Respiratory specimens were tested for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, 2 and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) by quantitative real-time PCR. Clinical parameters were compared in the cohorts with and without HSV-1- infection. RESULTS: 134 patients with a median age of 72.5 years (73.0% male, n=98) were included. HSV-1 reactivation occurred in 61 patients (45.5%), after median 9 (7-13) days of mechanical ventilation. The main factor for reactivation was length of stay on ICU (24 days vs 13 days, p<0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (417 vs 214 hours, p<0.001). Treatment with dexamethasone and a history of immunosuppression did not associate with HSV-infection in the univariate analysis (39 vs 41, p=0.462 and 27.9% vs 23.3%, p=0.561, respectively). Both ICU and hospital mortality were not significantly different in the cohorts with and without HSV-infection (57.4% vs 45.2%, p=0.219). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a high prevalence of HSV-infection in critically-ill COVID-19 patients which was unexpectedly higher than the prevalence of CMV-infections and unrelated to dexamethasone treatment. The main risk factors for HSV and CMV in the studied cohorts were the length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.

We also estimate basic reproduction number to illustrate the epidemiological status of the regions under study. Our simulations infer that the infective population will be on increasing curve for Maharashtra and India, and settling for Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected individuals. Our results reveal that to curtail the disease burden in India, specific control strategies should be implemented effectively so that the basic reproduction number is decreased below unity. The three control strategies are shown to be important preventive measures to lower disease transmission rate. The model is further extended to its stochastic counterpart to encapsulate the variation or uncertainty observed in the disease transmissibility. We observe the variability in the infective population and found their distribution at certain fixed time, which shows that for small populations, the stochasticity will play an important role.","output":"A mathematical model for the impacts of face mask, hospitalization and quarantine on the dynamics of COVID-19 in India: deterministic vs. stochastic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has affected economies, labor markets, health care, education and tourism around the globe in unprecedented ways.

We estimate reporting of IPCOH with a romantic/sexual partner in the 4 weeks prior to interview, describe the type of contact, identify demographic and behavioural factors associated with IPCOH and present age-adjusted ORs (aORs). Qualitative interviews (n=18) were conducted to understand the context, reasons and decision making around IPCOH. RESULTS: Of 6654 participants aged 18C59 years, 9.9% (95% CI 9.1% to 10.6%) reported IPCOH. IPCOH was highest in those aged 18C24 (17.7%), identifying as gay or lesbian (19.5%), and in steady non-cohabiting relationships (56.3%). IPCOH was associated with reporting risk behaviours (eg, condomless sex, higher alcohol consumption). IPCOH was less likely among those reporting bad/very bad health (aOR 0.54; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.93) but more likely among those with COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis (aOR 1.34; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65). Two-thirds (64.4%) of IPCOH was reported as being within a support bubble. Qualitative interviews found that people reporting IPCOH deliberated over, and made efforts to mitigate, the risks. CONCLUSIONS: Given 90% of people did not report IPCOH, this contact may not be a large additional contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, although heterogeneity exists within the population.

We aimed to estimate the impact of pandemic-related avoidance on outpatient IBD management, and the cost-effectiveness of adding telemonitoring during pandemic from the perspective of Hong Kong public healthcare provider. METHODS: The study was performed by a decision-analytic model to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost of care for IBD patients before and during the pandemic, and to compare the cost and QALYs of adding telemonitoring to standard care (SC-TM) versus standard care alone (SC) for IBD patients during the pandemic. The sources of model inputs included publications (retrieved from literature search) and public data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: Standard care with pandemic-related avoidance (versus without avoidance) lost 0.0026 QALYs at higher cost (by USD43). The 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations found standard care with pandemic-related avoidance lost QALYs and incurred higher cost in 100% and 96.82% of the time, respectively. Compared with the SC group, the SC-TM group saved 0.0248 QALYs and reduced cost by USD799. Monte Carlo simulations showed the SC-TM group gained higher QALYs at lower cost in 100% of 10,000 simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Standard care for IBD patients during pandemic with healthcare avoidance appears to worsen treatment outcomes at higher cost and lowered QALYs.

Data were collected among 204 physicians and nurses. The statistical analysis revealed a correlation between physical activity and some aspects of sleep disorders. RESULTS: A total number of 204 questionnaires have been distributed to medical doctors and nurses working in public hospitals in Athens Greece from the middle of February until the middle of April 2020. The hospitals were assigned by the health authorities to the fight of the pandemic of COVID 19. The majority of the participants were women 71,3% and 28,7% were men. From a total of 204 half of them were medical doctors and half of them were nurses. 43% were married, 49% were single and 8% were divorced and there were no widows. Regarding the participant nurses, 43% had a university degree and 38,4% had a technological education degree. The results of the statistical analysis showed that there are positive correlations between the level of physical activity during the daily work and the free time of the participants with parameters that are related to sleep disorders. CONCLUSION: The sample of the study was not a large one but nevertheless a stressful situation such as is the epidemic of COVID19 can provide useful information in order to better understand the relationship between physical activity and sleeping disorders in such working conditions.","output":"Sleep and Motion Disorders of Physicians and Nurses Working in Hospitals Facing the Pandemic of COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This technical report accompanies the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of the influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2021-2022 season.

ProGrip? is a self-gripping mesh which aims to reduce rates of chronic pain. The aim of this study is to perform an update meta-analysis to consolidate the non-superiority hypothesis in terms of postoperative pain and recurrence and perform a trial sequential analysis. METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pain and secondary outcomes were recurrence, operative time, wound complications, length of stay, re-operation rate, and cost. Trial sequential analysis was performed. RESULTS There were 14 studies included in the quantitative analysis with 3180 patients randomised to self-gripping mesh (1585) or standard mesh (1595). At all follow-up time points, there was no significant difference in the rates of chronic pain between the self-gripping and standard mesh (risk ratio, RR 1.10, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.83-1.46). There were no significant differences in recurrence rates (RR 1.13, CI 0.84-2.04). The mean operating time was significantly shorted in the ProGrip? mesh group (MD - 7.32 min, CI - 10.21 to - 4.44). Trial sequential analysis suggests findings are conclusive. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis has confirmed no benefit of a ProGrip? mesh when compared to a standard sutured mesh for open inguinal hernia repair in terms of chronic pain or recurrence.

Whole-genome sequencing based on next-generation sequencing technologies is the method of choice to identify all viral variants; however, the resources needed to use these techniques for a representative number of specimens remain limited in many low- and middle-income countries. To decrease sequencing costs, we developed a primer set allowing partial sequences to be generated in the viral S gene, enabling rapid detection of numerous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs); whole-genome sequencing is then performed on a selection of viruses based on partial sequencing results. Two hundred one nasopharyngeal specimens collected during the decreasing phase of a high-transmission COVID-19 wave in Tunisia were analyzed. The results reveal high genetic variability within the sequenced fragment and allow the detection of first introductions in the country of already-known VOCs and VOIs, as well as other variants that have interesting genomic mutations and need to be kept under surveillance. IMPORTANCE The method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection is whole-genome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Resources for this technology remain limited in many low- and middle-income countries, where it is not possible to perform whole-genome sequencing for representative numbers of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. In the present work, we developed a novel strategy based on a first partial Sanger screening in the S gene, which includes key mutations of the already known VOCs and VOIs, for rapid identification of these VOCs and VOIs and to help better select specimens that need to be sequenced by NGS technologies. The second step consists of whole-genome sequencing to allow a holistic view of all variants within the selected viral strains and confirm the initial classification of the strains based on partial S gene sequencing.","output":"Sequencing Using a Two-Step Strategy Reveals High Genetic Diversity in the S Gene of SARS-CoV-2 after a High-Transmission Period in Tunis, Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cholera, a devastating diarrheal disease that caused several global pandemics in the last centuries, may share some similarities with the new COVID\\\\19.

A recent unbiased genomics-guided tracing of the SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells identified vitamin D among the three top-scoring molecules manifesting potential infection mitigation patterns. Growing pre-clinical and epidemiological observational data support this assumption. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol versus a single oral standard dose on all-cause 14-day mortality rate in COVID-19 older adults at higher risk of worsening. METHODS: The COVIT-TRIAL study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial. Patients aged &#8805; 65 years with COVID-19 (diagnosed within the preceding 3 days with RT-PCR and/or chest CT scan) and at least one worsening risk factor at the time of inclusion (i.e., age &#8805; 75 years, or SpO2 &#8804; 94% in room air, or PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 300 mmHg), having no contraindications to vitamin D supplementation, and having received no vitamin D supplementation > 800 IU/day during the preceding month are recruited. Participants are randomized either to high-dose cholecalciferol (two 200,000 IU drinking vials at once on the day of inclusion) or to standard-dose cholecalciferol (one 50,000 IU drinking vial on the day of inclusion). Two hundred sixty participants are recruited and followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality within 14 days of inclusion. Secondary outcomes are the score changes on the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) scale for COVID-19, and the between-group comparison of safety. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, day 14, and day 28, together with the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, creatinine, calcium, and albumin at baseline and day 7. DISCUSSION: COVIT-TRIAL is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled trial testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of COVID-19 in high-risk older patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation may be an effective, well-tolerated, and easily and immediately accessible treatment for COVID-19, the incidence of which increases dramatically and for which there are currently no scientifically validated treatments.

This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity.

Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p = .0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02C1.09, p = .00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37% quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15C1.64, p = .00291), and Public Health a 16% increase (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11C1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Healths use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language, especially post-COVID.

For infectious diseases, one must study the circumstances under which both infection and disease occur, for these may be different. Infection is the consequence of an encounter of a potentially pathogenic microorganism with a susceptible human host through an appropriate portal of entry and usually involves a demonstrable host response to the agent. Exposure is the key factor, and the sources of infection lie mostly outside the individual human host, within the environment, or in other infected hosts. Disease represents one of the possible consequences of infection, and the factors important in its development are mostly intrinsic to the host, although the dosage and virulence of the infecting microbe play a role. These intrinsic factors include the age at the time of infection, the portal of entry, the presence or absence of immunity, the vigor of the primary defense system, the efficiency and nature of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, the genetic makeup of the host, the state of nutrition, the presence of other diseases, and psychosocial influences. These factors that result in the occurrence of clinical illness among those infected have been called the clinical illness-promotion factors,(3) and many of them remain unknown. The host responses can include death, the classic clinical features of the disease, mild or atypical forms, subclinical and inapparent infections, and the carrier state, which may exist in the absence of a detectable host response. While the clinician is primarily concerned with disease, the epidemiologist is interested in both infection and disease. Infection without disease is a common phenomenon, so that a study limited to clinical illness alone would give an incomplete epidemiological picture and would be a poor basis for control and prevention.(4) A full understanding involves the pathogenesis of the process leading to clinical disease both in the community and in the individual.","output":"Epidemiological Concepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arboviruses maintain high mutation rates due to lack of proofreading ability of their viral polymerases, in some cases facilitating adaptive evolution and emergence. Here we show that, just before its 2013 spread to the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) underwent an envelope protein V473M substitution (E-V473M) that increased neurovirulence, maternal-to-fetal transmission, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission. A preepidemic Asian ZIKV strain (FSS13025 isolated in Cambodia in 2010) engineered with the V473M substitution significantly increased neurovirulence in neonatal mice and produced higher viral loads in the placenta and fetal heads in pregnant mice. Conversely, an epidemic ZIKV strain (PRVABC59 isolated in Puerto Rico in 2015) engineered with the inverse M473V substitution reversed the pathogenic phenotypes. Although E-V473M did not affect oral infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, competition experiments in cynomolgus macaques showed that this mutation increased its fitness for viremia generation, suggesting adaptive evolution for human viremia and hence transmission. Mechanistically, the V473M mutation, located at the second transmembrane helix of the E protein, enhances virion morphogenesis. Overall, our study revealed E-V473M as a critical determinant for enhanced ZIKV virulence, intrauterine transmission during pregnancy, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission.","output":"A Zika virus envelope mutation preceding the 2015 epidemic enhances virulence and fitness for transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robust testing and tracing are key to fighting the menace of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods: Patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 150, with lung posterior consolidations as assessed by means of lung ultrasound, and chest x-ray were studied. Under continuous pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) monitoring, patients maintained active prone position. A PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150 was considered as treatment failure and patients had to be switched to non-invasive respiratory support. Retrospectively, data of 16 patients undergoing who refused proning and underwent non-invasive respiratory support were used as controls. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients maintaining prolonged prone position and discharged home. Secondary outcomes included improvement in oxygenation, hospital length of stay, and 6-month survival. Results: Three out of 16 (18.7%) patients did not tolerate the procedure.

Patients with PE were hospitalized after a longer time since symptoms onset (7 IQR 3-11 days, 3 IQR 1-6 days; p = 0.001) and showed higher D-dimers level (1819 IQR 568-5017 ng/ml vs 555 IQR 13-1530 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of myocardial injury (47% vs 28%, p = 0.033). At multivariable analysis, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE; HR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.66-0.98; p = 0.046) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP; HR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.03-1.23; p = 0.008) resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence. Mortality rates (50% vs 27%; p = 0.010) and cardiogenic shock (37% vs 14%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PE as compared with non-PE patients. At multivariate analysis PE was significant associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: PE is relatively common complication in COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality risk. TAPSE and sPAP resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients: prevalence, predictors and clinical outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exceptional health challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have sparked a wave of mobilization among medical students.

Past experience in routine and crisis contexts demonstrates that uptake of vaccines is more complicated than simply making the technology available. Vaccine uptake, and especially the widespread acceptance of vaccines, is a social endeavor that requires consideration of human factors.

As an additional objective we sought to determine whether a different expression of IFN lambda 1C3 was associated with different harboring viruses, the clinical course of bronchiolitis or with the levels of well established IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), such as mixovirus resistance A (MxA) and ISG56. Methods The analysis was undertaken in 118 infants with RSV or HRV bronchiolitis. Nasopharyngeal washes were collected for virological studies and molecular analysis of type III IFN responses. Results RSV elicited higher levels of IFN lambda subtypes when compared with HRV. A similar expression of type III IFN was found in RSVA or RSVB infected infants and in those infected with HRVA or HRVC viruses. Results also indicate that IFN lambda 1 and IFN lambda 2C3 levels were correlated with each other and with MxA and ISG56-mRNAs. In addition, a positive correlation exists between the IFN lambda1 levels and the clinical score index during RSV infection. In particular, higher IFN lambda 1 levels are associated to an increase of respiratory rate. Conclusions These findings show that differences in the IFN lambda 1C3 levels in infants with RSV or HRV infections are present and that the expression of IFN lambda 1 correlates with the severity of RSV bronchiolitis.","output":"Interferon lambda 1C3 expression in infants hospitalized for RSV or HRV associated bronchiolitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health emergency. When the pandemic started in our country fertility treatment was suspended for sometimes following national and international guidelines. This has led to delay in fertility treatment for some couples which was emotionally upsetting. METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN: This study was done on the patients enrolled at our various fertility units across India. The survey questionnaire was sent to patients during the month of first May to June 15, 2020, when COVID-19 pandemic was active across the country, and fertility units were just resuming the services back. The questionnaire was distributed to 100 patients who were currently under treatment and their response was recorded. Ethical committee approval was not taken as surveys are exempted from IRB. RESULTS: This survey was undertaken to understand the emotional impact of delay/cancelation in the fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey revealed that majority (95%) of couples felt cancelation of cycles as upsetting and 16% reporting it to be extremely upsetting. The impact was seen in the form of mood disturbances, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and depressive ideas. Almost half of the couples (49.4%) were desirous to start the fertility treatment immediately. Their knowledge regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy and future child was limited. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had impact on every sphere of life.

Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)Cenabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19Crelated keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing appCrelated keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learningCbased approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information.

Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data. Results hCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of 2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires less than 20mn on our cluster.

The restrictive component is considered key for short-term weight loss. However, there are important volume discrepancies between gastric reservoirs in different bariatric surgical techniques, which questions the real meaning of the restrictive part of the operation. We have investigated the relationship between residual gastric volume after sleeve gastrectomy in duodenal switch (DS) and weight loss over the first postoperative year. METHODS 14 patients submitted to a modified DS and one patient submitted to a sleeve gastrectomy were studied. All patients had an abdominal CT performed between the third and the ninth postoperative month to measure residual gastric volume. Gastric tube volume was correlated to early postoperative weight loss. RESULTS Mean excess BMI loss was 75% at 12 months. Mean gastric tube volume was 208 cc. Gastric volume was not related to preoperative weight or BMI; instead, it was directly related to patient's height. There was no statistical relation between gastric volume and weight loss at 3, 6, 9 or 12 months after the operation. CONCLUSION After DS, gastric tube volume is not directly related to weight changes. Other factors could have influence on intake restriction, such as gastric tube compliance or different mechanisms of satiety induction, because no differences in weight loss were observed between narrow tubes and wider ones, despite important variations in volume.","output":"Gastric tube volume after duodenal switch and its correlation to short-term weight loss."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide pandemic, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in response.

C-terminal truncation of E2 at residue 661 or 715 (position on the polyprotein) leads to secretion, consistent with deletion of a proposed hydrophobic transmembrane anchor sequence. We demonstrate cell surface expression of a chimeric glycoprotein consisting of E2 residues 384 to 661 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA), termed E2661-HATMCT. The E2661-HATMCT chimeric glycoprotein was able to bind a number of conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies and a recombinant soluble form of CD81, suggesting that it was folded in a manner comparable to \\"native\\" E2.

An understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms involved in virus replication is essential for repurposing the existing drugs and/or the discovery of new ones. Endocytosis is the important mechanism of entry of CoVs into host cells. Endosomal maturation followed by the fusion with lysosomes are crucial events in endocytosis. Late endosomes and lysosomes are characterized by their acidic pH, which is generated by a proton transporter V-ATPase and required for virus entry via endocytic pathway. The cytoplasmic cAMP pool produced by soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) promotes V-ATPase recruitment to endosomes/lysosomes and thus their acidification. In this review, we discuss targeting the sAC-specific cAMP pool as a potential strategy to impair the endocytic entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell.

We analyzed breakfast-related CGM profiles of free-living, predominantly Hispanic/Latino individuals at-risk of T2D, with pre-T2D, or with non-insulin treated T2D. METHODS: Starting February 2019, 119 participants in Santa Barbara, CA, USA, (93 female, 87% Hispanic/Latino [predominantly Mexican-American], age 544 [121] years), stratified by HbA(1c) levels into (i) at-risk of T2D, (ii) with pre-T2D, and (iii) with non-insulin treated T2D, wore blinded CGMs for two weeks. We compared valid CGM profiles from 106 of these participants representing glucose response to breakfast using four parameters. FINDINGS: A northeast drift was observed in breakfast glucose responses comparing at-risk to pre-T2D to T2D participants. T2D participants had a significantly higher pre-breakfast glucose level, glucose rise, glucose incremental area under the curve (all p < 00001), and time to glucose peak (p < 005) compared to pre-T2D and at-risk participants. After adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, pre-breakfast glucose and time to peak (p < 00001) were significantly associated with HbA(1c). The model predicted HbA(1c) within (055 [Formula: see text] 067)% of true laboratory HbA(1c) values. INTERPRETATION: For predominantly Hispanic/Latino adults, the average two-week breakfast glucose response shows a progression of dysglycemia from at-risk of T2D to pre-T2D to T2D. CGM-based breakfast metrics have the potential to predict HbA(1c) levels and monitor diabetes progression.

We confirm the significant negative impact of the outbreak on life satisfaction, with an extra 1% of cumulative death cases associated with a 0.54% decrease in expressed happiness.

The WIAT-4 authors make both pragmatic and measurement claims about the instrument. The pragmatic claims involve being useful for identifying individuals in certain academic achievement-related groups (e.g., specific learning disability). The measurement claims are twofold: (a) the instruments scores represent psychological attributes, and (b) scores transformed to standard score values have equal-interval properties. The WIAT-4 authors did not provide the evidence necessary to support the pragmatic claims in the technical manual, so we could not evaluate them. Thus, we limited our evaluation to the measurement claims for the composite scores. To do so, we used information in the technical manual along with some additional factor analyses. Support for the first measurement claim varies substantially across scores. Although none of the evidence is particularly strong, scores in mathematics and reading domains tend to have more support than the writing and total achievement scores. Support for the second claim was insufficient for all scores. Consequently, we recommend that psychologists wishing to interpret WIAT-4 composite scores limit those interpretations to just a few in the mathematics and reading domains. Second, psychologists should completely refrain from using any composite score in a way that requires equal-interval values (e.g., quantitative score comparisons). Neither of these recommendations necessarily disqualifies the scores from being useful for pragmatic purposes, but support for these uses will need to come from evidence not currently provided in the WIAT-4 technical manual.","output":"Evaluation of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Fourth Edition as a Measurement Instrument"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Registered professional and advanced practice nurses in the school setting, as a specialized practice entity, are leaders in implementation of evidence-based practice, skilled coordinators of care, advocates for students, and experts in designing systems assisting individuals and communities to reach full potential.

Even with the unprecedented speed at which vaccines were developed and introduced into society, identifying therapeutic interventions and drug targets for patients infected with the virus remains important as new strains of the virus evolve, or future coronaviruses may emerge that are resistant to current vaccines. The application of transcriptomic RNA sequencing of infected samples may shed new light on the pathways involved in viral mechanisms and host responses. We describe the application of the previously developed dual RNA-seq approach to investigate, for the first time, the co-regulation between the human and SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes. Together with differential expression analysis, we describe the tissue specificity of SARS-CoV-2 expression, an inferred lipopolysaccharide response, and co-regulation of CXCLs, SPRRs, S100s with SARS-CoV-2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide response pathways in particular offer promise for future therapeutic research and the prospect of subgrouping patients based on chemokine expression that may help explain the vastly different reactions patients have to infection. Taken together these findings highlight unappreciated SARS-CoV-2 expression signatures and emphasize new considerations and mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic intervention.","output":"Dual RNA-Seq analysis of SARS-CoV-2 correlates specific human transcriptional response pathways directly to viral expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Early postoperative recovery after surgery is a key point for patients safety and comfort. Moreover, operating room turnover depends on recovery time. Our aim was to assess which method of remifentanil administration, manual (MI) or target-controlled infusion (TCI), could reduce patient time in recovery room. In this study, patients recovery times were registered and compared among the groups. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 31 morbidly obese patients in this prospective study. All of them had undergone bariatric surgery at the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno Klinikos in 2020. Sevoflurane/remifentanil anaesthesia was performed for all patients. The patients were randomly assigned to the manual infusion (MI) (control group) or target-controlled infusion (TCI) group for the method of the administration of remifentanil. While the patients were waking up after the surgery, we recorded spontaneous breathing and airway reflexes recovery time, time of extubation, eye opening, recovery of orientation and beginning of the following oral command. For the TCI group, we also documented remifentanil concentrations in the blood (automatic infusion pump). Results: Patients did not differ in demographic values and duration of remifentanil infusion. We found that remifentanil consumption in the TCI group was lower, p = 0.02. Despite lower remifentanil consumption in the TCI group patients, they demonstrated longer total recovery time than the control group patiens: 14 (12C20) vs. 10 (6C16), p = 0.001. Conclusions: The study showed that, upon comparing the TCI method with MI, manual infusion produced better results in postoperative patient recovery. Additionally, higher doses of remifentanil were consumed using MI. In conclusion, the dosage recommended by highly qualified anaesthesiologists is favourable for morbidly obesity patients when compared to the TCI method.","output":"Comparison of Postoperative Recovery after Manual and Target-Controlled Infusion of Remifentanil in Bariatric Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is the disruption of in-person clinical experiences within geriatric psychiatry residency education.

Herein, we describe three patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the ICU and developed subcutaneous emphysema and one with a concomitant pneumothorax. Three patients with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the ICU developed subcutaneous emphysema during the hospital admission. One of them who had concomitant pneumothorax required thoracostomy tube for treatment and the other two were monitored clinically without additional interventions. Two patients died during the first two to three weeks of their hospital course. One patient survived and was discharged after 63 days in the hospital. Subcutaneous emphysema is considered a non-life-threatening condition and is usually self-limited requiring supportive treatment in mild cases. For such cases, observation is appropriate. Patients with newly discovered SE life-threatening pathology, such as pneumothorax, esophageal rupture, and necrotizing infections, should be investigated depending on the clinical setting. This is one of the first paper that shows the development of subcutaneous emphysema in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Data were collected from June 25, 2020, to May 15, 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of cardiac involvement based on a comparison of pre- and post-infection electrocardiogram (ECGs). The secondary outcome was to evaluate for any association between ethnicity and the presence or absence of symptoms. RESULTS: Among 99 athletes who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (mean age 19.9 years [standard deviation 1.7 years]; 31% female), baseline ECG changes suggestive of cardiovascular involvement post-infection were detected in two athletes (2/99; 2%).

We evaluated all patients over the age of 18 diagnosed with COVID-19 for a total of 6,195 consecutive patients.Objectives: We investigated the relationship between 90-day anticoagulation therapy among outpatients prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (OPAC) therapy and the risk for 45 days hospitalization, and mortality as well as the relationship between inpatient prophylactic, escalated prophylactic, or therapeutic anticoagulation (IPAC) therapy and 45 days mortality risk.Results: 598 were immediately hospitalized, and 5,597 were initially treated as outpatients. The case fatality rate was 2.8% (n=175 deaths) and 13% for the overall 45 days mortality and inpatient mortality respectively. Among 5,597 COVID-19 patients initially treated as outpatients, 160 (2.9%) were on anticoagulation, and 331 were hospitalized (5.9%). In a multivariable analysis, OPAC use was associated with a 43% reduction in risk for hospital admission, HR (95%CI)=0.57 (0.38, 0.86), p=0.007, but was not associated with mortality, HR (95%CI)=0.88 (0.50, 1.52), p=0.64. In comparison to inpatients who continued anticoagulation therapy upon admission, inpatients who never initiated anticoagulation (before or after hospitalization) realized increased mortality risk, HR (95%CI)=2.26 (1.17, 4.37), p=0.015, while inpatients who initiated anticoagulation upon admission realized no increased risk for mortality HR(95%CI)=1.27(0.75,2.14), p=0.38.Conclusion: Outpatients with COVID-19 using anticoagulation experienced a 43% reduced risk of hospitalization, and initiation of anticoagulation among inpatients was not associated with increased mortality risk.Funding Statement: No specific grant funding was obtained for this study.Declaration of Interests: Dr. Tignanelli is a principal investigator on randomized trials for Covid-19, but not related to anticoagulation.

This capacity can contribute to improvements in health, social welfare and poverty reduction through domestic application of research findings; it is increasingly seen as critical to pandemic preparedness and response. Developing research infrastructure and performance may reduce national economies reliance on primary commodity and agricultural production, as countries strive to develop knowledge-based economies to help drive macroeconomic growth. Yet efforts to date to understand health sciences research capacity are limited to output metrics of journal citations and publications, failing to reflect the complexity of the health sciences research landscape in many settings. METHODS: We map and assess current capacity for health sciences research across all 54 countries of Africa by collecting a range of available data. This included structural indicators (research institutions and research funding), process indicators (clinical trial infrastructures, intellectual property rights and regulatory capacities) and output indicators (publications and citations). RESULTS: While there are some countries which perform well across the range of indicators used, for most countries the results are variedsuggesting high relative performance in some indicators, but lower in others. Missing data for key measures of capacity or performance is also a key concern. Taken as a whole, existing data suggest a nuanced view of the current health sciences research landscape on the African continent. CONCLUSION: Mapping existing data may enable governments and international organizations to identify where gaps in health sciences research capacity lie, particularly in comparison to other countries in the region. It also highlights gaps where more data are needed. These data can help to inform investment priorities and future system needs.

Clinical manifestations of Corona-virus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death2, yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown. Also, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogenesis remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002/03), however, CD4+ T cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes3,4, while cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been investigated. Here we describe an assay that allows direct detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. We demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy donors, albeit at lower frequencies. Strikingly, in COVID-19 patients S-reactive CD4+ T cells equally targeted both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of S whereas in healthy donors S-reactive CD4+ T cells reacted almost exclusively to the Cterminal part that is a) characterized by higher homology to spike glycoprotein of human endemic \\"common cold\\" coronaviruses, and b) contains the S2 subunit of S with the cytoplasmic peptide (CP), the fusion peptide (FP), and the transmembrane domain (TM) but not the receptor-binding domain (RBD). S-reactive CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co-expressed higher levels of CD38 and HLA-DR, indicating their recent in vivo activation. Our study is the first to directly measure SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing, in depth epitope mapping and characterization of potential cross-reactive cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective cohort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a correlate of protection or pathology. Results of such studies will be key for a mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adaptation of containment methods and to support vaccine development.","output":"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of disease arising from food-borne pathogens is increasing continuously and has become a global public health problem.

This study aimed to investigate donors' awareness, attitudes and compliance with the two-phased policy implementation of time-limited deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Hong Kong. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three rounds of questionnaire survey were conducted between July 2017 and June 2019 covering the periods of pre-implementation (Round A), post-implementation without and with pre-donation questionnaire revision (Round B and C). Chi-square test and multivariable regression analysis were performed. RESULTS Of 3085 donors recruited, 968, 1036 and 1081 completed the surveys in Round A, B and C, respectively. The non-compliance rate of MSM remained stable at 06% (3/497), 04% (2/551) and 05% (3/587) among male donors in Round A, B and C, respectively. Two MSM donors from Round C complying with the prevailing policy were identified. About two-thirds (607%) of respondents from Round B and C were unaware of the policy change. Overall, over 80% were either neutral or positive about the change. CONCLUSION Our study showed a consistently low non-compliance rate of MSM over the three periods. The generally high level of acceptance of time-limited deferral among donors lends support to science-based policy development to protect blood safety. The identification of compliant MSM donors suggests that the 12-month deferral is effective and acceptable to MSM.

We aimed to understand determinants of non-medical COVID-19 impact and to account for its multileveled, intersectional nature of associations. Methods: This cross-sectional, multi-level, convergent mixed-methods study assessed a range of beliefs, practices, and experiences relating to COVID-19. We recruited a global sample (n=7,411) using both Facebook and Amazon mTURK platforms. We constructed a novel data-driven non-medical COVID-19 Impact Score and four subcomponents (Personal Action, Supply-related, Cancellations, and Livelihood impacts). We used generalized estimating equation models with identity link functions to determine concomitant association of individual, household, and country-level variables on the impact scores. We also classified 20,015 qualitative excerpts from 6859 respondents using an 80-code codebook. Results: Total and component impact scores varied significantly by region with Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean observing the highest impact scores. Multilevel modeling indicated that individual-level sociocultural variables accounted for much of this variation with COVID-related worry, knowledge, struggles in accessing food and supplies, and worsening mental health most strongly associated with non-medical impact. Family responsibilities, personal COVID medical experience, and health locus of control, in addition to country-level variables reflecting social and health challenge, were also significantly and independently associated with non-medical impact. Discussion: Non-medical personal impact of COVID-19 affects most people internationally, largely in response to shutdowns, implementing prevention requirements, and through economic consequences.

We assessed the PKTP buffer performance in comparison to the RNA-extraction-based protocol of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in saliva samples from 70 COVID-19 patients finding a good sensitivity (82.2% for the N1 and 84.4% for the N2 target, respectively) and correlations (R=0.77, p<0.001 for N1, and R=0.78, p<0.001 for N2). We also propose an auto-collection protocol for saliva samples and a multiplex reaction to reduce the number of PCR reactions per patient and further reduce overall costs while maintaining diagnostic standards in favor of massive testing.","output":"DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A LOW-COST INACTIVATION BUFFER THAT ALLOWS DIRECT SARS-COV-2 DETECTION IN SALIVA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Kickboxing is a combat sport where athletes require constant supervision of a coach. The outbreak of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a crisis in many sectors, including sport. Global efforts to limit the spread of the pathogen resulted in temporary lockdowns that limited sporting activity, thus deteriorating athletes' physical fitness. Methods: The participants included 20 kickboxers competing at the international level. Their physical fitness was evaluated based on the test developed by the International Committee on the Standardization of Physical Fitness Test (ICSPFT) and their body build was assessed using Tanita BC601 body composition monitor and a body height meter. Differences between physical fitness before the COVID-19 outbreak and during the pandemic after re-opening sports facilities were evaluated. Results: Temporary closing of sports clubs has led to the increase in body mass of the participants by 2.65 kg on average and significantly deteriorated physical fitness. Conclusions: Temporary closing of sports clubs and restrictions on physical activity aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 caused a significant reduction in physical fitness and increased body mass of the participants. This is likely to cause worse performance in the nearest competitions and have a negative impact on the athletes' health status and immunity to diseases.","output":"The Impact of Reduced Training Activity of Elite Kickboxers on Physical Fitness, Body Build, and Performance during Competitions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In September 2020, Irish schools reopened following their emergency closure due to the COVID-19 crisis Measures were put in place to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus within schools and communities However, these measures were likely to impact on teachers capacity to facilitate learning in science, particularly the practical and investigative aspects of the Irish curriculum This research explores the impact of the measures in place to limit virus transmission on teaching and learning in science, particularly on practical activities The period of focus is the three months (September to November 2020) following the school closures The research aims to highlight the implications of the COVID-19 crisis on science teaching and learning in Irish schools The research will also provide recommendations to lessen the impact on primary and second-level science education to improve student learning and engagement in science [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Irish Educational Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 crisis on learning, teaching and facilitation of practical activities in science upon reopening of Irish schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both antiviral treatment with remdesivir and hemoadsorption using a CytoSorb? adsorption device are applied in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

In this study, we evaluated whether remdesivir and its main active metabolite GS-441524 would be adsorbed by CytoSorb? . Serum containing remdesivir or GS-441524 was circulated in a custom-made system containing a CytoSorb? device. Concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 before and after the adsorber were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Measurements of remdesivir in the outgoing tube after the adsorber indicated almost complete removal of remdesivir by the device. In the reservoir, concentration of remdesivir showed an exponential decay and was not longer detectable after 60 mins. GS-441524 showed a similar exponential decay but, unlike remdesivir, it reached an adsorption-desorption equilibrium at ~48 g/L. Remdesivir and its main active metabolite GS-441524 are rapidly eliminated from the perfusate by the CytoSorb? adsorber device in vitro. This should be considered in patients for whom both therapies are indicated, and simultaneous application should be avoided.

Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8), which is released by apoptotic endothelial cells, limits tissue damage and inflammation by promoting anti-inflammatory macrophages. We aimed to study its role in transplant vasculopathy using the murine aortic allotransplantation model. BALB/c mice were transplanted with fully mismatched aortic transplants from MFG-E8 knockout (KO) or wild type (WT) C57BL/6J mice. Thereafter, mice received MFG-E8 (or vehicle) injections for 9 weeks prior to histopathological analysis of allografts for intimal proliferation (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and leukocyte infiltration assessment (immunofluorescence). Phenotypes of blood leukocytes and humoral responses were also evaluated (flow cytometry and ELISA). Mice receiving MFG-E8 KO aortas without MFG-E8 injections had the most severe intimal proliferation (p < 0.001). Administration of MFG-E8 decreased intimal proliferation, especially in mice receiving MFG-E8 KO aortas. Administration of MFG-E8 also increased the proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages among graft-infiltrating macrophages (p = 0.003) and decreased systemic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation (p < 0.001). An increase in regulatory T cells occurred in both groups of mice receiving WT aortas (p < 0.01). Thus, the analarmin MFG-E8 appears to be an important protein for reducing intimal proliferation in this murine model of transplant vasculopathy.

In respiratory viruses they inhibit the replication of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level. Nitazoxanide 1a, the prototype thiazolide, was originally developed as an antiparasitic agent and later repurposed for the treatment of viral respiratory infections. The second generation thiazolides following nitazoxanide, such as the 5-chloro analogue RM-5038 2a, are also broad-spectrum antiviral agents as we have reported. Both 1a and its effective circulating metabolite, tizoxanide 1b, are 5-nitrothiazole derivatives, while RM-5038 2a and its de-acetyl derivative RM-4848 2b are the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives. Recently 1a has completed phase II-III clinical trials in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a total of 2865 adults and adolescents of at least 12 months of age with viral acute respiratory illness. Since its biodisposition is primarily seen in the gastro-intestinal tract, its efficacy in systemic viral diseases requires relatively high oral doses. The chemical synthesis of new derivatives with a better systemic absorption was therefore urgently needed. In order to improve their systemic absorption, new amino-ester prodrug derivatives of 1b and RM4848 2b were prepared and tested for their animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology.

By developing highly sensitive and specific trimeric spike (S)-based antibody tests, we report IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity. All patients surveyed were IgG positive against S. Elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women sampled during the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25), displayed on average lower titers and weaker neutralizing responses compared to patients; however, inter-individual anti-viral IgG titers differed up to 1,000-fold. To provide more accurate estimates of seroprevalence, given the frequency of weak responders and the limitations associated with the dichotomization of a continuous variable (3,4), we used a Bayesian approach to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off. Analysis of blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900) sampled weekly demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in 7.2% (95% Bayesian CI [5.1-9.5]) of individuals two months after the peak of spring 2020 COVID-19 deaths.

Design: Cross-sectional study based on registry data from Brazil's influenza surveillance system. Setting: Public and private hospitals across Brazil. Participants: Eligible population included 21,942 inpatients aged 20 years or older with positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 until Jun 9th, 2020. Main outcome measures: Severe COVID-19 outcomes were non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation use, ICU admission, and death. Multivariate analyses were conducted separately for adults (20-59 years) and elders (>=60 years) to test the combined association of obesity (without and with DM and/or CVD) and degrees of obesity with each outcome. Results: A sample of 8,848 adults and 12,925 elders were included. Among adults, obesity with DM and/or CVD showed higher prevalence of invasive (PR 3.76, 95%CI 2.82-5.01) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation use (2.06, 1.58-2.69), ICU admission (1.60, 1.40-1.83), and death (1.79, 1.45-2.21) compared with the group without obesity, DM, and CVD. In elders, obesity alone (without DM and CVD) had the highest prevalence of ICU admission (1.40, 1.07-1.82) and death (1.67, 1.00-2.80). In both age groups, obesity alone and combined with DM and/or CVD showed higher prevalence in all outcomes than DM and/or CVD. A dose-response association was observed between obesity and death in adults: class I 1.32 (1.05-1.66), class II 1.41 (1.06-1.87), and class III 1.77 (1.35-2.33). Conclusions: The combined association of obesity, diabetes, and/or CVD with severe COVID-19 outcomes may be stronger in adults than in elders. Obesity alone and combined with DM and/or CVD had more impact on the risk of COVID-19 severity than DM and/or CVD in both age groups. The study also supports an independent relationship of obesity with severe outcomes, including a dose-response association between degrees of obesity and death in adults. These findings suggest important implications for the clinical care of patients with obesity and severe COVID-19 and support the inclusion of people with obesity in the high-risk and vaccine priority groups for protection from SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Combined association of obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases with severe COVID-19 outcomes: a nationwide cross-sectional study of 21,773 Brazilian adult and elderly inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we describe the isolation of 18 unique anti SARS-CoV-2 human single-chain antibodies from an antibody library derived from healthy donors. The selection used a combination of phage and yeast display technologies and included counter-selection strategies meant to direct the selection of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD2). Selected antibodies were characterized in various formats including IgG, using flow cytometry, ELISA, high throughput SPR, and fluorescence microscopy. We report antibodies' RBD2 recognition specificity, binding affinity, and epitope diversity, as well as ability to block RBD2 binding to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in vitro. We present evidence supporting that: 1) most of our antibodies (16 out of 18) selectively recognize RBD2; 2) the best performing 8 antibodies target eight different epitopes of RBD2; 3) one of the pairs tested in sandwich assays detects RBD2 with sub-picomolar sensitivity; and 4) two antibody pairs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection at low nanomolar half neutralization titers. Based on these results, we conclude that our antibodies have high potential for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Importantly, our results indicate that readily available non immune (na?ve) antibody libraries obtained from healthy donors can be used to select high-quality monoclonal antibodies, bypassing the need for blood of infected patients, and offering a widely accessible and low-cost alternative to more sophisticated and expensive antibody selection approaches (e.g. single B cell analysis and natural evolution in humanized mice).","output":"Healthy humans can be a source of antibodies countering COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year survival rate of <8%.

She was admitted for monitoring of rash, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. Her methimazole dose was increased as tolerated and then titrated as an outpatient. Results A 4-year-old girl presented with a heart rate of 195 beats/minute, blood pressure of 145/108, and subsequent labs of undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4 5.8 ng/dL, thyroid peroxidase antibody 11.5 IU/ml, and TSH receptor antibody 39.03 IU/L, consistent with Graves disease. She developed urticaria and arthralgias after 2.5 weeks on methimazole, which resolved with drug cessation. Because of her age, the risks of radioactive iodine ablation and surgery were concerning; therefore, methimazole desensitization was attempted.

The Covid-19 health emergency has seen healthcare workers in the front line facing all the difficulties related to the care burden. One of the most significant and probably underinvestigated aspects is the psychological stress of the healthcare staff managing the emergency. The aim of the paper is to analyze the literature on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the psychological well-being of health professionals. Methodology: We conducted a systematic review of articles published on this topic during the months from January 2020 to December 2020, searching on Pub Med, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results: Most of the issues can be summarized into five conceptual categories: Stress, Depression and Infection Anxiety, Anguish, Insomnia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Suicide. The literature identifies many factors contributing to the onset of anxiety, depression, and stress, like the fear of contracting the disease and transmitting it to family members and friends, stressful shifts, and little rest among several others. The literature highlights the needs for adequate measures, including proper psychological support. Conclusion: The conducted review suggests that the behaviours of healthcare professionals during the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic show psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, there is a call for those in chief like hospital managers and policymakers to take action, promoting measures like surveillance, monitoring, and psychological support among others, to increase the resilience of healthcare workers, limiting stress and anxiety and allowing them to keep their performance at work.","output":"The impact of Covid-19 healthcare emergency on the psychological well-being of health professionals: a review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had significant negative consequences for well-being.

We believe our model can serve as a platform for discussing solutions to the above-mentioned dilemma.","output":"An agent-based model of the interrelation between the COVID-19 outbreak and economic activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions around the world. In pregnancy the dangers to the mother and fetus are still being explored. SARS-CoV2 can potentially compromise maternal and neonatal outcomes and this may be dependent on the pregnancy stage during which the infection occurs. OBJECTIVE: The present study was done to find the histopathological alterations in the placenta of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies with either no symptoms or mild coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 related symptoms and its association with neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective analytical study. Twenty seven asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy delivered between 1(st) July 2020 and 15(th) September 2020, were included as cases. An equal number of SARS-CoV-2 negative singleton pregnancies matched for maternal and gestational age during the same period were included as controls. After delivery the histopathological examination of the placenta of these women was done and the findings recorded on a predesigned proforma based on the Amsterdam consensus criteria for evidence of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion changes. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the cases and controls. The following features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) were significantly higher in the placentae of COVID-19 positive pregnancies: retroplacental hematomas (RPH), accelerated villous maturation (AVM), distal villous hyperplasia (DVH), atherosis, fibrinoid necrosis, mural hypertrophy of membrane arterioles (MHMA), vessel ectasia and persistence of intramural endovascular trophoblast (PIEVT). Fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) significantly associated with the positive pregnancies were chorioangiosis, thrombosis of the fetal chorionic plate (TFCP), intramural fibrin deposition (IMFD) and vascular ectasia. Additionally, perivillous fibrin deposition was also significantly higher in the placentae of cases. The percentage of spontaneously delivered women was comparable in the two groups. The sex and weight of the newborn and the number of live births were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women, with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, show evidence of placental injury at a microscopic level. Similar findings have been demonstrated in other studies too. This placental injury apparently does not lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. The extent of this injury in symptomatic cases of COVID-19 pregnancies and its consequences on the outcomes need to be analysed.","output":"COVID-19 as an independent risk factor for subclinical placental dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The underlying cell types mediating predisposition to obesity remain largely obscure.

The aim of this article is to describe the process of transforming the Vall dHebron University Hospital, the second largest hospital in Spain, into a COVID-19 centre coordinating response to the pandemic in its reference area. Materials and methods: The study draws on the experience of the authors in transforming the hospital into a comprehensive resource in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategy is based on four central strategies: early planning, coordination of all healthcare agents in its reference area, definition of clear leadership roles, and the organisation of care based on multidisciplinary teams with minimal recruitment of new staff. Results: The transformation strategy enabled the hospital to cope with the surge in patients without exceeding its capacity. During the response phases, which amounted to a period of 57 days, 3,106 patients consulted the ER and 2,054 were admitted, 346 of whom were treated at the ICU. To accommodate the number of adult COVID-19 patients, adult ICU availability was progressive increased by 371%, and ordinary beds increased by 240. A total of 671 staff members went on sick leave after testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: The transformation experience of the hospital provides insight into how effectively adapt the structures and functioning of large hospitals.

Here, we examined changes in pulmonary ACE2 expression in two mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) models: adenine-induced (adenine mice) and aristolochic acid-induced (AA mice). We also investigated changes in pulmonary ACE2 expression due to reninCangiotensin system (RAS) blocker (olmesartan) treatment in these mice. Adenine mice showed significant renal functional decline and elevated blood pressure, compared with controls. AA mice also showed significant renal functional decline, compared with vehicles; blood pressure did not differ between groups. Renal ACE2 expression was significantly reduced in adenine mice and AA mice; pulmonary expression was unaffected. Olmesartan attenuated urinary albumin excretion in adenine mice, but did not affect renal or pulmonary ACE2 expression levels. The results suggest that the risk of COVID-19 infection may not be elevated in patients with CKD because of their stable pulmonary ACE2 expression.

Therefore, it is uncertain whether obesity is in fact associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-obese individuals. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed (including MEDLINE) and Google Scholar on May 18, 2020 to identify published studies on COVID-19 outcomes in non-obese and obese patients, covering studies published during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Meta-analyses with random effects modeling was used to determine unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for various COVID-19 outcomes in obese versus non-obese patients. By quantitative analyses of 22 studies from 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, we found that obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of presenting with more severe COVID-19 symptoms (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.45C6.28, P = 0.003; 4 studies, n = 974), developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.14C7.34, P = 0.025; 2 studies, n = 96), requiring hospitalization (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14C1.59, P < 0.001; 4 studies, n = 6611), being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15C1.65, P = 0.001; 9 studies, n = 5298), and undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV; OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.29C2.40, P < 0.001; 7 studies, n = 1558) compared to non-obese patients.

METHODS An online survey was conceived and circulated to members of the Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons. The survey was conducted in two phases, in April 2020 and July 2020, to evaluate changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Early in the pandemic (April 2020), the median number of major digestive surgeries performed monthly declined from 20 cases (range. 3-100 cases) to 1 case (range. 0-10 cases) (P < .001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Most of the cases in April 2020 addressed emergency problems, but more definitive surgeries were performed during the later period of the survey. The importance of screening for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction has increased over time, and a more comprehensive screening methodology incorporating real-time polymerase chain reaction, chest CT, and rapid antibody test were evident in 31.37% of July 2020 responses.

This study utilized the OSCE (objective-structured clinical examination) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the learning outcome of medical students from the regular group (class of 2020) and pandemic-impacted group (class of 2021). Methods: All medical students serially took, firstly, the mock-OSCE, secondly, the mock-OSCE, and the national OSCE. Then, the serial OSCE scores were compared between groups. Results: Although with similar scores in the first mock OSCE, the regular group (n = 78) had a higher average score in the national OSCE than the pandemic-impacted group (n = 80) (872.18 vs. 834.96, p = 0.003).

These questions are important in determining suitability for clinical deployment. PURPOSE To compare the IOP results of the water drinking test (WDT) and iCare HOME phasing in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed glaucoma. METHODS Ninety-eight consecutive patients attending a glaucoma clinic underwent IOP profiling using both techniques. For the WDT, patients ingested 10 mL/kg body weight of water following a baseline applanation IOP measurement, then underwent serial IOP measurements approximately every 15 minutes, ceasing after 30 minutes of consecutive measurements within 3 mmHg of baseline. Patients successfully certified for self-administration of the iCare HOME were loaned the instrument for one week and instructed to take four measurements per day. RESULTS Twenty-seven (28%) patients successfully obtained 4 measurements per day using iCare HOME, and 96 (98%) patients were able to complete the water drinking test. IOP profiles showed no difference between the time for peak IOP and across nearly all IOP parameters obtained from profiling except for the standard deviation of IOP measurements obtained using the iCare HOME (P = .005). There were moderate correlations between peak IOPs obtained using each technique (r = 0.67, P = .001, right eye; r = 0.66, P = .002 left eye), but no correlation between the daily range (iCare HOME) or peak-trough difference (WDT) (r = 0.21, P = .28, right eye; r = 0.27, P = .02, left eye). Bland-Altman analysis returned similar results for peak and range. CONCLUSIONS IOP profiling using both techniques can reveal the peak IOP, and these measurements are strongly correlated.

Cleaning and disinfecting is one of the infection prevention and control measures that can be taken at the individual and home level to break the chain of spread of the Coronavirus. Viruses can be detected in door handles light switches windows cupboards toilet seats remotes and ventilation fans. Therefore cleaning and disinfecting becomes an important thing to do regularly on objects that are often touched and on surfaces. Disinfection activities in the environment have actually been carried out by the Kemuning Lor Village Youth Organization as a form of tackling COVID-19. However it has not reached all residents houses. Disinfection is only carried out in public place such as school village halls and mosques. The problems faced by partners of this program are lack of knowledge about disinfection at home as an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 early and do not know how to carry out disinfection according to standard operating procedures. This community service activity aimed to socialized the importance of disinfection at home and provided training on standard procedures for disinfection. The method of implementation is by means of counselling demonstration practice and mentoring. The target of this activity is Youth Organization in Kemuning Lor village. The results were an increase in partners knowledge about the importance of disinfection at home by 867% and an increase in partners ability to disinfect using personal protective equipment. The output that given to partners was the Cleaning and Disinfecting Booklets and videos on how to properly disinfect.Keywords COVID-19 Disinfection Kemuning Lor Jember","output":"Upaya memutus penyebaran COVID-19 di desa Kemuning Lor Jember dengan sosialisasi dan pelatihan disinfeksi di rumah"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are at high risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection. Researchers exploring ALS and Covid-19 have focused primarily on system response and adaptation. Using Protection Motivation Theory, we investigated how people with ALS and family caregivers appraised and responded to Covid-19 threat, the costs associated with pandemic response, and how health professionals and systems can better support people affected by ALS who are facing public health emergencies. METHODS: Data were drawn from the ALS Talk Project, an asynchronous, moderated focus group study. Participants were recruited from regions across Canada. Seven groups met online over 14 weeks between January and July 2020. Fifty-three participants contributed to Covid-19 discussions. Data were qualitatively analyzed using directed content analysis and the constant-comparative approach. RESULTS: Participants learned about the Covid-19 pandemic from the media. They rapidly assessed their vulnerability and responded to Covid-19 threat by following recommendations from health authorities, information monitoring, and preparing for worst-case scenarios. Adopting protective behaviors had substantial response costs, including adaptations for medical care and home support workers, threatened access to advance care, and increased caregiver burden. Participants expressed need for ALS-specific, pandemic information from trusted health professionals and/or ALS health charities. Telemedicine introduced both conveniences and costs. Prior experience with ALS provided tools for coping with Covid-19. Threat and coping appraisal was a dynamic process involving ongoing vigilance and adaptation. Findings draw attention to the lack of emergency preparedness among participants and within health systems. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should engage ALS patients and families in ongoing discussions about pandemic coping, strategies to mitigate response costs, care pathways in the event of Covid-19 infection, and changing information about Covid-19 variants and vaccines. Healthcare systems should incorporate flexible approaches for medical care, leveraging the benefits of telemedicine and facilitating in-person interaction as needed and where possible. Research is needed to identify strategies to mitigate response costs and to further explore the interaction between prior experience and coping. Further study is also needed to determine how communication about emergency preparedness might be effectively incorporated into clinical care for those with ALS and other medically vulnerable populations.","output":"Covid-19 threat and coping: application of protection motivation theory to the pandemic experiences of people affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current understanding of ambient temperature and its link to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the environmental and climatic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2. For this study, we analyzed the data at the beginning of the outbreak (from 20 January to 31 March 2020) to avoid the influence of preventive or control measures. We obtained the number of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2, international tourism, population age, universal health coverage, regional factors, the SARS-CoV-2 testing rate, and population density of a country. A total of 154 countries were included in this study. There were high incidence rates and mortality risks in the countries that had an average ambient temperature between 0 and 10 C. The adjusted incidence rate for temperatures between 0 and 10 C was 2.91 (95% CI 2.87C2.95). We randomly divided the data into a training set (80% of data) for model derivation and a test set (20% of data) for validation. Using a random forest statistical model, the model had high accuracy for predicting the high epidemic status of a country (ROC = 95.5%, 95% CI 87.9C100.0%) in the test set. Population age, temperature, and international tourism were the most important factors affecting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in a country.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","output":"Clinical Consensus Recommendations Regarding Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in the Adult Patient with Acute Respiratory Failure Secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is a popular method for detecting RNA viruses in plants. RT-PCR is usually performed in a classical two-step procedure: in the first step, cDNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase (RT), followed by PCR amplification by a thermostable polymerase in a separate tube in the second step. However, one-step kits containing multiple enzymes optimized for RT and PCR amplification in a single tube can also be used. Here, we describe an RT-PCR single-enzyme assay based on an RTX DNA polymerase that has both RT and polymerase activities. The expression plasmid pET_RTX_(exo-) was transferred to various E. coli genotypes that either compensated for codon bias (Rosetta-gami 2) or contained additional chaperones to promote solubility (BL21 (DE3) with plasmids pKJE8 or pTf2). The RTX enzyme was then purified and used for the RT-PCR assay. Several purified plant viruses (TMV, PVX, and PVY) were used to determine the efficiency of the assay compared to a commercial one-step RT-PCR kit. The RT-PCR assay with the RTX enzyme was validated for the detection of viruses from different genera using both total RNA and crude sap from infected plants. The detection endpoint of RTX-PCR for purified TMV was estimated to be approximately 0.01 pg of the whole virus per 25 L reaction, corresponding to 6 virus particles/L. Interestingly, the endpoint for detection of TMV from crude sap was also 0.01 pg per reaction in simulated crude plant extracts. The longest RNA fragment that could be amplified in a one-tube arrangement was 2379 bp long. The longest DNA fragment that could be amplified during a 10s extension was 6899 bp long. In total, we were able to detect 13 viruses from 11 genera using RTX-PCR. For each virus, two to three specific fragments were amplified. The RT-PCR assay using the RTX enzyme described here is a very robust, inexpensive, rapid, easy to perform, and sensitive single-enzyme assay for the detection of plant viruses.","output":"One-Enzyme RTX-PCR for the Detection of RNA Viruses from Multiple Virus Genera and Crop Plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the correlations among perceived health status, stress, daily life changes, physical distancing, depression, and to determine associated fctors of depression fo older adults in COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of hMPV infection in children hospitalized with RTD and to analyze the virologic and clinical features of hMPV infection. STUDY DESIGN All children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized for RTD were included in this 1-year prospective study. hMPV was detected in nasopharyngeal secretions by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The hMPV F gene amplification products were sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Samples were also tested for other respiratory viruses by both direct immunofluorescence assay and virus culture. RESULTS hMPV, detected in 50 of 589 (8.5%) children, represented the second leading cause of RTD after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Infections with hMPV occurred mainly between December and April. hMPV isolates clustered into the 4 subgroups (A1, A2, B1 and B2) currently recognized; the majority (72%) of hMPV isolates belonged to subgroup A1. Among the 35 children infected with hMPV alone, 23 (65.7%) had bronchiolitis, 5 (14.3%) had pneumonia, 2 (5.7%) had asthma exacerbation and 5 (14.3%) had a limited upper RTD. Fifteen (30%) of the hMPV-infected children were coinfected with RSV. As compared with children infected with hMPV or RSV alone, duration of hospitalization and requirement for supplemental oxygen were increased in the hMPV/RSV-coinfected children.

Despite current multidisciplinary treatments, there has not been a drastic change in overall prognosis within the last two decades. With current treatments, 60-70 % of patients with localized disease survive. Given a propensity of Wnt signaling to control multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and differentiation, it is a critical pathway in OS disease progression. At the same time, this pathway is extremely complex with vast arrays of cross-talk. Even though decades of research have linked the role of Wnt to tumorigenesis, there are still outstanding areas that remain poorly understood and even controversial. The canonical Wnt pathway functions to regulate the levels of the transcriptional co-activator -catenin, which ultimately controls key developmental gene expressions. Given the central role of this mediator, inhibition of Wnt/-catenin signaling has been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer control. In OS, several secreted protein families modulate the Wnt/-catenin signaling, including secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF), Dickkopf proteins (DKK-1,2,3), sclerostin, and small molecules. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of Wnt/-catenin signaling in OS, based on recent in vitro and in vivo data.

The student-led Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society devised a low-cost wilderness medicine teaching weekend that can be replicated at other institutions. METHODS The weekend course consisted of small-group lessons introducing the roles of the expedition doctor and expedition leader and the assessment and management of acute conditions in remote environments. This was followed by a 3-station circuit to teach the principles of casualty triage, splinting, and construction of rope stretchers. These skills were then practiced in simulations in which participants rotated roles as care providers and patients. Participant confidence was compared before the course and immediately on course completion using the related-samples Wilcoxon signed-ranks test with significance accepted at P<0.05. Usefulness of course content and perceptions of learning were also assessed. RESULTS Sixty-one medical students attended the wilderness teaching weekend and completed the structured feedback questionnaires.

The statistical power of the scenarios was determined.ResultsTruncating both symptomatic and disease modification trials, led to underpowered trials.By contrast, adapting the trials byextending the treatment period, temporarily stopping treatment, delaying outcomes assessments, and performing remote assessment allowed for increased statistical power nearly to the level originally planned.DiscussionThese analyses support the idea that disrupted trials under common scenarios are better continued and extended even in the face of dropouts, treatment disruptions, missing outcomes, and other exigencies, and that adaptations can be made that maintain the trials validity. We suggest some adaptive methods to do this noting that some changes become under-powered to detect theoriginal effect sizes and expected outcomes.

For community palliative care (CPC) services, this has meant a sudden change from a predominantly face-to-face model of care to one that incorporates telehealth. Understanding patient and HCP experiences with telehealth and how telehealth compares to 'usual' care will be crucial in planning future CPC services. METHODOLOGY All patients of the Barwon Health CPC service between 1 April and 31 May 2020 were invited to complete a questionnaire evaluating their interactions with the palliative care service and specifically their involvement with telehealth consultations. Palliative care HCP who provided clinical services during the same time period were also surveyed. RESULTS/CONCLUSION Seventy-four patients (response rate 36%) and 22 HCP returned surveys. Both groups felt comfortable using telehealth, however, also encountered a range of issues when undertaking telehealth consultations. Despite reporting issues, the preference of both groups was for a CPC service model, which combined face-to-face and telehealth consultations.

To elucidate (1) which psychiatric disorders were exacerbated during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) the contributing factors, we prospectively assessed psychiatric symptoms of 1592 psychiatric outpatients in a single-center study using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) before the state of emergency was declared in Japan and during two months under the state of emergency (study period: April 8 to June 7, 2020). We conducted a chi-squared test for the relationship between psychiatric diagnostic category (ICD-10) and exacerbation. To control for confounders, we conducted a logistic regression analysis using sex, age, diagnostic category, and pre-pandemic GAF score as independent variables. Exacerbation rates of patients with mood disorders (F3) and neurotic disorders (F4) were 4.32% and 5.37%, respectively, and were significantly higher than those for patients with organic disorders (F0) and schizophrenic disorders (F2) (X(2) (9, N = 1592) = 27.8, p <.01).

A two-compartment PK model was linked to sigmoidal maximum effect (Emax ) models with proportional decrease from baseline characterizing the PD responses across the investigated single and multiple doses, up to 200 mg daily for 14 days (n = 72). Concentrations that maintain 50/60/90% inhibition (IC50/60/90 ) of cytokine secretion (IL-6/IFN-) over 24 hours were estimated and stochastic simulations performed to assess target coverage under different dosing regimens. Simulations suggested investigating 25, 50, and 100 mg enpatoran twice daily (b.i.d.) to explore the anticipated therapeutic dose range for lupus. With 25 mg b.i.d., > 50% of subjects are expected to achieve 60% inhibition of IL-6.

The present study aimed to predict the binding potential of six FDA drugs towards fifteen protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 and propose the structural and molecular basis of the interaction by molecular docking and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey, fifteen potential targets of SARS-CoV-2, and six FDA drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, and Ritonavir) were selected. The binding potential of individual drug towards the selected targets was predicted by molecular docking in comparison with the binding of the same drugs with their usual targets. The stabilities of the best-docked conformations were confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and energy calculations. Among the selected drugs, Ritonavir and Lopinavir showed better binding towards the prioritized targets with minimum binding energy (kcal/mol), cluster-RMS, number of interacting residues, and stabilizing forces when compared with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, later drugs demonstrated better binding when compared to the binding with their usual targets. Remdesvir showed better binding to the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, but showed lesser binding potential when compared to the interaction between Ritonavir and Lopinavir and the prioritized targets.

Over the past decade, the overall incidence of LVFWR has decreased given the advancements in reperfusion therapies. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant delay in hospital presentation of patients suffering myocardial infarctions, leading to a higher incidence of mechanical complications from myocardial infarctions such as LVFWR. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case in which a patient suffered a LVFWR as a mechanical complication from myocardial infarction due to delay in seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from the medical setting. The patient had been having chest pain for a few days but refused to seek medical care due to fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. He eventually suffered a cardiac arrest at home from a massive inferior myocardial infarction and found to be in cardiac tamponade from a left ventricular perforation. He was emergently taken to the operating room to attempt to repair the rupture but he ultimately expired on the operating table. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of LVFWR has been on a more significant rise over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients delay seeking care over fear of contracting COVID-19 from within the medical setting. Clinicians should consider mechanical complications of MI when patients present as an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as delay in seeking care is often the exacerbating factor.

Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing. Exposures: Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death. Results: Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]).

Outreach resulted in 172 completed screens, identifying 110 needs for 63 individuals. Twenty-eight patients completed patient portal enrollment. Outreach calls captured a higher percentage of Black patients (34%) and a higher percentage of 61-80 year olds (69%) compared to portal users. Telephone outreach during the pandemic captured data that otherwise would have been missed in elderly and minority patients without electronic patient portal access.

In recent years, studies have been conducted on Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang, a valuable medicinal herb listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Protopine, one of its components, has also become a research hotspot. To illustrate the identification, metabolism, and broad pharmacological activity of protopine and the botanical preparations containing it for further scientific studies and clinical applications, an in-depth and detailed review of protopine is required. We collected data on the identification and quantification, metabolism and pharmacokinetics, pharmacological activities, and botanical preparations of protopine from 1986 to 2021 from the PubMed database using protopine as a keyword. It has been shown that protopine as an active ingredient of many botanical preparations can be rapidly screened and quantified by a large number of methods (such as the LC-ESI-MS/MS and the TLC/GC-MS), and the possible metabolic pathways of protopine in vivo have been proposed. In addition, protopine possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-cancer, analgesic, vasodilatory, anticholinesterase, anti-addictive, anticonvulsant, antipathogenic, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and cytotoxic and anti-proliferative activities.

This study examined whether emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities during adolescence predicted young adult substance use during COVID-19, and whether using substances to cope with the pandemic's social conditions mediated these associations. Adolescents (N = 2,120) completed baseline surveys assessing transdiagnostic emotional vulnerabilities (anhedonia, distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency) and symptoms (major depression[MD], generalized anxiety[GAD], panic disorder[PD], social phobia[SP], obsessive-compulsive disorder[OCD]) in adolescence (September-December 2016; M[SD] age = 17.45[0.38]). At follow-up (May-August 2020; M[SD] age = 21.16[0.39]), past 30-day substance use and using substances to cope with social isolation during the pandemic were reported. Adjusted models showed that baseline distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency, and MD symptoms each significantly predicted higher number of past-month single-substance using days and number of substances used at follow-up (?s = 0.04-0.06). In each case, associations were mediated by tendency to use substances to cope with the pandemic (?indirect range: 0.028-0.061). To mitigate disproportionate escalation of substance use in young adults with a history of certain types of emotional disturbance, interventions promoting healthy coping strategies to deal with the pandemic's social conditions warrant consideration.","output":"Adolescent emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities as predictors of young adult substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: mediation by substance-related coping behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic certainly amplifies the extent to which curriculum is adaptable, responsive, and proactive.

Institutional Review Board at both institutions exempted this study from informed consent because there were no identifiable patient characteristics, photographs, or imaging studies included. RESULTS: All five patients were managed conservatively; four required packing with Kerlix gauze by an otolaryngologist. Two patients had the additional requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and associated anticoagulation. Three patients improved with oropharyngeal packing; two had persistent bleeding. Three patients expired. Endotracheal tubes were repositioned less frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Intubated patients with COVID-19 may have an increased risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage.

In relation with the COVID-19 new coronavirus infection epidemic that began in Russia in the spring of 2020, a completely new group of patients appeared: patients whose coronavirus infection was combined with the proximal femur fractures. In the course of practical work, hospital doctors had to gain experience in treating these complex patients, solve new organizational and medical tasks. The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of treatment of patients with the proximal femur fractures in combination with coronavirus infection in a \\"covid\\" hospital at the hospital stage, 30-day and 6-month terms. Materials and Methods. The retrospective study is based on the collection and generalization of data from 64 patients with the proximal femur fractures in combination with confirmed coronavirus infection who underwent inpatient treatment from 16.03.2020 to 31.05.2021. 38 (59.4%) patients had a femoral neck fracture, 26 (40.6%) had a fracture of the trochanter region. Forty (62.5%) patients underwent surgical treatment (hip replacement was performed in 23 cases, osteosynthesis was performed in 17 cases), 24 (37.5%) patients did not undergo surgery. Results. With conservative treatment, the hospital mortality rate was 41.6%, the 30-day mortality rate was 72.7%, and the 6 - month mortality rate was 95.5%. During surgical treatment, the hospital mortality rate was 5.0% (2 patients died). Early postoperative complications were detected in 5 (12.5%) patients. Thirty-one (77.5%) patients walked or stood with a walker on their own at the time of discharge;7 (17.5%) patients could not be activated.

Protein acetylation is known to play a crucial role in host response to viral infection. Acetylation of viral proteins encoded by other RNA viruses have been reported to affect viral replication. It is therefore of interest to see whether MERS-CoV proteins are also acetylated. Viral proteins obtained from infected cells were trypsin-digested into peptides. Acetylated peptides were enriched by immunoprecipitation and subject to nano-LC-Orbitrap analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess the conservation level of identified acetylation sites and to predict the upstream regulatory factors. A total of 12 acetylation sites were identified from 7 peptides, which all belong to the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. All identified acetylation sites were found to be highly conserved across MERS-CoV sequences in NCBI database. Upstream factors, including deacetylases of the SIRT1 and HDAC families as well as acetyltransferases of the TIP60 family, were predicted to be responsible for regulating the acetylation events identified. Western blotting confirms that acetylation events indeed occur on pp1ab protein by expressing NSP4 in HEK293 cells. Acetylation events on MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab were identified for the first time, which indicate that MERS-CoV might use the host acetylation machinery to regulate its enzyme activity and to achieve optimal replication.

These dynamics are the result of a combination of factors, including the spatial distribution of the populations social and economic levels and its mobility patterns within a given country. After assessing the risk of infection and associated uncertainty based on infection rates by municipality, one of the most important challenges now facing health authorities concerns the ability to predict second waves and interactions with epidemics of other viruses (e.g. influenza). We propose characterizing the local spatiotemporal behaviour of risk of infection based on existing historical data, and classifying the local spatiotemporal patterns of the time series, thus allowing the management of new waves by region. We combined functional data analysis with geostatistical simulation to model the spatiotemporal evolution of infection risk by COVID-19 in mainland Portugal. The daily number of infection data by municipality reported by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health are used to build time series of infection since the beginning of the outbreak in Portugal. We employ a dimensionality reduction of these curves using functional principal component analysis. The objective of this step is twofold: detect municipalities with a similar temporal evolution, and get a small number of coefficients to describe the temporal pattern of the series. The low-dimension coefficients are then used as experimental data to map the infection time series spatially using geostatistical simulation. With this step, we recover high-resolution maps of COVID-19 infection risk at any time step, allowing the simultaneous modelling of time and space. With the resulting spatiotemporal models, authorities can identify locations where the disease exhibits similar behaviours and, therefore, devise mitigation actions based on previous experience. Also, the models may be used for short-term forecasting as a simple data-driven proxy of full SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) models.","output":"Spatiotemporal Modelling of COVID-19 Infection Risk in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, defined as altered organ function in critically ill patients, is a possible consequence of COVID-19.

Varied concentrations of TCE have yielded different sized AgNPs. The physico-chemical characterization of TCE-AgNPs using UV-Vis, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy have confirmed the formation of nanostructures, their shape and size and plausible role of TCE bio-active compounds, most likely involved in the synthesis as well as stabilization of NPs, respectively. TCE-AgNPs have been tested for antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Candida albicans using various microbiological protocols. TCE-Ag-NPs?3 significantly inhibits biofilm formation of MDR-PA, MRSA, and C. albicans by 73.7, 69.56, and 63.63%, respectively, at a concentration of 7.8 g/mL, as determined by crystal violet microtiter assay. Furthermore, SEM micrograph shows that TCE-AgNPs significantly inhibit the colonization and adherence of biofilm forming cells; individual cells with loss of cell wall and membrane integrity were also observed, suggesting that the biofilm architecture and EPS matrix were severely damaged. Moreover, TEM and SEM images showed that TCE-AgNPs brutally damaged the cell wall and membranes of MDR-PA, MRSA, and C. albicans. Additionally, extreme ultrastructural changes such as deformation, disintegration, and separation of cell wall and membrane from the cells, have also been observed, indicating significant loss of membrane and cell wall integrity, which eventually led to cell death.

After informed consent, we collected urine 36  12 h after hospital admission and measured NGAL and KIM-1 levels using commercially available ELISAs. Levels of NGAL and KIM-1 at 36  12 h were compared between patients assigned to balanced crystalloids versus saline using a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The 131 patients (50.2%) assigned to the balanced crystalloid group and the 130 patients (49.8%) assigned to the saline group were similar at baseline. Urinary NGAL levels were significantly lower in the balanced crystalloid group (median, 39.4 ng/mg [IQR 9.9 to 133.2]) compared with the saline group (median, 64.4 ng/mg [IQR 27.6 to 339.9]) (P < 0.001).

From the 21 POAG eyes, we analyzed the IOP changes caused by physical exercise with two face masks and without wearing any face mask. RESULTS: At rest (baseline and recovery measurements), the use of the different face masks did not affect IOP levels (mean differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mmHg). During physical activity, wearing an FFP2/N95 mask caused a small (mean differences ranging from 1 to 2 mmHg), but statistically significant, IOP rise in comparison to both the surgical mask and control conditions (Cohen's d = 0.63 and 0.83, respectively). CONCLUSION: Face masks must be used to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and POAG patients can safely use FFP2/N95 and surgical masks at rest. However, due to the IOP rise observed while walking with the FFP2/N95 mask, when possible, POAG patients should prioritized the use of surgical masks during physical activity.","output":"Intraocular pressure responses to walking with surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks in primary open-angle glaucoma patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNSTRUCTURED: This manuscript is in the category of Letters to editor, and there is no abstract.","output":"Using Remote Medical Care Services to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in video conferencing capabilities combined with dramatic socio-dynamic shifts brought about by COVID-19, have redefined the ways in which humans interact in modern society From business meetings to medical exams, or from classroom instruction to yoga class, virtual interfacing has permeated nearly every aspect of our daily lives A seemingly endless stream of technological advances combined with our newfound reliance on virtual interfacing makes it likely that humans will continue to use this modern form of social interaction into the future However, emergent evidence suggests that virtual interfacing may not be equivalent to face-to-face interactions Ultimately, too little is currently understood about the mechanisms that underlie human interactions over the virtual divide, including how these mechanisms differ from traditional face-to-face interaction Here, we propose functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning - simultaneous measurement of two or more brains - as an optimal approach to quantify potential neurocognitive differences between virtual and in-person interactions We argue that increased focus on this understudied domain will help elucidate the reasons why virtual conferencing doesn't always stack up to in-person meetings, and will also serve to spur new technologies designed to improve the virtual interaction experience On the basis of existing fNIRS hyperscanning literature, we highlight the current gaps in research regarding virtual interactions Furthermore, we provide insight into current hurdles regarding fNIRS hyperscanning hardware and methodology that should be addressed in order to shed light on this newly critical element of every day life","output":"Capturing Human Interaction in the Virtual Age: A Perspective on the Future of fNIRS Hyperscanning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the coronavirus in the UK and the resultant lockdown has seen vulnerable groups being asked to shield themselves and stay indoors Are we facing a surge in the numbers of people suffering from vitamin D deficiency?","output":"Coronavirus: Does vitamin D play a role?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide has been alarming in the last months. According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of face masks is essential for slowing down the transmission rate of COVID-19 in human beings. This pandemic has generated a substantial increase in the use, as well as in the production, of face masks and other elements (gloves, face protectors, protective suits, safety shoes) manufactured with polymeric materials, including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic pools. Focusing on South America, the use and mismanagement of this type of personal protective equipment (PPE) represents an environmental problem. Added to this issue are the increase in the use of single-use plastic, and the reduction of plastic recycling due to the curfew generated by the pandemic, further aggravating plastic pollution on coasts and beaches. Recently, researchers have developed antiviral polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID-19. Antiviral polymeric textile wastes could also have long-term negative repercussions on aquatic environments, as they are an important emerging class of contaminants. For this reason, this work provides reflections and perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic can aggravate plastic pollution on beaches and coastal environments, consequently increasing the damage to marine species in the coming years. In addition, the potential impact of the pandemic on waste management systems is discussed here, as well as future research directions to improve integrated coastal management strategies.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic repercussions on plastic and antiviral polymeric textile causing pollution on beaches and coasts of South America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phonics is one of the techniques to teach kids to learn alphabet This technique used the sound of alphabet to teach kids This project is to improve word reading skills by learn how to spell The users mood of study can increase by the time The memorizing technique which is Spaced Repetition Algorithm that implemented in the application can help the slow learner that have problem to memorize The spaced repetition approach will strengthen memory, although at another efficiency using intervals The Fonik Application (FA) target user is slow learner This project provides the video of lips motion of how to sound the alphabet using phonics technique It also provides two tests to view the user understanding of the learner The tests are test of pronunciation and test of hearing In pronunciation test, user needs to input the voice of the word that display in the screen Speech recognition will recognize whether the speech that user input is correct or wrong In the hearing test, user need to recognize the sound of the phonics that have given and answer the right alphabet by choosing the correct alphabet ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"Mobile learning: Fonik Application (FA) using Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SRA) in the Covid-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has revealed a surprising number of extra-pulmonary manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

The paper discusses the importance of the spatial dimension in the conceptualization of social integration. Design/methodology/approach - The main method is a qualitative case study based on observations of settings, document/video analysis, online diary entries made by ten residents and eight semi-structured interviews conducted with the residents. Findings - SallBo was conceived as a new type of collaborative housing in which elderly, young locals and refugees share common spaces with the aim of enabling social integration. In this context, COVID-19 interrupted the ongoing processes of living together after four months of moving to the house. The three main themes that emerge from the empirical material are (1) changes in the use of common spaces and social interactions, (2) residents' resilient coping responses during the pandemic and (3) insights for future design of collaborative housing based on their experience. The pandemic caused a moment of institutional vacuum, which triggered the agency of the residents whilst developing social bonds and social bridges among them. Social implications - Social connection created in everyday life at SallBo's common spaces has triggered processes of social integration. Originality/value - The ongoing processes of social integration have included the spatial dimension. We understand social integration as a process that involves people from different generations and ethnical backgrounds, which takes place in common spaces and everyday life as different modes of socialization.","output":"Social integration through social connection in everyday life.

This study aimed to clarify the impact of hypertension on COVID-19 and investigate whether the prior use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors affects the prognosis of COVID-19. A total of 996 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 282 patients with hypertension and 714 patients without hypertension. Propensity score-matched analysis (1:1 matching) was used to adjust the imbalanced baseline variables between the 2 groups. Patients with hypertension were further divided into the RAAS inhibitor group (n=41) and non-RAAS inhibitor group (n=241) according to their medication history. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had more severe secondary infections, cardiac and renal dysfunction, and depletion of CD8+ cells on admission. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have comorbidities and complications and were more likely to be classified as critically ill than those without hypertension. Cox regression analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio, 95% CI, unmatched cohort [1.80, 1.20-2.70]; matched cohort [2.24, 1.36-3.70]) was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, hypertensive patients with a history of RAAS inhibitor treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and higher levels of CD4+ cells. The mortality of patients in the RAAS inhibitor group (9.8% versus 26.1%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the non-RAAS inhibitor group. In conclusion, hypertension may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients who previously used RAAS inhibitors may have a better prognosis.","output":"Clinical Features of COVID-19 in Patients With Essential Hypertension and the Impacts of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone System Inhibitors on the Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) cause significant morbidity and mortality. Mapping viral transmission within and between facilities by combining genomic sequencing with epidemiologic investigations enables targeting infection-control interventions. METHODS: We conducted weekly surveillance of residents and staff in LTCFs in Santa Clara County, California, with 1 confirmed COVID-19 case between March and July 2020. Positive samples were referred for whole-genome sequencing. Epidemiological investigations and phylogenetic analyses of the largest outbreaks (>30 cases) were carried out in 6 LTCFs (Facilities A through F). RESULTS: Among the 61 LTCFs in the county, 41 had 1 confirmed case during the study period, triggering weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing. The 6 largest outbreaks accounted for 60% of cases and 90% of deaths in LTCFs, although the bed capacity of these facilities represents only 11% of the LTCF beds in the county. Phylogenetic analysis of 196 whole-genome sequences recovered from those facilities showed that each outbreak was monophyletic, with staff and residents sharing a common viral lineage. Outbreak investigations revealed that infected staff members often worked at multiple facilities, and in 1 instance, a staff member infected while working in 1 facility was the likely index case in another. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a pattern of rapid and sustained transmission after a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in 6 large LTCF outbreaks, with staff playing a key role in transmission within and between facilities. Infection control, testing, and occupational policies to reduce exposure and transmission risk for staff are essential components to keeping facility residents safe.","output":"Genomic Epidemiology and Transmission Dynamics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Congregate Healthcare Facilities in Santa Clara County, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJETIVO: En tiempos de pandemia, la gestin de casos y el rastreo de contactos pueden ser elementos diferenciales para el control de la propagacin de la misma El objetivo de esta revisin fue evaluar las herramientas digitales empleadas para el rastreo de contactos de personas contagiadas de SARS-CoV-2 MTODOS: Se realiz una revisin sistemtica exploratoria en las bases de datos electrnicas Pubmed, Scopus y Web of Science el da 29 de mayo de 2020 a travs de los descriptores: coronavirus, digital surveillance y contact tracing Se seleccionaron finalmente un total de 11 estudios RESULTADOS: Los resultados mostraron cmo algunos pases estn implantando herramientas digitales para el rastreo de contactos a travs de aplicaciones para mviles, las cuales permiten compartir datos de los usuarios a travs del GPS y/o Bluetooth del dispositivo Los trminos sobre la privacidad y confidencialidad de los datos de la poblacin estn, en algunos casos, en entredicho CONCLUSIONES: El uso de herramientas de vigilancia digital para el rastreo de contactos de personas contagiadas de una enfermedad infecciosa, como la provocada por el SARS-CoV-2, puede ser capital para reducir el nmero de personas infectadas y reducir la propagacin del virus BACKGROUND: In times of pandemic, case management and tracking people with contact can be differential elements for controlling the spread The objective of this review was to evaluate the digital tools used to track contacts of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 METHODS: A systematic exploratory review was conducted in the electronic databases Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science on May 29, 2020 through the descriptors: coronavirus, digital surveillance and contact tracing A total of 11 studies were finally selected RESULTS: The results showed that some countries are implementing digital tools for contact tracking through mobile apps that allow user data to be shared via the device&#039;s GPS and/or Bluetooth The terms on the privacy and confidentiality of the population data are, in some cases, questionable CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital surveillance tools to track contacts of people infected with an infectious disease, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be key to reducing the number of people infected and reducing the spread of the virus","output":"Herramientas de vigilancia digital para el rastreo de contactos de personas contagiadas de SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major global health crisis that continues to threaten public health and safety.

However, there is a decline in the number of health professionals undertaking research which has implications for patient health and the economy. Informed by the motivation-based expectancy-value-cost (EVC) and self determination theories (SDT), this systematic literature review examined the barriers and facilitators of health professionals (HPs) motivation to undertake research. METHODS: The literature was searched between 2011 and 2021 for relevant peer-reviewed articles written in English, using CINAHL Complete, Informit, Medline Ovid, Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. This systematic review was performed and reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Identified barriers to HPs engagement with research included the lack of knowledge, skills, and competence to conduct research, lack of protected research time, lack of funding and lack of organisational support. Integration of the findings of this review based on the EVC and SDT theories indicate that research capacity, ie, expectancy and competence is highly influenced by attitude, ie, the type of value (attainment, intrinsic or utility) and connection attributed to research. HPs who had very positive attitude towards research demonstrated all three values and were keen to take up research despite the barriers. Those who had a positive attitude were only motivated to do research because of its utility value and did not necessarily see it as having personal relevance for themselves. HPs who were unmotivated did not see any personal connection or relatedness to the research experience and saw no value in research. CONCLUSION: The attitude HPs hold in their value of research is a catalyst for motivation or amotivation to engage in research as it directly influences the relevance of barriers. Facilitators that expedite the research journey have been attributed to research training, mentorship programs and supportive organisational research culture. Motivation of HPs explored through EVC and SDT is critical to the maintenance of a research culture and the clinician-researcher development pipeline.","output":"Rethinking Health Professionals Motivation to Do Research: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undoubtedly, we live in an era of global social, business and economic uncertainty due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

However, HIV testing uptake is low in sub-Saharan Africa, where many people use informal health-care resources such as traditional healers. We hypothesised that uptake of HIV tests would increase if provided by traditional healers. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of traditional healers delivering HIV testing at point of care compared with referral to local clinics for HIV testing in rural southwestern Uganda. METHODS: We did a mixed-methods study that included a cluster-randomised trial followed by individual qualitative interviews among a sample of participants in Mbarara, Uganda. Traditional healers aged 18 years or older who were located within 8 km of the Mbarara District HIV clinic, were identified in the 2018 population-level census of traditional healers in Mbarara District, and delivered care to at least seven clients per week were randomly assigned (1:1) as clusters to an intervention or a control group. Healers screened their clients for eligibility, and research assistants confirmed eligibility and enrolled clients who were aged 18 years or older, were receiving care from a participating healer, were sexually active (ever had intercourse), self-reported not having received an HIV test in the previous 12 months (and therefore considered to be of unknown serostatus), and had not previously been diagnosed with HIV infection. Intervention group healers provided counselling and offered point-of-care HIV tests to adult clients. Control group healers provided referral for HIV testing at nearby clinics. The primary outcome was the individual receipt of an HIV test within 90 days of study enrolment. Safety and adverse events were recorded and defined on the basis of prespecified criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03718871. FINDINGS: Between Aug 2, 2019, and Feb 7, 2020, 17 traditional healers were randomly assigned as clusters (nine to intervention and eight to control), with 500 clients of unknown HIV serostatus enrolled (250 per group). In the intervention group, 250 clients (100%) received an HIV test compared with 57 (23%) in the control group, a 77% (95% CI 73C82) increase in testing uptake, after adjusting for the effect of clustering (p<00001). Ten (4%) of 250 clients in the intervention group tested HIV positive, seven of whom self-reported linkage to HIV care. No new HIV cases were identified in the control group. Qualitative interviews revealed that HIV testing delivered by traditional healers was highly acceptable among both providers and clients. No safety or adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Delivery of point-of-care HIV tests by traditional healers to adults of unknown serostatus significantly increased rates of HIV testing in rural Uganda. Given the ubiquity of healers in Africa, this approach holds promise as a new pathway to provide community-based HIV testing, and could have a dramatic effect on uptake of HIV testing in sub-Saharan Africa.

Milestones have already been achieved in several health care domains, as big data and artificial intelligence have entered everyday life. The aim of this review is to synoptically illustrate and discuss how artificial intelligence approaches may help to compute single-patient predictions in stroke outcome research in the acute, subacute and chronic stage. We will present approaches considering demographic, clinical and electrophysiological data, as well as data originating from various imaging modalities and combinations thereof. We will outline their advantages, disadvantages, their potential pitfalls and the promises they hold with a special focus on a clinical audience.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven adult COVID-19 patients underwent chest CT scans on a CT scanner using the same scan protocol except with the manual positioning (MP group) for the initial scan and an AI-based automatic positioning method (AP group) for the follow-up scan. Radiation dose, patient positioning time, and off-center distance of the two groups were recorded and compared. Image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The AP operation was successful for all patients in the AP group and reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the MP group. Compared with the MP group, the AP group had significantly less patient off-center distance (AP 1.56 cm  0.83 vs. MP 4.05 cm  2.40, p < 0.001) and higher proportion of positioning accuracy (AP 99% vs. MP 92%), resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction (AP 6.1 mSv  1.3 vs. MP 7.3 mSv  1.2, p < 0.001) and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae and lower noise and higher SNR for lesions in the pulmonary peripheral areas. CONCLUSION: The AI-based automatic positioning and centering in CT imaging is a promising new technique for reducing radiation dose and optimizing imaging workflow and image quality in imaging the chest.

The provision of remote care to a terminally ill patient is associated with specific challenges and burdens. In the German context, research is lacking on the specific experiences and needs of caregivers in end-of-life situations who are geographically distanced from their relative. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed study is to detail the specifics of long-distance caregiving at the end of life in Germany, determining the role played by physical distance in shaping end-of-life caregiving and identifying the needs of long-distance caregivers in this situation. METHODS: The exploratory qualitative study will be guided by an inductive logic, drawing on one-time semi-structured interviews. To uncover the multiplicity of caregiving experiences, long-distance caregivers of both patients receiving early palliative care and patients at a very advanced stage of disease will be included. The study will be divided into five phases: (1) preparation and pretest, (2) data collection and primary analysis, (3) data analysis and interpretation, (4) advisory board workshop and (5) conclusions and recommendations. DISCUSSION: The study will aim at generating valuable insight regarding the experiences and needs of family caregivers of end-of-life patients. This is particularly relevant, given that families are becoming increasingly geographically dispersed. As this trend continues, it will challenge traditional models of family care and shed light on novel caregiving issues that will need to be addressed through social and health policy.

Aim To undertake a systematic review identifying postnatal interventions associated with improved outcomes for gastroschisis in LMICs. Methods and analysis Three search strings will be combined: (1) neonates; (2) gastroschisis and other gastrointestinal congenital anomalies requiring similar surgical care; (3) LMICs. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global, and the Cochrane Library. Grey literature will be identified through Open-Grey, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry and ISRCTN registry (Springer Nature). Additional studies will be sought from reference lists of included studies. Study screening, selection, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality will be undertaken by two reviewers independently and team consensus sought on discrepancies. The primary outcome of interest is mortality. Secondary outcomes include complications, requirement for ventilation, parenteral nutrition duration and length of hospital stay. Tertiary outcomes include service delivery and implementation outcomes. The methodology of the studies will be appraised. Descriptive statistics and outcomes will be summarised and discussed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required since no new data are being collected. Dissemination will be via open access publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and distribution among global health, global surgery and children's surgical collaborations and international conferences. Conclusion This study will systematically review literature focused on postnatal interventions to improve outcomes from gastroschisis in LMICs.

Ivermectin is a putative antiviral compound; the proposed mechanism is the inhibition of nuclear translocation of viral proteins, facilitated by mammalian host importins, a necessary process for propagation of infections. We systematically reviewed the evidence for the applicability of ivermectin against viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 regarding efficacy, mechanisms and selective toxicity. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was mined to determine potential nuclear location signals for ivermectin and meta-analyses for in vivo studies included all comparators over time, dose range and viral replication in multiple organs. Ivermectin inhibited the replication of many viruses including those in Flaviviridae, Circoviridae and Coronaviridae families in vitro. Real and mock nuclear location signals were identified in SARS-CoV-2, a potential target for ivermectin and predicting a sequestration bait for importin ?, stopping infected cells from reaching a virus-resistant state. While pharmacokinetic evaluations indicate that ivermectin could be toxic if applied based on in vitro studies, inhibition of viral replication in vivo was shown for Porcine circovirus in piglets and Suid herpesvirus in mice. Overall standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for ivermectin versus controls were -4.43 (-5.81, -3.04), p < 0.00001. Based on current results, the potential for repurposing ivermectin as an antiviral agent is promising. However, further work is needed to reconcile in vitro studies with clinical efficacy. Developing ivermectin as an additional antiviral agent should be pursued with an emphasis on pre-clinical trials in validated models of infection.","output":"A systematic review of experimental evidence for antiviral effects of ivermectin and an in silico analysis of ivermectin's possible mode of action against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to explore the attitudes of Swiss healthcare professionals toward the use of social media in adolescent and young adult oncology, and to examine whether the ongoing social restrictions due to COVID-19 might have altered these attitudes. METHODS: This research was a survey study. The subjects were healthcare providers working in pediatric or adult oncology settings in Switzerland. 62 providers completed the survey. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. RESULTS: While considered useful for various professional aspects (professional life 62.1%, educational purposes 72.7%, networking 83.3%, patient engagement 57.6%, clinical trial recruitment 51.5%), only a small proportion of participants actually used social media for professional reasons weekly (32.8%). Just over half considered themselves skillful in using these platforms (56.1%). Regression analysis revealed that self-assessed skillfulness with social media, the Covid-19 impact on attitudes, and the oncology setting, significantly predicted assessment of the usefulness of social media. Although, in answers to open items, institutional guidelines were deemed crucial to improve social media use, many respondents seemed unaware of their existence (50.8%). Only a minority reported an impact of Covid-19 on their attitudes towards the professional implementation of social media (25.0%). CONCLUSION: The global health crisis creates important challenges for young patients with cancer and their healthcare providers.

The city of New Orleans, Louisiana experienced one of the earliest and fastest accelerating outbreaks, coinciding with the annual Mardi Gras festival, which went ahead without precautions. To gain insight into the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and how large, crowded events may have accelerated early transmission, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Louisiana. We show that SARS-CoV-2 in Louisiana initially had limited sequence diversity compared to other U.S. states, and that one successful introduction of SARS-CoV-2 led to almost all of the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Louisiana. By analyzing mobility and genomic data, we show that SARS-CoV-2 was already present in New Orleans before Mardi Gras and that the festival dramatically accelerated transmission, eventually leading to secondary localized COVID-19 epidemics throughout the Southern U.S..

This dosing schedule is associated with inhibition of seroconversion following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in contrast to the high levels of seroconversion following treatment with alemtuzumab and cladribine tablets. A number of emerging reports suggest that repopulation of 1-3% B cells facilitates seroconversion after CD20-depletion. The frequency of this occurring following repeated ocrelizumab treatment, after other DMT, and after treatment cessation is largely unknown. METHODS: Relapse data, lymphocyte and CD19 B cell numbers were extracted from phase II ocrelizumab extension study (NCT00676715) data supplied by the manufacturer via the Vivli Inc, trial data-request portal. Repopulation data of oral cladribine from the phase III CLARITY study (NCT00213135) was supplied by the European Medicines Agency; and the alemtuzumab phase III CARE-MS I (NCT00530348) and CARE-MS II (NCT00548405) trial data were supplied by the manufacturer via the clinicalstudydatarequest.com portal. RESULTS: Only 3-5% of people with MS exhibit 1% B cells at 6 months after the last infusion following 3-4 cycles of ocrelizumab, compared to 50-55% at 9 months, and 85-90% at 12 months. During this time relapses occurred at consistent disease breakthrough rates compared to people during standard therapy. In contrast most people (90-100%) exhibited more than 1% B cells during treatment with either cladribine or alemtuzumab. CONCLUSIONS. Few people repopulate peripheral B cells with standard ocrelizumab dosing, however an extending the dosing interval by 3-6 months may allow many more people to potentially seroconvert in the relative absence of excess relapse-activity. Most people demonstrate B cell repletion within 3 months of the last treatment of alemtuzumab and cladribine.

Considerable study of endemic human coronaviruses has shown that neutralizing antibody correlates with protection, but effective clinical protection is variable for subsequent virus exposure. Animal coronavirus research has emphasized the importance of local mucosal protection (especially IgA) and systemic responses. Animal model and human post-infection studies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are largely corroborative. Whether for passive therapeutic strategies or vaccination, these findings provide a template for COVID-19. Many approaches to vaccination have emerged, and there may be more than one vaccine that will be applied, but individualized obstacles and concerns for administration, efficacy, and safety are inevitable. Regardless of safeguards or promises that may be understood from laboratory or vertebrate experiments, observations from large-scale human trials will ultimately prove to shape the medical future.

In this work, to assist the design of urgently needed crystals with large birefringence in the infrared (IR) region, typical alkali-metal chalcogenides, KPSe6, Na2Ge2Se5, and Li2In2GeSe6 have been studied. They exhibit a hierarchical characteristic in the calculated birefringence by about 0.21, 0.11, and 0.04, respectively. To explore the origin of the birefringence difference, the polarizability anisotropy and the effect of electron distribution anisotropy are analyzed. The alkali-metal chalcogenides KPSe6, Na2Ge2Se5, and Li2In2GeSe6 feature infinite one-dimensional (1D) chains of [PSe6], 2D anionic framework of [Ge2Se5] layers and 3D [In2GeSe9] networks, respectively. It is found that the anionic group with low-dimensional configuration could enhance polarizability anisotropy and render large birefringence for the macroscopic structure.

Since its initial host switch from the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) to the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), Varroa has become a widely successful invasive species, attacking honey bees on almost every continent where apiculture is practiced. Two haplotypes of V. destructor (Japanese and Korean) parasitize A. mellifera, both of which vector various honey bee-associated viruses. As the population of Varroa grows within a colony in the spring and summer, so do the levels of viral infections. Not surprisingly, high Varroa parasitization impacts bees at the individual level, causing bees to exhibit lower weight, decreased learning capacity, and shorter lifespan. High levels of Varroa infestation can lead to colony-wide varroosis and eventually colony death, especially when no control measures are taken against the mites. Varroa has become a successful parasite of A. mellifera because of its ability to reproduce within both drone cells and worker cells, which allows populations to expand rapidly. Varroa uses several chemical cues to complete its life cycle, many of which remain understudied and should be further explored. Given the growing reports of pesticide resistance by Varroa in several countries, a better understanding of the mite's basic biology is needed to find alternative pest management strategies. This review focuses on the genetics, behavior, and chemical ecology of V. destructor within A. mellifera colonies, and points to areas of research that should be exploited to better control this pervasive honey bee enemy.","output":"Understanding the Enemy: A Review of the Genetics, Behavior and Chemical Ecology of Varroa destructor, the Parasitic Mite of Apis mellifera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ambient or altered environmental conditions on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 applied to materials common in libraries, archives, and museums. METHODS AND RESULTS Porous and non-porous materials (e.g., paper, plastic protective book cover) were inoculated with approximately 1105 TCID50 SARS CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020), dried, placed within test chamber in either a stacked or unstacked configuration, and exposed to environmental conditions ranging from 4-29C at 4010% relative humidity. The amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was then assessed at various timepoints from 0-10 days. Ambient conditions resulted in varying inactivation rates per material type. Virus inactivation rate decreased when materials were stacked or at colder temperatures. Virus inactivation rate increased when materials were unstacked or at warmer temperatures. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 at ambient conditions resulted in the inactivation of virus below limit of quantitation (LOQ) for all materials by Day 8. Warmer temperatures, for a subset of materials, increased SARS-CoV-2 inactivation, and all were <LOQ by Day 3.

APPROACH: In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective preCpost surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively. OUTCOMES: The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001). There was no difference in the change in comfort level between those learners who were taught by the initial trainer and those who were taught by the subsequent trainers. These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners skill retention.

A restart could only be enabled with green site separation and a covid protected zone. A hospital within the hospital concept was developed including 9 elective theatres, 28 ring fenced elective beds, a surgical enhanced care unit, a canteen, and a separated entrance. This model was underpinned with PPE, enhanced infection control and guidance for staff. The study documented the ability to recover elective activity and therefore provide a training environment for surgical trainees. METHOD: Data was collected weekly (7/20 to 1/21) through the business informatics system with regard to theatres cases completed compared to the activity achieved in the 11-theatre elective estate pre COVID-19. RESULTS: Pre COVID-19, an average of 263 cases were completed per week. In the first week of operation, 31% of theatre capacity was achieved. By week 7, 106% of pre COVID was recorded and 130% by week 11. This was maintained until the impact of the second wave where activity has reduced to 50% but is not anticipated to reduce further as local anaesthetic and blocks maybe utilised. CONCLUSIONS: This hospital within the hospital has enabled elective care to return to above normal levels, with increased efficiencies.

The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences and perspectives in attending a Healthy Pregnancy Service designed to optimise healthy lifestyle and support recommended gestational weight gain for women with obesity. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study design utilised two questionnaires (completed in early and late pregnancy) to quantify feelings, motivation and satisfaction with the service, followed by semi-structured interviews that explored barriers and enablers of behaviour change. Data were analysed separately and then interpreted together. RESULTS: Overall, 49 women attending the service completed either questionnaire 1, 2 or both and were included in the analysis. Fourteen women were interviewed. Prior to pregnancy, many women had gained weight and attempted to lose weight independently, and reported they were highly motivated to achieve a healthy lifestyle. During pregnancy, diet changes were reported as easier to make and sustain than exercise changes. Satisfaction with the service was high. Key factors identified in qualitative analysis were: service support enabled change; motivation to change behaviour, social support, barriers to making change (intrinsic, extrinsic and clinic-related), post-partum lifestyle and needs. On integration of data, qualitative and quantitative findings aligned. CONCLUSIONS: The Healthy Pregnancy service was valued by women. Barriers and enablers to the delivery of an integrated model of maternity care that supported healthy lifestyle and recommended gestational weight gain were identified. These findings have informed and improved implementation and further scale up of this successful service model, integrating healthy lifestyle into routine antenatal care of women with obesity.

Here, we investigate the inactivation of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in human milk by pasteurisation and the stability of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in human milk under cold storage. METHODS: SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 was experimentally inoculated into human milk samples from healthy donors or into a control medium. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after Holder pasteurisation (63C for 30 min), heating to 56C for 30 min, or after 48 h of storage at 4C or ?30C.

Severe infections can lead to a variety of diseases, including poliomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis. Enterovirus infections have also been implicated in asthmatic exacerbations and type 1 diabetes. The large disease spectrum of the closely related enteroviruses may be partially, but not fully, explained by differences in tissue tropism. The molecular mechanisms by which enteroviruses cause disease are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that the two enteroviral proteases, 2A(pro) and 3C(pro), are important mediators of pathology. These proteases perform the post\\\\translational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein, but they also cleave several host\\\\cell proteins in order to promote the production of new virus particles, as well as to evade the cellular antiviral immune responses. Enterovirus\\\\associated processing of cellular proteins may also contribute to pathology, as elegantly demonstrated by the 2A(pro)\\\\mediated cleavage of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes contributing to Coxsackievirus\\\\induced cardiomyopathy.

We aimed to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Qatar. Methods: A series of epidemiologic studies were conducted including analysis of the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database, community surveys assessing current infection, ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas, serological testing for antibody on blood specimens collected for routine clinical screening/management, national Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) death registry, and a mathematical model. Results: By July 10, 397,577 individuals had been PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI: 27.8-28.1%). PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI: 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI: 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI: 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but it was 91.3% (95% CI: 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive >3 weeks before serology testing. There were substantial differences in exposure to infection by nationality and sex, reflecting risk differentials between the CMW and urban populations. As of July 5, case severity rate, based on the WHO severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Model-estimated daily number of infections and active-infection prevalence peaked at 31,040 and 8.0%, respectively, on May 20 and May 21. Attack rate (ever infection) was estimated at 61.3% on July 12. R0 ranged between 1.45-1.68 throughout the epidemic. Rt was estimated at 0.70 on June 15, which was hence set as onset date for easing of restrictions. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. Conclusions: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to exhaustion of susceptibles. The epidemic demonstrated a classic susceptible-infected-recovered SIR dynamics with a rather stable R0 of about 1.6.

Although the specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate events, such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection, sometimes there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance, individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk for rare conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who suffered non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis session, of which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent kidney biopsy, where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were found on kidney biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an open nucleolus in the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells. After 40 days in the hospital, his serum creatinine was 1.62 mg/dL and CPK and Myoglobin were 188 U/L and 168 ng/mL, respectively; therefore, the patient was discharged. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in severe rhabdomyolysis with AKI requiring acute HD.

PURPOSE: This article summarizes current androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapies that have received regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced prostate adenocarcinoma (herein referred to as prostate cancer, PC). SUMMARY: PC is an androgen-dependent malignancy in which ligands including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone bind to AR, initiating androgen-AR complex translocation to the nucleus followed by AR-mediated transcription of target genes. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists with or without AR antagonists (antiandrogens), GnRH antagonists, or bilateral orchiectomy, forms the backbone of treatment for patients with metastatic castration-naive PC and/or castration-resistant PC (CRPC). ADT is also an option for high-risk, early-stage PC after prostatectomy and/or radiation. While ADT is often very effective as initial therapy, resistance ultimately develops despite suppression of gonadal and/or adrenal androgens, leading to CRCPC, which is characterized by mechanisms such as reactivation of the AR signaling pathway, AR overexpression, and gene mutations in the ligand-binding domain of AR that lead to disease progression, resulting in increased symptom burden and ultimately death. However, disease in patients with CRPC is still dependent on androgen signaling, and these patients continue on ADT to maintain a castrate level of serum testosterone. Novel hormonal therapies including agents that target AR directly (eg, AR antagonists) are often added to ADT in this setting. Targeting the AR signaling pathway led to the development of second-generation AR antagonists, examples of which include enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide. These agents do not exhibit partial agonism or possess a higher affinity for AR and are not postulated to improve survival outcomes relative to their first-generation counterparts for patients with CRPC. Lastly, the emergence of ADT, including second-generation AR antagonists, has led to the development of supportive care for treatment-related adverse effects.

It is well established that the endothelial glycocalyx-degrading enzyme heparanase contributes to vascular leakage and inflammation. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) serve as an inhibitor of heparanase. We hypothesize that heparanase contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and that heparanase may be inhibited by LMWH. To test this hypothesis, heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured in plasma of healthy controls (n = 10) and COVID-19 patients (n = 48). Plasma heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Heparanase activity was associated with disease severity including the need for intensive care, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and creatinine levels. Use of prophylactic LMWH in non-ICU patients was associated with a reduced heparanase activity. Since there is no other clinically applied heparanase inhibitor currently available, therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparins should be explored.","output":"Increased Plasma Heparanase Activity in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When testing for a disease such as COVID-19, the standard method is individual testing: we take a sample from each individual and test these samples separately.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes (as of April 4, 2020) were compared among control (group 1), secondary hyperglycaemia (group 2: no diabetes history, FPG levels 7.0 mmol/L once and HbA1c values <6.5%) and diabetic (group 3) patients. RESULTS: Compared to group 1, groups 2 and 3 had higher rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia, and levels of sCRP, ferritin and d\\\\dimer (P < 0.05 for all). Group 2 patients have higher levels of LDH, prevalence of liver dysfunction and increased IL\\\\8 than those in group 1, a higher prevalence of increased IL\\\\8 was found in group 2 than in group 3 (P < 0.05 for all). The proportions of critical patients in groups 2 and 3 were significantly higher compared to group 1 (38.1%, 32.8% vs. 9.5%, P < 0.05 for both).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of these patients admitted to our hospital between March 22 and May 31, 2020. Data were abstracted from multiple electronic data sources or patient charts to provide information on patient characteristics, clinical, laboratory variables, and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients met the inclusion criteria and were followed up till June 7, 2020. The median age of the patients was 55.6 years (range 20C89 years) and 68% were men. At least one comorbidity was seen in 72% of the patients with diabetes (44%) and hypertension (46%) being the most common. At triage, fever (82%), shortness of breath (77%), and cough (61%) were the most common presenting symptoms. A PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio less than 300 was seen in 60%, and 4.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation within 72 hours of hospital admission. Five immunomodulatory agents (hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, colchicine, etoricoxib, and tocilizumab) were administered in different combinations. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 26.9%, and 32% required mechanical ventilation. Around 69% of patients were discharged home. Five variables (SpO(2), PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, leucocytosis, lymphopenia, and creatinine) on admission were found to be significant in the patients who died.

OBJECTIVES: A systematic description of a seasonal influenza patient population at a German university hospital to improve risk stratification and clinical care. METHODS: In this monocentric, retrospective observational study of the 2017/2018 influenza season at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, patients with confirmed influenza infection were included. RESULTS: Of all influenza swabs performed in the emergency department, 24% (n = 162/676) were positive. A total of 255 patients (median age 66 years) had an influenza infection (influenza A n = 79, influenza B n = 176); 27 (15.3%) were nosocomial infections. Of the 179 (70.2%) patients that were hospitalized, 51 (20%) received intensive medical care. Patients with subsequent need for intensive care had an elevated CRP level (69.5 mg/dl [SD 62.8] vs. 141.7 [SD 127.2] mg/dl) at the time of influenza diagnosis and more frequent infiltrates in X?ray/CT of the thorax (n = 43 [33.6%] vs. n = 43 [84.3%]). Antiviral therapy with oseltamivir was administered for 74 (29.0%) patients and 11 (6.1%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Of the 23 (9.0%) patients who died, only four of them had been vaccinated (trivalent). Those four had an influenza B infection. CONCLUSION: The structured use of diagnostic tests (influenza PCR, X?ray/CT chest and CRP) and antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) as well as targeted management of admission, intensive care capacities, and an increase in vaccination rates are important for improving patient care and optimizing the use of resources during seasonal influenza epidemics.","output":"Management der saisonalen Influenza 2017/2018: Erfahrungen an einem deutschen Universit?tsklinikum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The government in Indonesia and its staff work together to make tactical steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the community From the ministerial level to the heads of the provinces, regencies, and even the government Therefore, this study aims to make a model decision support system to diagnose patients exposed to Covid-19, such as people in control, patients in oversight, and those who are positive for the Covid-19 Virus Model decision support system development aims to provide information about the development of COVID- 19 and help the community in diagnosing themselves related to COVID-19 infection In this study, the authors use the forward chaining method in application to get conclusions from the symptoms of the Covid-19 This research resulted in an application that patients exposed to the Covid-19, and it's also provided a solution for healing from patients And this could be a reference for patients before consulting further with the doctor ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Model Decision Support System for Diagnosis COVID-19 Using Forward Chaining: A Case in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa in 2013C2015 spread heterogeneously across the three hardest-hit countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the estimation of national transmission of EVD provides little information about local dynamics.

Corticosteroids improve respiratory status and outcome, but the optimal treatment regimen for benefit with low systemic effects is uncertain. METHODS: In a pilot dose escalation trial, we administered 5 daily doses of budesonide in surfactant to 24 intubated premature infants (Steroid And Surfactant in ELGANs (SASSIE)). Untargeted metabolomics was performed on dried blood spots using UPLC-MS/MS. Tracheal aspirate IL-8 concentration was determined as a measure of lung inflammation. RESULTS: Metabolomics data for 829 biochemicals were obtained on 121 blood samples over 96 h from 23 infants receiving 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 mg budesonide/kg. Ninety metabolites were increased or decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner at q  0.1 with overrepresentation in lipid and amino acid super pathways. Different dose response patterns occurred, with negative regulation associated with highest sensitivity to budesonide. Baseline levels of 22 regulated biochemicals correlated with lung inflammation (IL-8), with highest significance for sphingosine and thiamin. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous metabolic pathways are regulated in a dose-dependent manner by glucocorticoids, which apparently act via distinct mechanisms that impact dose sensitivity. The findings identify candidate blood biochemicals as biomarkers of lung inflammation and systemic responses to corticosteroids. IMPACT: Treatment of premature infants in respiratory failure with 0.1 mg/kg intra-tracheal budesonide in surfactant alters levels of ~11% of detected blood biochemicals in discrete time- and dose-dependent patterns. A subset of glucocorticoid-regulated biochemicals is associated with lung inflammatory status as assessed by lung fluid cytokine concentration.

Our objectives were: i) to assess malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ii) to investigate the links between malnutrition and disease severity at admission, iii) to study the impact of malnutrition on clinical outcomes such as transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Methods Consecutive patients hospitalized in a medicine ward at a university hospital were included from March 21st to April 24th 2020 (n=114, 60.5% males, age: 59.9  15.9 years). Nutritional status was defined using Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Clinical, radiological and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were compared according to the presence of malnutrition. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between nutritional parameters and unfavourable outcomes such as transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Results The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 42.1% (moderate: 23.7%, severe: 18.4%). The prevalence of malnutrition reached 66.7% in patients admitted from ICU. No significant association was found between nutritional status and clinical signs of COVID-19. Lower albumin levels were associated with a higher risk of transfer to ICU (for 10g/l of albumin, OR [95%CI]: 0.31 [0.1; 0.7]; p<0.01) and this association was independent of age and CRP levels. Conclusions COVID-19 in medical units dedicated to non-intensive care is associated with a high prevalence of malnutrition, especially for patients transferred from ICU.

Though social media provide platforms for expressing news and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer volumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and rumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's opinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very important to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to prevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification of social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as it is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous studies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter. These approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context features from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours. Manually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume of tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising sentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the usual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to represent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual meaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by using various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved the accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.","output":"BERT based classification system for detecting rumours on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: An individualised thromboprophylaxis was implemented in critically ill patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this intervention on clinical outcome. METHODS: In this mono-centric, controlled, before-after study, all consecutive adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to ICU from March 13th to April 20th 2020 were included. A thromboprophylaxis protocol, including augmented LMWH dosing, individually tailored with anti-Xa measurements and twice-weekly ultrasonography screening for DVT, was implemented on March 31th 2020. Primary endpoint is one-month mortality. Secondary outcomes include two-week and three-week mortality, the incidence of VTE, acute kidney injury and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Multiple regression modelling was used to correct for differences between the two groups. RESULTS: 46 patients were included in the before group, 26 patients in the after group. One month mortality decreased from 39.13% to 3.85% (p < 0.001). After correction for confounding variables, one-month mortality was significantly higher in the before group (p = 0.02, OR 8.86 (1.46, 53.75)). The cumulative incidence of VTE and CRRT was respectively 41% and 30.4% in the before group and dropped to 15% (p = 0.03) and 3.8% (p = 0.01), respectively. After correction for confounding variables, risk of VTE (p = 0.03, 6.01 (1.13, 32.12)) and CRRT (p = 0.02, OR 19.21 (1.44, 255.86)) remained significantly higher in the before group. CONCLUSION: Mortality, cumulative risk of VTE and need for CRRT may be significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients by implementation of a more aggressive thromboprophylaxis protocol. Future research should focus on confirmation of these results in a randomized design and on uncovering the mechanisms underlying these observations.

Controversial claims have been made in the literature regarding whether the viral load distribution actually depends on the age of the patients. Such a dependence would have implications for the COVID-19 spreading mechanism, the age-dependent immune system reaction, and thus for policymaking. We hereby develop a method to analyze viral-load distribution data as a function of the patients' age within a flexible, non-parametric, hierarchical, Bayesian, and causal model. This method can be applied to other contexts as well, and for this purpose, it is made freely available. The developed reconstruction method also allows testing for bias in the data. This could be due to, e.g., bias in patient-testing and data collection or systematic errors in the measurement of the viral load. We perform these tests by calculating the Bayesian evidence for each implied possible causal direction. When applying these tests to publicly available age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load data, we find a statistically significant increase in the viral load with age, but only for one of the two analyzed datasets. If we consider this dataset, and based on the current understanding of viral load's impact on patients' infectivity, we expect a non-negligible difference in the infectivity of different age groups.

In spite of such progress, novel challenges have been added to the equation, most importantly outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio cases resulting from reversion to neurovirulence of attenuated vaccine virus, and insufficient coverage of vaccination. In the context of the latest discussions on malaria eradication, the GPEI experience provides more than a few lessons to the malaria field when considering a coordinated eradication campaign. The WHO Strategic Advisory Committee on Malaria Eradication (SAGme) stated in 2020 that in the context of more than 200 million malaria cases reported, eradication was far from reach in the near future and, therefore, efforts should remain focused on getting back on track to achieve the objectives set by the Global Technical Strategy against Malaria (2016C2030).

Above all, it shows the critical need for openness to change and adaptation as the biological, social and political contexts vary throughout the time an eradication campaign is ongoing.","output":"Some lessons for malaria from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the trade-off between economics and epidemic prevention (safety) has become painfully clear worldwide This situation thus highlights the significance of balancing the economy with safety and health Safety economics, considering the interdependencies between safety and micro-economics, is ideal for supporting this kind of decision-making Although economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis have been used in safety management, little attention has been paid to the fundamental issues and the primary methodologies in safety economics Therefore, this paper presents a systematic study on safety economics to analyze the foundational issues and explore the possible approaches Firstly, safety economics is defined as a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field of academic research focusing on the interdependencies and coevolution of micro-economies and safety Then we explore the role of safety economics in safety management and production investment Furthermore, to make decisions more profitable, economic approaches are summarized and analyzed for decision-making about prevention investments and/or safety strategies Finally, we discuss some open issues in safety economics and possible pathways to improve this research field, such as security economics, risk perception, and multi-criteria analysis","output":"Operational safety economics: Foundations, current approaches and paths for future research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Most of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms arise at the vertebral artery-PICA junction; distal PICA aneurysms are rare.

We reported 9 patients with the distal PICA aneurysms treated by surgical clipping or endovascular embolization in our neurosurgical center. RESULTS All patients experienced sudden onset of headache with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The location of PICA aneurysms was at the anterior-medullary (n = 4), tonsillomedullary (TM) (n = 1), and telovelotonsillar (n = 4). Surgical clipping was performed in 3 and endovascular coil in 6 patients. All the PICA aneurysms were occluded with parent artery preservation, and all of the patients achieved good recovery.

Current PyCBC-based searches for compact binary mergers, which matched filter the detector data against a set of template waveforms, have so far detected or confirmed several GW events. However, the sensitivity of these searches to signals arising from mergers of IMBH binaries is not optimal. Here, we present a new optimised PyCBC-based search for such signals. Our search benefits from using a targeted template bank, stricter signal-noise discriminators and a lower matched-filter frequency cut-off. In particular, for a population of simulated signals with isotropically distributed spins, we improve the sensitive volume-time product over previous PyCBC-based searches, at an inverse false alarm rate of 100 years, by a factor of 1.5 to 3 depending on the total binary mass. We deploy this new search on Advanced LIGO-Virgo data from the first half of the third observing run. The search does not identify any new significant IMBH binaries but does confirm the detection of the short-duration GW signal GW190521 with a false alarm rate of 1 in 727 years.","output":"An optimized PyCBC search for gravitational waves from intermediate-mass black hole mergers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secondary pulmonary tuberculosis (SPT) is one of the top ten causes of death from a single infectious agent.

The cytopathic effects of periodontopathic bacteria on epithelial cells disrupt the integrity of the barrier junction, resulting in the inflammation of periodontal tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of T. denticola virulence factors dentilisin and Msp on epithelial cells. The effects of T. denticola wild-type, Msp-mutant, and dentilisin-mutant strains on the contact junction in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells was evaluated based on ohmic values. Cultured oral carcinoma epithelial cells were scratched and exposed to the selected T. denticola strains and cell migration determined. Subsequent degradation of adherence proteins and proteins in the contact junctions was evaluated. Dissociation of cell contact junctions was detected in cells infected with wild-type T. denticola approximately 30 min after infection, but not in those exposed to the mutants. Inhibition of migration was observed in the wild-type and Msp-deficient mutants. The adherent proteins focal adhesion kinase, ZO-1, and paxillin were hydrolyzed by infection with the wild-type and Msp mutants. These results indicate that T. denticola disrupts the function of epithelial cells by hydrolyzing proteins at the intercellular junction and inhibiting healing of epithelial cells via hydrolyzed proteins associated with focal adhesion; Msp was also associated with these effects.","output":"Effect of Treponema Denticola Infection on Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biocidal active chemicals have potential health risks associated with exposure to retail biocide products such as disinfectants for COVID-19.

The interviewCsurvey approach was taken to obtain the database about several subcategories of twelve occupational groups, the use pattern, and the exposure information of non-human hygiene disinfectant and insecticide products in workplaces. Furthermore, we investigated valuable exposure factors, e.g., the patterns of use, exposure routes, and quantifying potential hazardous chemical intake, on biocidal active ingredients.

The 685 non-human hygiene disinfectants and 763 insecticides identified contained 152 and 97 different active-ingredient chemicals, respectively. The toxicity values and clinical health effects of total twelve ingredient chemicals were determined through a brief overview of toxicity studies aimed at estimating human health risks. To estimate actual exposure amounts divided by twelve occupational groups, the time spent to apply the products was investigated from the beginning to end of the product use.

Inspired by the peculiar spatial arrangement of salp colonies, which are displaced in long chains following a leader, this algorithm seems to provide an interesting optimization performance. However, the original work was characterized by some conceptual and mathematical flaws, which influenced all ensuing papers on the subject. In this manuscript, we perform a critical review of SSO, highlighting all the issues present in the literature and their negative effects on the optimization process carried out by this algorithm. We also propose a mathematically correct version of SSO, named Amended Salp Swarm Optimizer (ASSO) that fixes all the discussed problems. We benchmarked the performance of ASSO on a set of tailored experiments, showing that it is able to achieve better results than the original SSO. Finally, we performed an extensive study aimed at understanding whether SSO and its variants provide advantages compared to other metaheuristics. The experimental results, where SSO cannot outperform simple well-known metaheuristics, suggest that the scientific community can safely abandon SSO.","output":"Salp Swarm Optimization: a Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to identify factors responsible for disease in all species depends on the ability to separate those factors which are environmental from those that are intrinsic. This is particularly important for studies on the development of the adaptive immune response of neonates. Studies on laboratory rodents or primates have been ambiguous because neither the effect of environmental nor maternal factors on the newborn can be controlled in mammals that: (i) transmit potential maternal immunoregulatory factors in utero and (ii) are altricial and cannot be reared after birth without their mothers. Employing the newborn piglet model can address each of these concerns. However, it comes at the price of having first to characterize the immune system of swine and its development. This review focuses on the porcine B cell system, especially on the methods used for its characterization in fetal studies and neonatal piglets. Understanding these procedures is important in the interpretation of the data obtained. Studies on neonatal piglets have (a) provided valuable information on the development of the adaptive immune system, (b) lead to important advances in evolutionary biology, (c) aided our understanding of passive immunity and (d) provided opportunities to use swine to address specific issues in veterinary and biomedical research and immunotherapy.

This radiopeptide is made by labelling the ligand octreotate with Lutetium-177 using the linker DOTA. After labelling, and before clinical application quality control of the radiopeptide is needed and the radiochemical purity is assessed. Acceptance limits for radiochemical purity should be within 90-110% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic use and within 95-105% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic use. Moreover, the amount of unlabelled [177Lu]LuCl3 cannot exceed 2% of the radioactive dose. Since no monograph is available for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph Eur), this article describes the development and validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection and radiodetection. A Waters Acquity Arc UHPLC system equipped with a Waters 2998 photodiode array (PDA) detector was used coupled to a Berthold Lb 514 Flowstar detector equipped with a BGO-X gamma measuring cell. A reversed phase Symmetry Shield C18 column (4.6 mm  250 mm, 5 m) was used for chromatographic separation. A flow of 1.5 mL/min was maintained during analysis, using 0.1% TFA in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% TFA in ACN as mobile phase B. The retention time was around 1.7 min and 13.5 min for [177Lu]LuCl3 and [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE, respectively. Stock solutions of [177Lu]LuCl3 were made by serial dilution and were injected to test for linearity, accuracy and precision, carry over and signal-to-noise ratio. A [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE sample was prepared and injected to determine the carry over. The results showed that the method is linear over a range of 0.300-130 MBq/mL, which covers the range for clinical samples, provided that the clinical sample is diluted ten times before analysis. The LLOQ can be measured accurately even after dilution, with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5. In short, the method is accurate, precise and sensitive and can be implemented as part of the quality control of [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE.","output":"The development and validation of a high performance liquid chromatography method to determine the radiochemical purity of [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE in pharmaceutical preparations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread world-wide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Germany-wide online-based cross-sectional study (03/10-07/27/2020) included 22,961 people (convenience sample). Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), and psychological distress (DT) were collected, as well as COVID-19-related experiences and behavior patterns: COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions, subjective level of information, adherent safety behavior, and personal risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness. The pandemic was retrospectively divided into five phases (initial, crisis, lockdown, reorientation, and new normality). RESULTS: Compared to pre-COVID-19 reference values, GAD-7, PHQ-2, and DT levels were significantly elevated and persistent throughout the different phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-related fear, information level, trust, safety behavior, and the risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness showed, after initial strong increase, a strong decrease to partly below the initial value. Exceptions were constant risk assessments of having a severe course of illness or dying of it.

METHODS Twenty-one students undertaking a mock-final OSCE consented to have one of their examination stations filmed. Participants completed a series of reflective forms immediately after the OSCE, after verbal feedback from an examiner and finally, after watching the video of their own performance. Students were asked to predict their overall grade as well as list areas for improvement. Pearson r correlations examined the relationship between the examiners' grades and the candidates' self-predicted grades. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the length of reflections at each stage. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore students' beliefs on self-efficacy and how the video-assisted reflection altered their ability to act on feedback. RESULTS The students' ability to self-assess and gauge their own performance improved significantly after undertaking the video-assisted reflection (p < 0.01). Furthermore, video-assisted reflection significantly increased the length of the student's reflections. In interviews, participants described multiple ways in which the video-assisted reflection improved their confidence and ability to act on feedback, highlighting a clear enhancement in self-efficacy.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of stress hyperglycaemia in acute pulmonary embolism, providing new insights into the presumed embolus size and localization, clinical parameters (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index, PESI), and in-hospital mortality. Design and Methods. Among a total of 95,454 patients referred to the Emergency Department of the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Centre between 2014 and 2016, all patients with acute pulmonary embolism were included into this observational cohort study. The study group consisted of 190 patients aged 25-96. Relevant patient history, clinical data, and laboratory findings were collected during the entire hospitalization period. Data were analyzed for the entire group of patients, as well as separately for patients without diabetes, using the Fisher exact test and logistic regression. Results: Analysis of embolus localization as an indirect parameter of embolus size showed that patients with stress hyperglycaemia more often had emboli located in proximal parts of the pulmonary circulation (i.e., main artery or lobar branches) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, stress hyperglycaemia correlated with PESI score and diabetes (p < 0.05) in the entire patient group. Stress hyperglycaemia showed independent association with in-hospital mortality in patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Stress hyperglycaemia in patients with acute pulmonary embolism is associated with embolus localization in larger arteries of the pulmonary circulation and higher PESI score and therefore could serve as an independent in-hospital mortality predictor.","output":"Stress Hyperglycaemia Indicates Embolus Size and Localization in Patients with Acute Pulmonary Embolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 14% COVID-19 patients, develop acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

However, there is no evidence for the expression of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles, which deliver neurotransmitter to synaptic cleft. The aim of this paper was to investigate the presence of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles purified from the rat brain and to study their possible involvement in vesicles life cycle. According to dynamic light scattering analysis, the antibody against extracellular domain (1-208) of &#945;7 nAChR subunit inhibited synaptic vesicles clustering. Sandwich ELISA with nAChR subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of &#945;4?2, &#945;7 and &#945;7?2nAChR subtypes in synaptic vesicles and showed that &#945;7 and ?2 nAChR subunits are co-localized with synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Pre-incubation with either &#945;7-selective agonist PNU282987 or nicotine did not affect synaptic vesicles clustering but delayed their Ca2+-dependent fusion with the plasma membranes. In contrast, nicotine but not PNU282987 stimulated acidification of isolated synaptic vesicles, indicating that &#945;4?2 but not &#945;7-containing nAChRs are involved in regulation of proton influx and neurotransmitter refilling. Treatment of rats with levetiracetam, a specific modulator of SV2A, increased the content of &#945;7 nAChRs in synaptic vesicles accompanied by increased clustering but decreased Ca2+-dependent fusion. These data for the first time demonstrate the presence of nAChRs in synaptic vesicles and suggest an active involvement of cholinergic regulation in neurotransmitter release.

Donning masks can play an important role in curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. AIM: To conclude if there is an effective mask for the population to wear in public that could easily be made during a medical face mask shortage using readily available materials. METHODS: We determined the effectiveness of readily available materials and models for making a face mask. The outcomes were compared with N95/FFP2/KN95 masks that entered the Netherlands in April-May 2020. Masks were tested to see if they filter a minimum of 35% of 0.3?m particles, are hydrophobic, seal on the face, are breathable, and can be washed. FINDINGS: Fourteen of the 25 (combinations of) materials filtered at least 35% of 0.3?m particles. Four of the materials proved hydrophobic, all commercially manufactured filters. Two models sealed the face. Twenty-two of the 25 materials were breathable at <0.7 mbar. None of the hydrophobic materials stayed intact after washing.

In order to identify and characterize individual trajectories, we defined and validated ten COVID-19 phenotypes from linked electronic health records (EHR) on a nationwide scale using an extensible framework. MethodsCohort study of 56.6 million people in England alive on 23/01/2020, followed until 31/05/2021, using eight linked national datasets spanning COVID-19 testing, vaccination, primary & secondary care and death registrations data. We defined ten COVID-19 phenotypes reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity using a combination of international clinical terminologies (e.g. SNOMED-CT, ICD-10) and bespoke data fields; positive test, primary care diagnosis, hospitalisation, critical care (four phenotypes), and death (three phenotypes). Using these phenotypes, we constructed patient trajectories illustrating the transition frequency and duration between phenotypes. Analyses were stratified by pandemic waves and vaccination status. FindingsWe identified 3,469,528 infected individuals (6.1%) with 8,825,738 recorded COVID-19 phenotypes. Of these, 364,260 (11%) were hospitalised and 140,908 (4%) died. Of those hospitalised, 38,072 (10%) were admitted to intensive care (ICU), 54,026 (15%) received non-invasive ventilation and 21,404 (6%) invasive ventilation. Amongst hospitalised patients, first wave mortality (30%) was higher than the second (23%) in non-ICU settings, but remained unchanged for ICU patients. The highest mortality was for patients receiving critical care outside of ICU in wave 1 (51%). 13,083 (9%) COVID-19 related deaths occurred without diagnoses on the death certificate, but within 30 days of a positive test while 10,403 (7%) of cases were identified from mortality data alone with no prior phenotypes recorded. We observed longer patient trajectories in the second pandemic wave compared to the first. InterpretationOur analyses illustrate the wide spectrum of severity that COVID-19 displays and significant differences in incidence, survival and pathways across pandemic waves. We provide an adaptable framework to answer questions of clinical and policy relevance; new variant impact, booster dose efficacy and a way of maximising existing data to understand individuals progression through disease states. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on October 14, 2021, for publications with the terms \\"COVID-19\\" or \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"severity\\", and \\"electronic health records\\" or \\"EHR\\" without date or language restrictions. Multiple studies explore factors associated with severity of COVID-19 infection, and model predictions of outcome for hospitalised patients. However, most work to date focused on isolated facets of the healthcare system, such as primary or secondary care only, was conducted in subpopulations (e.g. hospitalised patients) of limited sample size, and often utilized dichotomised outcomes (e.g. mortality or hospitalisation) ignoring the full spectrum of disease. We identified no studies which comprehensively detailed severity of infections while describing disease severity across pandemic waves, vaccination status, and patient trajectories. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study providing a comprehensive view of COVID-19 across pandemic waves using national data and focusing on severity, vaccination, and patient trajectories. Drawing on linked electronic health record (EHR) data on a national scale (56.6 million people alive and registered with GP in England), we describe key demographic factors, frequency of comorbidities, impact of the two main waves in England, and effect of full vaccination on COVID-19 severities. Additionally, we identify and describe patient trajectory networks which illustrate the main transition pathways of COVID-19 patients in the healthcare system. Finally, we provide reproducible COVID-19 phenotyping algorithms reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity i.e. positive tests, primary care diagnoses, hospitalisation, critical care treatments (e.g. ventilatory support) and mortality. Implications of all the available evidenceThe COVID-19 phenotypes and trajectory analysis framework outlined produce a reproducible, extensible and repurposable means to generate national-scale data to support critical policy decision making. By modelling patient trajectories as a series of interactions with healthcare systems, and linking these to demographic and outcome data, we provide a means to identify and prioritise care pathways associated with adverse outcomes and highlight healthcare system touch points which may act as tangible targets for intervention.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 trajectories from a nationwide linked electronic health record cohort of 56 million people: phenotypes, severity, waves & vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High quality bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy can be difficult to achieve in the inpatient setting. Hospitalized patients are at risk for extended hospital stays and low diagnostic yield due to inadequate bowel preparation. The Pure-Vu System is a novel device intended to fit over existing colonoscopes to improve intra-colonoscopy bowel preparation. The objective of the REDUCE study was to conduct the first inpatient study to evaluate optimization of bowel preparation quality following overnight preparation when using the Pure-Vu System during colonoscopy. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective feasibility study enrolled hospitalized subjects undergoing colonoscopy. Subjects recorded the clarity of their last bowel movement using a 5-point scale prior to colonoscopy. After one night of preparation, all enrolled subjects underwent colonoscopy utilizing the Pure-Vu System. The primary endpoint was improvement of colon cleanliness from baseline to post-cleansing with the Pure-Vu System as assessed by the improvement in Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). An exploratory analysis was conducted to assess whether the clarity of the last bowel movement could predict inadequate bowel preparation. RESULTS: Ninety-four subjects were included. BBPS analyses showed significant improvements in bowel preparation quality across all evaluable colon segments after cleansing with Pure-Vu, including left colon (1.74 vs 2.89; p < 0.0001), transverse colon (1.74 vs 2.91; p < 0.0001), and the right colon (1.41 vs 2.88; p < 0.0001). Prior to Pure-Vu, adequate cleansing (BBPS scores of  2) were reported in 60%, 62%, and 47% for the left colon, transverse colon, and right colon segments, respectively. After intra-colonoscopy cleansing with the Pure-Vu System, adequate colon preparation was reported in 100%, 99%, and 97% of the left colon, transverse colon, and right colon segments, respectively. Subjects with lower bowel movement clarity scores were more likely to have inadequate bowel preparation prior to cleansing with Pure-Vu. CONCLUSIONS: In this feasibility study, the Pure-Vu System appears to be effective in significantly improving bowel preparation quality in hospitalized subjects undergoing colonoscopy. Clarity of last bowel movement may be useful indicator in predicting poor bowel preparation.

Our indicator is based on the chronology of stage-by-stage progress of individual vaccines and related news. We construct a general equilibrium regime-switching model of repeated pandemics and stages of vaccine progress wherein the representative agent withdraws labor and alters consumption endogenously to mitigate health risk. The value of a cure in the resulting asset-pricing framework is intimately linked to the relative labor supply across states. The observed stock market response to vaccine progress serves to identify this quantity, allowing us to use the model to estimate the economywide welfare gain that would be attributable to a cure. In our estimation, and with standard preference parameters, the value of the ability to end the pandemic is worth 5-15% of total wealth. This value rises substantially when there is uncertainty about the frequency and duration of pandemics. Agents place almost as much value on the ability to resolve the uncertainty as they do on the value of the cure itself. This effect is stronger - not weaker - when agents have a preference for later resolution of uncertainty.

We conducted an online survey using a questionnaire with a simple random sampling technique and we received 474 responses. Results: In this study, numerous psychological concerns were reported. The study is limited to university students, which may affect the generalizability of the research. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a need to build awareness of the mental health implications of the pandemic for university students.","output":"Socio-psychological impact on Bangladeshi students during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Limited information is available regarding barriers to breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown. Study design This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18 2020, in the COVID-19 hotspot in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (-15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03  4.88 vs. 8.03  4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56 0.65 vs. 0.18 0.38, p<0.001) and depression (0.62 0.60 vs. 0.39 0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019). Conclusion This study indicates that hospital containment measures adopted during lockdown in the hotspot COVID-19 epidemic area of Northeastern Italy have a detrimental effect on maternal emotions and on breastfeeding exclusivity practices.","output":"Infant feeding initiation practices in the context of COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized transmissible viral infection with high virulence and case fatality rates for which there is no currently defined primary treatment or prophylaxis.

Recent studies indicate that eviction, which may affect a larger segment of the population than other forms of housing instability, is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, these studies evaluate eviction across large areas, such as counties, so it remains unclear whether these patterns extend to individual-level pregnancy outcomes. METHODS We used data on a cohort of all singleton live births at a single Chicago hospital between March 2008 and March 2018 to investigate the associations between block-group eviction rates and individual adverse pregnancy outcomes. Eviction data were obtained from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate associations and account for correlations among individuals living in the same block groups. RESULTS Individuals living in block groups in the highest quartile for eviction filing rate were 1.17 times as likely to deliver preterm (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.27) and 1.13 times as likely to deliver a small for gestational age infant (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) as compared with individuals living in block groups in the lowest quartile. Further, tests for linear trend indicated that for each quartile increase in eviction filing rate, there was a corresponding increase in odds of adverse outcomes (p<0.05). Results were strongest in magnitude for those with low neighbourhood and individual socioeconomic status, who are most likely to be renters and affected by local eviction policies. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that individuals living in block groups with higher eviction rates are more likely to deliver preterm. Future research should explore associations of individual experience with eviction on adverse pregnancy outcomes and examine whether policies to improve tenant protections also impact pregnancy outcomes.","output":"Living in a block group with a higher eviction rate is associated with increased odds of preterm delivery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the most common causes of death worldwide with a higher frequency especially in the young.

However during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, public and private insurers rapidly expanded access to telehealth in order to reduce exposure and avoid transmission. It is unknown whether telehealth will become a more regular substitute for in-person care beyond the pandemic. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to provide evidence on the value of telehealth by comparing the productivity of physicians and other specialized clinicians who provide telehealth with the productivity of those who do not. RESEARCH DESIGN We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 17,705 unique providers in the areas of internal medicine, cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, psychology, and optometry practicing in the US veterans affairs health care system during the period 2015 to 2018. For each year, we measured individual providers productivity by the total number of relative value units (RVUs) per full-time equivalent (FTE). We estimated the impact of providing telehealth on RVUs/FTE using fixed effects regression models estimated on a panel dataset of 58,873 provider-year observations and controlling for provider and patient characteristics. RESULTS Overall provider productivity increased in veterans affairs over the period, particularly in cardiology and dermatology. Providers of telehealth had above average productivity by 124 RVUs/FTE, or 4% of average total provider productivity. For the highest quartile of telehealth providers, average productivity was 188 RVUs/FTE higher than productivity of other providers.

Like many other countries, Iran is struggling with the current situation. In this article, we aim to share our perspectives on confronting obstacles mentioned above using appropriate hospital protocols during the COVID-19 crisis. We investigated and compared the number of referred patients to the emergency room, elective, and emergent orthopedic operations in our hospital, along with a number of residents and faculty participants in the morning reports and virtual classes before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in our hospital. The number of referred patients to the emergency room was significantly reduced; the number of orthopedic operations was also decreased to almost zero in March 2020. Meanwhile, we managed to dismiss our residents and reduce the number of in-hospital morning reports and conferences. Instead, we designed virtual classes, and the number of participants in our virtual classes grew to almost two-third of the whole participant. We also managed to fortify our virtual office system to reduce the number of in-hospital visits. Since our hospital had become a leading center for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and the number of referred trauma patients, elective, and trauma operations, along with educational activities, was reduced. There was also a significant concern about the management of elective, trauma, and post-operative patients in this era. Orthopedic faculty members needed to react to the current situation cautiously. We were able to manage the situation with consideration of our educational path, along with the management of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the use of communication technologies and specific protocols to overcome the obstacles mentioned above.

Nevertheless, the early talent identification of these riders largely remains a subjective assessment. Therefore, an analytical system which automatically detects talented riders based on their freely available youth results should be installed. However, such a system cannot be copied directly from related fields, as large distinctions are observed between cycling and other sports. The aim of this paper is to develop such a data analytical system, which leverages the unique features of each race and thereby focusses on feature engineering, data quality, and visualization. To facilitate the deployment of prediction algorithms in situations without complete cases, we propose an adaptation to the k-nearest neighbours imputation algorithm which uses expert knowledge. Overall, our proposed method correlates strongly with eventual rider performance and can aid scouts in targeting young talents. On top of that, we introduce several model interpretation tools to give insight into which current starting professional riders are expected to perform well and why.","output":"Predicting the next Poga?ar: a data analytical approach to detect young professional cycling talents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhizoma Polygonati (Chinese name asƾ, pinyin as huangjing), as medicine and food homology of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been recently applied for the complex prescriptions of alternative medicine for treatment of COVID-19 but the mechanisms are largely unclear Here using public database search and filtering the potential chemical compound based drug targets withCOVID-19 targets mapped, the list of data were provided and suggested pharmacokinetic tolerating dose of selected natural compounds were further collected from database The data provided is the supplementary as a reference showing the intersections of Rhizoma Polygonati druggable targets of lists from current database and potentially related ones targeting COVID-19","output":"Dataset of Potential Rhizoma Polygonati Compound-Druggable Targets and Partial Pharmacokinetics for Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disproportionate effects of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on many Canadian Aboriginal communities have drawn attention to the vulnerability of these communities in terms of health outcomes in the face of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.

There is limited empirical research that examines the impact of these orders. We aimed to rapidly ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities (obtaining food, essential medications and childcare); and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of shelter-in-place orders for seven counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. METHODS: We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 C April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in the U.S. RESULTS: The percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0).

HLH is characterized by uncontrolled activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages that can lead to a cytokine storm. The diagnosis of HLH is often challenging due to the diverse clinical manifestations and the presence of several diagnostic mimics. The prognosis is generally poor, warranting rapid diagnosis and aggressive management. OBJECTIVE.-: To provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HLH. DATA SOURCES.-: Peer-reviewed literature. CONCLUSIONS.-: HLH is a condition where a complete understanding of the pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and proper management has an important role in determining patient outcome. Genetic mutations causing impairment in the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells have been identified as the root cause of familial HLH; however, the specific pathogenesis of acquired HLH is unclear. The HLH-2004 protocol used in the diagnosis of HLH was originally developed for the pediatric population. The HLH-2004 protocol still forms the basis of the diagnosis of HLH in adults, although its use in adults has not been formally validated yet. Treatment of HLH is primarily based on the HLH-94 protocol, which involves suppressing the inflammatory response, but the treatment needs to be modified in adults depending on the underlying cause and comorbidities.","output":"Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chemical cross-linking was used to create nanocomposite hydrogels made up of gelatin (G) and borosilicate bioactive glass (BBG) with different content (0, 3, and 5 wt.%).

stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America STUDY DESIGN: This observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects RESULTS: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%] Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes CONCLUSIONS: Although pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were

Of all the 13 children, 9(69%) were from family clusters of COVID-19 and 4(31%) had unknown sources of infection The mean time from exposure to onset was 6 8 days (range: 2-13 days) in 9 children with a definite history of exposure There were 6 symptomatic children with the main manifestations of fever, cough, weakness, and myalgia, and the mean time from onset to hospitalization was 9 2 days Of all the 13 children, 7(54%) were asymptomatic with positive nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) There were 4 children (31%) with abnormal lung CT findings, mainly patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lung field, and 6 children (46%) had no symptoms with normal lung CT findings All children had normal routine blood test results and C-reactive protein levels Eight children underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests at least once, among whom 6 had negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM but positive IgG, and 2 underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests twice and had negative results Of all the 13 children, 11(85%) had negative results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests during hospitalization and were discharged, and 2(15%) had positive results of four SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and were transferred to another hospital and lost to follow-up Among the 11 children who were followed up, 1 had positive results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests at the isolation point, and 10 had negative results The mean hospital stay was 10 9 days for the 13 children Eleven children recovered during follow-up, with good living and learning conditions CONCLUSIONS: Children with mild COVID-19 often have an uncertain history of exposure and may not have any clinical symptoms Etiological diagnosis is more important than clinical diagnosis The disappearance of clinical manifestations may not parallel with the result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test SARS-CoV-2 has a long detoxification time, and there may be recurrent cases of SARS-CoV-2

outbreak in the Top 5 affected countries in the world, namely the USA, India, Brazil, France, and Russia. The officially confirmed cases and death due to COVID-19 from the day of the official confirmation to June 30, 2021 are considered for each country. Primarily, we use the data to make a comparison between the cumulative cases and deaths due to COVID-19 among these five different countries. This analysis allows us to infer the key parameters associated with the dynamics of the disease for these five different countries. For example, the analysis reveals that the infection rate is much higher in the USA, Brazil, and France compared to that of India and Russia, while the recovery rate is found almost the same for these countries. Further, the death rate is measured higher in Brazil as opposed to India, where it is found much lower among the remaining countries. We then use the SEIART compartmental model to characterize the first and second waves of these countries, as well as to investigate and identify the influential model parameters and nature of the virus transmissibility in respective countries. Besides estimating the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) for these countries, we also use the model to predict the peak size and the time occurring peak in respective countries. The analysis demonstrates that COVID-19 was observed to be much more infectious in the second wave than the first wave in all countries except France. The results also demonstrate that the epidemic took off very quickly in the USA, India, and Brazil compared to two other countries considered in this study. Furthermore, the prediction of the epidemic peak size and time produced by our model provides a very good agreement with the officially confirmed cases data for all countries expect Brazil.","output":"Data analysis and prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in the first and second waves for top 5 affected countries in the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The atmospheric pressure that decreases with altitude affects lung physiology.

It asks the question, can Public Health advance food security? If so, how, and what are its limitations? METHODS: This policy analysis merges findings from 38 key informant interviews conducted with government and civil society stakeholders involved in the development of food security initiatives, along with an examination of relevant documents. The Population Health Template is used to delineate and analyze Public Health roles in food security. RESULTS: Public Health was able to advance food security in some ways, such as the adoption of food security as a core public health program. Public Healths leadership role in food security is constrained by a restricted mandate, limited ability to collaborate across a wide range of sectors and levels, as well as internal conflict within Public Health between Food Security and Food Protection programs. CONCLUSIONS: Public Health has a role in advancing food security, but it also faces limitations. As the limitations are primarily systemic and institutional, recommendations to overcome them are not simple but, rather, require movement toward embracing the determinants of health and regulatory pluralism. The results also suggest that the historic role of Public Health in food security remains salient today.","output":"Exploring Public Healths roles and limitations in advancing food security in British Columbia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, the seventh member of the Coronaviridae named severe acute respiratory coronavirus II (or COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. It could rapidly turn into a global pandemic. Therefore, searching for a natural/ novel therapy is urgently essential to prevent disease distribution. Based on the principle of cross-kingdom interaction, plants are a candidate as a potential source of exogenous miRNAs that can efficiently affect the host cell gene expression by promote target mRNA degradation or repress protein translation, and, or virus RNA translation/replication. The possibility of taking up the diet-derived plant-originated/artificially miRNA(s) in addition to their biological role in the host provides a pivotal clue for the study of synthesized/artificially expressed active therapeutic plant-originated miRNA(s) to promote antiviral activity. In this study, plant miRNAs, which can potentially interact with the COVID-19 genome within the 3-UTR region and prompt antiviral function, were searched using bioinformatics approaches. RNAHybrid, RNA22, and STarMir miRNA/target detection tools were served for the possible plant miRNA/target recognition on the 3-UTR flanking region of the COVID-19 genome by different algorithms. The RNAHybrid algorithm resulted in 63 plant miRNAs having hybridization energy with less or equal to -25 kcal/mol. They interact with diverse classes of miRNA/target binding patterns. However, each RNA22 and STarMir tools identified eight probable miRNA/target interaction candidates, in which pvu-miR159a.2 and sbi-miR5387b detected by both the RNA22 and STarMir tools at the same position. For us, they are suitable plant-derived miRNA candidates, which have the great chance of targeting the COVID-19 genome in the 3-UTR region in vitro to induce the virus degradation and translational repression and for antiviral miRNA-based therapies without any side effects in vivo .","output":"Plant Microrna Potential in Targeting COVID-19 Genome Offering Efficient Antiviral Mirna-based Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the year coming to a close, I couldnt help but reflect on our experiences in 2020 and 2021.

RESULTS: The databases CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM were searched from inception until July 2018. Two appropriately-trained reviewers screened and extracted articles independently. The ARRIVE guidelines were used to assess the quality of the published reports of animal experiments. The compliance rate of every item was analyzed relative to their date of publication. A total of 4342 studies were included, of which 73.0% had been cited &#8804;5 times. Only 29.0% (1261/4342) were published in journals listed in the Chinese Science Citation Database. The results indicate that the compliance rate of approximately half of the sub-items (51.3%, 20/39) was less than 50%, of which 65.0% (13/20) was even less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The reporting quality of animal experiments in Chinese journals is not at a high level. Following publication of the ARRIVE guidelines in 2010, the compliance rate of the majority of its requirements has improved to some extent. However, less attention has been paid to the ethics and welfare of experimental animals, and a number of specific items in the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections continue to not be reported in sufficient detail. Therefore, it is necessary to popularize the ARRIVE guidelines, advocate researchers to adhere to them in the future, and in particular promote the use of the guidelines in specialized journals in order that the design, implementation, and reporting of animal experiments is promoted, to ultimately improve their quality.","output":"Quality of interventional animal experiments in Chinese journals: compliance with ARRIVE guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic secondary to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is leading to unprecedented global morbidity and mortality With a bewildering array of complications, renal involvement in various forms is common, including serum electrolyte derangements Hypokalaemia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 was common in a reported Chinese cohort Here we review the emerging evidence on hypokalaemia and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the potential pathophysiological mechanisms based on early clinical and histopathological data and important clinical implications Mechanisms of hypokalaemia are multifactorial and so the electrolyte disturbance can be difficult to avoid We provide further support to the theory of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) activation, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implicating RAS involvement and highlight the importance of calculating the transtubular potassium gradient to identify those at risk of hypokalaemia and its complications","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and hypokalaemia: evidence and implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Individual participant data meta-analyses (IPD-MAs) include the raw data from relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and involve secondary analyses of the data. Performed since the late 1990s, ~50 such meta-analyses have been carried out in psychiatry, mostly in the field of treatment. IPD-MAs are particularly relevant for three objectives: (1) evaluation of the average effect of an intervention by combining effects from all included trials, (2) evaluation of the heterogeneity of an intervention effect and sub-group analyses to approach personalised psychiatry, (3) mediation analysis or surrogacy evaluation to replace a clinical (final) endpoint for the evaluation of new treatments with intermediate or surrogate endpoints. The objective is to describe the interest and the steps of an IPD-MA method applied to the field of psychiatric therapeutic research. Method: The method is described in three steps. First, the identification of the relevant trials with an explicit description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the RCT to be incorporated in the IPD-MA and a definition of the intervention, the population, the context and the relevant points (outcomes or moderators). Second, the data management with the standardisation of collected variables and the evaluation and the assessment of the risk-of-bias for each included trial and of the global risk. Third, the statistical analyses and their interpretations, depending on the objective of the meta-analysis. All steps are illustrated with examples in psychiatry for treatment issues, excluding study protocols. Conclusion: The meta-analysis of individual patient data is challenging. Only strong collaborations between all stakeholders can make such a process efficient. An ecosystem that includes all stakeholders (questions of interest prioritised by the community, funders, trialists, journal editors, institutions, ) is required.

Recent evidence on effectiveness of primary care interventions has attracted renewed calls for their implementation. This review aims to synthesize evidence pertaining to primary care interventions on these two diseases, evaluated and tested in LMICs. METHODS Two reviewers conducted an electronic search of three databases (Pubmed, EMBASE and Web of Science) and screened for eligible articles. Interventions covering health promotion, prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation activities at the PHC or community level were included. Studies published in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, from January 2007 to January 2017, were included. Key extraction variables included the 12 criteria identified by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework (ICCCF) was used to guide analysis and reporting of results. RESULTS 198 articles were analyzed. The strategies focused on healthcare service organization (76.5%), community level (9.7 %), creating a positive policy environment (3.6%) and strategies covering multiple domains (10.2%). Studies included related to the following topics: description or testing of interventions (n=81; 41.3%), implementation or evaluation projects (n=42; 21.4%), quality improvement initiatives (n=15; 7.7%), screening and prevention efforts (n=26; 13.2%), management of HTN or DM (n=13; 6.6%), integrated health services (n=10; 5.1%), knowledge and attitude surveys (n=5; 2.5%), cost-effective lab tests (n=2; 1%) and policy making efforts (n=2; 1%). Most studies reported interventions by non-specialists (n=86; 43.4%) and multidisciplinary teams (n=49; 25.5%). CONCLUSION Only 198 articles were found over a 10 year period which demonstrates the limited published research on highly prevalent diseases in LMIC. This review shows the variety and complexity of approaches that have been tested to address HTN and DM in LMICs and highlights the elements of interventions needed to be addressed in order to strengthen delivery of care. Most studies reported little information regarding implementation processes to allow replication. Given the need for multi-component complex interventions, study designs and evaluation techniques will need to be adapted by including process evaluations versus simply effectiveness or outcome evaluations.","output":"Interventions targeting hypertension and diabetes mellitus at community and primary healthcare level in low- and middle-income countries:a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Good government requires cooperation between the politicians who make policy and the bureaucrats who implement it \\"YOU CAN'T BULLSHIT A VIRUS\\": THE TRUMP COALITION'S FAILED PANDEMIC RESPONSE The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic infected almost 20 million Americans, killed over 300,000, and devasted the U S economy and society (https://www nature com/articles/d41586-020-02800-9) CONCLUSION The Trump coalition's failed policy response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has cost more American lives than any war in history [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Public Integrity is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Neutral Professionalism: Donald E.

RESULTS: Ninety-Seven patients had satisfactory responses. Eighty-six patients were symptomatic (41 at presentation, and 45 during admission). Among those patients, 59.3% had cough, 52.3% sore throat and 48.8% fever. The most common initial symptom was sore throat. Shortness of breath and smell/taste dysfunction were significantly higher in females. Surprisingly, shortness of breath was more common in non-smokers.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. RESULTS: The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]).

We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 and its components interact with the biofilms generated by commensal bacteria, which may contribute to co-infections. This study employed crystal violet staining and particle-tracking microrheology to characterize the formation of biofilms by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus that commonly cause secondary bacterial pneumonia. Microrheology analyses suggested that these biofilms were inhomogeneous soft solids, consistent with their dynamic characteristics. Biofilm formation by both bacteria was significantly inhibited by co-incubation with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit and both S1 + S2 subunits, but not with S2 extracellular domain nor nucleocapsid protein. Addition of spike S1 and S2 antibodies to spike protein could partially restore bacterial biofilm production. Furthermore, biofilm formation in vitro was also compromised by live murine hepatitis virus, a related beta-coronavirus. Supporting data from LC-MS-based proteomics of spikeCbiofilm interactions revealed differential expression of proteins involved in quorum sensing and biofilm maturation, such as the AI-2E family transporter and LuxS, a key enzyme for AI-2 biosynthesis. Our findings suggest that these opportunistic pathogens may egress from biofilms to resume a more virulent planktonic lifestyle during coronavirus infections. The dispersion of pathogens from biofilms may culminate in potentially severe secondary infections with poor prognosis. Further detailed investigations are warranted to establish bacterial biofilms as risk factors for secondary pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Mouse Coronavirus Inhibit Biofilm Formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Open-source data from online news reports and informal sources may provide information about outbreaks before official notification. This study aims to evaluate the use of open-source data from the epidemic observatory, EpiWATCH, to identify the early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause as a proxy for COVID-19 in Indonesia. Methods: Using open-source data on pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia between 1 November 2019 and 31 March 2020 (extracted from EpiWATCH, an open-source epidemic observatory), a descriptive analysis was performed to identify the trend of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia before official notification of COVID-19 cases. Results: A rise in reports of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Indonesia, starting from late January 2020. There were 304 reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, 30 of which occurred before the identification of the first COVID-19 cases on 2 March 2020. The early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia may indicate possible unrecognized circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before official detection. Discussion: Open-source data may provide rapid, unvalidated information for early detection of outbreaks. Although unvalidated, such information may be used to supplement or trigger investigation and testing. As EpiWATCH sources global information, this methodology can be repeated for other countries within the Western Pacific Region, and for other diseases.","output":"Using open-source intelligence to identify early signals of COVID-19 in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We report our experience and learning curve in single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) using an internal anchored retraction system. METHODS Usefulness of the retraction system was analysed in 18 SPLC. The first eight, the following ten SPLC and 20 consecutive four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies (4PLC) were compared. Duration of operation, burns on nontarget tissue and gallbladder perforations were assessed by reviewing videotapes recorded during the procedures. RESULTS Use of the retraction system failed in three out of five patients (60%) with intraoperative signs of chronic inflammation and in one out of 13 (7.1%) without such signs (p = 0.0441). Median operation time was 90 (45-120) in the first eight and 55 (40-180) minutes in the following ten SPLC (p = 0.0361). Whereas the first eight SPLC lasted longer compared to 4PLC (70 (40-140) minutes, p = 0.0435) the difference disappeared after eight procedures (p = 0.2076). Median number of burns to nontarget tissue was seven (1-16) in the first eight and one (0-8) in the following ten SPLC (p = 0.0049). There was no difference in perforation of the gallbladder.

Methods This cross-sectional study gathered 2018 adolescents throughout Indonesia from April 22nd-28th 2020. The questionnaire was spread through social media and included Kessler-10 Psychological Distress scale and closed-ended questions about the risk and protective factors. The results were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Logistic Regression. Results The participants were mostly males (91.8%) with a median age of 19. The results showed 54.1% experienced varying degrees of distress. All variables were significantly related with psychological distress during Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis test. The logistic regression analysis showed maintaining or improving dietary pattern and sleep quality was found to be protective against psychological distress (OR = 0.497,95%CI = 0.34C0.725 and OR = 0.515,95%CI = 0.372C0.714, respectively), while others were risk factors, i.e.: Not having a confidant (OR = 1.539,95%CI = 1.226C1.931), frequent argument with parents (OR = 1.735,95%CI = 1.343C2.24), feeling worried (OR = 2.364, 95%CI1.528-3.656), chronic diseases (OR = 2.601,95%CI = 1.468C4.606), and mental illnesses (OR = 9.866,95%CI = 3.855C25.249).

The objective of the current study, therefore, was to model the association between cow-level metabolic indicators and conceptus growth during early pregnancy (day 33-45 after AI) and to determine if an association (if present) is large enough to cause pregnancy loss. Metabolic indicators included milk production, changes in body weight and body condition score, parity, and concentrations of circulating hormones and metabolites (glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, growth hormone, IGF1, progesterone, and pregnancy-associated glycoproteins). One-hundred cows were enrolled. Cows that became pregnant with single conceptus pregnancies (n=53) weighed more (P<0.007) and had fewer uterine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (uterine health indicator; P<0.051) compared with cows that failed to become pregnant. The embryo and amniotic vesicle were measured by using ultrasound on day 33, 35, 38, 40, 42, and 45 of pregnancy. Most of the cow-level indicators that were included in the model of conceptus growth failed to achieve statistical significance. Day of pregnancy had the largest effect on conceptus growth (size and cross-sectional area of the embryo and amniotic vesicle; P<0.001). There were effects of sex of fetus (male fetuses larger than female), insulin (negative association), and body weigh change (positive association) on embryo length and cross-sectional area but these effects were small when compared with the range in conceptus length or area that we observed. The conclusion was that the capacity of the cow to become pregnant was associated with body weight and uterine health but we failed to find a large association with metabolic status on conceptus growth from day 33 to 45 of pregnancy in lactating dairy cows.","output":"Growth of the conceptus from day 33 to 45 of pregnancy is minimally associated with concurrent hormonal or metabolic status in postpartum dairy cows."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine the process of implementing online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accordingly, it is a vital process to detect positive cases at an early stage for treatment and controlling the disease from spreading. Several medical tests had been applied for COVID-19 detection in certain injuries, but with limited efficiency. In this study, a new COVID-19 diagnosis strategy called Feature Correlated Na?ve Bayes (FCNB) has been introduced. The FCNB consists of four phases, which are; Feature Selection Phase (FSP), Feature Clustering Phase (FCP), Master Feature Weighting Phase (MFWP), and Feature Correlated Na?ve Bayes Phase (FCNBP). The FSP selects only the most effective features among the extracted features from laboratory tests for both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 people by using the Genetic Algorithm as a wrapper method. The FCP constructs many clusters of features based on the selected features from FSP by using a novel clustering technique. These clusters of features are called Master Features (MFs) in which each MF contains a set of dependent features. The MFWP assigns a weight value to each MF by using a new weight calculation method. The FCNBP is used to classify patients based on the weighted Na?ve Bayes algorithm with many modifications as the correlation between features. The proposed FCNB strategy has been compared to recent competitive techniques. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the FCNB strategy in which it outperforms recent competitive techniques because it achieves the maximum (99%) detection accuracy.","output":"Accurate detection of Covid-19 patients based on Feature Correlated Na?ve Bayes (FCNB) classification strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is a degradative mechanism mainly involved in the recycling and turnover of cytoplasmic constituents from eukaryotic cells.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a case series of a broad-spectrum of oral surgeries in a COVID-19 pandemic area. Data collection included patient age, type of procedure performed, and COVID-19 status of staff and patients. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Between February 21 and April 23, 2020, 1471 patients were treated in the outpatient clinic (n=1404) and under general anesthesia (n=67). All procedures were carried out under a strict empiric protective protocol that included patient screening, personal protective equipment allocation protocol, frequent staff testing, and patient testing before general anesthesia. Treatments included emergency and urgent elective procedures. Only one staff member was confirmed positive for COVID-19 during routine weekly testing, and an independent epidemiologic investigation suggested he was likely infected outside of hospital facilities.

We aimed to investigate the role of pre- and peri-natal factors as potential risk factors for the development of IBD in a population with a follow-up of 50 years. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study, reporting IBD incidence among individuals born in 1964-76, for whom pre and perinatal exposures were reported as part of the Jerusalem Perinatal Study (JPS), by linking them to the database of the epidemiology group of the Israeli IBD Research Nucleus (epi-IIRN), including all IBD patients in Israel since 2005 and their matched controls. RESULTS: We identified 2,789 individuals within the epi-IIRN cohort who were also included in the JPS cohort (n=90,079): 746 IBD patients (405 with Crohn's disease [CD] and 341 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 2,043 non-IBD controls. Those with \\"Non-western\\" family origin had decreased odds of developing CD and UC. High socioeconomic status was associated with CD but not UC. Low birth weight ( 2500g) occurred less frequently in IBD cases compared to controls, especially in UC patients, showing a protective effect. Being the first born was associated with CD, and having older siblings lowered the odds of developing CD, decreasing 7% with each additional sibling. Smoking and breastfeeding were available for a subset of individuals, but neither was associated with IBD development. CONCLUSION: This population-based study identifies several pre and perinatal variables as predictors of IBD development.

The study also brings new insight into five leadership practices and behaviors that help exercise entrepreneurial resiliency: personal and business experience of crises, positive mindset, personal faith, learning and leading, and relationships.","output":"Flexing the Leadership Muscle: An International Study of Entrepreneurial Resilience in Rural Communities During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Pseudobulbar palsy (PBP) is characterized by supranuclear lesions in the corticobulbar pathway. Neoplasia, inflammatory, demyelinating, and stroke are possible etiologies of this disorder. Case report We report an elderly female who presented with dysarthria. She was dysarthric with a hypernasal voice, no apraxia or aphasia was observed. Tongue movements were slow with limited amplitude. Her soft palate dropped bilaterally; gag reflex was present. Also, she reported swallowing difficulty and choking with her saliva. Bilateral vertical and horizontal gaze were intact to either voluntary or oculocephalic movements. A cranial CT scan was suggestive of artery of Percheron (AOP) infarction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hypersignal on diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images and hyposignal on apparent diffusion coefficient in both thalami. CT angiography scan revealed an AOP originating from the left posterior cerebral artery. The swallowing study with a videofluoroscopic demonstrated oral and pharyngeal phases with severe dysfunction. Conclusion To the authors' knowledge, there are two cases of individuals with artery of Percheron infarction who developed PBP associated with other clinical syndromes. Still, isolated PBP following infarction of Percheron's artery was not reported. We hypothesized that the PBP may have occurred because of the existence of vascular territory variations in the perforating arteries that arise from the AOP.","output":"Isolated acute pseudobulbar palsy with infarction of artery of percheron: case report and literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians has developed a guideline for primary care practitioners to assist with safe return of patients to physical activity after COVID-19.","output":"Life after COVID-19: The importance of a safe return to physical activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lutilisation de virus oncolytiques combine  limmunothrapie (tel que le T-VEC) est en passe de devenir une stratgie majeure en oncologie.

Both vitamin D and K have been proposed as potential modulators of this process. Methods We assessed vitamin D and K status by measuring circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and desphospho-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla-Protein (dp-ucMGP), respectively in 135 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to inflammatory response, elastic fiber degradation and clinical outcomes. Results Comparing good and poor disease outcomes of COVID-19 patients, vitamin 25(OH)D levels were not significantly different. IL-6 levels, however, were significantly higher in patients with poor outcome, compared to patients with good outcome (30.3 vs. 153.0 pg/mL;p < 0.0001). Dp-ucMGP levels as biomarker of extrahepatic vitamin K status was associated with IL-6 levels (r = 0.35;p < 0.0001). In contrast, 25(OH)D levels were only borderline statistically significant correlated with IL-6 (r = ?0.14;p <0.050). A significant association was also found between IL-6 and elastic fiber degradation. Contrary to vitamin K status, 25(OH)D did not correlate with elastic fiber degradation. Conclusions Dp-ucMGP associates with IL-6 as a central component of the destructive inflammatory processes in COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the consequences of interrupting invasive procedures in patients with chronic cardiac diseases due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. METHODS The study population is comprised of 2,158 patients that were pending on elective cardiac invasive procedures in 37 hospitals in Spain on the 14th of March 2020, when a state of alarm and subsequent lockdown was declared in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients were followed-up until April 31th. RESULTS Out of the 2,158 patients, 36 (1.7%) died. Mortality was significantly higher in patients pending on structural procedures (4.5% vs. 0.8%, respectively; p < .001), in those >80 year-old (5.1% vs. 0.7%, p < .001), and in presence of diabetes (2.4% vs. 1.3%, p = .057), hypertension (2.0% vs. 0.6%, p = .014), hypercholesterolemia (2.0% vs. 0.9%, p = .036), chronic renal failure (6.0% vs. 1.2%, p < .001), NYHA > II (3.8% vs. 1.2%, p = .001), and CCS > II (4.2% vs. 1.4%, p = .013), whereas was it was significantly lower in smokers (0.5% vs. 1.9%, p = .013).

While FCoV and FCV belong to two distinct virus families, the Coronaviridae and the Caliciviridae, respectively, they share a dependence on viral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) for their replication. Since 3CLpro is functionally and structurally conserved among these viruses and essential for viral replication, 3CLpro is considered a potential target for the design of antiviral drugs with broad-spectrum activities against these distinct and highly important viral infections. However, small-molecule inhibitors against the 3CLpro enzymes of FCoV and FCV have not been previously identified. In this study, derivatives of peptidyl compounds targeting 3CLpro were synthesized and evaluated for their activities against FCoV and FCV. The structures of compounds that showed potent dual antiviral activities with a wide margin of safety were identified and are discussed. Furthermore, the in vivo efficacy of 3CLpro inhibitors was evaluated using a mouse model of coronavirus infection. Intraperitoneal administration of two 3CLpro inhibitors in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus A59, a hepatotropic coronavirus, resulted in significant reductions in virus titers and pathological lesions in the liver compared to the findings for the controls. These results suggest that the series of 3CLpro inhibitors described here may have the potential to be further developed as therapeutic agents against these important viruses in domestic and wild cats. This study provides important insights into the structure and function relationships of 3CLpro for the design of antiviral drugs with broader antiviral activities. IMPORTANCE Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is the leading cause of death in young cats, and virulent, systemic feline calicivirus (vs-FCV) causes a highly fatal disease in cats for which no preventive or therapeutic measure is available. The genomes of these distinct viruses, which belong to different virus families, encode a structurally and functionally conserved 3C-like protease (3CLpro) which is a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral drug development. However, no studies have previously reported a structural platform for the design of antiviral drugs with activities against these viruses or on the efficacy of 3CLpro inhibitors against coronavirus infection in experimental animals. In this study, we explored the structure-activity relationships of the derivatives of 3CLpro inhibitors and identified inhibitors with potent dual activities against these viruses. In addition, the efficacy of the 3CLpro inhibitors was demonstrated in mice infected with a murine coronavirus. Overall, our study provides the first insight into a structural platform for anti-FIPV and anti-FCV drug development.","output":"Broad-spectrum inhibitors against 3C-like proteases of feline coronaviruses and feline caliciviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Europe has experienced a large COVID-19 wave caused by the Delta variant in winter 2021/22.

We describe prescribing practices in South Africas private health sector, where an estimated third of people with TB symptoms first seek care. METHODS: Sixteen standardised patients (SPs) presented one of three cases during unannounced visits to private general practitioners (GPs) in Durban and Cape Town: TB symptoms, HIV-positive; TB symptoms, a positive molecular test for TB, HIV-negative; and TB symptoms, history of incomplete TB treatment, HIV-positive. Prescribing practices were recorded in standardised exit interviews and analysed based on their potential to contribute to negative outcomes, including increased healthcare expenditures, antibiotic overuse or misuse, and TB diagnostic delay. Factors associated with antibiotic use were assessed using Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator. RESULTS: Between August 2018 and July 2019, 511 SP visits were completed with 212 GPs. In 88.5% (95% CI 85.2% to 91.1%) of visits, at least one medicine (median 3) was dispensed or prescribed and most (93%) were directly dispensed. Antibiotics, which can contribute to TB diagnostic delay, were the most common medicine (76.5%, 95% CI 71.7% to 80.7% of all visits). A majority (86.1%, 95% CI 82.9% to 88.5%) belonged to the WHO Access group; fluoroquinolones made up 8.8% (95% CI 6.3% to 12.3%). Factors associated with antibiotic use included if the SP was asked to follow-up if symptoms persisted (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and if the SP presented as HIV-positive (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23). An injection was offered in 31.9% (95% CI 27.0% to 37.2%) of visits; 92% were unexplained. Most (61.8%, 95% CI 60.2% to 63.3%) medicines were not listed on the South African Primary Healthcare Essential Medicines List.

Their potential impact is particularly germane to the biology of pregnancy and perinatal medicine, where limited improvement in health outcomes for women and children has remained a global challenge. We assembled a group of experts to establish a Pregnancy Think Tank to discuss a broad spectrum of major gestational disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes that impact maternal-infant lifelong health and that should serve as targets for leveraging the many recent advances. This report reflects avenues for future impact that hold great potential in three major areas: developmental genomics, including the application of methodologies designed to bridge genotypes, physiology and diseases addressing vexing questions in early human development; gestational physiology, from immune tolerance to growth and the timing of parturition; and personalized and population medicine, focusing on amalgamating health record data and deep phenotypes to create broad knowledge that can be integrated into health care systems and drive discovery to address pregnancy related disease and promote general health. We propose a series of questions reflecting development, systems biology, diseases, clinical approaches and tools, and population health and a call for scientific action. Clearly, transdisciplinary science must advance and accelerate in order to address adverse pregnancy outcomes. Disciplines not traditionally involved in the reproductive sciences, including computer science, engineering, mathematics, and pharmacology should be engaged at the study design phase to optimize the information gathered as well as to identify and further evaluate potentially actionable therapeutic targets. Information sources should include non-invasive, personalized sensors and monitors, alongside instructive liquid biopsies for non-invasive pregnancy assessment. Future research should also address the diversity of human cohorts in terms of geography, racial and ethnic distributions, as well as social and health disparities. Modern technologies, both for data-gathering and for data-analyzing, make this possible at a scale that was previously unachievable.

In order to evaluate the potential scope of aPD, it is important to review the outcomes and cost considerations of aPD. SUMMARY We reviewed available data from different countries and regions for health outcomes between aPD and in-center HD, with a focus on quality of life (QoL), mortality, hospitalization, and technique survival. We also evaluated studies discussing the overall costs of delivering aPD, including training, operating costs, and indirect costs and compared these to in-center HD costs for the same regions. Key Messages: aPD patients are older and more frail than either self-care PD patients and many in-center HD patients. We found no evidence for any difference in QoL, mortality, or hospitalization between aPD and in-center HD after adjustment for these differences. There is some evidence for an association between nurse assistance and improved technique survival as compared to family assistance or self-care PD.

The effect of these restrictions is unknown, given that beauty services are widely used for stress relief or to enhance confidence. The current study explored the relationship between engagement in appearance-focused behaviors and distress regarding beauty service closure. Participants with high and low levels of dysmorphic concern were compared to determine whether COVID-19 restrictions may affect these groups differently. METHOD An online survey was completed by 216 participants living in Australia. Questions addressed engagement in appearance-focused behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and attitudes toward beauty service closure. The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) was used to group participants by low and high dysmorphic concern. RESULTS Appearance-focused behaviors decreased in the low DCQ group (n = 163) during the COVID-19 pandemic, while such behaviors in the high DCQ group (n = 53) remained unchanged. Individuals who were living alone, younger, reported higher dysmorphic concern and greater distress over beauty service closure engaged in more frequent appearance-focused behaviors (R2 = .57, p < .001). The high DCQ group reported greater distress over beauty service closure and increased desire to obtain future beauty treatments. DISCUSSION While COVID-19 restrictions may have provided a break from societal appearance pressure for those with low dysmorphic concern, appearance-focused behaviors persisted in individuals with high dysmorphic concern.

Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between pandemic stressors and coping strategies with LGBTQ identity, while adjusting for sex, age, and race and ethnicity. Differences in the proportion of medicinal cannabis use among LGBTQ respondents (74.6%) and non-LGBTQ respondents (75.3%) were insignificant. LGBTQ cannabis users were more likely to report COVID-19-related stressors and coping behaviors, including increased alcohol use. After adjustment for covariates, LGBTQ cannabis users were more likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety than non-LGBTQ cannabis users. These results show that compared to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts, LGBTQ cannabis users are experiencing more problematic mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Affected birds are more prone to secondary complications (e.g. colibacillosis and clostridiosis) and failure to mount an effective vaccine-induced immune response. HEV belongs to the new genus Siadenovirus. Feco-oral transmission is the main route of entry of the virus and it mainly colonizes bursa, intestine and spleen. Both naturally occurring virulent and avirulent strains of HEVs are serologically indistinguishable. Recent findings revealed that ORF1, E3 and fib genes are the key factors affecting virulence. The adoption of suitable diagnostic tools, proper vaccination and biosecurity measures have restrained the occurrence of disease epidemics. For diagnostic purposes, the best source of HEV is either intestinal contents or samples from spleen. For rapid detection highly sensitive and specific tests such as quantitative real-time PCR based on Taq man probe has been designed. Avirulent strains of HEV or MSDV can be effectively used as live vaccines. Novel vaccines include recombinant hexon protein-based subunit vaccines or recombinant virus-vectored vaccines using fowl poxvirus (FPV) expressing the native hexon of HEV. Notably, subunit vaccines and recombinant virus vectored vaccines altogether offer high protection against challenge or field viruses.

METHODS This study was a review of the evidence-based literature and was conducted by searching databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, until April 2020. The search was performed based on keywords including \\"coronavirus\\", \\"COVID-19\\", and \\"prevention\\". The list of references in the final studies has also been re-reviewed to find articles that might not have been obtained through the search. The guidelines published by trustworthy organizations such as the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control have been used in this study. CONCLUSION So far, no vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19 has been invented, and the disease has become a pandemic. Therefore, observation of hand hygiene, disinfection of high-touch surfaces, observation of social distance, and lack of presence in public places are recommended as preventive measures. Moreover, to control the situation and to reduce the incidence of the virus, some of the measures taken by the decision-making bodies and the guidelines of the deterrent institutions to strengthen telecommuting of employees and reduce the presence of people in the community and prevent unnecessary activities, are very important.","output":"A review of studies on the epidemic crisis of COVID-19 disease with a preventive approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent crisis in the form of COVID-19 has rendered wearing of mask mandatory for patients, health care workers and members of public worldwide This has caused a sudden shift of focus on availability, effectiveness, re-use and development of face masks/respirators In the current pandemic situation, the shortage of masks has also led to rethinking on strategies of reuse of masks after due sterilization This work discusses a quick laboratory methodology to test/determine the particle filtration efficiency of face masks/respirators The testing parameters include the particle capture efficiency of the mask material/full mask, pressure drop and the fit factor Two different, simple, make-shift set-ups have been adopted for the present context The first is used to measure the intrinsic particle capture efficiency and pressure drop of the filter material and the second as a full mask sampler to assess the leakages through seams and joints of the mask Experiments conducted with atomized NaCl test particles on three types of mask viz commercial N-95 respirator, surgical mask and cloth mask have been used for evolving the methodology The differences in terms of capture efficiency of aerosol particles for the filter material and for the full mask in face fix/sealed fixture have been linked to improvement of the mask design in development phase This paper hopes to provide a crucial laboratory link between the mask developers and the certification agencies in the times of urgency Needless to mention that commercialization of the same is subject to certification from authorized agencies, following standard procedures ?

On these bases, we build the transition matrix describing, in probability, the room-scale visitor flows. Such a matrix is the cornerstone of a stochastic model capable of generating visitor trajectories in silico. We conclude by employing the simulator to increase the number of daily visitors while respecting numerous logistic and safety constraints.

This requires a room with supervision and presence of technologists and trained sleep experts. Today, clinical guidelines in most countries recommend home sleep apnoea testing with simple systems using six signals only. If criteria for signal quality, recording conditions, and patient selection are considered, then this is a reliable test with high accuracy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently diagnostic tools for sleep apnoea diagnosis become even more simple: smartwatches and wearables with smart apps claim to diagnose sleep apnoea when these devices are tracking sleep and sleep quality as part of new consumer health checking. Alternative and new devices range from excellent diagnostic tools with high accuracy and full validation studies down to very low-quality tools which only result in random diagnostic reports. Due to the high prevalence of sleep apnoea, even a random diagnosis may match a real disorder sometimes. SUMMARY: Until now, there are no metrics established how to evaluate these alternative algorithms and simple devices. Proposals for evaluating smartwatches, smartphones, single-use sensors, and new algorithms are presented. New assessments may help to overcome current limitations in sleep apnoea severity metrics.

The current study relates COVID-19 fear with psychological strain, i.e., stress amongst the nursing staff. Moreover, the intervening role of COVID-19 stress between COVID-19 fear and the performance of the nursing staff has also been tested. An online survey was conducted to collect data from nurses. A total of 471 responses of nurses were received during the process of online data collection from 16 November 2020 to 30 April 2021. Results revealed the significant effect of COVID-19 fear on COVID-19 stress and the performance of nurses. Additionally, the results substantiate that COVID-19 stress mediates between COVID-19 fear and the health care performance of nurses. COVID-19 fear has become a psychological consequence that increases stress among nursing staffs. This study fills the research gap about the performance of the health care sectors, particularly with respect to COVID-19 fear and COVID-19 stress among nurses. Hence, COVID-19 fear plays a significant role in COVID-19 stress in terms of influencing the health care performance of nurses.

A particularly concerning symptom is transient vision loss, which may become irreversible without prompt recognition and treatment. The pathogenesis of GCA is incompletely understood, but it seems that the innate and adaptive immune systems play a key role in vessel inflammation, remodeling, and occlusion. We present a case of a 79-year-old male who developed GCA two days after he received his second dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. He presented with headaches, fever, and myalgias. Lab workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers, with C-reactive protein (CRP) 272 mg/L (<8.1 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 97 mm/hr (0-20mm/hr). Imaging of the head, with CT and MRI, was unremarkable. His headache persisted despite supportive treatment, and he developed new, transient blurred vision, which increased suspicion for GCA. He underwent bilateral temporal artery biopsies, which were consistent with GCA. His symptoms resolved quickly with oral prednisone 60mg daily, and his inflammatory markers returned to normal within a month. A review of the literature revealed several case reports of giant cell arteritis following influenza vaccination. However, no large-scale studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between GCA and immunization. Our case demonstrates the first instance of GCA following a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. We propose that the upregulated immune response to the vaccine acted as a trigger for GCA in this patient with predisposing factors. While causation cannot be determined based on one case alone, our case demonstrates an opportunity for further research into the relationship between vasculitis and immunizations. Despite this isolated case, the proven benefits of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines significantly outweigh any theoretical risk of immune dysregulation following administration.","output":"A Case of Giant Cell Arteritis Presenting After COVID-19 Vaccination: Is It Just a Coincidence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of Chinas global responsibilities to address climate change, the country has made a commitment to limiting the growth of future emissions using policy measures, such as funding mitigation research and regulating energy efficiency requirements directly. Extensions of these policies, such as the measures to improve energy efficiency, use of carbon taxes, and changes to the mix of electricity generation in the country, are also of interest to China. This article applied a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to examine the effects of such energy efficiency and climate change policy options in the post-COVID-19 era in the China economy. The study findings show that even modest measures can have significant effects on emissions with marginal economic impacts, given the current level of development in the China electricity generation and transportation sectors. It is estimated that a 5 RMB per ton carbon tax will reduce emissions by 4.1% and GDP by 0.27%. Emissions drop by 8.2% and GDP drops by 0.54% when energy efficiency increases by 2% across the China economy, respectively. As a final result, a 5% shift away from burning coal would reduce emissions by 9.0%, while GDP would increase by 1.3%.

The rapid progression to a global pandemic of COVID-19 has had profound medical, social, and economic consequences. Pregnant women and newborns represent a vulnerable population. However, the precise impact of this novel virus on the fetus and neonate remains uncertain. Appropriate protection of health care workers and newly born infants during and after delivery by a COVID-19 mother is essential. There is some disagreement among expert organizations on an optimal approach based on resource availability, surge volume, and potential risk of transmission. The manuscript outlines the precautions and steps to be taken before, during, and after resuscitation of a newborn born to a COVID-19 mother, including three optional variations of current standards involving shared-decision making with parents for perinatal management, resuscitation of the newborn, disposition, nutrition, and postdischarge care. The availability of resources may also drive the application of these guidelines. More evidence and research are needed to assess the risk of vertical and horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes. Key Points: The risk of vertical transmission is unclear; transmission from family members/providers to neonates is possible. Optimal personal-protective-equipment (airborne vs. droplet/contact precautions) for providers is crucial to prevent transmission. Parents should be engaged in shared decision-making with options for rooming in, skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding.","output":"Neonatal Resuscitation and Postresuscitation Care of Infants Born to Mothers with Suspected or Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus and Rotavirus are most commonly associated etiologies for calves diarrhea resulting in loss of productivity and economy of farmers. However, various facets of diarrheal disease caused by coronavirus and rotavirus in calves in Ethiopia are inadequately understood. A cross sectional study was conducted with the aim of isolation and molecular characterization of coronavirus and rotavirus from calves in central part of Oromia (Bishoftu, Sebata, Holeta and Addis Ababa), Ethiopia from November 2018 to May 2019. The four study areas were purposively selected and fecal samples were collected by simple random sampling for diagnosis of coronavirus and rotavirus infection by using antigen detection Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA) kit. In addition, this study was carried out to have insight in prevalence and associated risk factors of coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves. Result: During the study 83 diarrheic and 162 non-diarrheic fecal samples collected from calves less than 4 weeks of age were screened for coronavirus and rotavirus. Of the 83 diarrheic samples, 1 sample (1.2%) was positive for coronavirus antigen (Ag) and 6 samples (7.2%) were found to be positive for rotavirus antigen (Ag) by Ag-ELISA. All the non-diarrheic samples were negative for both coronavirus and rotavirus Ag. The overall prevalence of coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves were estimated as 0.4% (1/245) and 2.45% (6/245) respectively. All samples (7) of ELISA test positive of both coronavirus and rotavirus were propagated in Madin Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK). After 3 subsequent passages, progressive cytopathic effect (CPE) i.e. rounding, detachment as well as destruction of mono-layer cell of five sample (1 sample of coronavirus and 4 sample of rotavirus) (71.4%) were observed. At the molecular stage, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to determine the presence of coronavirus and rotavirus nucleic acid by using specific primers. The 5 samples that were coronavirus and rotavirus antigen positive by ELISA and develop CPE on cell culture were also positive on RT-PCR technique. Infection prevalence peaked have been obtained at 1 st and 2 nd weeks of age in male calves. Conclusion: Diarrheal disease caused by coronavirus and rotavirus has a great health problem in calves that interrupts production benefits with reduced weight gain and increased mortality, and its potential for zoonotic spread. So the present findings show coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves in Ethiopia that needs to be addressed by practicing early colostrums feeding in newborn calves, using vaccine, or improving livestock management.","output":"Isolation Coronavirus and Rotavirus Associated With Calves, in Central Part of Oromia, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Osteosarcoma is known to be one of the frequently occurring cancers in dogs.

To evaluate by L-BIA, the severity of MTJ injuries graded from 1 to 3, and to determine the relationship between days to return to play (RTP) and L-BIA measurements. Methods 3T MRI and tetra polar L-BIA was used to analyzed 37 muscle injuries 24 h after injury in 32 male professional football players, (23.5  1.5 kg m-2; 1.8  0.1 m; 20-30 year.) between the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. Muscle injuries were classified by The British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification (BAMIC). Percentage difference of L-BIA parameters [resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and phase angle (PA)] of the injured side were calculated considering contralateral non-injured side as the reference value. Results According to BAMIC classification and by MRI exam, we found tendinous (n = 4), MTJ (n = 26), and MFJ (n = 7) muscle injuries. In addition, MTJ injuries were grouped according to the severity of injury in grade 1 (n = 11), grade 2 (n = 8), and grade 3 (n = 7). Significant decrease (P < 0.01) was found in the L-BIA parameters R, Xc, and PA, in both MTJ and MFJ as well as in the different grades of MTJ injuries. In particular, in Xc (P < 0.001), which is related to muscle cell disruption.

To address these issues, we propose a deep learning-based approach known as PPM-Unet to segmenting COVID-19 lesions from CT images. Our method improves an Unet by adopting pyramid pooling modules instead of the conventional skip connection and then enhances the representation of the neural network by aiding the global attention mechanism. We first pre-train PPM-Unet on COVID-19 dataset of pseudo labels containing1600 samples producing a coarse model. Then we fine-tune the coarse PPM-Unet on the standard COVID-19 dataset consisting of 100 pairs of samples to achieve a fine PPM-Unet.

The key areas targeted were visiting restrictions, ward round changes, facilities closures and the need to wear personal protective equipment. Free text responses were reviewed by two authors independently and common themes identified. Results: The findings offer insight into family perceptions that illustrate the negative repercussions of the restrictions to parents. Understanding on the part of the parents was demonstrated throughout;however, restrictions and pandemic interventions also resulted in isolation, distress, exclusion and anxiety. Conclusions: There are no current studies exploring parental perceptions of COVID-19 interventions within paediatric intensive care units.

In humans, the seriousness of infection caused by a coronavirus in the respiratory tract can vary from mild to lethal. A serious illness can be developed in old people and those with underlying medical problems like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease. For the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease, due to the growing number of cases, a limited number of test kits for COVID-19 are available in the hospitals. Hence, it is important to implement an automated system as an immediate alternative diagnostic option to pause the spread of COVID-19 in the population. OBJECTIVE This paper proposes a deep learning model for classification of coronavirus infected patient detection using chest X-ray radiographs. METHODS A fully connected convolutional neural network model is developed to classify healthy and diseased X-ray radiographs. The proposed neural network model consists of seven convolutional layers with rectified linear unit, softmax (last layer) activation functions and max pooling layers which were trained using the publicly available COVID-19 dataset. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION For validation of the proposed model, the publicly available chest X-ray radiograph dataset consisting COVID-19 and normal patient's images were used. Considering the performance of the results that are evaluated based on various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, MSE, RMSE & accuracy, it is seen that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model is 98.07%.","output":"An Efficient Method for Coronavirus Detection Through X-rays using deep Neural Network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about perceived health status and behavioral risk factors among prostate cancer survivors. The objective of this study was to describe racial and ethnic differences in self-reported health status, chronic conditions, and selected behavioral risk factors among prostate cancer survivors in the US. METHODS: We used data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey to calculate the prevalence of various levels of health status, chronic conditions, behavioral risk factors, and sociodemographic characteristics among prostate cancer survivors aged 50 years or older. We stratified results by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: Of the 317 prostate cancer survivors in our sample, 33.1% reported no physical activity, 64.2% reported being current drinkers, 26.1% characterized their drinking as moderate/heavy, 42.3% reported being former smokers, and 8.7% were current smokers. Nearly one-third (29.1%) of survivors were obese (body mass index 30), and 15.1% had 3 to 6 chronic conditions. A greater percentage of White (29.7%) than Black (14.2%) or Hispanic (16.3%) survivors were moderate/heavy drinkers. A greater percentage of Black (16.2%) than White (7.5%) or Hispanic (7.3%) survivors were current smokers. A greater percentage of Black (25.1%) or Hispanic (27.7%) than White (11.4%) survivors had 3 to 6 chronic conditions. CONCLUSION: As the population of older men increases, prostate cancer diagnoses and those surviving the disease will also increase.

Young cells possessed highly diverse circular DNA populations but 94% of the circular DNA were lost after a??15 divisions, whereas rDNA circles underwent massive accumulation to >95% of circular DNA. Circles present in both young and old cells were characterized by replication origins including circles from unique regions of the genome and repetitive regions: rDNA and telomeric Y' regions. We further observed that circles can have flexible inheritance patterns: [HXT6/7circle] normally segregates to mother cells but in low glucose is present in up to 50% of cells, the majority of which must have inherited this circle from their mother. Interestingly, [HXT6/7circle] cells are eventually replaced by cells carrying stable chromosomal HXT6 HXT6/7 HXT7 amplifications, suggesting circular DNAs are intermediates in chromosomal amplifications.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will set up a community-based longitudinal, prospective cohort study. The study will be conducted in two public outpatient clinics located in the southern district of Santiago, Chile. We expect to begin recruitment in the second quarter of 2022. Each patient will be followed up for at least 1 year after inclusion in the cohort. The eligible population will be adult patients registered in the Cardiovascular Health Programme. Exposure in this study is defined as any event where participants have contact with SARS-CoV-2 antigens from natural exposure or vaccination. The primary outcomes are seroconversion and strength and duration of the neutralising IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Secondary outcomes are any COVID-19-related event or intercurrent morbidities or death. Data will be collected by extracting serial blood samples and administering a questionnaire at the first face-to-face contact and monthly follow-up time points.

In this scenario, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMW/ASSM) organized guidelines based on expert opinion to identify Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) patients, which often need palliative care (PC) due to a large symptoms burden. In our specialized COVID-19 Center, we investigated characteristics and mortality of DNR patients according to SAMW/ASSM guidelines, comparing to non-DNR patients. Methods: Pilot retrospective validation study, evaluating consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Internal Medicine Department. A sub-analysis of the deceased patients care was performed, using both Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale-Palliative care (RASS-PAL) for sedation and agitation (+4/-5) and modified Borg Scale for dyspnea (1-10). Primary outcome was a 30-days survival of DNR patients comparing to non-DNR patients. Secondary outcomes reported quality of PC, especially on dyspnea and restlessness. Results: From March 16 to April 1 2020, 213 consecutive patients were triaged; of 40 DNR patients 25 (64%) were males with a mean age of 79.9 years. At 30-days follow-up, 9 (22.5%) of DNR patients died; 4 patients (2.2%) died in the control group. The higher mortality rate in DNR group was further confirmed by Log-Rank Mantel-Cox (23.104, p < 0.0001). PC was applied using oxygen (100%), opioids (100%) and sedatives (89%); the mean RASS-PAL improved from 2.2 to -1.8 (p < 0.0001) and Borg scale improved from 5.7 to 4.7 (p = 0.581). Conclusion: The SAMW/ASSM guidelines identified patients at higher risk of short-term death. In the end-of-life management, an early access to PC becomes crucial, both improving patients' end-of-life treatment and reducing psychological families' post-traumatic disorders.","output":"DNR order in SARS-CoV-2 patients: preliminary guidelines validation and quality of palliative care in a single Swiss COVID-19 Center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) is a qualitative methodology that explores the complex nature of healthcare 'as it really is'. Its collaborative and reflexive process invites stakeholders (e.g. pharmacists and pharmacy support staff) to participate in analysing their everyday work practices as captured on video footage. Through close collaboration with practitioners and attention to their work contexts, VRE may be a useful methodology to engage a time-poor pharmacy workforce in research about themselves, encouraging more practitioner involvement in practice-based research. Aside from research, VRE has also been used effectively as an intervention to facilitate learning and change in healthcare settings, and could be effective in provoking change in otherwise resistant pharmacy environments. Much like traditional ethnographic approaches, VRE researchers have relied on being present 'in the field' to observe, record and make sense of practices with participants. The COVID-19 pandemic however, has introduced restrictions around travel and physical distancing, which has required researchers to contemplate the conduct of VRE 'at a distance', and to imagine new ways in which the methodological 'closeness' to stakeholders and their workplace contexts can be maintained when researchers cannot be on site. In this commentary, we outline the rationale for participatory methods, in the form of VRE, in pharmacy research. We describe the underlying principles of this innovative methodology, and offer examples of how VRE can be used in pharmacy research. Finally, we offer a reflexive account of how we have adapted the method for use in community pharmacy research, to adapt to physical distancing, without sacrificing its methodological principles. This paper offers not only a new methodology to examine the complexity of pharmacy work, but demonstrates also the responsiveness of VRE itself to complexity, and the potential breadth of future research applications in pharmacy both during and beyond the current pandemic.","output":"A participatory research approach in community pharmacy research: The case for video-reflexive ethnography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive monitoring technique that measures regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). OBJECTIVES The primary aim was to compare the output of 2 NIRS-based cerebral oximetry devices, FORESIGHT (CAS Medical Systems Inc, Branford, Connecticut) and INVOS (Covidien, Boulder, Colorado), to venous oxygen saturations from the jugular venous bulb at cannulation and decannulation of the superior vena cava (SVC). Secondary objectives included evaluating correlations of cerebral saturation, as measured by the NIRS devices, with mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), measured by an invasive arterial line, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). METHODS Near-infrared spectroscopy, MAP, and ETCO2 data were collected at 13 defined events during each case when hemodynamic instability was expected. At SVC cannulation and decannulation, a 0.1 mL sample of blood was collected from the jugular bulb by the surgeon using a long angiocatheter. The oxygen saturation of these blood samples was measured using an AVOX device and compared with contemporaneous readings from the NIRS probes. Mixed-effects linear regression was used to correlate MAP or ETCO2 with cerebral oxygen saturation (by NIRS) at each time point. RESULTS Children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital heart surgery (n = 34) were enrolled in the study. At SVC cannulation, both INVOS ( r = .78) and FORESIGHT ( r = .59) were correlated with AVOX data at P < .001, although the correlation with INVOS was significantly stronger ( P = .003). At SVC decannulation, INVOS ( r = .68; P < .001) and FORESIGHT ( r = .60; P < .001) were similarly correlated with jugular venous rSO2. Correlations of rSO2 (by NIRS) with MAP and ETCO2 levels were stronger than correlations between rSO2 change and change in MAP or ETCO2. CONCLUSION INVOS correlated more strongly than FORESIGHT with the jugular bulb rSO2 at SVC cannulation but may have underestimated oxygen saturation at low rSO2 values.

The risk of biases (RoB) in RCTs and observation studies were assessed using the Cochrane RoB1.0 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. RESULTS 62 studies were included for qualitative analysis, while 51 of them reported number of patients with PPP post-intervention. Three observational studies and 13 RCTs compared the rates of PPP in patients undergoing ablation, enucleation or TURP. The most reported types of PPP are dysuria, abdominal pain and irritative symptoms. The pooled incidence of PPP at 1-month follow-up in patients undergoing ablation, enucleation and TURP were 0.15 (95% CI 0.10-0.22), 0.09 (95% CI 0.04-0.19 and 0.10 (95% CI 0.06-0.15), respectively.

Under two scenarios we estimate the impact of COVID-19 on cervical cancer over one screening cycle (3y at ages 25-49 and 5y at ages 50-64). The duration of disruption in both scenarios is six months. In the first scenario all women have their screening interval is extended by six months. In the second some women (those who would have been screened during the disruption) miss one screening cycle, but most women have no delay. Results: Both scenarios result in similar numbers of excess cervical cancers: 630 vs. 632 (both 4.3 per 100,000 women in the population). However the scenario in which some women miss one screening cycle creates inequalities - they would have much higher rates of excess cancer: 41.5 per 100,000 screened women compared to those with a six month delay (5.9 per 100,000 screened).

The present study aimed to examine the mediating roles of coping, psychological flexibility and prosociality in the impacts of perceived illness threats toward COVID-19 on mental health. METHOD: Five-hundred and fourteen Hong Kong citizens (18 years or above) completed an online survey to measure illness perceptions toward COVID-19, coping, psychological flexibility, prosociality, and mental health, together with their socio-demographic variables. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the explanatory model that was the best-fit to illustrate the relationships between these constructs. RESULTS: Serial mediation structural equation model showed that only psychological flexibility (unstandardised beta coefficient, ? = - 0.12, 95% CI [- 0.20, - 0.02], p = 0.031) and prosociality (unstandardised ? = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.08], p = 0.001) fully mediated the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health. In addition, psychological flexibility exerted a direct effect on prosociality (standardised ? = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.32], p < 0.001).

Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.","output":"CAVA: A Visual Analytics System for Exploratory Columnar Data Augmentation Using Knowledge Graphs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathways regulating cell senescence and cell cycle underlie many processes associated with ageing and age-related pathologies, and they also mediate cellular responses to exposure to stressors. Meanwhile, there are central mechanisms of the regulation of stress responses that induce/enhance or weaken the response of the whole organism, such as hormones of the hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, thymic hormones, and the pineal hormone melatonin. Although there are many analyses considering relationships between the HPA axis and organism ageing, we found no systematic analyses of relationships between the neuroendocrine regulators of stress and inflammation and intracellular mechanisms controlling cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis. Here, we provide a review of the effects of neuroendocrine regulators on these mechanisms. Our analysis allowed us to postulate a multilevel system of central regulators involving neurotransmitters, glucocorticoids, melatonin, and the thymic hormones. This system finely regulates the cell cycle and metabolic/catabolic processes depending on the level of systemic stress, stage of stress response, and energy capabilities of the body, shifting the balance between cell cycle progression, cell cycle stopping, senescence, and apoptosis.

This trial evaluated the effectiveness of a universal web-based service (Smooth Sailing) for improving help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and other related outcomes among students. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the 12-week outcomes of the Smooth Sailing service among 1841 students from 22 secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Assignment was conducted at the school level. The control condition received school-as-usual. The primary outcome was help-seeking intentions for general mental health problems at 12-weeks post-baseline. Secondary outcomes included help-seeking behaviour, anxiety and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, psychological barriers to help-seeking, and mental health literacy. Data were analysed using mixed linear models. This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001539224). FINDINGS: At 12-weeks post-baseline, there was a marginal statistical difference in the relative means of help-seeking intentions (effect size=0?10, 95%CI: -0?02C0?21) that favoured the intervention condition. Help-seeking from adults declined in both conditions. There was a greater reduction in the number of students who needed support for their mental health but were not seeking help in the intervention condition (OR: 2?08, 95%CI: 1?72C2.27, P<?0001). No other universal effects were found. Participants found the service easy to use and understand; However, low motivation, time, forgetfulness, and lack of perceived need were barriers to use. INTERPRETATION: Smooth Sailing led to small improvements in help-seeking intentions. Refinements are needed to improve its effectiveness on other mental health outcomes and to increase student uptake and engagement.

In patients with SLE, the loss of B cell tolerance to autoantigens is controlled in a cell-intrinsic manner by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which sense nucleic acids in endosomes. TLR7 drives the extrafollicular B cell response and the germinal centre reaction that are involved in autoantibody production and disease pathogenesis. Surprisingly, TLR9 seems to protect against SLE, even though it is required for the production of autoantibodies recognizing double-stranded DNA-associated antigens, which are abundant in SLE and are a hallmark of this disease. The protective function of TLR9 is at least partly mediated by its capacity to limit the stimulatory activity of TLR7. The roles of TLR7 and TLR9 in the effector function of B cells in lupus-like disease and in patients with SLE, and the unique features of TLR signalling in B cells, suggest that targeting TLR signalling in SLE might be therapeutically beneficial.","output":"Toll-like receptor signalling in B cells during systemic lupus erythematosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect almost all warm-blooded animals, avian species and humans. Toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, whereas it may lead to death in immune suppressed or deficient patients. A vaccine against T. gondii is required to prevent consequences of the infection. The aim of this study is to generate a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine against T. gondii. METHODS: 49 previously discovered antigenic proteins of T gondii were evaluated by their expression level in E. coli and by comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to determine antigenic epitopes. Based on these analyses, six vaccine candidate proteins were selected to generate a hexavalent recombinant protein vaccine adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 50 V. Humoral and cellular immune responses were determined by flow cytometry and ELISA. Vaccinated mice were challenged with T. gondii Ankara strain tachyzoites. RESULTS: In mice vaccinated with hexavalent vaccine, strong total IgG (P < 0.0001) and IgG2a (P < 0.001) responses were induced compared to controls, the ratio of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes secreting IFN- increased, and significantly higher extracellular IFN- secretion was achieved compared to the controls (P < 0.001). The survival time of the vaccinated mice increased to 8.38  2.13 days which was significantly higher than controls (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results show that the hexavalent vaccine which is developed for the first time against T. gondii induced strong and balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses as well as conferred significant protection against challenge with lethal toxoplasmosis in murine model.","output":"Development of a hexavalent recombinant protein vaccine adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 50 V and determination of its protective efficacy against acute toxoplasmosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oligophenylene ethynylenes, known as OPEs, are a sequence of aromatic rings linked by triple bonds, the properties of which can be modulated by varying the length of the rigid main chain or/and the nature and position of the substituents on the aromatic units.

Objective To present novel insights and consolidated evidence collected from experts, clinical practice guidelines and original studies on the unmet needs in thromboprophylaxis, and on the treatment of VTE in two high-risk patient groups: patients with cancer and the critically ill. Methodology To identify specific unmet needs in the management of VTE, a methodology was designed and implemented that assessed gaps in prophylaxis and treatment of VTE through interviews with 44 experts in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, and through a review of current guidelines and seminal studies to substantiate the insights provided by the experts. The research findings were then analysed, discussed and consolidated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results The gap analysis methodology identified shortcomings in the VTE risk assessment tools, patient stratification approaches for prophylaxis, and the suboptimal use of anticoagulants for primary prophylaxis and treatment. Conclusions Specifically, patients with cancer need better VTE risk assessment tools to tailor primary thromboprophylaxis to tumour types and disease stages, and the potential for drug-drug interactions needs to be considered. In critically ill patients, unfractionated heparin is not advised as a first-line treatment option, and the strength of evidence is increasing for direct oral anticoagulants as a treatment option over low-molecular-weight heparins.","output":"Evaluation of unmet clinical needs in prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism in high-risk patient groups: cancer and critically ill."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Carotid atherosclerosis (CAS) is a disease of the aorta caused by lipid metabolism disorders and local inflammation. Acupuncture combined with traditional western medicine (such as aspirin or atorvastatin) for the treatment of CAS has been widely applied in clinical practice, but there is still a lack of supporting evidence for its efficacy and safety on CAS. Therefore, this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) will summarise the effects of different types of acupuncture treatments on CAS, and a ranking of the therapeutic classes will also be presented, aiming to provide evidence-based medicine for its extensive clinical application. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic and NMA searches will be conducted in seven electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and Chongqing VIP databases. The search time is from their inception to December 2020, regardless of language and publication type. Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that include patients with CAS receiving acupuncture therapy compared with a control group will be considered eligible. The primary outcomes include the carotid intima-media thickness and vessel plaque quantification; the secondary outcomes include the carotid plaque Crouse score, greyscale median, lipid levels, the incidence of cardiovascular events, safety and adverse events. The selection of studies, data extraction, quality assessment and risk of bias assessment will be conducted by two independent reviewers.

As a result, the efficacy of most antiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann and Dahari model. Considering the fact that the efficacy of the antiviral drug varies in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model systems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and antiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or stops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is considered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our result depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load decreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral drugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high efficacy, the viral load, as well as the number of infected cells, monotonously decreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the critical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation between viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored. In this case, not only the dependence for the basic reproduction ratio on the model parameters is explored but also we analyze the critical drug efficacy as a function of time. We show that the term related to the basic reproduction ratio increases when the CTL response step up.

The method was designed with a one health approach in mind requiring multidisciplinary and multisectoral collaborative efforts. It enables comprehensive evaluation of antibiotic usage in surveyed communities via wastewater-based epidemiology, as well as allowing for the assessment of potential environmental impacts. The instrumental performance was very good, demonstrating linearity up to 3000 g L(?1), and high accuracy and precision. The method accuracy in several compounds was significantly improved by dividing calibration curves into separate ranges. This was accompanied by applying a weighting factor (1/x). Microwave-assisted and/or solid-phase extraction of analytes from liquid and solid matrices provided good recoveries for most compounds, with only a few analytes underperforming. Method quantification limits were determined as low as 0.017 ng L(?1) in river water, 0.044 ng L(?1) in wastewater, 0.008 ng g(?1) in river sediment, and 0.009 ng g(?1) in suspended solids. Overall, the method was successfully validated for the quantification of 64 analytes extracted from aqueous samples, and 45 from solids. The analytes that underperformed are considered on a semi-quantitative basis, including aminoglycosides and carbapenems. The method was applied to both solid and liquid environmental matrices, whereby several antibiotics and their metabolites were quantified. The most notable antibiotic-metabolite pairs are three sulfonamides and their N-acetyl metabolites; four macrolides/lincomycins and their N-desmethyl metabolites; and five quinolone metabolites.

The severity and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic means it is extremely likely that health-care professionals will experience psychological distress as a result of their direct contact with patients who have contracted the infection. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate levels of psychological distress among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, determine the associated factors, and identify nurses coping strategies. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional design. Overall, 130 nurses answered online questionnaires. The questionnaires measured sociodemographic characteristics, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, and the Brief Coping Inventory. Results: Nurses have a moderate level of fear (mean score: 24.34  13.43) and depression (43.8% of the sample), and severe anxiety (73.8%) and stress (45.4%). Anxiety and fear were positively correlated (r = .675, p < .001). Independent t-tests revealed that female nurses had higher psychological distress and fear than male nurses (p = 0.015 and p = 0.038, respectively). Nurses who cared for patients who had tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 and those who had a friend or family member who had tested positive had higher fear and psychological distress than their respective counterparts (p < .001 and p = .010, respectively).

The homologies shared between viruses and host cytoskeletal proteins likely indicate that shared determinants on cell linker proteins guided viral proteins along highways and stop points inside cells.

In this paper, we exploit spatial patterns of individual invitations sent from registered users to new users over the entire life cycle of a social media platform. We demonstrate that hierarchical diffusion overlaps with diffusion to close distances and these factors co-evolve over the life cycle. Therefore, we disentangle them in a regression framework that estimates the yearly number of invitations sent between pairs of towns. We confirm that hierarchical diffusion prevails initially across large towns only but emerges in the full spectrum of settlements in the middle of the life cycle when adoption accelerates. Unlike in previous gravity estimations, we find that after an intensifying role of distance in the middle of the life cycle a surprisingly weak distance effect characterizes the last years of diffusion. Our results stress the dominance of urban hierarchy in spatial diffusion and inform future predictions of innovation adoption at local scales.","output":"Urban hierarchy and spatial diffusion over the innovation life cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) coding system has been adopted by the Ministry of Health in Aotearoa New Zealand to replace other medical coding systems l The MOH has mandated that Emergency Departments (ED) in New Zealand must report all visits using SNOMED-CT codes for Chief Presenting Complaint (CPC), Procedures and Diagnoses to the National Non-admitted Patient Collection (NNPAC) by July 2021 2 It is hoped that this will correct a large gap in the data about acute presentations which is not captured currently 3 This is especially important as there are implications for disease surveillance, new trends in recreational drug toxicity and especially relevant in the current context of SARS COV-2: early identification of possible pandemics 4 Auckland City Hospital (ACH) emergency department (ED) introduced coding CPC with SNOMED-CT in March 2019 as an 'early adopter' pilot site for the MOH national rollout and are currently in the process of introducing procedure and diagnosis codes The lead author reviewed the first few cases with the auditors, until satisfied that data collection was reliable The auditor recorded CPC based on the first treating clinician's clinical notes onto a purpose-built electronic data collection form in Microsoft Excel?

METHODS: Cats referred to an FeLV-specific adoption program between January 2018 and July 2019 at an animal shelter in Austin, TX, USA, were first identified based on their putative FeLV status as reported by the referring shelter, rescue group, veterinarian or individual. Each cat was re-screened for FeLV upon admission and subsequently deemed infected or uninfected. Data on cat source, admission date, outcome date, outcome type, signalment and comorbidities at the time of admission were extracted from the shelter database. Outcomes were recorded up to 15 December 2019. RESULTS: In total, 801 cats suspected to be infected with FeLV were referred to the FeLV adoption program. Of these, 149 (18.6%) were ultimately deemed uninfected, and infection was confirmed in 652 (81.4%) cats. Adoption was the most common outcome for FeLV-infected cats (n = 514 cats; 78.8%), followed by euthanasia or death in care (n = 109; 16.7%). Upper respiratory infection (URI) was the most common comorbidity in FeLV-infected cats (n = 106; 16.3%) at the time of admission, which was not significantly different than URI in the cats that were deemed not to be infected with FeLV (n = 29; 19.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated high national demand for a lifesaving option for cats diagnosed with FeLV. FeLV infections could not be confirmed in approximately one in five cats referred to the FeLV adoption program, a reminder of the risk behind basing the fate of a cat on a single positive test result. The majority of cats referred to the FeLV program were adopted, demonstrating that programs centered on adopter education and post-adoption support can create lifesaving outcomes for most FeLV-infected cats, despite uncertainty regarding their long-term prognosis.","output":"Outcome of cats referred to a specialized adoption program for feline leukemia virus-positive cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kinerja seorang dosen tetap di suatu perguruan tinggi memiliki perspektif makna yang sangat luas bukan hanya menyatakan sebagai hasil kerja tetapi bagaimana juga proses kerja berlangsung.

Estimates are usually derived from Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems, but these do not include non-registered deaths, which may be affected by changes in vital registration coverage over time. METHODS: Our analytical framework and empirical strategy account for registered mortality and under-registration. This provides a better estimate of the actual mortality impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. We use population and crude mortality rate projections from Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI, in Spanish), individual-level registered COVID-19 deaths from the Ministry of Health (MoH), and individual-level registered deaths by region and age since 2017 from the National Electronic Deaths Register (SINADEF, in Spanish). We develop a novel framework combining different estimates and using quasi-Poisson models to estimate total excess mortality across regions and age groups. Also, we use logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the coverage of the new SINADEF system. FINDINGS: We estimate that registered mortality underestimates national mortality by 37?1% (95% CI 23% - 48?5%) across 26 regions and nine age groups. We estimate total all-cause excess mortality during the period of analysis at 173,099 (95% CI 153,669 - 187,488) of which 108,943 (95% CI 96,507 - 118,261) were captured by the vital registration system. Deaths at age 60 and over accounted for 74?1% (95% CI 73?9% - 74?7%) of total excess deaths, and there were fewer deaths than expected in younger age groups. Lima region, on the Pacific coast and including the national capital, accounts for the highest share of excess deaths, 87,781 (95% CI 82,294 - 92,504), while in the opposite side regions of Apurimac and Huancavelica account for less than 300 excess deaths. INTERPRETATION: Estimating excess mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Peru must take under-registration of mortality into account. Combining demographic trends with data from administrative registries reduces uncertainty and measurement errors. In countries like Peru, this is likely to produce significantly higher estimates of excess mortality than studies that do not take these effects into account.

While serologic testing does not indicate current SARS CoV 2 infection, it can indicate prior infection and help inform local policy and health guidance. The DC Department of Health (DC Health) conducted a community based survey to estimate DC SARS CoV 2 seroprevalence and identify seropositivity associated factors. Methods A mixed-methods cross-sectional serology survey was conducted among a convenience sample of DC residents during July 27 through August 21, 2020. Free serology testing was offered at three public test sites. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire on household and demographic characteristics, COVID like illness (CLI) since January 1, 2020, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 exposures. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the sample population and assess factors associated with seropositivity. Results Among a sample of 671 participants, 51 individuals were seropositive, yielding an estimated seroprevalence of 7.6%. More than half (56.9%) of the seropositive participants reported no prior CLI; nearly half (47.1%) had no prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. Race/ethnicity, prior SARS-CoV-2 testing, prior CLI, employment status, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with seropositivity (P<0.05). Among those reporting prior CLI, loss of taste or smell, duration of CLI, fewer days between CLI and serology test, or prior viral test were associated with seropositivity (P[]0.006). Conclusions These findings indicate many seropositive individuals reported no symptoms consistent with CLI since January or any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. This underscores the potential for cases to go undetected in the community and suggests wider-spread transmission than previously reported in DC.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey Among District Residents Presenting for Serologic Testing at Three Community Based Test Sites in Washington, DC, July to August, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article doi: 10.1590/0034-7167-2019-0157].","output":"ERRATUM."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) inhibitors are considered as potential treatments for coronavirus disease 2019, and dietary polyphenols show promise in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition based on in silico studies.

Sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected simultaneously, and causative organisms were identified by conventional bacterial culture together with exhaustive bacterial and viral identification by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The subjects were eight patients diagnosed with mild or moderate pneumonia at Sotobo Childrens Clinic Outpatient Department between October 2006 and June 2007. TBPM-PI was administered at the recommended clinical dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. to five patients and at a high dose of 6 mg/kg b.i.d. to three patients. Sputum was collected from all patients, and 11 strains were detected from washed sputum culture. Causative organisms were mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (6 strains), and nasopharyngeal swabs showed the same organisms as coughed-up sputum. Real-time PCR for individual viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae identified four cases of only bacterial infection, one case of M. pneumoniae coinfection, two cases of viral coinfection, and one case of both viral and M. pneumoniae coinfection. The clinical results indicated efficacy in all patients, and causative organisms were 100% eliminated. In the four patients with only bacterial infection, the average fever of 38.9C at the start of treatment normalized the following day, showing excellent efficacy. No clinically problematic adverse events occurred, and compliance was good.

The proposed model has been verified for the adequate description of the rheological behavior of suspensions, introducing a scalar variable that describes dynamically the level of internal microstructure of rouleaux at any instance, capturing accurately the aggregation and disaggregation mechanisms of the RBCs. Also, a non-linear fitting is adopted for the definition of the models parameters on limited available experimental data of steady and transient rheometric flows of blood samples. We present the predictability of the new model in various steady and transient rheometric flows, including startup shear, rectangular shear steps, shear cessation, triangular shear steps and LAOS tests. Our model provides predictions for the elasto-thixotropic mechanism in startup shear flows, demonstrating a non-monotonic relationship of the thixotropic index on the shear-rate. The intermittent shear step test reveals the dynamics of the structural reconstruction, which in turn is associated with the aggregation process. Moreover, our model offers robust predictions for less examined tests such as uniaxial elongation, in which normal stress was found to have considerable contribution. Apart from the integrated modeling of blood rheological complexity, our implementation is adequate for multi-dimensional simulations due to its tensorial formalism accomplished with a single time scale for the thixotropic effects, resulting in a low computational cost compared to other TEVP models.","output":"Advanced Constitutive Modeling of the Thixotropic Elasto-Visco-Plastic Behavior of Blood: Description of the Model and Rheological Predictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"͹״ףCOVID-19ҹͻĹ¼и߶ȴȾԵļвΪһȺΪȾصصȺеٴݼоϣںϲCOVID-19Ⱦиٴڳ˻ƣ֤ݱCOVID-19и׷չΪ֢׻δ͹״Ⱦɵ¹ڴֱ֤֭ݡٴйУӦϲCOVID-19ȾٴռɺܽᣬǿCOVID-19Ⱦá.","output":"[Attach importance to COVID-19 infection on maternal and infant outcomes]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (which occures also with severe course of COVID-19) requires oxygen therapy.

The goal of our experiment was to test functionality of a simple device equipped with a Venturi nozzle Corovalve which we designed and printed on a 3D printer. We incorporated the nozzle into a system assembled from parts commonly available in the Czech Republic. We put this device through a static test and a dynamic test performed on ourselves and measured its basic parameters. In our experiment during spontaneous ventilation the device was able to generate positive mean airway pressure. At higher flow rates, the system was able to maintain a slightly positive pressure even during the inspiration, so we can talk about a system that allows, under certain circumstances, spontaneous ventilation at continuous positive airway pressure. The most effective from setting tested was oxygen input of 15 L/min combined with PEEP valve set to 10-15 cm H2O. Mean airway pressure ranged at 9-12 cm H2O and oxygen concentration in the inspiration mixture was 40-42%. We therefore conclude that our nozzle Corovalve printed on a 3D printer can be used in a simple device allowing positive pressure oxygen application during spontaneous ventilation EPAP/CPAP.

Change to: Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and systemic immunosuppressive therapies in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians. METHODS: A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring. RESULTS: Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications. The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications. In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried. The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for new infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering. CONCLUSIONS: The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families. Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.","output":"Systemic immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory skin diseases in children: Expert consensus-based guidance for clinical decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of the pre-criminal space has seen increasing uncritical use in countering terrorism policy since 9/11. It is understood by critical scholars primarily as a new legal temporality that brings forward the threshold of criminal responsibility, thus allowing for pre-emptive, suspicion-based criminalisation. This has allowed for the validation of measures such as arbitrary arrest and detention, bogus trial and restrictions on liberty, and is evidenced as being applied in an Islamophobic and racialised manner to entire communities. Furthermore, in our contemporary moment of Covid-19 where the emergency tools used to regulate hygiene and infection intersect with those used in countering terrorism work, critics are increasingly concerned about the expansion and normalisation of the pre-criminal space and its use in pathologising and medicalised ways.

The involvement of thyroid and adrenal glands has also been described, although infrequently. Amyloidoses have a heterogeneous plethora of clinical manifestations, with certain phenotypes associated with specific amyloid forms. Gynecological amyloidosis is a rare condition. Uterine involvement may occur in a localized fashion or may also arise as a part of systemic involvement, albeit at a lesser ratio. Several cases of uterine AL amyloidosis have been documented so far as an organ involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis. On the other hand, uterine amyloidosis associated with AA amyloidosis has been described merely in one case with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we presented a 40-year-old female patient with FMF known for 38 years who underwent splenectomy and hysterectomy due to massive splenomegaly, deep anemia, and persistent menometrorrhagia. Histological examinations of materials revealed uterine and splenic AA amyloidosis. This case report is first-of-its-kind to describe FMF-associated uterine AA amyloidosis and also provides a discussion of possible mechanisms of amyloidosis-induced uterine bleeding.","output":"Menorrhagia due to uterine amyloidosis in familial Mediterranean fever: case-based review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a severe outbreak worldwide. There are still several challenges in COVID-19 diagnoses, such as limited reagents, equipment, and long turnaround times. In this research, we propose to design molecularly imprinted polymers as a novel approach for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we investigated molecular interactions between the target spike protein, receptor-binding domain of the virus, and the common functional monomers used in molecular imprinting by a plethora of computational analyses; sequence analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results demonstrated that AMPS and IA monomers gave promising results on the SARS-CoV-2 specific TEIYQAGST sequence for further analysis. Therefore, we propose an epitope approach-based synthesis route for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by using AMPS and IA as functional monomers and the peptide fragment of the TEIYQAGST sequence as a template molecule.","output":"Computational analysis of functional monomers used in molecular imprinting for promising COVID-19 detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A charity helpline organisation has said that more than 200 nurses who contacted it during the COVID-19 pandemic had attempted suicide.

Universities had to embark on remote teaching to salvage the 2020 academic year. This created the opportunity to draw on students' creative and digital skills to promote digital storytelling as a way of enhancing their learning experience. This article describes the journey of a teacher educator and a group of students registered for a language didactics module in an initial teacher education programme. Film study was traditionally presented through lively conversations in a contact session where students could exchange their perceptions and opinions regarding various aspects of film. Because of the COVID-19 lockdown this approach had to be reviewed. The lecturer in question employed digital learning competencies to transform learning through the innovative use of digital tools and resources to rethink student engagement with film. Students were invited to create digital stories. The outcome of the process not only improved their understanding of teaching film but also promoted their digital competencies and empowered them to create resources they could use in their careers.","output":"A Journey through Digital Storytelling during COVID-19: Students' Preparedness to Use Technology for Learning in the Language Classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper assesses the convergence of COVID-19 cases by obtaining transition paths of Indian states covering the period from August 01 to October 31, 2020.

Often times the datasets are quite imbalanced and sampling techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) give only moderate accuracy in such cases. To overcome this problem, a two-step approach has been proposed. In the first step, SMOTE is modified to reduce the class imbalance in terms of Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE) which were then coupled with selective classifiers for prediction. An increase in accuracy is noted for both BP-SMOTE and D-SMOTE compared to basic SMOTE. In the second step, Machine learning, Deep Learning and Ensemble algorithms were used to develop a Stacking Ensemble Framework which showed a significant increase in accuracy for Stacking compared to individual machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Na?ve Bayes, Neural Networks and Ensemble techniques like Voting, Bagging and Boosting. Two different methods have been developed by combing Deep learning with Stacking approach namely Stacked CNN and Stacked RNN which yielded significantly higher accuracy of 96C97% compared to individual algorithms. Framingham dataset is used for data sampling, Wisconsin Hospital data of Breast Cancer study is used for Stacked CNN and Novel Coronavirus 2019 dataset relating to forecasting COVID-19 cases, is used for Stacked RNN.","output":"Effective treatment of imbalanced datasets in health care using modified SMOTE coupled with stacked deep learning algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human to human transmissible infectious diseases spread in a population using human interactions as its transmission vector.

The majority of these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory. The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] which depends only on the probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the [Formula: see text] of a model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic.

ObjectiveTo identify diagnosed symptoms, diagnosed health conditions and medications associated with PASC in children. Design, Setting and ParticipantsRetrospective cohort study using electronic health records from 9 US childrens hospitals for individuals <21 years-old who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020 - October 31, 2021 and had at least 1 encounter in the 3 years before testing. ExposureSARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe identified syndromic (symptoms), systemic (conditions), and medication PASC features in the 28-179 days following the initial test date. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were obtained for 151 clinically predicted PASC features by contrasting PCR-positive with PCR-negative groups using proportional hazards models, adjusting for site, age, sex, testing location, race/ethnicity, and time-period of cohort entrance. We estimated the incidence proportion for any syndromic, systemic or medication PASC feature in the two groups to obtain a burden of PASC estimate. ResultsAmong 659,286 children in the study sample, 59,893 (9.1%) tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Most were tested in outpatient testing facility (50.3%) or office (24.6%) settings. The most common syndromic, systemic, and medication features were loss of taste or smell (aHR 1.96 [95% CI 1.16-3.32), myocarditis (aHR 3.10 [95% CI 1.94-4.96]), and cough and cold preparations (aHR 1.52 [95% CI 1.18-1.96]). The incidence of at least one systemic/syndromic/medication feature of PASC was 41.9% among PCR-positive children versus 38.2% among PCR-negative children, with an incidence proportion difference of 3.7% (95% CI 3.2-4.2%). A higher strength of association for PASC was identified in those cared for in the ICU during the acute illness phase, children less than 5 years-old, and individuals with complex chronic conditions. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this large-scale, exploratory study, the burden of pediatric PASC that presented to health systems was low. Myocarditis was the most commonly diagnosed PASC-associated condition. Acute illness severity, young age, and comorbid complex chronic disease increased the risk of PASC.

In the current study, MD thalamic regions from AUD subjects and controls were analyzed with Affymetrix Clariom S human microarray. Long-term alcohol use induced a significant (FDR  0.05) upregulation of 2802 transcripts and downregulation of 1893 genes in the MD thalamus of AUD subjects. A significant upregulation of GRIN1 (glutamate receptor NMDA type 1) and FTO (alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase) was confirmed in western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed similar heterogenous distribution of GRIN1 in the thalamic nuclei of both AUD and control subjects. The most prevalent functional categories of upregulated genes were related to glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, cellular metabolism, and neurodevelopment. The prevalent gene cluster among down-regulated genes was immune system mediators. Forty-two differentially expressed genes, including FTO, ADH1B, DRD2, CADM2, TCF4, GCKR, DPP6, MAPT and CHRH1, have been shown to have strong associations (FDR p < 10(?8)) with AUD or/and alcohol use phenotypes in recent GWA studies.

Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia.

Through this study, we contribute to literature by discussing the challenges of current research, and, more importantly, identifying and proposing future research directions. The results of our survey show that further debate on the theory and application of BNs to SC resilience and risk management is a significant area of interest for both academics and practitioners.

However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; -HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission ( 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and -HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and -HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and -HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","output":"Heart injury signs are associated with higher and earlier mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on oral hygiene (OH) awareness, attitude towards dental treatment, fear of infection and economic impact in the Middle East. METHODS: This survey was performed by online distribution of questionnaires in three countries in the Middle East (Jordan, Iraq and Egypt). The questionnaire consisted of five sections: the first section was aimed at collecting demographic data and the rest sections used to assess OH awareness, attitude towards dental treatment, degree of fear and economic impact of COVID-19. The answers were either multiple choice, closed-end (Yes or No) or 5-point Likert scale for the last four sections. RESULTS: A total of 3782 respondents completed the questionnaire. Overall, OH awareness was low (mean SD; 1.84  1.03), while attitude towards dental treatment (5.04  1.68) and economic impact (11.29  4.37) were moderately affected. In addition, fear of infection showed moderately high level (14.04  4.11). All subgroups of the demographic variables showed significant differences among them in relation to OH awareness and attitude towards dental treatment.

In this work, we synthetized two novel structurally similar oligomers (5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D-A-D-A-D and A-D-A-D-A configuration for high-performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination of the ternary OSCs. Although the HOMO energy levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers showed ultra-high EQEEL of 0.05% and improved VOC was achieved in ternary OSCs, indicating that suppressing non-radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP-BO4Cl fine-tunes the morphology of the active layer and forms synergistic effects.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: According to the specially designed form, a retrospective analysis of primary accounting documents was carried out (f. No. 103/o) in 158 patients with COVID-19. The research was carried out in specialized inpatient infectious diseases wards of health institutions of the Sumy region during the period from April to September 2020. The study used a systemic approach, bibliosemantic, comparative and statistical analyses, logical generalization methods. RESULTS: Results: Among the study group of patients, namely 158 people, a bigger number of women (56.33+/-3.95%) than men (43.67+/-3.95%) were recorded. Patients of working age (from 18 to 64 years old) took 70.89+/-3.61% of all patients, and people aged 65 years and older - 29.11+/-3.61%. The time from the beginning of symptoms to hospitalization in each second patient (49.37+/-3.98%) lasted 5-7 days. In most cases, the patient's stay in the hospital equaled 13-15 bed-days - 32.28+/-3.72%. The index of patients with severe and critical state was 20.89+/-3.23% (33 patients). In 8.23+/-2.19% (13 people) of treated cases of hospital stay ended in death.

Although initially developed as a theranostic ligand for metastasized cancer, FAPI (FAP inhibitor) tracers have recently been used to study cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction in small-animal models. The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of FAP via FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans in human hearts. METHODS: FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans of 229 patients of 2 consecutive cohorts (modeling cohort: n=185; confirmatory cohort: n=44) suffering from metastasized cancer were analyzed applying the American Heart Association 17-segment model of the left ventricle. Logistic regression models were created using data from the modeling cohort. Multivariate regression models were established using Akaike information criterion in a step-down approach. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of patients had preexisting coronary artery disease (n=31), 33% arterial hypertension (n=75), and 12% diabetes mellitus type II (n=28). Forty-three percent had been treated with platin derivatives (n=100), 14% with anthracyclines (n=32), and 10% had a history of prior radiation to the chest (n=23). High left ventricular FAPI signals correlated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio [OR], 4.3, P=0.0029), a focal myocardial signal pattern (OR, 3.9, P=0.0068), diabetes mellitus type II (OR, 4.1, P=0.046), and beta-blocker use (OR, 3.8, P=0.049) in univariate regression models.

Moreover, the SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of mortality in DM (OR = 0.549, CI 95 % 0.448-0.671, p &#8804; 0.001) and CKD (OR = 0.552, 95 % CI 0.367-0.829, p = 0.004) patients, but not hypertension and CVDs. There was no publication bias. Conclusions: Our pooled data showed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection was the highest in the Iranian patients with hypertension (21.1 %) followed by DM (16.3 %), CVDs (14.0 %) and CKD (5.0 %). Moreover, DM and CKD in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with a 0.549 and 0.552-fold increase in mortality, respectively. Clinicians in Iran should be aware of these findings, to identifying patients at higher risk and inform interventions to reduce the risk of death. Moreover, well-designed, large-scale and multicenter studies are needed to improve and validate our findings.","output":"Proportion and mortality of Iranian diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and cardiovascular disease patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) control programmes rely heavily on laboratories to support both clinical care and public health. Qualified personnel with adequate technical and managerial skills comprise an integral component of any quality assured laboratory. Training a new generation of TB laboratory specialists was identified as a critical priority in the European Union /European Economic Area (EU/EEA). A tailored training programme for TB reference laboratory professionals was developed and implemented within the European Reference Laboratory Network for Tuberculosis to increase the pool of technical experts available to step into leadership roles in the TB laboratory community. Three cohorts of selected laboratory specialists participated in a series of trainings from 2009 to 2016. METHODS: We conducted an evaluation of the training programme using a structured questionnaire administered via the EUSurvey website, with the aim of documenting the benefits and contribution as well as suggesting improvements and future direction of the programme. All graduated participants and all current ERLTB-Net members were invited to participate in the online survey and descriptive quantitative analysis was performed. RESULTS: The evaluation found significant benefits for both the participants and the participants institutions, with improvements being reported in laboratory practices and management including implementation of new diagnostic techniques and career progression for participants. The training programme differed from other international and European initiatives in a number of important ways; the curriculum is unique in the scope and range of topics covered; the programme targets senior level professionals and future directors; cohorts were limited to 8C10 participants; and the programme involved a number of workshops (5C7) taking place over a two-year period. Relationships and collaborations established between individuals and institutions were valued as an important success of the initiative. Suggestions on how the impact of the programme could be enhanced included equipping participants to perform laboratory assessments in low-resource settings outside the EU, thus bolstering global TB control. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings presented the training programme has proved to be successful in developing leadership, expertise, partnerships and networks to support TB laboratories and has contributed significant benefits to strengthening European National Reference laboratories in the fight against TB.","output":"European Union training programme for tuberculosis laboratory experts: design, contribution and future direction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Surgeons regularly educate patients on health promoting behaviours including diet, sleep and exercise. No study thus far has explored surgeons personal compliance with these health behaviours and their relationship with surgical performance. The primary outcomes of this study were self-reported health, health related behaviours, wellbeing, fatigue and surgical performance. METHODS: A survey of validated themes on health related behaviours, workplace variables and performance was distributed to surgical trainees and consultants in the UK and Ireland through the Association for Surgeons in Training (ASiT). Non-parametric analysis was used to determine inferential associations. RESULTS: Ninety five surgeons (51.5% female, 39.9% registrars) completed the survey. 94% and 74% reported good or better overall health and mental wellbeing respectively. The majority (54.7%) reported inconsistent sleep patterns. Less than a quarter engage in regular exercise. Sixty two and 64.2% reported being regularly fatigued and bothered by feelings of anxiety and/or depression respectively. Poor self-reported health and wellbeing were associated with poorer reported off-call performance (p < .01). Higher levels of fatigue negatively impacted self-reported surgical and non-surgical task proficiency (p < .01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Surgeons reported high levels of overall health. However, healthy behaviours around sleep, diet and exercise were not consistently reported. Fewer reported good mental health and emotional well-being. Self-reported health behaviours including sleep and physical activity were associated with surgical performance. Strategies to improve modifiable lifestyle factors which will optimise physical health, mental wellbeing and levels of fatigue may optimise surgical performance.","output":"Self-reported surgeon health behaviours: A multicentre, cross-sectional exploration into the modifiable factors that impact surgical performance with the association of surgeons in training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that public institutions and some households in the United Kingdom (UK) were in a vulnerable and weak financial position to mitigate its immediate outcomes. Public institutions did not have the necessary resources to support their communities and low-income groups were disproportionally affected by the economic contraction of 2020?2021. This paper explores how the disastrous consequences of the pandemic were exacerbated by the implementation of an austerity programme, that as an extension of a neoliberal ideology, supported the development of the market at the expense of reducing the welfare state. Through an assessment of four trends that were reinforced during austerity?the four ?Ds??this article shows that austerity influenced many of the struggles observed during the pandemic. These trends are disinvestment, decentralisation, decollectivisation and disintegration. Despite the lessons learnt in 2020?2021 and the evident need to move away from a neoliberal agenda that dismantled the capacities of the state, this article concludes that neoliberalism continues to threaten the welfare state and the formation of social collectivities. Some expenditure decisions taken by the British government in 2020?2021 could further deepen social class divisions and regional inequalities. More is needed from the government to tackle these social problems and to build a fairer and more equal society.JEL Codes: H0, I3, O1","output":"Austerity in the United Kingdom and its legacy: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies have documented the impact of various types of health care information technology (HIT) on patient outcomes. However, literature on the HIT products is largely for outpatients and little is known about those for hospitalized patients. In 2014, a Korean hospital developed an inpatient portal known as the Smart Bedside Station (SBS). A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the associated factors for accessing the medication view menu (Today's Medication) on the SBS using data from October 2018 through September 2019. A root cause analysis with expert review was conducted to identify additional barriers for accessing the medication view menu. Approximately 92.58% of the study population accessed the SBS at least once during their hospital stay. However, 99.20% of accessed patients used the SBS for entertainment purposes (e.g., television) and 40.16% viewed the medication information. Younger age, higher education, and certain jobs were significant associated factors for accessing the medication information. In conclusion, this study revealed strong associations between accessing the medication view menu on the SBS and a number of associated factors.

Prospective data regarding this approach from randomised trials is lacking. In the PET NECK study, 564 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving definitive chemoradiation were randomised to either planned neck dissection or PET CT scan guided surveillance. In this surgical trial, three radiotherapy fractionation schedules delivered over 7, 6 or 4 weeks were permitted with synchronous chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to determine efficacy and quality of life outcomes associated with the use of these schedules. Primary local control and overall survival in addition to quality of life measures at immediately post treatment and 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment were compared between the three fractionation cohorts. In the 525 patients where fractionation data was available, 181 (34%), 288 (55%) and 56 (11%) patients received 68-70 Gy in 34-35 fractions (#), 60-66 Gy in 30# and 55 Gy in 20# respectively. At a minimum follow up of two years following treatment there was no significant difference between the three fractionation schemes in local control, overall survival or any quality of life measure. Despite the obvious limitations of this study, some data is provided to support the use of hypofractionated accelerated chemoradiation to avoid delays in cancer treatment and reduce hospital visits during the peak of a pandemic.

Through a process of expert consultation, we identified and categorised, into 19 themes and 70 sub-themes, the ways in which biodiversity and its conservation has been or could be impacted by the pandemic globally; nearly 60% of which were broadly negative in impact. Subsequently, we created a compendium (see Supporting Information) of all themes and sub-themes, each with explanatory text, and in August 2020 a diverse group of experienced conservationists with expertise from across sectors and geographies assessed each sub-theme for its likely impact on biodiversity conservation globally. The 9 sub-themes ranked highest were all negative in impact. These were, in rank order: governments side-lining the environment during their economic recovery, reduced wildlife-based tourism income, increased habitat destruction, reduced government funding, increased plastic and other solid waste pollution, weakening of pro-nature regulations and their enforcement, increased illegal harvest of wild animals, reduced philanthropy, and threats to survival of conservation organisations. In combination, these impacts present a worrying future of increased threats to biodiversity conservation but reduced capacity to counter them. The highest-ranking positive impact, at 10, was the beneficial impact of wildlife trade restrictions. More optimistically, amongst impacts ranked 11 to 20, 6 were positive and 4 were negative. We hope our assessment will draw attention to the impacts of the pandemic, improving the conservation community's ability to respond to them in the future.

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6th April 2020. SETTING: UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with acute epistaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re-presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: Eighty three centres from all four UK nations submitted 2631 valid cases. The majority of cases were ED referrals (89.7%, n = 2358/2631). 54.6% were discharged from the ED following ENT review (n = 1267/2322), of whom 19.5% re-presented within 10 days (n = 245/1259) and 6.8% were ultimately admitted (n = 86/1259). 46.7% of patients had a non-dissolvable pack inserted by ED prior to referral to ENT (n = 1099/2355). The discharge rates for ED patients and their subsequent re-presentation rates were as follows: non-dissolvable packs, 29.5% discharged (n = 332/1125), 18.2% re-presented (n = 60/330); dissolvable products, 71.1% discharged (n = 488/686), 21.8% re-presented (n = 106/486); cautery only, 89.2% discharged (n = 247/277), 20.0% re-presented (n = 49/245); and no intranasal intervention, 85.5% discharged (n = 200/234), 15.2% re-presented (n = 30/198). Univariable logistic regression showed that not being packed by ED, antiplatelet medications, failed cautery and recent epistaxis treatment were significant predictors of re-presentation within 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Management of acute epistaxis was notably affected during the initial peak of the pandemic, with a shift towards reduced admissions.

MuV not only causes systemic infection but also has a unique tropism to glandular tissues and the central nervous system. In general, tropism can be defined by multiple factors in the viral life cycle, including its entry, interaction with host factors, and host-cell immune responses. Although the underlying mechanisms of MuV tropism remain to be fully understood, recent studies on virusChost interactions have provided insights into viral pathogenesis. This review was aimed at summarizing the entry process of MuV by focusing on the glycan receptors, particularly the recently identified receptors with a trisaccharide core motif, and their interactions with the viral attachment proteins.

Resuming these programs is a priority, but fewer colonoscopies may be available. We developed an evidence-based tool for decision-making in CRC screening programs, based on a fecal hemoglobin immunological test (FIT), to optimize the strategy for screening a population for CRC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data collected at a regional CRC screening program between February/2014 and November/2018. We investigated two different scenarios: not modifying vs. modifying the FIT cut-off value. We estimated program outcomes in the two scenarios by evaluating the numbers of cancers and adenomas missed or not diagnosed in due time (delayed). Results: The current FIT cut-off (20-g hemoglobin/g feces) led to 6,606 colonoscopies per 100,000 people invited annually. Without modifying this FIT cut-off value, when the optimal number of individuals invited for colonoscopies was reduced by 10C40%, a high number of CRCs and high-risk adenomas (34C135 and 73C288/100.000-people invited, respectively) will be undetected every year. When the FIT cut-off value was increased to where the colonoscopy demand matched the colonoscopy availability, the number of missed lesions per year was remarkably reduced (9C36 and 29C145/100.000 people, respectively). Moreover, the unmodified FIT scenario outcome was improved by prioritizing the selection process based on sex (males) and age, rather than randomly reducing the number invited. Conclusions: Assuming a mismatch between the availability and demand for annual colonoscopies, increasing the FIT cut-off point was more effective than randomly reducing the number of people invited. Using specific risk factors to prioritize access to colonoscopies should be also considered.","output":"Evidence-Based Selection on the Appropriate FIT Cut-Off Point in CRC Screening Programs in the COVID Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Layered systems of commonly available fabric materials can be used by the public and healthcare providers in face masks to reduce the risk of inhaling viruses with protection that is about equivalent to or better than the filtration and adsorption offered by 5-layer N95 respirators.

Alongside this pandemic, people have experienced a parallel infodemic, i.e., an overabundance of information, some of which misleading or even harmful, that has widely spread around the globe. Although Social Media are increasingly being used as information source, Web Search Engines, like Google or Yahoo!, still represent a powerful and trustworthy resource for finding information on the Web. This is due to their capability to capture the largest amount of information, helping users quickly identify the most relevant, useful, although not always the most reliable, results for their search queries. This study aims to detect potential misleading and fake contents by capturing and analysing textual information, which flow through Search Engines. By using a real-world dataset associated with recent CoViD-19 pandemic, we first apply re-sampling techniques for class imbalance, then we use existing Machine Learning algorithms for classification of not reliable news. By extracting lexical and host-based features of associated Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for news articles, we show that the proposed methods, so common in phishing and malicious URLs detection, can improve the efficiency and performance of classifiers.

However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection.

The third and final part of the article focuses on the extent of health-care data use for policy reform in these different economies. Even though these economies differ in their economic structure and population size, they share some similarities on issues related to health-care data. There are two main institutions that collect and manage the health-care data in these economies. In Thailand, China mainland, Taiwan, and Malaysia, the Ministry of Health is responsible through its various agencies for collecting and managing the health-care data. On the other hand, health insurance is the main institution that collects and stores health-care data in South Korea and Japan. In all economies, sharing of and access to data is an issue. The reasons for limited access to some data are privacy protection, fragmented health-care system, poor quality of routinely collected data, unclear policies and procedures to access the data, and control on the freedom on publication. The primary objective of collecting health-care data in these economies is to aid the policymakers and researchers in policy decision making as well as create an awareness on health-care issues for the general public. The usage of data in monitoring the performance of the heath system is still in the process of development. In conclusion, for the region under discussion, health-care data collection is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and health insurance agencies.

Thus, this work aims at solving the problems and improving the disinfection efficiency in cold chain transportation. While Ultraviolet-C (UVC) irradiation is an effective method by which to kill viruses, it is difficult to apply the commonly used UVC-LED disinfection light source to ice-covered cold chain transportation due to its uneven light field distribution. Thus, the light field regulation of UVC-LED disinfection for cold chain transportation is studied. A UVC-LED chip with a wavelength of 275 nm was used as a light source, and parallel light was obtained by collimating lenses. Then, microlens array homogenization technology was used to shape the UVC light into a uniform light spot, with an energy space uniformity rate of 96.4%. Moreover, a simulation was conducted to compare the effects of the ice layer on the absorption of UVC light. Finally, an experiment was carried out to verify that the disinfection efficiency can be increased nearly by 30% with the proposed system by disinfecting E. coli (Escherichia coli), and the results indicate that the proposed system is an effective disinfection solution during cold chain transportation.","output":"Study on the Light Field Regulation of UVC-LED Disinfection for Cold Chain Transportation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous form of acute, diffuse lung injury that is characterized by dysregulated inflammation, increased alveolar-capillary interface permeability, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In the general population, the incidence and mortality associated with ARDS over the last two decades have steadily declined in parallel with optimized approaches to pneumonia and other underlying causes of ARDS as well as increased utilization of multimodal treatment strategies that include lung-protective ventilation. In the cancer settings, significant declines in the incidence and mortality of ARDS over the past two decades have also been reported, although these rates remain significantly higher than those in the general population. Epidemiologic studies identify infection, including disseminated fungal pneumonias, as a major underlying cause of ARDS in the cancer setting. More than half of cancer patients who develop ARDS will not survive to hospital discharge. Those who do survive often face a protracted and often incomplete recovery, resulting in significant long-term physical, psychological, and cognitive sequelae. The residual organ dysfunction and poor functional status after ARDS may delay or preclude subsequent cancer treatments. As such, close collaboration between the critical care physicians and oncology team is essential in identifying and reversing the underlying causes and optimizing treatments for cancer patients with ARDS.

As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. Method: By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0t proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use R 0t to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R 0t ) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R 0t showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R 0t has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R 0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R 0t . Conclusion: The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R 0t is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP. Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.","output":"Analysis of the Transmissibility Change of 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia and Its Potential Factors in China from 2019 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic lethality (SL) occurs between two genes when the inactivation of either gene alone has no effect on cell survival but the inactivation of both genes results in cell death. SL-based therapy has become one of the most promising targeted cancer therapies in the last decade as PARP inhibitors achieve great success in the clinic. The key point to exploiting SL-based cancer therapy is the identification of robust SL pairs. Although many wet-lab-based methods have been developed to screen SL pairs, known SL pairs are less than 0.1% of all potential pairs due to large number of human gene combinations. Computational prediction methods complement wet-lab-based methods to effectively reduce the search space of SL pairs. In this paper, we review the recent applications of computational methods and commonly used databases for SL prediction. First, we introduce the concept of SL and its screening methods. Second, various SL-related data resources are summarized. Then, computational methods including statistical-based methods, network-based methods, classical machine learning methods and deep learning methods for SL prediction are summarized. In particular, we elaborate on the negative sampling methods applied in these models. Next, representative tools for SL prediction are introduced.

We assess the need to use pressurized 02 during the ICU hospitalization. The secondary objectives were to identify the causes of the use of pressurized 02. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We realize an interventional cohort study at the French role 3 hospitals located in the Republic of Djibouti. The criteria of inclusion were all patients aged over 18 years, requiring oxygen and admitted to intensive care. RESULTS: We include 35 patients over 6-month period for 251 days of oxygenation, including 142 days of invasive mechanical ventilation.

Smell tests were performed in 14 of these patients and taste tests in 10. The measurements were conducted in a patient care setting in an early COVID-19 cohort. RESULTS: An olfactory disorder was present in 10/14 patients, before as well as after nasal decongestion. In 2 of these patients, hyposmia was the leading or only symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All tested patients reported recovery of smell and/or taste within 8 to 23 days. CONCLUSION: The data imply that a) COVID-19 can lead to hyposmia in a relevant number of patients, the incidence was approximately 30% in this cohort; b) in most cases, the olfactory disturbance was not associated with nasal obstruction, thus indicating a possible neurogenic origin; and c) the olfactory disorder largely resolved within 1-3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. There were no indications of an increased incidence of dysgeusia. These early data may help in the interpretation of COVID-19-associated hyposmia as well as in the counseling of patients, given the temporary nature of hyposmia observed in this study.

However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane-based targets of viruses and virus-infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, we discover that viroporins, viral-encoded ion channels which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus-infected cells. Through development of a fine-scale library of gradient pH-sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, we measure the cellular membrane pH transition from pH 6.8-7.1 (un-infection) to pH 6.5-6.8 (virus-infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS6.8 ) selectively binds to virus-infected cell membranes or viral envelope, and even completely disrupts viral envelope. Accordingly, GPS6.8 treatment exerts suppressive effects on a wide variety of viruses including SARS-CoV-2 through triggering viral envelope lysis rather than affecting immune pathway or viability of host cells. Murine viral infection models exhibit that supplementation of GPS6.8 decreases viral titers and ameliorates inflammatory damage. Thus, the gradient pH-sensitive nanotechnology offers a promising strategy for accurate detection of biological pH environments and robust interference with viruses.

DESIGN: A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public.

A meta-analysis was performed to measure the frequencies of clinical outcomes and symptoms of COVID-19. A stratified analysis was conducted according to the timeline of outbreak and exposure histories: Group I, most patients were exposed to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and lived in Wuhan, Hubei province; Group II, patients lived in Hubei province but were not directly exposed to the market; and Group III, patients lived outside Hubei. RESULTS: Thirteen studies, all from China, were eligible. The estimated mortality rate among all studies was 2.12%, but that in Group I was 8.66%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in Group I was 20.00%. Both fever and cough were major symptoms, and their frequencies were higher in Group I than in Groups II and III, while the frequency of diarrhea in Group I was lower than that in Group III. The estimated frequency of dyspnea in Group I was 37.18%, while those in Groups II and III were 16.95% and 7.03%, respectively.

This study propose the clinical application of the principle of tissue regeneration priority in small defects (defect diameter <1.0 cm) of nasal sidewall. METHODS A retrospective study of 3 patients experienced the tumor excision and tissue regeneration healing in situ from January 2019 to January 2020. In this group, the nasal sidewall defect was treated with wound moist theory, preventing infection, to promote the wound regeneration and repair.

One of them were left small sunken scars but all of them healed up well and satisfied with the results. CONCLUSION When dealing with the small defect of the skin and soft tissue on the nasal sidewall (defect diameter <1.0 cm), this article provided a new idea that is application of the priority principle for tissue regeneration repair rather than traditional flap used for 1-stage repair. For the small defects of the skin and soft tissue on the nasal sidewall, the tissue regeneration and natural repair in situ can achieve satisfactory effects.

The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of primary studies identified in this rapid review of systematic reviews by focusing on the needs of knowledge users. Methods: This secondary meta-analysis follows a rapid review of systematic reviews, a virtual workshop with knowledge users to identify research questions and a modified Delphi study to guide research methods. We conducted a secondary analysis of the primary studies identified in the rapid review. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and applied inclusion criteria: RCT design using a digital mental health intervention in a population of adults with another chronic condition, published after 2010 in French or English, and including an outcome measurement of anxiety or depression. Results: 708 primary studies were extracted from the systematic reviews and 84 primary studies met the inclusion criteria Digital mental health interventions were significantly more effective than in-person care for both anxiety and depression outcomes. Online messaging was the most effective technology to improve anxiety and depression scores; however, all technology types were effective. Interventions partially supported by healthcare professionals were more effective than self-administered.

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available. During the 2021C22 influenza season, the following types of vaccines are expected to be available: inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). The 2021C22 influenza season is expected to coincide with continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Influenza vaccination of persons aged 6 months to reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza will reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. Prevention of and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html. Recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html, and additional clinical guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 28, 2020; February 25, 2021; and June 24, 2021. Primary updates to this report include the following six items. First, all seasonal influenza vaccines available in the United States for the 2021C22 season are expected to be quadrivalent. Second, the composition of 2021C22 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell cultureCbased and recombinant vaccines), an influenza A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Third, the approved age indication for the cell cultureCbased inactivated influenza vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), has been expanded from ages 4 years to ages 2 years. Fourth, discussion of administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines includes considerations for coadministration of influenza vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines. Providers should also consult current ACIP COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and CDC guidance concerning coadministration of these vaccines with influenza vaccines. Vaccines that are given at the same time should be administered in separate anatomic sites. Fifth, guidance concerning timing of influenza vaccination now states that vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available can be considered for pregnant women in the third trimester. As previously recommended, children who need 2 doses (children aged 6 months through 8 years who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of 2 doses) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered 4 weeks later) to be received by the end of October. For nonpregnant adults, vaccination in July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Sixth, contraindications and precautions to the use of ccIIV4 and RIV4 have been modified, specifically with regard to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to an influenza vaccine. A history of a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, LAIV, or RIV of any valency is a precaution to use of ccIIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution to use of RIV4. Use of ccIIV4 and RIV4 in such instances should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting under supervision of a provider who can recognize and manage a severe allergic reaction; providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. For ccIIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future use of ccIIV4. For RIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4 is a contraindication to future use of RIV4. This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2021C22 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used according to Food and Drug AdministrationClicensed indications.

S-protein is the key target for many therapeutics and vaccines. Potential S-proteinCACE2 fusion inhibitor is expected to block the virus entry into the host cell. In many countries, traditional practices, based on natural products (NPs) have been in use to slow down COVID-19 infection. In this study, a protocol was applied that combines mixed solvent molecular dynamics simulations (MixMD) with high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) to search NPs to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human cell. MixMD simulations were employed to discover the most promising stable binding conformations of drug-like probes in the S-proteinCACE2 interface. Detected stable sites were used for HTVs of 612093 NPs to identify molecules that could interfere with the S-proteinCACE2 interaction. In total, 19 NPs were selected with rescoring model.

Due to the current global emergency and the length of time required to develop specific antiviral agent(s) and a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the world health organization (WHO) adopted the strategy of repurposing existing medications to treat COVID-19. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were previously approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) for anemia treatment and studies have also demonstrated its antiviral activity in vitro. Therefore, we performed a docking study to explore the interaction of IONPs (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) with the spike protein receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is required for virus attachment to the host cell receptors. A similar docking analysis was also performed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins E1 and E2. These studies revealed that both Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 interacted efficiently with the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD and to HCV glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Fe3O4 formed a more stable complex with S1-RBD whereas Fe2O3 favored HCV E1 and E2. These interactions of IONPs are expected to be associated with viral proteins conformational changes and hence, viral inactivation.

However, it is unclear whether laparoscopy-assisted gastric tube reconstruction (LAGT) can attenuate the postoperative systemic inflammatory response after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. METHODS We investigated the postoperative clinical course of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in patients who underwent an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer by LAGT (LAGT group) and gastric tube reconstruction by conventional open surgery (Open group). RESULTS Compared with the Open group, the LAGT group had a significantly shorter operative time (539.6 min vs. 639.8 min), shorter duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation (1.1 days vs. 2.8 days), and shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (2.1 days vs. 4.4 days). The LAGT group also had a significantly shorter SIRS duration (1.4 days vs. 2.7 days), a significantly lower incidence of SIRS, and a smaller number of positive SIRS criteria. Throughout the investigation period, the postoperative white blood cell count was lower in the LAGT group than in the Open group. Additionally, in the LAGT group, the heart rate was lower on each postoperative day (POD), and the respiratory rate was significantly lower on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 4.

Therefore effective prevention and treatment of RTIs remain a high priority worldwide. Preclinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity\\\\targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations and non\\\\specific immunomodulation in the prevention and management of recurrent upper RTIs. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: The idea of this review was to summarise the current evidence and address key questions concerning the use of conservative and immunity\\\\targeted approaches to recurrent and chronic URTIs, with a focus on the paediatric population. SEARCH STRATEGY/EVALUATION METHOD: Literature searches were conducted in March 2017 and updated in September 2017 using: Academic Search Complete; CENTRAL; Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition; MEDLINE; clinicaltrials.gov; and Cochrane databases. In total, 84 articles were retrieved and reviewed. Two independent researchers focused on primary and secondary endpoints in systematic reviews, meta\\\\analyses and randomised, controlled trials, using immunity\\\\directed strategies as the control group or within a subpopulation of larger studies. Existing guidelines and interventional/observational studies on novel applications were also included. RESULTS: Children are particularly susceptible to RTIs due to the relative immaturity of their immune systems, as well as other potential predisposing factors such as day care attendance and/or toxic environmental factors (eg increased pathogenic microbial exposure and air pollutants). Recurrent URTIs can affect otherwise healthy children, leading to clinical sequelae and complications, including the development of chronic conditions or the need for surgery. Available pre\\\\clinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity\\\\targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations (flu and pneumococcal vaccines) and non\\\\specific immunomodulation (bacterial lysates), in the prevention and management of recurrent croup, tonsillitis, otitis media, recurrent acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we summarise the current evidence and provide data demonstrating that some immunity\\\\targeted strategies, including vaccination and immunomodulation, have proved effective in the treatment and prevention of recurrent and chronic URTIs in children.","output":"Immunity\\\\targeted approaches to the management of chronic and recurrent upper respiratory tract disorders in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female doctors and nurses' mental health in Oman Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 402 female doctors and nurses recruited from several health facilities in Oman We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and the Sleep Quality Scale to determine the prevalence rates of anxiety, stress, well-being, and sleep quality Results: A total of 231 (57 5%) Omanis and 171 (42 5%) non-Omanis participated in this study Of the total 402 participants, 28 4% were physicians and 71 6% were nurses One in four (27 9%) participants reported caring for COVID-19 patients One in four (27 9%) had moderate to severe anxiety A higher proportion of Omanis (32 0%) had moderate to severe anxiety than non-Omanis (22 2%) Six in 10 (60 7%) scored at or above the mean on the PSS-10 Doctors and nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients reported higher levels of stress than those who did not Almost half (45 3%) of the participants scored 50% or less on the well-being scale A higher proportion of Omanis and those who cared for COVID-19 cases scored &lt;= 50 Four in 10 (39 3%) had poor sleep quality;this was particularly prevalent among Omanis A multiple regression analysis revealed that anxiety, stress, and well-being were significant predictors of poor sleep quality Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant effect on the mental health of health care workers in Oman In this study, nurses, Omanis, and frontline health care workers were the most impacted by the global health crisis Urgent psychological, social, and administrative interventions and support should be implemented to mitigate mental health risks in these groups","output":"The Mental Health of Female Physicians and Nurses in Oman during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The World Health Organization recognized in March 2020 the existence of a pandemic for the new coronavirus that appeared in China, in late 2019, and whose disease was named COVID-19 In this context, the SBAIT (Brazilian Society of Integrated Care for Traumatized Patients) conducted a survey with 219 trauma and emergency surgeons regarding the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the role of the surgeon in this pandemic by means of an electronic survey It was observed that surgeons have been acting under inadequate conditions, with a lack of basic supplies as well as more specific equipment such as N95 masks and facial shields for the care of potential victims who may be contaminated The latter increases the risk of contamination of professionals, resulting in potential losses in the working teams Immediate measures must be taken to guarantee access to safety equipment throughout the country, since all trauma victims and/or patients with emergency surgical conditions must be treated as potential carriers of COVID-19 RESUMO A Organiza??o Mundial de Sade reconheceu a partir de mar?o de 2020 a existncia de uma pandemia do novo coronavrus que surgiu na China no final de 2019, e cuja doen?a foi denominada COVID-19 Neste contexto, a SBAIT (Sociedade Brasileira de Atendimento Integrado ao Traumatizado) realizou pesquisa com 219 cirurgi?es de Trauma e de Urgncias e Emergncias a respeito de disponibilidade de equipamentos de prote??o individual (EPI) e do papel do cirurgi?o nesta pandemia, por meio de formulrio eletr?nico Observou-se que os cirurgi?es vm atuando em condi??es inadequadas, com falta de insumos bsicos assim como equipamentos mais especficos, como mscaras N95 e protetores faciais, para a aten??o de potenciais vtimas que estejam contaminadas Isso eleva o risco de contamina??o dos profissionais e causa decorrentes baixas na for?a de trabalho Medidas imediatas devem ser adotadas para garantir o acesso aos equipamentos de seguran?a em todo pas uma vez que, todos os pacientes vtimas de trauma e/ou portadores de doen?as cirrgicas de urgncia devem ser tratados como potenciais portadores do COVID-19","output":"The trauma and acute care surgeon in the COVID-19 pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.

DesignDecision analysis linked to a compartmental epidemic model, quantifying the interaction of policy instruments (e.g., vaccination promotion, asymptomatic testing, physical distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions), institutional priorities (e.g., risk tolerance, desire to resume activities), and assumptions about vaccine performance and background epidemic severity. ParticipantsHypothetical cohort of 5000 individuals (students, faculty, and staff) living and working in the close environs of a residential college campus. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Cumulative infections over a 120-day semester. ResultsUnder Base Case assumptions, if 90% coverage with an 85%-effective vaccine can be attained, the model finds that campus activities can be fully resumed while holding cumulative cases below 5% of the population without the need for routine, asymptomatic testing. With 50% population coverage using such a vaccine, a similar \\"return to normalcy\\" would require daily asymptomatic testing of unvaccinated individuals.

Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the association of mandatory mask-wearing policies with behaviors associated with the transmission of COVID-19. Objective To assess the association of mask wearing with face-touching behavior among the general population in public areas. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used videos recorded in public transportation stations, streets, and parks among the general population in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe (ie, England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), and the US to analyze mask-wearing and face-touching behavior in public areas. Videos before the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded from January 2018 to October 2019, and those during the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded during February 2020 to March 2020 in China, Japan, and South Korea and during March 2020 in Western Europe and the US. Individuals who clearly displayed their face and face-touching behavior were included, and those whose behaviors were influenced by filming or public events were excluded. Exposures Mandatory mask-wearing policies enacted at various time points in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, and the US. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportion of individuals wearing masks and incidence of face touching. Results This study included 4699 individuals before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2887 individuals during the pandemic. During the periods studied, mask wearing increased in all regions except the US, from 20 of 1745 individuals (1.1%) to 1090 of 1097 individuals (99.4%) in mainland China (P < .001), 44 of 1422 individuals (3.1%) to 346 of 893 individuals (38.7%) in Japan (P < .001), 6 of 717 individuals (0.8%) to 277 of 324 individuals (85.5% ) in South Korea (P < .001), 1 of 546 individuals (0.2%) to 6 of 379 individuals (1.6%) in Western Europe (P = .02), and 1 of 269 individuals (0.4%) to 4 of 194 individuals (2.1%) in the US (P = .17). Surgical masks were predominant in China (989 masks [89.1%]), and fabric masks were predominant in the other regions (Japan: 371 masks [95.1%]; South Korea: 240 masks [84.8%]; Western Europe: 6 masks [85.7%]; US: 5 masks [100%]).

These patients require highly specialist care, but overwhelmed hospital systems with stretched human resources potentially leave these patients cared for by undertrained healthcare professionals. We describe a rare complication where a routine COVID-19 swab done incorrectly via a tracheostomy tube, resulted in a snapped-off swab in the trachea. We outline the events and our method of removal using rigid bronchoscopy through the tracheostomy stoma as endo-tracheal bronchoscopy was impossible due to significant sub-glottic stenosis. This case highlights the paramount importance of the unique care needed to safely manage tracheostomies during this ongoing pandemic.","output":"A challenging case of tracheal foreign body retrieval following COVID-19 swabbing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 to direct fusion with host cells. S comprises a large external domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Understanding the intracellular trafficking of S is relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to vaccines expressing full-length S from mRNA or adenovirus vectors. Here we report a proteomic screen for cellular factors that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of S. We confirm interactions with the COPI and COPII vesicle coats, ERM family actin regulators, and the WIPI3 autophagy component. The COPII binding site promotes exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, and although binding to COPI should retain S in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs, there is a suboptimal histidine residue in the recognition motif. As a result, S leaks to the surface where it accumulates and can direct the formation of multinucleate syncytia. Thus, the trafficking signals in the tail of S indicate that syncytia play a role in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle.","output":"Sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 Spike facilitate expression at the cell surface and syncytia formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We conducted a longitudinal study to examine person\\\\centered heterogeneity in problem drinking risk during the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pandemic. We aimed to differentiate high\\\\ from low\\\\risk subgroups of drinkers during the pandemic, to report on the longitudinal follow\\\\up of the baseline sample reported in Wardell et al. (Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 44, 2020, 2073), and to examine how subgroups of drinkers differed on coping\\\\related and pre\\\\pandemic alcohol vulnerability factors. METHODS: Canadian alcohol users (N = 364) were recruited for the study. Participants completed surveys at four waves (spaced 3 months apart), with the first being 7 to 8 weeks after the COVID\\\\19 state of emergency began in Canada. The data were analyzed using a parallel process latent growth class analysis followed by general linear mixed models analysis. RESULTS: We found evidence for three latent classes: individuals who increased drinking (class 1; n = 23), low\\\\risk drinkers (class 2; n = 311), and individuals who decreased drinking (class 3; n = 30). Participants who increased (vs. those who decreased) problem drinking during the pandemic struggled with increasing levels of social disconnection and were also increasingly more likely to report drinking to cope with these issues. Those in the increasing class (relative to low\\\\risk drinkers) reported increasing levels of depression during the study. Relative to low\\\\risk drinkers, participants in the increasing class had higher pre\\\\pandemic AUDIT scores, greater frequency of solitary drinking, and higher alcohol demand. Interestingly, participants in the decreasing class had the highest pre\\\\pandemic AUDIT scores. CONCLUSIONS: We examined longitudinal data to identify subgroups of drinkers during the pandemic and to identify factors that may have contributed to increased problem drinking. Findings suggest that while most of the sample did not change their alcohol use, a small portion of individuals escalated use, while a small portion decreased their drinking. Identifying the vulnerability factors associated with increased drinking could aid in the development of preventative strategies and intervention approaches.","output":"A longitudinal approach to understanding risk factors for problem alcohol use during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medications to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed to complement emerging vaccinations. Recent in vitro and electronic health record (EHR) studies suggested that certain allergy medications could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We sought to carefully examine the potential selection bias associated with utilizing EHRs in these settings. METHODS: We analyzed associations of three allergy medications (cetirizine, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine) with testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, measuring the potential effect of selection bias on these associations. We used a retrospective cohort of EHR data from 230,376 patients (18 years+) who visited outpatient clinicians in a single, large academic center at least once but were never hospitalized (10/1/2019C6/1/2020). Main exposures included EHR documentation of three allergy medications and allergy, with an intermediate outcome of receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 test, and the primary outcome as testing negative. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 testing rates varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity and insurance. Increasing age and public insurance were associated with a higher adjusted odds of test negativity, while being Black or Hispanic was significantly associated with test positivity. Allergy diagnosis and use of any of three allergy medications were each associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a test (e.g. diphenhydramine - Odds Ratio (OR) 2.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.73, 3.28; cetirizine 1.75 (95% CI 1.60, 1.92)). Among those tested, only use of diphenhydramine was associated with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.10, 4.55). However, analyses revealed that selection bias may be responsible for the apparent protective effect of diphenhydramine. INTERPRETATION: Diphenhydramine use was associated with more SARS-CoV-2 testing and subsequent higher odds for negative tests. While EHR-based observational studies can inform a need for interventional trials, this study revealed limitations of EHR data. The finding that diphenhydramine documentation conferred a higher odds of testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 must be interpreted with caution due to probable selection bias.
