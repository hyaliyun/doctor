Despite this terse definition, dispersal is an essential process with direct ecological and evolutionary implications that modulate community assembly and turnover. Seminal ecological studies have shown that environmental context (e.g., local edaphic properties, resident community), dispersal timing and frequency, and species traits, collectively account for patterns of species distribution resulting in either their persistence or unsuccessful establishment within local communities. Despite the key importance of this process, relatively little is known about how dispersal operates in microbiomes across divergent systems and community types. Here, we discuss parallels of macro- and micro-organismal ecology with a focus on idiosyncrasies that may lead to novel mechanisms by which dispersal affects the structure and function of microbiomes. Within the context of ecological implications, we revise the importance of short- and long-distance microbial dispersal through active and passive mechanisms, species traits, and community coalescence, and how these align with recent advances in metacommunity theory. Conversely, we enumerate how microbial dispersal can affect diversification rates of species by promoting gene influxes within local communities and/or shifting genes and allele frequencies via migration or de novo changes (e.g., horizontal gene transfer). Finally, we synthesize how observed microbial assemblages are the dynamic outcome of both successful and unsuccessful dispersal events of taxa and discuss these concepts in line with the literature, thus enabling a richer appreciation of this process in microbiome research.","output":"Ecological and Evolutionary Implications of Microbial Dispersal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks in domestic pigs have been reported in Burundi and Malawi and whole-genome sequences of circulating outbreak viruses in these countries are limited. In the present study, complete genome sequences of ASF viruses (ASFV) that caused the 2018 outbreak in Burundi (BUR/18/Rutana) and the 2019 outbreak in Malawi (MAL/19/Karonga) were produced using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform and compared with other previously described ASFV complete genomes. The complete nucleotide sequences of BUR/18/Rutana and MAL/19/Karonga were 176,564 and 183,325 base pairs long with GC content of 38.62 and 38.48%, respectively. The MAL/19/Karonga virus had a total of 186 open reading frames (ORFs) while the BUR/18/Rutana strain had 151 ORFs. After comparative genomic analysis, the MAL/19/Karonga virus showed greater than 99% nucleotide identity with other complete nucleotides sequences of p72 genotype II viruses previously described in Tanzania, Europe and Asia including the Georgia 2007/1 isolate. The Burundian ASFV BUR/18/Rutana exhibited 98.95 to 99.34% nucleotide identity with genotype X ASFV previously described in Kenya and in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The serotyping results classified the BUR/18/Rutana and MAL/19/Karonga ASFV strains in serogroups 7 and 8, respectively. The results of this study provide insight into the genetic structure and antigenic diversity of ASFV strains circulating in Burundi and Malawi. This is important in order to understand the transmission dynamics and genetic evolution of ASFV in eastern Africa, with an ultimate goal of designing an efficient risk management strategy against ASF transboundary spread.","output":"Complete genome analysis of African swine fever virus responsible for outbreaks in domestic pigs in 2018 in Burundi and 2019 in Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ocular candidiasis is a known complication of candidemia. Given the poor ocular penetration of echinocandins, there is some concern that the increasing use of echinocandins may portend an increased incidence of ophthalmic complications. We examined the changing trends in antifungal prescribing patterns and the incidence of ophthalmic complications after candidemia. METHODS: Patients with blood cultures positive for Candida species between January 2014 and June 2020 who underwent screening fundoscopic examination by an ophthalmologist were analyzed. The (2) analysis was used to compare antifungal prescriptions and ocular exam findings before and after 2016. Trend analysis was also performed to assess temporal changes in prescribing practices and eye exam findings. RESULTS: There were 226 candidemia cases during the study period, 129 (57.1%) of which underwent screening eye exams. From 2014 to 2015, 24 of 37 (64.5%) patients received eye-penetrating antifungals compared to 36 of 92 (39.1%) from 2016 to 2020 (P = .008). Overall, 30 of 129 (23.3%) patients had abnormal eye exams with the prevalence of abnormal findings being 7 of 37 (18.9%) before 2016 compared to 23 of 92 (25%, P = .46) thereafter. A trend analysis revealed an increase in abnormal eye findings over the study period (P = .008). Of the 30 patients who had abnormal eye exams, 9 (30%) had a change in systemic antifungal therapy from echinocandins to eye-penetrating antifungals. Echinocandin use was associated with abnormal eye findings. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription of eye-penetrating antifungals for candidemia has trended down since 2016. This was associated with a concomitant increase in abnormal findings on screening fundoscopy. Abnormal eye exams were not uncommon throughout our study period.","output":"The Incidence of Ocular Complications in Candidemic Patients and Implications for the Practice of Routine Eye Exams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Although the efforts at global and national levels have attempted to decrease the COVID-19 pandemic, the low level of preparedness among healthcare providers is a challenge mainly in developing countries. Hence, this study is aimed at assessing the level of preparedness for COVID-19 and its associated factors among frontline healthcare providers in South Gondar public hospitals, northwest Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 207 selected healthcare providers who were working in South Gondar public hospital from July 08 to August 29, 2020. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The healthcare providers were selected through simple random sampling techniques. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions with a 95% confidence interval were fitted with 95% CI to establish the associated factors with a low level of preparedness. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The overall level of preparedness among healthcare providers for COVID-19 was found to be 41.3% (95% CI: 37.4, 44.7). Only 81 (40.1%) healthcare providers had prepared for telling their family and friends if they are infected with COVID-19. Besides, only 23.8% of healthcare providers obtained alcohol-based hand sanitizer in every patient room. Factors associated with a low level of preparedness include being male (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.22-4.94), unmarried (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.44-8.00), and working experience less than five years (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.29-9.09). Conclusion: The level of preparedness among frontline healthcare providers towards COVID-19 was found to be very low. In the future, more emphasis should be placed on healthcare providers who are male, unmarried, and had working experience of lower than five years to decrease the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Level of Preparedness for COVID-19 and Its Associated Factors among Frontline Healthcare Providers in South Gondar Public Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemodialysis is a necessary treatment for end-stage kidney disease patients. It imposes undergoing three sessions of dialysis per week in a specialized center. Amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, precautionary measures were mandatory in all dialysis facilities and may have negatively impacted patients well-being. This study aimed to uncover the scale of this effect. We performed a cross-sectional study of all patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in two dialysis units (one urban and another rural). Patients with Alzheimers disease were excluded. Patients filled a questionnaire including information on socio-demographics, factors related to the dialysis facility, and the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on their mental health. A total of 72 patients responded. Their median age was 70 (60.79) years. Of them, 68% were males, 71% were married, and 10% were living alone. Following the pandemic, 35% felt more anxious, with a higher incidence of anxiety in the rural unit (p=0.021). Half of them felt very limited in their relationships, and 29% were isolated from their families. In total, 98% of patients were satisfied with the staff support. The imposed preventive measures were perceived as very strict in 27% of the surveyed patients. The majority of the urban group were bothered for not eating during the session, and they felt significantly more stress than the rural group (p=0.001). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic increased anxiety among hemodialysis patients from a rural setting.

This study aims to identify problems encountered by patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and their parents/caregivers during the six-week pandemic lockdown in Poland (15 March to 30 April 2020). To determine the factors that influenced health and treatment-related issues, as well as the respondents' perception of the impact of the pandemic, study participants were asked to complete a non-validated online questionnaire comprising 31 questions (including 27 single-choice, two multiple-choice and two open-ended ones). A total of 571 patients or their parents completed the questionnaire, with 9.5% of respondents not performing any blood phenylalanine (Phe) test in the analysed period, 21.3% declaring a blood Phe increase, and 15.3% a decrease. Increased problems in contacting the doctor or dietitian were reported by 26.1% of subjects, whereas 39.3% of them felt restricted access to dietary products. Most (63.4%) participants were satisfied with remote contact with their PKU clinic. Better compliance was associated with higher odds of acceptance of remote contact and of reporting fewer problems with contacting the doctor, and with lower odds of missing Phe testing. Self-reported high stress was associated with higher odds of reporting the limited availability of low-Phe products and Phe-free formulas, as well as with increased Phe concentrations and non-PKU-related health problems. These patients also had poor dietary compliance and experienced more problems in contacting specialists. Health and treatment-related problems experienced during the pandemic lockdown were related to a higher intensity of stress in patient's family and worse therapy compliance before the pandemic. Previous experience of remote visits resulted in a better perception of this method of contact. It seems that this form of communication should be popularized and improved to increase therapy effectiveness in case of different limitations in the future. Special attention should be paid to vulnerable patients who may be at extra risk when the provision of standard care is affected.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Perception of Health and Treatment-Related Issues among Patients with Phenylketonuria in Poland-The Results of a National Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced healthcare systems worldwide to reshape their facilities and protocols. Although not considered the frontline specialty in managing COVID-19 patients, neurosurgical service and training were also significantly affected. This article focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at a low- and/or middle-income country (LMIC) academic tertiary referral hospital, the university and hospital policies and actions for the neurosurgical service and training program during the outbreak, and the contingency plan for future reference on preparedness for service and education. METHODS: The authors collected data from several official databases, including the Indonesian Ministry of Health database, East Java provincial government database, hospital database, and neurosurgery operative case log. Policies and regulations information was obtained from stakeholders, including the Indonesian Society of Neurological Surgeons, the hospital board of directors, and the dean's office. RESULTS: The curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia had not flattened by the 2nd week of June 2020. Surabaya, the second-largest city in Indonesia, became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. The neurosurgical service experienced a significant drop in cases (50% of cases from normal days) along all lines (outpatient clinic, emergency room, and surgical ward). Despite a strict preadmission screening, postoperative COVID-19 infection cases were detected during the treatment course of neurosurgical patients, and those with a positive COVID-19 infection had a high mortality rate. The reduction in the overall number of cases treated in the neurosurgical service had an impact on the educational and training program. The digital environment found popularity in the educational term; however, digital resources could not replace direct exposure to real patients. The education stakeholders adjusted the undergraduate students' clinical postings and residents' working schemes for safety reasons. CONCLUSIONS: The neurosurgery service at an academic tertiary referral hospital in an LMIC experienced a significant reduction in cases. The university and program directors had to adapt to an off-campus and off-hospital policy for neurosurgical residents and undergraduate students. The hospital instituted a reorganization of residents for service. The digital environment found popularity during the outbreak to support the educational process.","output":"Neurosurgery at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: experience from a Surabaya academic tertiary hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) is a patient-reported outcome measurement that evaluates patients' ability to forget the replaced joint (knee or hip) in everyday activity.

Clinical academic training programmes for nurses to develop research and innovation skills alongside continued development of their clinical practice are becoming increasingly established at national, regional and local levels. Though widely supported, geographical variation in the range and scope of opportunities available remains. It is imperative that clinical academic opportunities for nurses continue to grow to ensure equity of access and opportunity so that the potential of nurse-led clinical academic research to improve quality of care, health experience and health outcomes can be realised. In this paper we describe and report on clinical academic internship opportunities available to nurses to share internationally, a range of innovative programmes currently in operation across the UK. Examples of some of the tangible benefits for patients, professional development, clinical teams and NHS organisations resulting from these clinical academic internships are illustrated. Information from local evaluations of internship programmes were collated to report what has worked well alongside 'real-world' set-up and sustainability challenges faced in practice. Clinical academic internship schemes are often opportunistically developed, making use of hybrid models of delivery and funding responsive to local needs and available resources.

We then consider several key factors that have demonstrated relevance in matching people to specific music-based interventions. Based on these key factors, we developed a person-centered framework integrating elements from precision-medicine methodology to guide intervention studies.Results: Our organizing framework systematically integrates the following factors to inform the design of intervention studies: 1) person-centered goals and desired outcomes; 2) differences among individuals in clinical, cognitive, and historical attributes; and 3) the context of intervention and access to resources.Conclusion: Integration of the proposed framework into empirical investigations of music interventions for people living with dementia will inform precise and tailored interventions that will bring clarity to this growing body of research.

Most anti-glaucoma treatments aim to lower IOP by enhancing aqueous humor drainage from the eye. Aqueous humor drainage occurs via well-characterized trabecular meshwork (TM) and uveoscleral (UVS) pathways, and recently described ciliary body lymphatics. The relative contribution of the lymphatic pathway to aqueous drainage is not known. We developed a sheep model to quantitatively assess lymphatic drainage along with TM and UVS outflows. This study describes that model and presents our initial findings. Following intracameral injection of (125)I-bovine serum albumin (BSA), lymph was continuously collected via cannulated cervical lymphatic vessels and the thoracic lymphatic duct over either a 3-h or 5-h time period. In the same animals, blood samples were collected from the right jugular vein every 15 min. Lymphatic and TM drainage were quantitatively assessed by measuring (125)I-BSA in lymph and plasma, respectively. Radioactive tracer levels were also measured in UVS and \\"other\\" ocular tissue, as well as periocular tissue harvested 3 and 5 h post-injection. Tracer recovered from UVS tissue was used to estimate UVS drainage. The amount of (125)I-BSA recovered from different fluid and tissue compartments was expressed as a percentage of total recovered tracer. Three hours after tracer injection, percentage of tracer recovered in lymph and plasma was 1.64%  0.89% and 68.86%  9.27%, respectively (n = 8). The percentage of tracer in UVS, other ocular and periocular tissues was 19.87%  5.59%, 4.30%  3.31% and 5.32%  2.46%, respectively. At 5 h (n = 2), lymphatic drainage was increased (6.40% and 4.96% vs. 1.64%). On the other hand, the percentage of tracer recovered from UVS and other ocular tissue had decreased, and the percentage from periocular tissue showed no change. Lymphatic drainage increased steadily over the 3 h post-injection period, while TM drainage increased rapidly - reaching a plateau at 30 min.

While depression and obesity have been examined in adolescents, there is a paucity of research in AA children. This study examined the relationships among depressive symptoms, obesity, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children. A community sample of 65 AA children completed questionnaires for depressive symptoms and physical activity self-efficacy and also had body mass index (BMI) and BMI Z-scores calculated. Correlational statistics were used to examine associations between variables. Clinically significant total depression scores were present in 22% of children, while 48% were overweight or obese. Overall, children reported high physical activity self-efficacy. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher BMI Z-scores. Results also indicated significant correlations between the childrens physical activity self-efficacy and depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that the associations between depressive symptoms, BMI, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children merit additional examination. Early identification of depression in children may inform future approaches to treatment of psychological and physiological problems within the clinical setting.

We described the use of a state-based, population-level surveillance system on COVID-19 prevention and information-seeking behaviors in Florida during the first month of survey administration. METHODS: Beginning in April 2020, respondents of the Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were asked a series of 8 questions about sources of COVID-19 information and prevention behaviors. We analyzed the prevalence of information-seeking and prevention behaviors among respondents who answered at least 1 of the 8 questions (N = 1,004) overall, by demographic characteristics, and by the presence of chronic conditions. RESULTS: Most respondents reported engaging in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (98.2%), reducing or avoiding travel (96.6%), avoiding crowds and public events (96.5%), and keeping household members at home (87.5%); however, the prevalence of prevention behaviors varied significantly by age, sex, and education. The most frequently reported source of COVID-19 information was the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions website (40.8%) followed by the Florida Department of Healths website (32.9%). We found significant differences in information sources across all demographic and chronic condition subgroups. A larger proportion of respondents with chronic conditions (vs without chronic conditions) reported consulting their personal doctor for COVID-19 information.

The present systematic review therefore aims to perform a comprehensive search of databases to examine the preferable drugs for prehospital pain relief in paediatric patients with acute pain, irrespective of aetiology. METHODS The systematic review includes studies from 2000 and up to 2020 that focus on children's prehospital pain management. The study protocol is registered in PROSPERO with registration no. CRD42019126699. Pharmacological pain management using any type of analgesic drug and in all routes of administration was included. The main outcomes were (1) measurable pain reduction (effectiveness) and (2) no occurrence of any serious adverse events. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos and Cochrane library. Finally, the risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist and a textual narrative analysis was performed due to the heterogeneity of the results. RESULTS The present systematic review on the effectiveness and safety of analgesic drugs in prehospital pain relief in children identified a total of eight articles. Most of the articles reviewed identified analgesic drugs such as fentanyl (intranasal/IV), morphine (IV), methoxyflurane (inhalational) and ketamine (IV/IM). The effects of fentanyl, morphine and methoxyflurane were examined and all of the included analgesic drugs were evaluated as effective. Adverse events of fentanyl, methoxyflurane and ketamine were also reported, although none of these were considered serious. CONCLUSION The systematic review revealed that fentanyl, morphine, methoxyflurane and combination drugs are effective analgesic drugs for children in prehospital settings. No serious adverse events were reported following the administration of fentanyl, methoxyflurane and ketamine. Intranasal fentanyl and inhalational methoxyflurane seem to be the preferred drugs for children in pre-hospital settings due to their ease of administration, similar effect and safety profile when compared to other analgesic drugs. However, the level of evidence (LOE) in the included studies was only three or four, and further studies are therefore necessary.","output":"The effectiveness and safety of paediatric prehospital pain management: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that is often related to a previous infectious exposure.

However, web-based testing presents unique challenges for researchers and clinicians working with aging populations. Older adults may be less familiar with computer usage than their younger peers, leading to differences in performance when completing web-based tasks in their home versus in the laboratory under the supervision of an experimenter. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use a within-subjects design to compare the performance of healthy older adults on computerized cognitive tasks completed at home and in the laboratory. Familiarity and attitudes surrounding computer use were also examined. METHODS: In total, 32 community-dwelling healthy adults aged above 65 years completed computerized versions of the word-color Stroop task, paired associates learning, and verbal and matrix reasoning in 2 testing environments: at home (unsupervised) and in the laboratory (supervised). The paper-and-pencil neuropsychological versions of these tasks were also administered, along with questionnaires examining computer attitudes and familiarity. The order of testing environments was counterbalanced across participants. RESULTS: Analyses of variance conducted on scores from the computerized cognitive tasks revealed no significant effect of the testing environment and no correlation with computer familiarity or attitudes. These null effects were confirmed with follow-up Bayesian analyses. Moreover, performance on the computerized tasks correlated positively with performance on their paper-and-pencil equivalents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show comparable performance on computerized cognitive tasks in at-home and laboratory testing environments. These findings have implications for researchers and clinicians wishing to harness web-based testing to collect meaningful data from older adult populations.","output":"Web-Based Cognitive Testing of Older Adults in Person Versus at Home: Within-Subjects Comparison Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study focuses on budget policy implementation at the level of local governments in Slovakia in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study investigated the association of the IL6-174G/C polymorphism with changes in cytokine levels and its influence on the persistence and progression of chronic hepatitis caused by HBV and HCV in 72 patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV), 100 patients with hepatitis C (HCV), and a control group of 300 individuals. The genotyping of the IL6-174G/C polymorphism was performed by real-time PCR, and cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HCV patients with the wild-type genotype (GG) had a higher viral load (p = 0.0230). The plasma levels of IL-6 were higher among patients infected with HBV and HCV than among the control group (p < 0.0001). Patients with HCV were associated with increased inflammatory activity (A2-A3; p < 0.0001). In hepatitis C, carriers of the GG genotype had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.0286), which were associated with A2-A3 inflammatory activity (p = 0.0097). Patients with A2-A3 inflammatory activity and GG genotype had higher levels of IL-6 than those with the GC/CC genotype (p = 0.0127). In conclusion, the wild-type genotype for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism was associated with high levels of IL-6 and HCV viral load and inflammatory activity, suggesting that this genotype may be a contributing factor to virus-induced chronic infection.","output":"The IL6-174G/C Polymorphism Associated with High Levels of IL-6 Contributes to HCV Infection, but Is Not Related to HBV Infection, in the Amazon Region of Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the migratory flow of infected people with severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), the numbers of confirmed cases of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infections is accelerating worldwide and pre-clinical evidence of antiviral agents that can combat this pandemic is still elusive.

Among the six currently known major CRISPR-Cas types, the type VI CRISPR-Cas13 is the only one known to exclusively bind and cleave foreign RNA. Within the last couple of years, this system has been adapted to serve numerous, and sometimes not obvious, applications, including some that might be developed as effective molecular therapies. Indeed, Cas13 has been adapted to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In a cell-free environment, Cas13 has been used in the development of highly specific, sensitive, multiplexing-capable, and field-adaptable detection tools. Importantly, Cas13 can be reprogrammed and applied to eukaryotes to either combat pathogenic RNA viruses or in the regulation of gene expression, facilitating the knockdown of mRNA, circular RNA, and noncoding RNA. Furthermore, Cas13 has been harnessed for in vivo RNA modifications including programmable regulation of alternative splicing, A-to-I and C to U editing, and m6A modifications. Finally, approaches allowing for the detection and characterization of RNA-interacting proteins have also been demonstrated. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the applications utilizing CRISPR-Cas13 that illustrate its versatility. We also discuss the most important limitations of the CRISPR-Cas13-based technologies, and controversies regarding them.

The Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing \\"red zones\\" need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS: In all Italian provinces a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 km and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities.

Furthermore, there was an increase in the proportion of patients with visual complications [1]. The finding supports the viral hypothesis of GCA aetiopathogenesis as previously described [2]. This not only has ramifications for understanding the underlying disease mechanisms in GCA but also has implications for the provision of local GCA services which may have already be affected by the pandemic. Objectives: The objective of the study was to estimate the incidence of giant cell arteritis during the COVID-19 pandemic years of 2020 -2021 and compare it to 2019 data. Given that there have now been two distinct peaks of COVID-19 as reflected by hospital admissions of COVID-19-positive patients this has allowed us to investigate if there is a temporal relationship between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the incidence of GCA. Methods: The incidence of GCA was calculated by assessing emailed referrals to the GCA service and the hospital electronic medical records to identity positive cases from 2019 to the current date. Local COVID-19 prevalence was estimated by measuring the number of hospital beds taken up by COVID-19 positive patients, available publicly in a UK Government COVID-19 dataset [3]. Results: There were 61 (95% Poisson distribution confidence interval [CI] 47 -78) probable or definite GCA diagnoses made in 2020 compared to 28 (CI 19 -40) in 2019 (Figure 1). This is an excess of 33 cases in 2020, or an increase in 118%. Given that 41% of the hospital's catchment population is over 50, this equates to an annual incidence rate of 13.7 per 100,000 in 2019 and 29.8 per 100,000 in 2020. This compares to a previously estimated regional incidence rate of 21.6 per 100,000 for the South West of the UK [4]. A peak in COVID-19-positive inpatients was seen on 10th April 2020 with a corresponding peak of GCA diagnoses on 29th May 2020, giving a lag period of approximately 6 weeks between these peaks (Figure 1). Conclusion: The incidence of GCA in Bath was significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019. This may be the result of the widespread infection of the local population with the COVID-19 virus as a precipitating factor. Possible mechanisms include, but are not limited to, endothelial disruption by the virus, immune system priming towards T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cellular immunity and/or activation of the monocyte-macrophage system. More work is currently underway to assess the causal relationship between the two diseases. There was a lag period of 6 weeks between the peak during the first wave of the pandemic and the rise in GCA cases.

Methods Participation in this survey was offered to 1730 gastroenterology fellows in the United States during the academic year 2019 to 2020. The survey assessed endoscopic mucosal resection training and knowledge and was approved and administered by the American College of Gastroenterology. Results A total of 163 fellows (9.4 %) completed the survey. Only 85 fellows (52.1 %) reported receiving formal education in endoscopic mucosal resection. Fellow confidence was lowest regarding knowing electrosurgery unit settings. Fewer fellows correctly identified Paris 0-IIb (79, 48.5 %; P < 0.0001) or NICE I (114, 69.9 %; P < 0.01) lesions as compared to other Paris and NICE III lesions, respectively.

Training year, male sex, and provision of advanced endoscopy rotations during fellowship were associated with a higher knowledge score for EMR. Conclusions Nearly half of all fellows reported no formal education in EMR and incorrectly ordered its steps.

Many viruses, including coronavirus and influenza virus, wreak havoc on the control of cytokine expression, leading to the formation of detrimental cytokine storms. Understanding the regulation and interplay between inflammatory cytokines is critical to the identification of targets involved in controlling the induction of cytokine expression. In this study, we focused on how the antiviral cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27) regulates signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 ligation, which recognize endosomal single-stranded RNA. Given that IL-27 alters bacterial-sensing TLR expression on myeloid cells and can inhibit replication of single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated whether IL-27 affects expression and function of TLR7 and TLR8. Analysis of IL-27-treated THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1-derived macrophages revealed changes in mRNA and protein expression of TLR7 and TLR8. Although treatment with IL-27 enhanced TLR7 expression, only TLR8-mediated cytokine secretion was amplified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, inhibited cytokine and chemokine production induced by a TLR8 agonist, TL8-506. Delineating the immunomodulatory role of IL-27 on TLR7 and TLR8 responses provides insight into how myeloid cell TLR-mediated responses are regulated during virus infection.","output":"TLR7 Ligation Inhibits TLR8 Responsiveness in IL-27-Primed Human THP-1 Monocytes and Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media poses a threat to public health by facilitating the spread of misinformation. At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims - as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded.

Because spatial-temporal dynamics of viral spread and immune response are challenging to study in vivo, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a scalable computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of lung cells, including respiratory epithelial cells and T cells. SIMCoV replicates viral growth dynamics observed in patients and shows how spatially dispersed infections can lead to increased viral loads. The model also shows how the timing and strength of the T cell response can affect viral persistence, oscillations, and control. By incorporating spatial interactions, SIMCoV provides a parsimonious explanation for the dramatically different viral load trajectories among patients by varying only the number of initial sites of infection and the magnitude and timing of the T cell immune response. When the branching airway structure of the lung is explicitly represented, we find that virus spreads faster than in a 2D layer of epithelial cells, but much more slowly than in an undifferentiated 3D grid or in a well-mixed differential equation model.

The bioinformatics analysis showed that both proteins have serine/threonine-protein kinases, catalytic domain (S_TKc) with 360 and 753 amino acids, respectively. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K had high expression in the midgut and hemolymph.

Western bolt results showed a positive correlation between RT-qPCR and iTRAQ data for Bmp38, but BmS6K data showed partial correlation with iTRAQ. Injection of anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K serum suggested that Bmp38 may be involved against BmNPV infection, whereas BmS6K may require phosphorylation modification to inhibit BmNPV infection.

In the context of Article 14 of the revised European Bathing Waters Directive 2006/7/EC (rBWD, CEU, 2006) a Europe-wide surveillance study was carried out to determine the frequency of occurrence of two human enteric viruses in recreational waters. Adenoviruses were selected based on their near-universal shedding and environmental survival, and noroviruses (NoV) selected as being the most prevalent gastroenteritis agent worldwide. Concentration of marine and freshwater samples was done by adsorption/elution followed by molecular detection by (RT)-PCR. Out of 1410 samples, 553 (39.2%) were positive for one or more of the target viruses. Adenoviruses, detected in 36.4% of samples, were more prevalent than noroviruses (9.4%), with 3.5% GI and 6.2% GII, some samples being positive for both GI and GII. Of 513 human adenovirus-positive samples, 63 (12.3%) were also norovirus-positive, whereas 69 (7.7%) norovirus-positive samples were adenovirus-negative. More freshwater samples than marine water samples were virus-positive. Out of a small selection of samples tested for adenovirus infectivity, approximately one-quarter were positive. Sixty percent of 132 nested-PCR adenovirus-positive samples analysed by quantitative PCR gave a mean value of over 3000 genome copies per L of water. The simultaneous detection of infectious adenovirus and of adenovirus and NoV by (RT)PCR suggests that the presence of infectious viruses in recreational waters may constitute a public health risk upon exposure. These studies support the case for considering adenoviruses as an indicator of bathing water quality.","output":"Surveillance of adenoviruses and noroviruses in European recreational waters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Im vorliegenden Beitrag berichten wir ber die Erfahrungen mit digitalen Lernhilfen und Selbsttests zur Verst?ndnisprfung am Beispiel einer einfhrenden Datenbankvorlesung mit weitgehend traditionellen Lehrinhalten.

Identifying these individuals before manifest disease would provide useful clinical information. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that combining 2 simple markers of insulin resistance, prediabetes (PreDM) and triglyceride (TG) concentration 150 mg/dL, would identify apparently healthy persons with adverse cardiometabolic risk profiles and increased coronary artery calcium (CAC) compared with those with neither or only 1 abnormality. METHODS A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from 25,886 apparently healthy individuals (18,453 men and 7433 women) evaluated at the Cooper Clinic from 1998 to 2015. Participants were divided into those with a normal fasting glucose concentrations (<100 mg/dL = normal fasting glucose) or PreDM (fasting plasma glucose 100 and <126 mg/dL) and further subdivided into those with a plasma TG concentration <150 or 150 mg/dL. These 4 groups were compared on the basis of multiple coronary artery disease risk factors and the presence of CAC determined during their evaluation. RESULTS Participants with PreDM and a TG concentration 150 mg/dL had a significantly more adverse coronary artery disease risk profile than individuals with either abnormality or only 1 abnormality (PreDM or TG concentration 150 mg/dL). Furthermore, the odds of detectable CAC were higher in participants with PreDM and a TG  150 mg/dL than in participants with neither or only 1 abnormality. CONCLUSION The presence of 2 markers of insulin resistance, PreDM and TG concentration 150 mg/dL, is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk and detectable CAC within a population of apparently healthy individuals.","output":"Relationship between simple markers of insulin resistance and coronary artery calcification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses are an important group of human and animal pathogens that have significant global health and economic impacts.

Since the turn of the century, various organizations have funded non\\\\governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine to provide PWID with needles and syringes, condoms, HIV and HCV testing, and improve linkage to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and HIV treatment. We investigated whether contact with these NGOs was associated with improved HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among PWID. METHODS: Five rounds of respondent\\\\driven sampled integrated bio\\\\behavioural survey data (2009 [N = 3962], 2011 [N = 9069], 2013 [N = 9502], 2015 [N = 9405], and 2017 [N = 10076]) among PWID in Ukraine (including HIV/HCV testing and questionnaires) were analysed using mixed\\\\effect logistic regression models (mixed\\\\effects: city, year). These regression models assessed associations between being an NGO client and various behavioural, OAT, HIV testing and HIV treatment outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics (age, gender, lifetime imprisonment, registration in a drug abuse clinic, education level). We also assessed associations between being an NGO client and being HIV positive or HCV positive, likewise adjusting for demographic characteristics (as above). RESULTS: NGO clients were more likely to have received HIV testing ever (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 4.97 to 5.80) or in the last year (aOR 3.37, 95% CI: 3.20 to 3.54), to have used condoms at last sexual intercourse (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30 to 1.44) and sterile needles at last injection (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.56), to be currently (aOR 4.19, 95% CI: 3.48 to 5.05) or ever (aOR 2.52, 95% CI: 2.32 to 2.74) on OAT, and to have received syringes (aOR 109.89, 95% CI: 99.26 to 121.66) or condoms (aOR 54.39, 95% CI: 50.17 to 58.96) in the last year. PWID who were HIV positive (aOR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.33 to 1.48) or HCV positive (aOR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.65) were more likely to have contact with NGOs, with HIV positive PWID in contact with NGOs being more likely to be registered at AIDS centres (aOR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.88 to 2.92) and to be on antiretroviral therapy (aOR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.83).

Innate and adaptive immune response are controlled by coordinated activity of multiple immune cell types. The functional activity state of immune cells is determined by cellular signal transduction pathways (STPs). A novel mRNA-based signaling pathway assay platform has been developed to quantitatively measure relevant STP activities in all types of immune cells and mixed immune cell samples for experimental and diagnostic purposes. We generated a STP activity profile, termed Immune-Pathway Activity Profile (I-PAP), for a variety of immune cell types in resting and activated state, and provide a first example for use in patient samples. Methods The technology to measure STP activity has been described for androgen and estrogen receptor, PI3K, MAPK, TGF, Notch, NFB, JAK-STAT1/2, and JAK-STAT3 pathways. STP activity was measured on Affymetrix expression microarray data from preclinical studies containing public data from different types of immune cells, resting/na?ve or immune-activated in vitro, to establish I-PAPs. Subsequently data from a clinical study on rheumatoid arthritis were analyzed. Results I-PAPs of na?ve/resting and immune-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, T helper cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells were established and in agreement with known experimental immunobiology. In whole blood samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients TGF pathway activity was increased; JAK-STAT3 pathway activity was selectively increased in female patients. In na?ve CD4+ Tregs TGF pathway activity was increased, while in memory T effector cells JAK-STAT3 pathway activity tended to increase, suggesting that these immune cell types contributed to whole blood analysis results. Conclusion STP assay technology (currently being converted to qPCR-based assays) makes it possible to directly measure functional activity of cells of the innate and adaptive immune response enabling quantitative assessment of the immune response of an individual patient. Envisioned utility lies in (1) prediction and monitoring of response to immunomodulatory treatments for a variety of immune-mediated diseases, including RA; (2) uncovering novel treatment targets; (3) improvement and standardization of in vitro immunology research and drug development.","output":"Measuring host immune response status by simultaneous quantitative measurement of activity of signal transduction pathways that coordinate functional activity of immune cells from innate and adaptive immune system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study was carried out on alcohol-preferring male Wistar rats.

We selected over 200,000 individuals in each of 6 influenza seasons from 2012 to 2018 using MarketScan? databases. The two outcomes were hospitalization or emergency room (ER) visit due to (1) influenza or (2) pneumonia.

Here, we evaluated whether the anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen, may act as a potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor, using an in silico study. From molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we also evaluated the influence of ionic strength on the affinity and stability of the Ibuprofen-Mpro complexes. The docking analysis shows that R(-)Ibuprofen and S(+)Ibuprofen isomers can interact with multiple key residues of the main protease, through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with favourable binding energies (-6.2 and -5.7 kcal/mol, respectively). MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA calculations confirm the affinity of these complexes, in terms of binding energies. It also demonstrates that the ionic strength modifies significantly their binding affinities. Different structural parameters calculated from the MD simulations (120 ns) reveal that these complexes are conformational stable in the different conditions analysed. In this context, the results suggest that the condition 2 (0.25 NaCl) bind more tightly the Ibuprofen to Mpro than the others conditions. From the frustration analysis, we could characterize two important regions (Cys44-Pro52 and Linker loop) of this protein involved in the interaction with Ibuprofen.

Our inclusion criteria included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) who received a LUS. Providers used a 12-zone LUS scanning protocol. The images were interpreted by the researchers based on a pre-developed consensus document. Patients were stratified by clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset) and time from symptom onset to their scan. RESULTS: N = 22 patients (N = 36 scans) were included. Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration. Among N = 36 scans, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal. The remaining scans demonstrated B-lines (89%), consolidations (56%), pleural thickening (47%), and pleural effusion (11%). Scans from patients with clinical deterioration demonstrated higher percentages of bilateral consolidations (50 versus 15%; P = .033), anterior consolidations (47 versus 11%; P = .047), lateral consolidations (71 versus 29%; P = .030), pleural thickening (69 versus 30%; P = .045), but not B-lines (100 versus 80%; P = .11).

In 2011, a novel Orthobunyavirus was discovered in northern Europe causing congenital malformations and abortions in ruminants. From field studies, Culicoides were implicated in the transmission of this virus which was subsequently named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but to date no assessment of susceptibility to infection of field populations under standardised laboratory conditions has been carried out. We assessed the influence of membrane type (chick skin, collagen, Parafilm M?) when offered in conjunction with an artificial blood-feeding system (Hemotek, UK) on field-collected Culicoides blood-feeding rates. Susceptibility to infection with SBV following blood-feeding on an SBV-blood suspension provided via either (i) the Hemotek system or via (ii) a saturated cotton wool pledglet was then compared. Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was defined by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions of head homogenates and related to Culicoides species and haplotype identifications based on the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) gene. RESULTS Culicoides blood-feeding rates were low across all membrane types tested (7.5% chick skin, 0.0% for collagen, 4.4% Parafilm M?, with 6029 female Culicoides being offered a blood meal in total). Susceptibility to infection with SBV through membrane blood-feeding (8 of 109 individuals tested) and pledglet blood-feeding (1 of 94 individuals tested) was demonstrated for the Obsoletus complex, with both C. obsoletus (Meigen) and C. scoticus Downes & Kettle susceptible to infection with SBV through oral feeding. Potential evidence of cryptic species within UK populations was found for the Obsoletus complex in phylogenetic analyses of cox1 DNA barcodes of 74 individuals assessed from a single field-site. CONCLUSIONS Methods described in this study provide the means to blood-feed Palaearctic Culicoides for vector competence studies and colonisation attempts. Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the subgenus Avaritia and 1.1% for pledglet-fed. Both C. obsoletus and C. scoticus were confirmed as being susceptible to infection with SBV, with potential evidence of cryptic species within UK Obsoletus complex specimens, however the implications of cryptic diversity in the Obsoletus complex on arbovirus transmission remains unknown.","output":"Blood-feeding, susceptibility to infection with Schmallenberg virus and phylogenetics of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) from the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]what ties the collection together is an insistence that the politics of (enforced) debt is part of a long history of the political erosion of public support in favor of high finance, and that this bad history has come to a head since 2008.

This study was designed to investigate such and determine the clinical significance in determining mortality risk. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 to July 2020. Clinical details were retrieved from electronic medical records to obtain clinical characteristics, medical history, laboratory tests, therapeutic intervention, and outcome data. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age: 45.5 years), comprised of 62.5% men. In total, 22 (12.0%) patients had severe infection and 162 (88.0%) had mild to moderate infection. Overall, 95 (51.6%) showed abnormal liver function test (LFT) and 17 (9.2%) showed normal LFT at admission. The median age, hospital stay, and LFT were significantly higher in severe vs. non-severe infection (p<0.001). Out of 12 deaths, the majority were due to severe infection (n=11). Deaths were also due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=5), cardiac reasons (n=3), and sepsis with multiorgan failure (n=3). The median age, hospital stay and number of intensive care unit admissions were higher in patients having abnormal LFT compared to normal LFT. Incidence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (42.8% and 40.4%), alanine transaminase (43.7% and 41.6%), and hypoalbuminemia (71.4% and72.7%) at admission and discharge were more common in severe infection. The mean survival was significantly lower in severe infection compared to those with non-severe disease (17.2 vs. 52.3 days; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of abnormal liver function was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 and was associated with prolonged hospital stay; mortality was associated with severity of COVID-19. For ruling out the risk of liver injury, it is crucial to vigilantly monitor the liver function parameters in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital.","output":"Clinical Significance of Liver Function Abnormality in Patients with COVID-19: A Single-center Experience from Western India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Covid-19 has significantly disrupted elective and emergency health care provision including cancer care within the UK. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the staging of oesophago-gastric cancers at presentation, determine the time delay in performing gastroscopy and the multidisciplinary team (MDT) treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all newly diagnosed oesophago-gastric cancers (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) in a single regional MDT was performed between 1st October 2019 and 30th September 2020. Electronic records were interrogated and patients dichotomised into two groups with those presenting before the introduction of the UK national lockdown of 23(rd) March 2020 compared to those presenting post-lockdown. RESULTS: 349 new oesophago-gastric cancer patients were discussed in the MDT (192 pre-lockdown versus 157 post-lockdown). Demographics were evenly matched between the two groups. More patients presented as an emergency admission post-lockdown (28.0% vs 12.5%, p < 0.001). Median waiting time for gastroscopy was longer post-lockdown (23 vs 14 days, p = 0.035).

In situ stabilization is an effective and low-cost method to remediate heavy metal-contaminated sediment. In this study, a red mud-based low-cost composite (RMM) was used to stabilize heavy metal-contaminated sediment. RMM was mixed with heavy metal-contaminated sediment at the doses of 0%, 1%, 3% and 5%. The CaCl2-extractable, DTPA-extractable, leachability (TCLP) and heavy metal fractions were analysed to evaluate the stabilization efficiency of RMM for heavy metals. The selected properties and microbial activities of the sediment were analysed to verify the safety of RMM to sediment. The results showed that RMM reduced the DTPA-, CaCl2- and TCLP-extractable heavy metals in sediment. At an RMM dose of 5%, DTPA-, CaCl2- and TCLP- extractable heavy metals were reduced by 7.60%, 72.34% and 69.24% for Pb; 18.20%, 76.7% and 23.57% for Cd; 32.7%, 96.50% and 49.64% for Zn; and 35.0%, 61.20% and 55.27% for Ni, respectively. TCLP- and DTPA-extractable Cu was reduced by 71.15% and 12.90%, respectively. In contrast, CaCl2-extractable Cu increased obviously after the application of RMM. RMM reduced the acid-soluble fraction of Zn by 6.99% and increased the residual fraction of Ni by 4.28%. However, the influence of RMM on the fractions of Pb, Cd and Cu was nonsignificant. In addition, the application of RMM increased the pH values of the sediment, and the microbial activity in the sediment was also obviously enhanced. These results indicated that RMM has great potential in the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated sediment.","output":"Effectively reducing the bioavailability and leachability of heavy metals in sediment and improving sediment properties with a low-cost composite."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Durant l'pidmie de la Covid-19 et lors des confinements, des fluctuations des dons de sang ont t observes, questionnant la continuit des rponses aux besoins.

SHFV genomes found in different species of African primates have recently been sequenced but no biological data for these viruses has yet been reported. The sequence of one SHFV isolate from a long term persistently infected baboon showed a high degree of identity to the genome of SHFV-LVR, the prototype strain isolated in the 1960s. Similar to what was observed in early studies with the prototype SHFV isolate LVR, infection of Japanese macaques with 100 PFU of the baboon isolate efficiently induced fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. Consistent with the differential infection outcomes observed in macaques and baboons, SHFV infection of macaque macrophages and dendritic cells is more efficiently than that of baboons and infection induces pro39 inflammatory cytokine production in macaque but not baboon cells. A stable full-length SHFV LVR infectious clone was constructed and basic knowledge about the unique functions of SHFV has been expanded by several recent studies. The SHFV genome encodes extra genes compared to those of other arteriviruses; three instead of two papain-like protease one (PLP1) domains are encoded at the 5 end and two adjacent sets of four minor structural proteins at the 3 end. SHFV PLP1, PLP1 and PLP1 were each shown to be active proteases in vitro and the three expected nsp1proteins were detected in infected cells. The catalytic Cys of PLP1 is adjacent to an Ala instead of canonical Typ and PLP1 is unique among arterivirus PLPs in being able to cleave at both downstream and upstream sites. Although the duplicated sets of SHFV minor structural proteins were predicted to be functionally redundant, data obtained with a set of mutant infectious clones, each with the start codon of one of the minor structural proteins mutated, showed that all eight of the minor structural proteins are required for production of infectious extracellular virus.","output":"Simian hemorrhagic fever virus: Recent advances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the interplay of various measures used by different governments around the world in combatting COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses the interpretative structural modelling (ISM) for assessing the powerful measures amongst the recognized ones, whereas to establish the cause-and-effect relations amongst the variables, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used. Both approaches utilized in the study aid in the comprehension of the relationship amongst the assessed measures. Findings: According to the ISM model, international support measures have the most important role in reducing the risk of COVID-19. There has also been a suggestion of a relationship between economic and risk measures. Surprisingly, no linkage factor (unstable one) was reported in the research. The study indicates social welfare measures, R&D measures, centralized power and decentralized governance measures and universal healthcare measures as independent factors. The DEMATEL analysis reveals that the net causes are social welfare measures, centralized power and decentralized government, universal health coverage measure and R&D measures, while the net effects are economic measures, green recovery measures, risk measures and international support measures. Originality/value: The study includes a list of numerous government measures deployed throughout the world to mitigate the risk of COVID-19, as well as the structural links amongst the identified government measures. The Matrice d'Impacts croises-multiplication applique and classment analysis can help the policymakers in understanding measures used in combatting COVID-19 based on their driving and dependence power.

Severe hypotension developed during his sedation for MRI and magnetic resonance angiography. Imaging revealed a hypoplastic pituitary gland within a shallow sella turcica and findings suggestive of moyamoya syndrome. Hemiparesis resolved 5 hours after correction of hypoglycemia with dextrose infusion, and severe hypotension improved with crystalloid fluids and vasopressors. Magnetic resonance angiography repeated 24 hours later revealed resolution of the vascular finding. Additional biochemical testing was consistent with hypopituitarism, and genetic evaluation revealed that the patient had a microdeletion including the LHX4 gene, which has been implicated in combined pituitary hormone deficiency type IV. Hypoglycemia frequently presents with autonomic or neuroglycopenic symptoms. However, when hypoglycemia presents with an isolated neurologic deficit like hemiparesis with preservation of alertness, it can be challenging to differentiate a cerebrovascular event from hypoglycemia-induced symptoms, leading to a delay in endocrine evaluation.

With a pandemic on the scale of COVID-19, antimicrobial resistance has the potential to become a double-edged sword with the overuse of antibiotics having the potential of taking us back to the pre-antibiotic era. Antimicrobial resistance is majorly attributed to widespread and unnecessary use of antibiotics, among other causes, which has facilitated the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.

METHODS: We constructed a probabilistic decision tree of the value of acquiring a chest CT scan or not, expressed in quality\\\\adjusted life months (QALM) of patients and medical professionals. The model was based on the chance of detecting infection by chest CT scan, the case fatality rates of COVID\\\\19 infection, the risk of COVID\\\\19 infection after exposure, the expected proportion of medical professionals exposed, and the exposure reduction derived from early disease detection. RESULTS: The decision to incorporate the chest CT scan was superior to not doing so (12.00 QALM vs 11.99 QALM, respectively), when the probability of patients having undetected COVID\\\\19 infection is 3.5%, potentially exposing 100% of medical professionals, and if early detection reduces exposure by 50%.

Search terms included a combination of the following Medical Subject Headings and key terms: \\"cancer,\\"\\"spirituality,\\"\\"religion,\\" and \\"decision making.\\" We used Covidence to screen relevant studies and extracted data into Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: Among 311 screened studies, 32 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Most studies evaluated the patient perspective (n = 29), while 2 studies evaluated the provider perspective and 1 study examined both. In assessing patient R&S relative to treatment decision making, we thematically characterized articles according to decision-making contexts, including general (n = 11), end-of-life/advance care planning (n = 13), and other: specific (n = 8). Specific contexts included, but were not limited to, clinical trial participation (n = 2) and use of complementary and alternative medicine (n = 4). Within end-of-life/advance care planning, there was a discrepancy regarding how R&S influenced treatment decision making. The influence of R&S on general treatment decision making was both active and passive, with some patients wanting more direct integration of their R&S beliefs in treatment decision making. In contrast, other patients were less aware of indirect R&S influences. Patient perception of the impact of R&S on treatment decision making varied relative to race/ethnicity, being more pronounced among Black patients. CONCLUSION: Most articles focused on R&S relative to treatment decision making at the end of life, even though R&S appeared important across the care continuum.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be conducted in three phases. Phase I will be a formative research to iteratively refine an existing puberty and menstrual health intervention, and to collaboratively design strategies to embed the intervention into government structures thereby promoting scalability. In Phase II, we will pilot and evaluate the refined intervention and implementation strategies using a mixed-methods design to assess (1) feasibility, acceptability and sustainability; and (2) effect on MSRH practices and perceptions and the overall school climate. In Phase III, we will synthesise the research findings in collaboration with the national, regional and district government and non-government stakeholders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This pilot study will provide evidence-based recommendations for a comprehensive, complex menstrual and puberty intervention within secondary schools in Tanzania that can be further tested for broader effectiveness across a larger population.

However, it is unclear how the cellular proteostasis machines have evolved to adjust the protein biogenesis needs to environmental constraints. Herein, we describe a novel computational approach, based on semantic network analysis, to evaluate proteostasis during evolution. We show that the molecular components of the proteostasis network (PN) are reliable metrics to deconvolute the life forms into Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes and to assess the evolution rates among species. Semantic graphs were used as a new criterion to evaluate PN complexity of 94 Eukaryotes, 250 Bacteria and 93 Archaea, thus representing a novel strategy for taxonomic classification. This functional analysis provided information about species divergence and pointed towards taxonomic clades that evolved faster than others. Kingdom-specific PN were identified, suggesting that PN complexity correlates evolution. Through the analysis of gene conservation, we found that the gains or losses that occurred throughout PN evolution revealed a dichotomy within both the PN conserved modules and within species-specific modules. Since the PN is implicated in cell fitness, aging and disease onset, it could be used as a new metric to tackle mechanisms underlying gain-of-functions, and their biological ramifications.","output":"Protein homeostasis imprinting across evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A newly identified coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has spread rapidly from its epicenter in China to more than 150 countries across six continents.

In order to understand the significance of IFN responses in this subset, we examined monocytes during infection with a lethal H5N1 virus that induces high levels of IFN and a low-pathogenicity H1N1 virus that induces low levels of IFN. We show that H5N1 infection results in early recruitment of high numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes and induction of chemokines and Ifnb1. Using unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we also find that monocytes are significantly enriched during H5N1 infection and are associated with chemokine and IFN signatures in mice, and with severity of symptoms after influenza virus infection in humans. Recruited Ly6Chi monocytes subsequently become infected in the lung, produce IFN-, and mature into FasL+ monocyte-derived cells (FasL+MCs) expressing dendritic cell markers. Both Ccr2-/- and Faslgld mice are protected from lethal infection, indicating that monocytes contribute to pathogenesis. Global loss of type I and type III IFN signaling in Stat2-/- mice results in loss of monocyte recruitment, likely reflecting a requirement for IFN-dependent chemokine induction. Here we show that IFN is not directly required for monocyte recruitment on an IFN-sufficient background, but is required for maturation to FasL+MCs. Loss of IFN signaling skews to a Ly6Clo phenotype associated with tissue repair, suggesting that IFN signaling in monocytes is a critical determinant of influenza virus pathogenesis.","output":"Type I IFN promotes pathogenic inflammatory monocyte maturation during H5N1 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For example, collective or community hope is more than the sense of individual hope of the members of a particular community.

This paper, therefore, examined the life expectancyCgrowth nexus and the role of poverty reduction with the view to determine the contribution of health to growth and poverty reduction and the threshold of health required to mitigate the adverse effect of poverty on economic growth in Nigeria. Based on the endogenous growth theoretical approach, the link between life expectancy, poverty incidence, and economic growth was estimated using the fully modified ordinary least square method. Findings showed that health contributes positively to economic growth and also mitigates the adverse effect of poverty on economic growth in Nigeria. The study determined the minimum threshold of life expectancy of 64.4 years as a health improvement annual benchmark. Therefore, for Nigeria to achieve sustainable economic growth and significant poverty reduction, policies aimed at achieving the newly determined health improvement threshold from the current annual average of 47.8 years are fundamental.","output":"The life expectancyCeconomic growth nexus in Nigeria: the role of poverty reduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), in December 2019, the infection has spread around the globe. Some of the risk factors include social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing with soap, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and dysbiosis. Evidence has shown the incidence of total infection and death rates to be lower in sub-Saharan Africa when compared with North Africa, Europe and North America and many other parts of the world. The higher the metabolic syndrome rate, the higher the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Africa has a lower rate of metabolic syndrome risk than many other continents. This paradox has puzzled several in the biomedical and scientific communities. Published results of research have demonstrated the exciting correlation that the combination of young age of the population coupled with their native plant-based diet has lowered their risk factors. The plant-based diet include whole grains (millet, sorghum), legumes (black-eye peas, dry beans, soybean), vegetables, potato, sweet potato, yams, squash, banana, pumpkin seeds, and moringa leaves, and lower consumption of meat. The plant-based diet results in a different gut microbiota than of most of the rest of the world. This has a significant impact on the survival rate of other populations. The plant-based diet results in lower rates of obesity, diabetes and dysbiosis, which could contribute to lower and less severe infections.

This fMRI study assessed the extent to which early adolescents (n = 39, ages 12-14) conform to their parents' and peers' conflicting attitudes toward different types of behavior (unconstructive and constructive) and in response to different types of influence (negative and positive). Overall, adolescents exhibited low rates of conformity, sticking with their pre-existing attitudes 65 % of the time. When they did conform, adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers' attitudes towards constructive than unconstructive behaviors, exhibiting decreased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus during peer conformity toward constructive over unconstructive behaviors. Adolescents were also more likely to conform when their parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive influence than negative influence, exhibiting increased activation in the temporoparietal junction when considering conforming to negative over positive influence. These results highlight early adolescents' ability to stick with their own opinions when confronted with opposing attitudes and conform selectively based on the social context.","output":"Neural sensitivity to conflicting attitudes supports greater conformity toward positive over negative influence in early adolescence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors research focuses on the transformation of the online education market in the current context and the creation of the concept of a digital educational ecosystem.

With the arrival of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in early 2020, physicians across the world were met with a surge of critically ill patients. Emergency physicians (EP) are prone to developing burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to experiencing emotional trauma as well as the cumulative stress of practice. Thus, calls have been made for attempts to prevent physician PTSD during this current pandemic. METHODS: From July 2019CJanuary 2020, emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians at a large, academic healthcare system were surveyed for symptoms of burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). In late April and early May 2020, during the outbreak surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Northeast USA, these same residents and the whole EM residency at the institution were again surveyed for symptoms of burnout as well as post-traumatic stress using the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (PCL-5). A final survey was administered to the EM residents after the COVID-19 surge had largely subsided in June 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-two residents participated in the pre-pandemic study and completed the MBI. Twelve (55%) completed the two follow-up MBI surveys. In the larger EM residency cohort, 31/60 residents completed the MBI and PCL-5 survey during the pandemic peak and 30/60 (50%) completed the follow-up surveys. There were no significant differences in the three MBI burnout category measures of emotional exhaustion (P = 0.49), depersonalization (P = 0.13), and personal accomplishment (P = 0.70) pre-, during, and post-COVID. Of 31 participants, 11 (35%) scored greater than 31 on the PCL-5. Two residents had scores between 21C30, interpreted as at risk. At greater than one month follow-up, 2/30 continued to meet criteria for a preliminary PTSD diagnosis, and five were at risk. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of residents (35%) experienced post-traumatic symptoms acutely during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, potentially indicating a high prevalence of acute stress disorder in this population and increased risk of developing PTSD. However, there was no significant difference in burnout levels in this cohort before, during, or after the initial COVID-19 surge. Early screening for physicians at risk and referral for assessment and treatment may be important to mitigate pandemic-related PTSD.","output":"Burnout and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Emergency Medicine Resident Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes pathological pulmonary symptoms.

The dataset of ligands was obtained from the ZINC database and consists of drugs approved for clinical use worldwide. Trajectories for the passage of individual drugs through the tunnel of the spike glycoprotein homotrimer, their binding energies within the tunnel, and the duration of their contacts with the trimers three subunits were computed for the full dataset. Multivariate statistical methods were then used to establish structure-activity relationships and select top candidate for movement inhibition. This new protocol for the rapid screening of globally approved drugs (4359 ligands) in a multi-state protein structure (6 states) showed high robustness in the rate of finished calculations. The protocol is universal and can be applied to any target protein with an experimental tertiary structure containing protein tunnels or channels.

The attention transfer direction always goes from the teacher network to the student network. Firstly, the teacher network extracts global features and concentrates on the infection regions to generate attention maps. It uses a deformable attention module to strengthen the response of infection regions and to suppress noise in irrelevant regions with an expanded reception field. Secondly, an image fusion module combines attention knowledge transferred from teacher network to student network with the essential information in original input. While the teacher network focuses on global features, the student branch focuses on irregularly shaped lesion regions to learn discriminative features.

Methods Single-center, retrospective study of patients scheduled for treatment between March 19 and June 1, 2020, the national mandatory quarantine period. Patients' demographics, VA, and scheduled treatment during this period were reviewed via medical records. All patients were analyzed regarding treatment attendance rates. The visual impact of COVID-19 was assessed in patients who had been treated and presented a stable VA for >6 months before the beginning of the quarantine. Results This study included 927 eyes from 769 patients. The attendance rate increased throughout the study timeframe (p < 0.001) and correlated negatively with higher patient's age (r = -0.142; p = 0.005). Patients with age-related macular degeneration (67.6%) had lower attendance rates (p = 0.007) and were older (p < 0.001). The visual impact analysis included 400 eyes from 325 patients. The average VA variation throughout this period was -1.7  8.4 ETDRS letters and was similar in different retinal pathologies (p = 0.334).

The focus here is on choosing a spatial model which best predicts the true probabilities of infection, as well as determining under which conditions such spatial models fail. Spatial models tend to predict infection probability reasonably well when disease spread is propagated through contact networks in which contacts are only within a certain distance of each other. If contacts exist over long distances, the spatial models tend to perform worse when compared to the network model.","output":"Spatial approximations of network-based individual level infectious disease models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sleep disturbances are among the common nonmotor symptoms in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD). Sleep can be disrupted by nocturnal motor and nonmotor symptoms and other comorbid sleep disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) causes sleep-related injury, has important clinical implications as a harbinger of PD and predicts a progressive clinical phenotype. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its related symptoms can impair sleep initiation. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a refractory problem affecting patients daytime activities. In particular, during the COVID-19 era, special attention should be paid to monitoring sleep problems, as infection-prevention procedures for COVID-19 can affect patients motor symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and sleep. Therefore, screening for and managing sleep problems is important in clinical practice, and the maintenance of good sleep conditions may improve the quality of life of PD patients. This narrative review focused on the literature published in the past 10 years, providing a current update of various sleep disturbances in PD patients and their management, including RBD, RLS, EDS, sleep apnea and circadian abnormalities.","output":"Current Update on Clinically Relevant Sleep Issues in Parkinsons Disease: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, the virus responsible for the global coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, attacks multiple organs of the human body by binding to angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter cells.

This study describes the clonal spread of a unique strain of MR-MP within a single family. On January 23, 2015, nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from the index case (a 9-year-old girl) in southern Italy. The patient had pneumonia and was initially treated with clarithromycin. MR-MP infection was suspected due to prolonged symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Two further cases of pneumonia occurred in relatives (a 7-year-old cousin and the 36-year-old mother of the index case); therefore, respiratory samples were also collected from other family members. Sequence analysis identified mutations associated with resistance to macrolides. Both P1 major adhesion protein typing and multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing were performed to assess the relatedness of the strains. The index case, the cousin, the mother, and another 4 family members (twin siblings of the index case, a 3-year-old cousin, and the grandmother) were positive for MR-MP. All strains harbored the mutation A2063G, had the same P1 subtype (1), and were MLVA (7/4/5/7/2) type Z. In addition, the index case's aunt (31 years of age and the probable source of infection) harbored an M pneumoniae strain with the same molecular profile; however, this strain was susceptible to macrolides. This cluster of MR-MP infection/carriage caused by a clonal strain suggests a high transmission rate within this family and highlights the need for increased awareness among clinicians regarding the circulation of MR-MP.

Yet few studies have investigated the impact of a vegetables first approach to complementary feeding, especially in New Zealand. The purpose of this randomised control trial is to investigate the effect of starting complementary feeding with vegetables only on infants later intake and liking of vegetables, compared to those starting with fruit and vegetables. METHODS/DESIGN: One-hundred and twenty mother-infant pairs living in Auckland, New Zealand, will be randomised to receive either vegetables only (intervention) or fruit and vegetables (control) for 28 days, starting from the first day of complementary feeding at around 4C6 months of age. Infants will be presented with a brassica (broccoli), followed by a green leafy vegetable (spinach) and sweet fruit (pear) at 9 months of age. The primary outcome measures of intake of each food will be assessed using a weighed food diary. Secondary outcome measures of overall intake, liking and wanting of vegetables will be assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, liking tool and video coding tool, respectively, at 9, 12, and 24 months of age. Infant growth and iron status will be assessed as part of health screening and monitoring at baseline, post intervention and 9 months of age. Other biological samples to be collected include infant stool samples, vitamin D (mother and infant), iron status (mother), and mothers diet. DISCUSSION: This randomised, controlled trial will be the first to our knowledge to investigate a vegetables first approach to complementary feeding on infants liking and intake of vegetables in New Zealand. Comparison against standard practice (fruit and vegetables as first foods) should complement other trials underway, such as the Babys First Bites and Nordic OTIS trial.

However, few empirical reports have been published on its impact on occupational therapists. Clarifying the mental health status of occupational therapists is important to maintain care quality and prevent psychological problems in this population. OBJECTIVE To investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Japanese occupational therapists in prefectures with and without severe pandemic-related restrictions and elucidate factors associated with psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. DESIGN A cross-sectional online survey using region-stratified two-stage cluster sampling conducted May 28-31, 2020. PARTICIPANTS The sample included 371 participants (63.1% women) in the prefectures under specific cautions (i.e., where residents were strictly advised to refrain from outings) and 1,312 in the prefectures without such cautions (61.9% women). RESULTS The increase in workload due to the pandemic was significantly related to an increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and an attempt to avoid talking face to face with others was significantly related to an increase in anxiety regardless of area. In prefectures under specific cautions as of May 25, 2020, the provision of sufficient information on COVID-19 by the workplace significantly reduced the risk of insomnia. In other prefectures, the provision of sufficient information significantly reduced the risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results demonstrate the severe negative psychological impact of the increase in workload resulting from COVID-19 and suggest the importance of psychological support for occupational therapists, such as the provision of sufficient information by the workplace.

We studied the effect of advanced modality imaging with CT perfusion (CTP) or MRI compared with non-contrast CT (NCT) in a multicenter cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of 10 stroke centers who select patients for endovascular treatment using institutional protocols. Approval was obtained from each institution's review board as only de-identified information was used. We collected demographic and radiographic data, selected time intervals, and outcome data. ANOVA was used to compare the groups (NCT vs CTP vs MRI). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with a good clinical outcome. RESULTS 556 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 66  15 years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18 (IQR 14-22). NCT was used in 286 (51%) patients, CTP in 190 (34%) patients, and MRI in 80 (14%) patients. NCT patients had significantly lower median times to groin puncture (61 min, IQR (40-117)) compared with CTP (114 min, IQR (81-152)) or MRI (124 min, IQR (87-165)). There were no differences in clinical outcomes, hemorrhage rates, or final infarct volumes among the groups. CONCLUSIONS The current retrospective study shows that multimodal imaging may be associated with delays in treatment without reducing hemorrhage rates or improving clinical outcomes. This exploratory analysis suggests that prospective randomised studies are warranted to support the hypothesis that advanced modality imaging is superior to NCT in improving clinical outcomes.","output":"Advanced modality imaging evaluation in acute ischemic stroke may lead to delayed endovascular reperfusion therapy without improvement in clinical outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence are amending guidelines to support use of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) as a first-line treatment for patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

The robust integrative review methodology simultaneously sought quantitative and qualitative studies and grey literature from multiple disciplines, identifying only 45 studies directly relating to Australian housing and indoor mould. Twenty-one studies highlight negative health impacts relating to indoor residential mould, with asthma, respiratory, allergy conditions and emerging health concerns for chronic multiple-symptom presentation. The majority of studies reported risk factors for indoor mould including poor housing conditions, poor-quality rental accommodation, socioeconomic circumstance, age-related housing issues and concerns for surface/interstitial condensation and building defects in newer housing. Risks for indoor mould in both older and newer housing raise concerns for the extent of the problem of indoor mould in Australia. Understanding the national prevalence of housing risks and root cause associated with indoor mould is not conclusive from the limited existing evidence.

Both are found in blood and thyroid colloid, where they serve protective functions. Serum SELENOP derives mainly from hepatocytes, whereas the kidney contributes most serum GPX3. Studies using transgenic mice indicated that renal GPX3 biosynthesis depends on Se supply by hepatic SELENOP, which is produced in protein variants with varying Se contents. Low Se status is an established risk factor for autoimmune thyroid disease, and thyroid autoimmunity generates novel autoantigens. We hypothesized that natural autoantibodies to SELENOP are prevalent in thyroid patients, impair Se transport, and negatively affect GPX3 biosynthesis. Using a newly established quantitative immunoassay, SELENOP autoantibodies were particularly prevalent in Hashimotos thyroiditis as compared with healthy control subjects (6.6% versus 0.3%). Serum samples rich in SELENOP autoantibodies displayed relatively high total Se and SELENOP concentrations in comparison with autoantibody-negative samples ([Se]; 85.3 vs. 77.1 g/L, p = 0.0178, and [SELENOP]; 5.1 vs. 3.5 mg/L, p = 0.001), while GPX3 activity was low and correlated inversely to SELENOP autoantibody concentrations. In renal cells in culture, antibodies to SELENOP inhibited Se uptake. Our results indicate an impairment of SELENOP-dependent Se transport by natural SELENOP autoantibodies, suggesting that the characterization of health risk from Se deficiency may need to include autoimmunity to SELENOP as additional biomarker of Se status.","output":"Natural Autoimmunity to Selenoprotein P Impairs Selenium Transport in Hashimotos Thyroiditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients continue to experience different symptoms each day.

We sought to evaluate factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among residents of homeless shelters and to evaluate positivity rates in shelters where testing was conducted in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks or for surveillance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart audit to obtain repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between Apr. 1 and July 31, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate for shelters where testing was conducted because of an outbreak (at least 1 known case) with those tested for surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis evaluated differences in demographic, health and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at shelters with at least 2 positive cases. RESULTS: One thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate.

This systematic review summarises the early literature on clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital, and evaluates the quality of evidence produced during the initial stages of the pandemic. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched for studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 of any age were included. Data on clinical characteristics were independently extracted by two review authors. Study design specific critical appraisal tools were used to evaluate included studies: the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and cross sectional studies, Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for case series and the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. RESULTS: The search yielded 78 studies presenting data on 77,443 people. Most studies (82%) were conducted in China. No studies included patients from low- and middle-income countries. The overall quality of included studies was low to moderate, and the majority of studies did not include a control group. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms early in the pandemic. Laboratory and imaging findings were diverse with lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities the most common findings respectively. Clinical data in children and vulnerable populations were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The early Covid-19 literature had moderate to high risk of bias and presented several methodological issues. Early clinical characterisation studies should aim to include different at-risk populations, including patients in non-hospital settings. Pandemic preparedness requires collection tools to ensure observational studies are methodologically robust and will help produce high-quality data early on in the pandemic to guide clinical practice and public health policy.

Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively.

NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription. Evidence from community studies, administrative data, and small studies of hospitalised patients suggest NSAIDs are not associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to characterise the safety of NSAIDs and identify whether pre-existing NSAID use was associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre cohort study included patients of any age admitted to hospital with a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilation, use of supplementary oxygen, and acute kidney injury. NSAID use was required to be within the 2 weeks before hospital admission. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of NSAIDs and adjust for confounding variables. We used propensity score matching to further estimate effects of NSAIDS while accounting for covariate differences in populations. RESULTS: Between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020, we enrolled 78 674 patients across 255 health-care facilities in England, Scotland, and Wales. 72 179 patients had death outcomes available for matching; 40 406 (562%) of 71 915 were men, 31 509 (438%) were women. In this cohort, 4211 (58%) patients were recorded as taking systemic NSAIDs before admission to hospital. Following propensity score matching, balanced groups of NSAIDs users and NSAIDs non-users were obtained (4205 patients in each group). At hospital admission, we observed no significant differences in severity between exposure groups. After adjusting for explanatory variables, NSAID use was not associated with worse in-hospital mortality (matched OR 095, 95% CI 084C107; p=035), critical care admission (101, 087C117; p=089), requirement for invasive ventilation (096, 080C117; p=069), requirement for non-invasive ventilation (112, 096C132; p=014), requirement for oxygen (100, 089C112; p=097), or occurrence of acute kidney injury (108, 092C126; p=033). INTERPRETATION: NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. Policy makers should consider reviewing issued advice around NSAID prescribing and COVID-19 severity.

METHODS: To determine the impact of CCL2 in inflammation in vivo and to elucidate the CCL2-induced polarization of activated brain microglia, we delivered CCL2 into the brains of wild-type mice via recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV-9) driven by the chicken -actin promoter. We measured microglial activation using histological and chemical measurement and recruitment of monocytes using histology and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The overexpression of CCL2 in the CNS induced significant activation of brain resident microglia. CD45 and major histocompatibility complex class II immunoreactivity significantly increased at the sites of CCL2 administration. Histological characterization of the microglial phenotype revealed the elevation of classically activated microglial markers, such as calgranulin B and IL-1, as well as markers associated with alternative activation of microglia, including YM1 and arginase 1. The protein expression profile in the hippocampus demonstrated markedly increased levels of IL-6, GM-CSF and eotaxin (CCL-11) in response to CCL2, but no changes in the levels of other cytokines, including TNF- and IFN-. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis confirmed increases in mRNA levels of gene transcripts associated with neuroinflammation following CCL2 overexpression. Finally, we investigated the chemotactic properties of CCL2 in vivo by performing adoptive transfer of bone marrowCderived cells (BMDCs) isolated from donor mice that ubiquitously expressed green fluorescent protein. Flow cytometry and histological analyses indicated that BMDCs extravasated into brain parenchyma and colabeled with microglial markers. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that CCL2 strongly activates resident microglia in the brain. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory activation of microglia were prominent, with no bias toward the M1 or M2 phenotype in the activated cells.

However, while there is an abundance of research on theories of SRL, little research explicitly reviews and operationalizes such theoretical considerations. Work is needed to develop frameworks for the practical applications of fundamental SRL theories, helping researchers move from conceptual considerations to operationalization in real world settings. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for investigating SRL in the context of online tutoring for upper primary school learners. SRL is interpreted as a social learning construct, and the framework proposed is designed to investigate the influence of tutor practices on the development of learners SRL.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it has been detected in nearly 200 countries and is an ongoing concern in the United States. Various reports provided anecdotal evidence that many ethnic minorities and specifically African Americans have become ill and died from COVID-19. Coincidentally, several states have provided data that at least initially corroborate the anecdotes. Narratives and descriptive data were compiled from medical and public health professionals to ascertain whether medical evidence supports the over-representation of state-level total infections and deaths of African Americans. The ramifications are critical for African Americans, non-medical professional, citizens, and also to the reduction and mitigation of the novel coronavirus as an American pandemic. The medical and health policy literature suggests that African Americans are burdened with a disproportionate share of persons contracting and dying due to COVID-19. Authors and witnesses believe that their occupation as essential workers, poverty, health access, government distrust, comorbidities, and Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are important factors for further research. For these reasons, federal funding of a rigorous and robust national public health study of COVID-19 and African Americans is highly recommended and the next logical step to develop mitigation strategies that reduce infection, mortality, and disparate medical outcomes.","output":"COVID-19: a Review of the Literature Regarding African American Patient Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lately, one of the major clinical and public health issues has been represented by Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and the risk of transmission of the infection from mother to child. Debate on perinatal management and postnatal care is still ongoing, principally questioning the option of the joint management of mother and child after birth and the safety of breastfeeding. According to the available reports, neonatal COVID-19 appears to have a horizontal transmission and seems to be paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic, compared to older age groups. The aim of this work is to describe a cluster of neonatal COVID-19 and discuss our experience, with reference to current evidence on postnatal care and perinatal management. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational case series of five mother-child dyads, who attended the Labor and Delivery Unit of a first-level hospital in Italy, in March 2020. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables consisted of number of observations, mean and the range of the minimum and maximum values. RESULTS: Five women and four neonates tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In one case, the mother-child dyad was separated and the neonate remained negative on two consecutive tests. Two positive neonates developed symptoms, with a predominant involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Blood tests were unremarkable, except for a single patient who developed mild neutropenia. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We agree that the decision on whether or not to separate a positive/suspected mother from her child should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the parent's will, clinical condition, hospital logistics and the local epidemiological situation. In conformity with literature, in our study, affected neonates were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Despite these reassuring findings, a few cases of severe presentation in the neonatal population have been reported. Therefore, we agree on encouraging clinicians to monitor the neonates with a suspected or confirmed infection.","output":"A neonatal cluster of novel coronavirus disease 2019: clinical management and considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The instances of cyber attacks are increasing as of exponential hike in online processing amid COVID-19 pandemic scenario that significantly compromising huge number of confidential data as well With the rising security demands, the detection of cyber-attacks has emerged as a promising field that offers wider scope for the application developers In the similar scenario, authors have proposed an improved detection system that could effectively detect attacks as DDoS, malware etc Initially, Genetic Algorithm is implemented for the feature section and reducing the size of data thereby reducing the computational work load of classifiers In second phase, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Artificial Bee colony (ABC) is used to divides the data into four categories and also filters out the irrelevant features In later stages, Artificial Neural Network is employed whose results are refined by Support Vector Machine (SVM) The novelty of the work lies in the precise detection of the malicious behaviour of the nodes This ANN-SVM hybrid approach enhanced the classification efficiency of the proposed system in identifying the cyber-attacks The simulation study over 1000 rounds reflects the performance of the proposed system in terms of higher precision, recall and f-measure in comparison to the existing works dedicated to deal with DDoS attacks Also, the proposed work demonstrated better outcomes in terms of average True Positive rate and False Positive rate ? 2020, Engg Journals Publications All rights reserved","output":"A hybrid approach for cyber security: Improved intrusion detection system using ann-svm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the years, multiple biomarkers have been used to aid in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy. As of late, protein biomarkers are gaining strength in their role for early disease diagnosis and prognosis in part due to the advancements in identification and characterization of a distinct functional pool of proteins known as proteoforms. Proteoforms are defined as all of the different molecular forms of a protein derived from a single gene caused by genetic variations, alternative spliced RNA transcripts and post-translational modifications. Monitoring the structural changes of each proteoform of a particular protein is essential to elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms that guide the course of disease. Clinical proteomics therefore holds the potential to offer further insight into disease pathology, progression, and prevention. Nevertheless, more technologically advanced diagnostic methods are needed to improve the reliability and clinical applicability of proteomics in preventive medicine. In this manuscript, we review the use of immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE) as an emerging powerful diagnostic tool to isolate, separate, detect and characterize proteoform biomarkers obtained from liquid biopsy. IACE is an affinity capture-separation technology capable of isolating, concentrating and analyzing a wide range of biomarkers present in biological fluids. Isolation and concentration of target analytes is accomplished through binding to one or more biorecognition affinity ligands immobilized to a solid support, while separation and analysis are achieved by high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to one or more detectors. IACE has the potential to generate rapid results with significant accuracy, leading to reliability and reproducibility in diagnosing and monitoring disease. Additionally, IACE has the capability of monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic agents by quantifying companion and complementary protein biomarkers. With advancements in telemedicine and artificial intelligence, the implementation of proteoform biomarker detection and analysis may significantly improve our capacity to identify medical conditions early and intervene in ways that improve health outcomes for individuals and populations.","output":"Immunoaffinity Capillary Electrophoresis in the Era of Proteoforms, Liquid Biopsy and Preventive Medicine: A Potential Impact in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Disease Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The implementation of effective control measures in a timely fashion is crucial to control the epidemic outbreak of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to analyze the control measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as evaluating the responses and outcomes at different phases for epidemic control in Taiwan. (2) Methods: This case study reviewed responses to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of a range of control measures implemented for epidemic control in Taiwan and assessed all laboratory-confirmed cases between 11 January until 20 December 2020, inclusive of these dates. The confirmation of COVID-19 infection was defined as the positive result of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction test taken from a nasopharyngeal swab. Test results were reported by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence rate, mortality rate, and testing rate were compiled, and the risk ratio was provided to gain insights into the effectiveness of prevention measures. (3) Results and Discussion: This study presents retrospective data on the COVID-19 incidence rate in Taiwan, combined with the vital preventive control measures, in a timeline of the early stage of the epidemic that occurred in Taiwan. The implementation of multiple strategy control measures and the assistance of technologies to control the COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan led to a relatively slower trend in the outbreak compared to the neighboring countries. In Taiwan, 766 confirmed patients were included, comprised of 88.1% imported cases and 7.2% local transmission cases, within the studied period. The incidence rate of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the studied period was 32 per million people, with a mortality rate of 0.3 per million people. Our analysis showed a significantly raised incidence risk ratio in the countries of interest in comparison to Taiwan during the study period; in the range of 1.9 to 947.5. The outbreak was brought under control through epidemic policies and hospital strategies implemented by the Taiwan Government.

ObjectiveTo determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s)COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s)Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. ResultsCompared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will be a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and RelevanceIn addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.

FindingsUsing a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months. MeaningEven with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities.","output":"Forecasting COVID-19 impact on hospital bed-days, ICU-days, ventilator-days and deaths by US state in the next 4 months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventive procedures against COVID-19 pandemic have caused many changes in everyday lifes material aspects.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, scientists struggled to manage tasks and academic journals announced possible publication delays due to reduced editorial capacity. In this context, COVID-19 research has been somewhat paradoxical, due to societal and editorial pressures for fast publication. We hypothesised that given the urgency of disseminating pandemic-related information, articles on the topic would be published as a priority in 2020. We analysed the submission-to-publication time lag for 5790 articles published between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 in eight ecology and eight medical journals. We also analysed patterns in the gender of first and last authors. All 16 journals were international, with relatively high impact factor (between 2.34 and 36.13) and partially or fully open access. Even though articles in general took longer to get published, the speed of publication increased in 2020, as the faster review of 419 COVID-19 articles compensated for the longer submission-to-publication time lag of non-COVID-19 publications. Manuscripts in journals with a higher impact factor and only partial open access took longer to get published during the last three years. In 2020, the ratio of articles with male and female first and last authors remained similar to that in 2019, maintaining the gender bias in scientific productivity.

As a result of the high communicability of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), individuals are reluctant to visit medical institutions. It is as yet unclear how the oral health of the population has been affected by the interruption of regular medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the association between the status of regular dental visits and changes in oral health among high school students during the pandemic using data from routine medical checkups conducted at a school, as well as data obtained from a questionnaire-based survey conducted simultaneously with medical checkups.MethodsThis study included 878 participants (comprising freshmen and sophomores) during the 2019 academic year from a high school in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. Data on the frequency of dental checkups and anxiety related to dental visits during the pandemic was obtained through a questionnaire-based survey. Changes in dental health and gingival status between 2019 and 2020 were determined using data from routine medical checkups at the school. Poisson regression analysis with robust standard errors was used to evaluate the association between changes in dental health and gingival status and the status of regular dental visits.ResultsOf 878 participants, 417 (47.5%) did not have regular dental visits, 320 (36.4%) continued to have regular dental visits, and 141 (16.1%) had interrupted regular dental visits during the pandemic. In the interrupted regular dental visit group, 30.5% of participants were anxious about visiting a dental institution, which was a significantly higher proportion than other groups.

Conversely, IBD patient VLPs provoked inflammation, which was successfully dampened by healthy VLPs. The IBD colon tissue virome was perturbed, including enriched Picornovirus Enterovirus B, not previously observed in fecal virome studies. Mice with humanized healthy colon tissue viromes had attenuated intestinal inflammation while those with IBD-derived viromes exhibited exacerbated inflammation in a nucleic acid sensing-dependent fashion. Furthermore, there were detrimental consequences for IBD-associated MDA5 loss-of-function on patient intestinal epithelial cells exposed to healthy or IBD viromes.

A four-phase approach was applied. Phase 1: Clinical assessment and exploring background history of exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Phase 2: Individual tailored GastroAxEx laboratory simulation designed to mirror exercise stress, highlighted in phase 1, that promotes EIGS and GIS during exercise. Phase 3: Individually programmed therapeutic intervention, based on the outcomes of Phase 2. Phase 4: Monitoring and readjustment of intervention based on outcomes from field testing under training and race conditions. Nine endurance athletes presenting with EIGS, and two control athletes not presenting with EIGS, completed Phase 2. Two athletes experienced significant thermoregulatory strain (peak core temperature attained > 40C) during the GastroAxEx. Plasma cortisol increased substantially pre- to post-exercise in n = 6/7 ( > 500 nmol/L). Plasma I-FABP concentration increased substantially pre- to post-exercise in n = 2/8 ( > 1,000 pg/ml). No substantial change was observed in pre- to post-exercise for systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profiles in all athletes. Breath H2 responses showed that orocecal transit time (OCTT) was delayed in n = 5/9 (90-150 min post-exercise) athletes, with the remaining athletes (n = 4/9) showing no H2 turning point by 180 min post-exercise. Severe GIS during exercise was experienced in n = 5/9 athletes, of which n = 2/9 had to dramatically reduce work output or cease exercise. Based on each athlete's identified proposed causal factors of EIGS and GIS during exercise (i.e., n = 9/9 neuroendocrine-gastrointestinal pathway of EIGS), an individualised gastrointestinal therapeutic intervention was programmed and advised, adjusted from a standard EIGS prevention and management template that included established strategies with evidence of attenuating EIGS primary causal pathways, exacerbation factors, and GIS during exercise. All participants reported qualitative data on their progress, which included their previously presenting GIS during exercise, such as nausea and vomiting, either being eliminated or diminished resulting in work output improving (i.e., completing competition and/or not slowing down during training or competition as a result of GIS during exercise). These outcomes suggest GIS during exercise in endurance athletes are predominantly related to gastrointestinal functional and feeding tolerance issues, and not necessarily gastrointestinal integrity and/or systemic issues. GastroAxEx allows for informed identification of potential causal pathway(s) and exacerbation factor(s) of EIGS and GIS during exercise at an individual level, providing a valuable informed individualised therapeutic intervention approach.","output":"Gastrointestinal Assessment and Therapeutic Intervention for the Management of Exercise-Associated Gastrointestinal Symptoms: A Case Series Translational and Professional Practice Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic, the last 2 years have been active periods for hypertension research and initiatives in Asia.

The authors describe their experience with this patient population and seek to identify predictors of sufficiency of endoscopic surgery alone. METHODS The medical records of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent endoscopic repair were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, operative details, and follow-up data were collected. RESULTS A total of 6 patients with syndromic craniosynostosis underwent endoscopic surgery followed by helmet therapy during the study period. Of these, 3 patients were male. The involved syndromes included Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Jackson-Weiss, Muenke, Saethre-Chotzen, and craniosynostosis-3 (n = 1 each). The patients underwent endoscopic surgery at a median age of 2.1 months (range 0.9-4.1 months). The median estimated blood loss was 30 ml (range 20-100 ml), with 2 patients requiring a transfusion. The median length of stay in the hospital was 1.5 days (range 1-4 days), and the median follow-up was 29.0 months (range 16.8-81.7 months), with 1 patient (16.7%) requiring an open revision. Three patients (50%) were classified as Whitaker Category I at the last follow-up. The patients for whom additional open surgery was performed or recommended (Whitaker Category IV) were the oldest patients in the cohort, ranging from 2.6 to 4.1 months at the time of surgery. CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates that endoscopic surgery can be sufficient to treat syndromic craniosynostosis without subsequent open calvarial remodeling over a median follow-up period of at least 2 years. The findings suggest that younger age at the time of endoscopic surgery may be an important factor in determining the sufficiency of this procedure. Even among patients who require subsequent open calvarial remodeling, early endoscopic surgery may allow for growth and development of the brain and skull while delaying the need for open remodeling until the patient is older and can better tolerate the procedure.","output":"Endoscopic surgery for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and the requirement for additional open surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cloud computing has become the infrastructure that supports people's daily activities, business operations, and education delivery around the world.

The current trial served to further investigate I-C in patients with early common cold symptoms. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase IV trial was conducted in 200 adult patients with self-diagnosed colds of <48 h duration that were confirmed by baseline cold symptom scores. Patients were to self-administer 0.12 % I-C or placebo spray (NaCl 0.5 %) four times daily for four to ten days and record symptom information for ten days. Common respiratory viruses were quantified by RT-PCR during pretreatment and on Day 3 or 4. The primary endpoint was the mean total symptom score (TSS) of eight cold symptoms on Days 2C4 (TSS(2C4)). RESULTS: Patients in both treatment groups had similar baseline TSSs (mean TSS: 6.75 for I-C and 6.79 for placebo). Viruses were detected in baseline samples from 53 of 98 I-C patients (54.1 %) and 54 of 97 placebo patients (55.7 %). Mean  SE for TSS(2C4) was 5.78  0.25 for I-C patients and 6.39  0.25 for placebo (p = 0.0895). Exploratory analyses after unblinding (TSS(2C4) excluding a patient with aberrantly high symptom scores [TSS(2C4, ex 1pt)]; mean of TSS over Days 1C4 [TSS(1C4)]; change in TSS(1C4) relative to baseline [TSS(1C4, rel)]) demonstrated treatment differences in favor of I-C (p = 0.0364, p = 0.0495 and p = 0.0421, respectively). For patients with quantifiable rhinovirus/enterovirus at baseline, there was a trend towards greater reduction of virus load at Day 3 or 4 (p = 0.0958; I-C: 90.2 % reduction in viral load; placebo: 72.0 %). Treatments were well tolerated with no differences in adverse event rates. CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between I-C and placebo but showed a trend towards I-C benefit. Exploratory analyses indicated significant reduction of cold symptoms in the I-C group relative to placebo during the first four days when symptoms were most severe, and also substantiated I-Cs activity against rhinovirus/enterovirus.

From the medical point of view, the data might be useful to clinicians and vaccinologists to develop and evaluate immunomodulatory and immunotherapeutic approaches. As a matter of fact, primates seem to be unreliable animal models for revealing potential autoimmune events in preclinical testing of immunotherapies.

Vaccination is a vital tool in controlling the pandemic. With accelerated infection rates in various parts of the world, the incidence of variants has risen and threatens to set back the long sought after immunity, provided by available vaccines. The objective of this study was to evaluate the breakthrough infection rate after complete vaccination, in Sangamon County, with a rural and urban population of 195,000 in Central Illinois. METHODS: Data regarding breakthrough infections collected from the Sangamon County Department of Public Health, included the total number of infections, time after vaccination, age range of those infected and the type of vaccine used. Complete vaccination was defined as 14 days after the single dose of Johnson & Johnson/Janssen or the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Inc. vaccine. RESULTS: The number of fully vaccinated individuals at the time of writing of this study was 87,086 which corresponded to 44.58 % of the total population. The breakthrough infection percentage was calculated as 0.036%. The mean time after vaccination to infection was 49.13 days with a standard deviation of 23.28. CONCLUSION: Breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated individuals in our county, have been quite rare, which points to the high efficacy of the vaccines. A complex number of factors likely contribute to this including virus-related factors i.e. variant forms and specific patient-related factors which are not a part of this study.

This paper considers these findings in the light of the literature on Jewish mortality and undertakes a re-analysis of the results alongside the additional data on Jewish deaths provided by the British Jewish communal statistics. It asks two questions: (1) To what extent is elevated British Jewish mortality from COVID-19 a result of the presence of long-standing vulnerability and ill health among Jews? (2) What role do strictly Orthodox Jews play in elevating coronavirus mortality levels among British Jews? The primary contribution of the paper is to explore, via analyses of alternative data sources, the ONS finding of elevated Jewish mortality from coronavirus, to explain why it is surprising, to test whether it is real and to eliminate certain explanations. Such process of elimination in itself will highlight other alternative explanations, but the paper falls short of decisively explaining the phenomenon of the elevated British Jewish mortality from coronavirus.

Up to now, eleven genotypes have been identified however, their clinical significance remains unclear. Here, we investigated the presence of SAFV in asymptomatic patients admitted for adenoidectomy. A total of 70 adenoid tissue samples were collected from children with clinical symptoms caused by hypertrophy of adenoids but without symptoms of airway infection. Samples were investigated for SAFV by RT-nested PCR and sequence analysis. Eleven of 70 (15.7%) samples were positive for SAFV. Nasopharyngeal swabs were available from 45 children just before surgery. SAFV was rarely found and only in children with SAFV-positive adenoids 2/8. Our findings indicate that the presence of SAFV seems to be more frequent in adenoid tissue than expected. This could support the notion of a longer than previously anticipated persistence of SAFV nucleic acids in the respiratory tract and possibly a chronic infection. Further investigations are necessary to establish the role of SAFV infection in humans.","output":"Frequent detection of Saffold cardiovirus in adenoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the need to prepare for the development of antiviral therapeutics for the next pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination education and logistical intervention on adolescent psychosocial outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cluster randomized trial and process and qualitative evaluation, adolescents aged 12 to 13 years (first year of high school) were recruited at high schools in Western Australia (WA) and South Australia (SA) in 2013 and 2014. Statistical analysis was performed from January 2016 to December 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The complex intervention consisted of an adolescent intervention to promote knowledge and psychosocial outcomes, shared decisional support tool, and logistical strategies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prespecified secondary outcomes were assessed. The HPV Adolescent Vaccination Intervention Questionnaire (HAVIQ) was used to measure changes in adolescent knowledge (6-item subscale), fear and anxiety (6-item subscale), self-efficacy (5-item subscale), and decision-making (8-item subscale). The hypothesis was that the intervention would improve adolescent involvement in vaccine decision-making (measured before dose 1 only), improve vaccine-related self-efficacy, and reduce vaccine-related fear and anxiety (measured before doses 1, 2, and 3). Mean (SD) scores for each subscale were compared between intervention and control students. In the process evaluation, focus groups were conducted. Analyses of the HAVIQ data were conducted from 2016 to 2020. Qualitative analyses of the focus groups were undertaken from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: The trial included 40 schools (21 intervention and 19 control) across sectors with 6967 adolescents (mean [SD] age, 13.70 [0.45] years). There were 3805 students (1689 girls and 2116 boys) in the intervention group and 3162 students (1471 girls and 1691 boys) in the control group. The overall response rate for the HAVIQ was 55%. In WA, where parental consent was required, the response rate was 35% (1676 of 4751 students); in SA, where parental consent was not required, it was 97% (2166 of 2216 students). The mean (SD) score for decision-making in the intervention group before dose 1 was 3.50 (0.42) of 5 points and 3.40 (0.40) in the control group, a small but significant difference of 0.11 point (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.16 point; P < .001). There was a small difference in favor of the intervention group in reduced vaccination-related anxiety (preCdose 1 difference, ?0.11 point [95% CI, ?0.19 to ?0.02 point]; preCdose 2 difference, ?0.18 point [95% CI, ?0.26 to ?0.10 point]; preCdose 3 difference, ?0.18 [95% CI, ?0.24 to ?0.11]) and increased vaccination self-efficacy (preCdose 1 difference, 4.0 points; [95% CI, 1.0 to 7.0 points]; preCdose 2 difference, 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.0 to 6.0 points]; preCdose 3 difference, 3.0 points [95% CI, 1.0 to 5.0 points]). Focus group data from 111 adolescents in 6 intervention and 5 control schools revealed more confidence and less anxiety with each vaccine dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster randomized trial, there was a small difference in adolescent decisional involvement and vaccine-related confidence and reduced vaccination-related fear and anxiety that was maintained throughout the vaccine course in the intervention vs control groups. Guidelines for vaccination at school should incorporate advice regarding how this outcome can be achieved.

We investigated immigrants health status and health deterioration over time in terms of the prevalence of chronic diseases (CDs) and their relationship to vitD status. Methods: We used cycles three (2012C2013) and four (2014C2015) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey. These data contained unique health information and direct physical/blood measures, including serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D). Indicators of health status and deterioration were the prevalence of CDs diagnosed by healthcare professionals, self-reported general and mental health, and CD-related biomarkers. Results: The data (n = 11,579) included immigrants from more than 153 countries. Immigrants were healthier than non-immigrants for most health status measures. The prevalence of CDs was higher among those who migrated to Canada aged  18 years. A longer time in Canada after immigration was associated with a higher risk for CDs. The mean S-25(OH)D was lower among immigrants, higher among patients with CDs, and inversely associated with glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, immunoglobulin E, serum ferritin, and blood hemoglobin. After adjusting for covariates, no association was found between S-25(OH)D and the prevalence of CDs. Conclusions: Lower levels of accumulated S-25(OH)D among immigrants may impact their health profile in terms of CD-related biomarkers, which partially explains immigrants health deterioration over time.

Many countries have faced a shortage of diagnostic kits as well as a lack of infrastructure to perform necessary testing. Due to these limiting factors, only patients showing symptoms indicating infection were subjected to testing, whilst asymptomatic individuals, who are widely believed to be responsible for the fast dispersion of the virus, were largely omitted from the testing regimes. The inability to implement high throughput diagnostic and contact tracing strategies has forced many countries to institute lockdowns with severe economic and social consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged affected countries to increase testing capabilities to identify new cases, allow for a well-controlled lifting of lockdown measures, and prepare for future outbreaks. Here, we propose HiDRA-seq, a rapidly implementable, high throughput, and scalable solution that uses NGS lab infrastructure and reagents for population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. This method is based on the use of indexed oligo-dT primers to generate barcoded cDNA from a large number of patient samples. From this, highly multiplexed NGS libraries are prepared targeting SARS-CoV-2 specific regions and sequenced. The low amount of sequencing data required for diagnosis allows the combination of thousands of samples in a sequencing run, while reducing the cost to approximately 2 CHF/EUR/USD per RNA sample.

We assessed the effect of TM (AirView Online System, ResMed) during the CPAP habituation phase on 3-month and 1-year treatment adherence and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: At CPAP initiation, 120 patients diagnosed with OSA were randomized to either usual care (UC) or TM during the habituation phase (clinical registration: ISRCTN12865936). Both groups received a first face-to-face appointment with a sleep care giver at CPAP initiation. Within the following month, 2 other physical visits were scheduled in the UC group whereas two phone consultations were planned in the TM group, in which CPAP parameters were remotely adapted. Additional physical visits were programmed at the patient's request. Face-to-face consultations were scheduled at 3 and 12 months after CPAP initiation. The primary outcome was the mean CPAP daily use over the course of 12 months. Results: Twenty of 60 patients stopped CPAP therapy in the UC group vs. 14 of 60 in the TM group (p = 0.24). In per protocol analysis, mean [95% CI] daily CPAP use among 86 patients still using CPAP at 12 months was 279 [237; 321] min in the 38 patients on UC and 279 [247; 311] min in the 43 patients on TM, mean difference [95% CI]: 0 [?52; 52] min, P = 0.99.

Understanding the pandemic's effects on already vulnerable populations, such as individuals with chronic pain, may inform healthcare preparation for future catastrophic events. Given the association between excessive discounting of delayed rewards and chronic pain, this study examined relationships between delay discounting, pain severity, and COVID-19 perceived stress in individuals with chronic pain. Individuals reporting chronic pain (N = 180; 41% female; 86% white; 59% with a college degree) were recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in this cross-sectional study. Measures of pain severity, delay discounting, probability discounting, and COVID-19 perceived stress were collected. Delay discounting was a significant predictor of overall pain severity (p < .02) and COVID-19 perceived stress (p < .001). Also, the magnitude of COVID-19 perceived stress fully mediated the relationship between delay discounting and overall pain severity (p = .004). Probability discounting was not a significant predictor of pain severity or COVID-19 perceived stress (p > .05). These findings highlight the importance of excessive discounting of delayed rewards as a potential determinant of pain severity as well as predictor of perceived stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to its high level of contagion, it has already reached most countries, quickly becoming a pandemic. Although the most common symptoms are related to breathing problems, SARS-CoV-2 infections also affect the gastrointestinal tract culminating in inflammation and diarrhea. However, the mechanisms related to these enteric manifestations are still not well understood. Evidence shows that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in host cells as a viral invasion mechanism and can infect the lungs and the gut. Other viruses have already been linked to intestinal symptoms through binding to ACE2. In turn, this medical hypothesis article conjectures that the ACE2 downregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 internalization could lead to decreased activation of the mechanistic target of mTOR with increased autophagy and lead to intestinal dysbiosis, resulting in diarrhea. Besides that, dysbiosis can directly affect the respiratory system through the lungs. Although there are clues to other viruses that modulate the ACE2/gut/lungs axis, including the participation of autophagy and dysbiosis in the development of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is still no evidence of the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thus, we propose that the new coronavirus causes a change in the intestinal microbiota, which culminates in a diarrheal process through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway into enterocytes. Our assumption is supported by premises that unregulated intestinal microbiota increases the susceptibility to other diseases and extra-intestinal manifestations, which can even cause remote damage in lungs. These putative connections lead us to suggest and encourage future studies aiming at assessing the aforementioned hypothesis and regulating dysbiosis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to confirm the decrease in lung injuries and the improvement in the prognosis of the disease.","output":"Premises among SARS-CoV-2, dysbiosis and diarrhea: walking through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy route"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The airway epithelium and underlying innate immune cells comprise the first line of host defense in the lung.

We explored adaptive changes in Hungarian students behaviour and their time-budget in order to determine whether quarantine and/or fear of infection were responsible for these changes. METHODS: A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to all students in the Hungarian language program (N = 7436) of Semmelweis University. Information was collected on basic demographic data, knowledge and attitude about COVID-19, methods of prevention as well as the students behaviour before, during and after the first wave of the pandemic.

The nutrition of 100 students (21%) became healthier and the lockdown reduced the level of physical activity. CONCLUSION: Social and health-related behaviour of medical students changed basically during the first wave of the pandemic and some changes remained after it in tobacco smoking, nutrition and sleeping habits. Time-budget of students changed significantly during the pandemic and did not return to the baseline values. Results of this study justify future multiple systematic research to analyse and better understand the short- and long-term effects of the current crisis.","output":"Impact of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on the Hungarian university students social and health behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces respiratory symptoms, predominantly of the upper airways, which can progress to pneumonia after 7 days with persistent fever, cough and dyspnea, and even develop a syndrome of acute respiratory distress (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death. Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU). In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department; as well as explaining home isolation measures. In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment; In case of oxygen saturation <95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU. Depending on the severity of the patient, he/she would be or not a candidate for invasive mechanical ventilation, which must be performed by trained personnel to prevent the spread of the infection minimizing the risk of contagion. ARDS's treatment strategies include pulmonary protection ventilation, prone position, recruitment maneuvers and, less frequently, oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane. Among the specific treatments for COVID-19 stand out mainly drugs to reduce viral load, although sometimes specific drugs will be needed to treat hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability and concomitant infections. One of the goals to be achieved is for patients to recover and be able to successfully return to work; for this purpose, an adequate physical and psychological rehabilitation program is essential, as about 50% have symptoms of anxiety and depression.","output":"The Covid-19 pandemic seen from the frontline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Deep learning and computer vision revolutionized a new method to automate medical image diagnosis.

Based on the droplet-transmitted risk of COVID-19, such spitting could be considered a potentially life-threatening assault. Officers commonly use \\"spit socks\\" over the head and neck of spitting subjects to reduce this risk. The pneumatic impedance of such socks has not been published, so this remains an open issue for arrest-related death investigation. METHODS: We purchased samples of 3 popular spit sock models, 3 insect-protecting \\"bug\\" socks and hats, 3 N95 masks, a standard 3-ply surgical mask, and a common dust mask. We used a BTmeter model BTN8468 digital anemometer, an HTI model HT-1890 digital manometer, and an AC Infinity Cloudline model S6 inline controllable fan to measure air flow versus pressure drop. We compared the curves graphically and also calculated a pneumatic pseudo-impedance by dividing the pressure drop by the air velocity. RESULTS: The spit and bug socks allowed nearly maximum airflow with minimal pressure (&#8804;1 mm Hg), whereas none of the masks allowed greater than 2 m/s of airflow at maximum pressure of 3 mm Hg. All of the spit and bug masks were grouped together with the lowest pneumatic impedances, whereas all of the N95 masks were grouped together with the highest values. The dust mask and surgical mask were in between with the dust mask closer to the spit and bug masks, whereas the surgical mask was closer to the N95 masks in impedance. CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used spit socks offer nearly zero resistance to breathing. The highest resistance spit sock was still 100 times better than the best N95 mask for airflow during inhalation. Our results do not support the occasional hypothesis that spit socks might contribute to an arrest-related death.","output":"Pneumatic Impedance of Spit Socks and N95 Masks: The Applicability to Death Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide novel evidence of two different types of volatility-patterns of oil spot prices that are generated depending on which is the predominant trigger: a) spikes of volatility (which are highly erratic) are produced during periods of supply/demand crises of oil disruptions (such as the 1990/91 First-Gulf-War, 2001 US-terrorist attack, the oil conflict of Saudi-Arabia with the US in 2014/16 and with Russia in 2020 -together with the Covid-19 impact-);while b) periods where economic/financial/stock market crises are the predominant trigger (such as the 1997/98 Asian and 2008/09 Global-Financial Crises and the 2017/19 oil conflicts including the 2018 stock market crisis) are associated to higher volatility persistence.

This study examines how these conditions as well as food supplementation and parasite treatment might alter immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and risk of progression to TB disease. METHODS: This is a 5-year prospective clinical trial at Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India. We aim to enroll 760 household contacts (HHC) of adults with active TB in order to identify 120 who are followed prospectively for 2 years: Thirty QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) positive HHCs  18 years of age in four proposed groups: (1) undernourished (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m(2)); (2) participants with a BMI  18.5 kg/m(2) who have a parasitic infection (3) undernourished participants with a parasitic infection and (4) controlsparticipants with BMI  18.5 kg/m(2) and without parasitic infection. We assess immune response at baseline and after food supplementation (for participants with BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)) and parasite treatment (for participants with parasites). Detailed nutritional assessments, anthropometry, and parasite testing through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microscopy are performed. In addition, at serial time points, these samples will be further analyzed using flow cytometry and whole blood transcriptomics to elucidate the immune mechanisms involved in disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study will help determine whether undernutrition and parasite infection are associated with gene signatures that predict risk of TB and whether providing nutritional supplementation and/or treating parasitic infections improves immune response towards this infection.

The day prior, she had one episode of emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but no fever. She presented to an outside hospital and was reported to have agonal breathing with a GCS of 8 (eyes open to pain, no verbal response to stimuli, and localizes pain). She was promptly intubated and initial labs revealed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). With a family member with COVID-19, she tested COVID-19 positive. Results: Our patient's rapid progression and severity of illness requires discussion of how COVID-19 might affect diabetes and indicates opportunities for improving clinical practice in children with preexisting diabetes. We discuss how COVID-19 might change the underlying pathophysiology of DKA and cause metabolic complications. Possible mechanisms include binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and enabling a proinflammatory \\"cytokine storm\\". Additionally, ketoacidosis and altered mental status have been present in patients with COVID-19 without diabetes, which might potentiate the symptoms in developing DKA.

To date, the epidemic waves have not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim for pan Indian cross-sectional evolutionary analysis since inception of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: High quality genomes, along with their collection date till 26th July 2021, were downloaded. Whole genome-based phylogeny was obtained. Further, the mutational analysis was performed using SARS-CoV-2 first reported from Wuhan (NC_045512.2) as reference. RESULTS: Based on reported cases and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian epidemic into seven phases. The average mutation rate for the pre-first wave was <11, which elevated to 17 in the first wave and doubled in the second wave (34). In accordance with mutation rate, VOCs and VOIs started appearing in the first wave (1.5%), which dominated the second (96%) and post-second wave (100%). Nation-wide mutational analysis depicted >0.5 million mutation events with four major mutations in >19,300 genomes, including two mutations in coding (spike (D614G), and NSP 12b (P314L) of rdrp), one silent mutation (NSP3 F106F) and one extragenic mutation (5 UTR 241).

Clinicians and health care workers in low-income countries have few tests to diagnose causes of fever other than malaria although several diseases share common symptoms. We propose here to assess etiologies of fever in Madagascar to ultimately improve management of febrile cases. METHODOLOGY: Consenting febrile outpatients aged 6 months and older were recruited in 21 selected sentinel sites throughout Madagascar from April 2014 to September 2015. Standard clinical examinations were performed, and blood and upper respiratory specimens were taken for rapid diagnostic tests and molecular assays for 36 pathogens of interest for Madagascar in terms of public health, regardless of clinical status. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 682 febrile patients were enrolled. We detected at least one pathogen in 40.5% (276/682) of patients and 6.2% (42/682) with co-infections. Among all tested patients, 26.5% (181/682) had at least one viral infection, 17.0% (116/682) had malaria and 1.0% (7/682) presented a bacterial or a mycobacterial infection.

METHODS We used data from 4583 patients with recent transient ischemic attack or minor stroke enrolled in the TIAregistry.org to perform a nested case-control analysis to evaluate pre- and post-CEA/CAS risk. Cases were defined as patients with a CEA/CAS during the 1-year follow-up period. For each case, 2 controls with a follow-up time greater than the time from qualifying event to CEA/CAS were randomly selected, matched by age and sex. Primary outcome was defined as major vascular events (MVE, including stroke, cardiovascular death, and myocardial infarction). RESULTS The median delay from symptom onset of qualifying event to CEA/CAS was 11 days (interquartile range, 6-23). Overall, patients with CEA/CAS had a higher 1-year risk of MVE than other patients (14.8% versus 5.8%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.60; P<0.001). During the matched preprocedural period, MVE occurred in 14 (7.5%) cases and in 13 (3.5%) controls, with an adjusted odds ratio =2.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-5.64; P=0.03). In the postprocedural period, the risk of MVE was also higher in cases than in controls (adjusted P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS Patients with CEA/CAS had a higher 12-month risk of MVE, as well as during pre- and postprocedural periods.

In this context, pyDock energy-based docking and scoring can predict hot-spots on the unbound proteins, thus not requiring the complex structure. Here, we have devised a new strategy to detect protein-protein inhibitor binding sites, based on the integration of molecular dynamics for the detection of transient cavities, and docking-based interface hot-spot prediction for the selection of the suitable cavities. This integrative approach has been validated on a test set formed by protein-protein complexes with known inhibitors for which complete structural data of unbound molecules and complexes is available. The results show that local conformational sampling with short molecular dynamics can generate transient cavities similar to the known inhibitor binding sites, and that docking simulations can identify the best cavities with similar predictive accuracy as when knowing the real interface. In a few cases, these predicted pockets are shown to be suitable for protein-ligand docking. The proposed strategy will be useful for many protein-protein complexes for which there is no available structure, as long as the the unbound proteins do not deviate dramatically from the bound conformations.","output":"Docking-based identification of small-molecule binding sites at protein-protein interfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic is entering its second year. In this short report we present additional results as a supplement to our previous paper on COVID-19 and common respiratory virus screening for healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary infectious disease referral hospital in Manila, Philippines. We sought to understand what etiologic agents could explain the upper/lower respiratory tract infection-like (URTI/LRTI-like) symptoms exhibited by 88% of the 324 HCWs tested. Among the patients who had URTI/LRTI-like symptoms, only seven (2%) were positive for COVID-19, while 38 (13%) of the symptomatic participants were identified positive for another viral etiologic agent. Rhinovirus was the most common infection, with 21 (9%) of the symptomatic participants positive for rhinovirus. Based on these results, testing symptomatic HCWs for common respiratory illnesses in addition to COVID-19 should be considered during this time of global pandemic.","output":"If Not COVID-19 What Is It?

However, there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular complication among these patients. Assessment of echocardiographic parameters provides clinical characteristics for utilization in the management of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictors of mortality and analyze the echocardiographic findings of Filipino patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia and its correlation to the severity of the disease. METHOD: This is a retrospective observational cohort study of the echocardiographic findings among 173 Filipino patients who acquired COVID-19 pneumonia from June to August 2020. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of dichotomous outcome variable. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant direct correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and wall motion abnormality (r = 0.171;p = 0.024). There was also a significant direct correlation between length of hospital stay and the wall motion abnormality (r = 0.140;p = 0.050). Furthermore, there was a significant difference noted in the proportion of subjects with or without wall motion abnormality according to mortality (p = 0.007). The results also exhibit significant difference in the left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left atrium according to mortality as shown by the p values 0.001, 0.001 and 0.030 respectively. However, there is no significant correlation noted between the severity of COVID-19 and mortality to the right ventricular size and function. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression, two variables were found to be significant predictors of mortality, this includes LVEDD and LVEF. CONCLUSION: Among Filipino patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the study demonstrated that left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction are significant predictors for mortality.","output":"Echocardiographic findings of filipino patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a singlecenter experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Covid-19 infection is associated with coagulopathy and possible heparin resistance, raising concerns that routine heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is failing to achieve adequate anticoagulation. We examined heparin requirements and efficacy in patients treated by PCI before and after the first reported UK case of Covid-19 (January 31st 2020). METHODS: We retrospectively compared heparin dose, Activated Clotting Time (ACT) and coronary flow (TIMI grade) for PCI procedures at a London cardiac centre in the 3 months before the UK pandemic and the three months afterwards. Testing for COVID was not routinely performed. Pre-specified analyses in patients with STEMI, NSTEMI and Stable angina were undertaken. RESULTS: Of 1227 PCI procedures performed over the period of observation, 690 were pre-pandemic and 537 were afterwards. Overall median heparin dose per case was 11000units versus 11500units (p = 0.137) and maximum ACTs were 291s versus 305s, respectively (p = 0.135). Pre-PCI TIMI 3 flow was lower during the pandemic than before (60% v 65%, p = 0.005) but Post-PCI flow was similar (96% versus 96%, p = 0.839). There were no statistically significant differences in heparin dose or achieved ACT among patients with STEMI, NSTEMI or Stable presentations. CONCLUSION: In spite of the increasing evidence that COVID-19 infection causes thrombosis, it appears that standard heparin management during PCI is sufficient to achieve effective anticoagulation and avoid peri-procedural thrombotic complications.","output":"Coronary angioplasty and COVID-19: are heparin requirements and thrombotic complications increasing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has placed significant strain on United States health care and health care providers.

This study established a methodology with the objective of evaluating new associated strategies to reduce the risk of cross-transmission in a health environment by simulating spread of potentially contaminated dispersion particles (PCDP) in the environment. This crossover study, was conducted in a school clinic environment (4 clinics containing 12 dental chairs each). As a positive control group (without barriers), 12 professionals activated at the same time the turbine of dental drill, for one minute, with a bacterial solution (Lactobacillus casei Shirota, 1.5x10(8) CFU/mL), which had been added in the cooling reservoir of the dental equipment. In the experimental groups, the professionals made use of; a) an individual biosafety barrier in dentistry (IBBD) which consists of a metal support covered by a disposable PVC film barrier; b) a Mobile Unit of Disinfection by Ultraviolet-C, consisting of 8 UV lamps-C of 95W, of 304W/cm(2) of irradiance each, connected for 15 minutes (UV-C) and; c) the association between the two methods (IBBD + UV-C). In each clinic, 56 Petri dishes containing MRS agar were positioned on the lamps, benches and on the floor. In addition, plates were placed prior to each test (negative control group) and plates were also placed in the corridor that connects the four clinics. In the groups without barrier and IBBD + UV-C the passive air microorganisms in Petri dishes was also evaluated at times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the end of the dentals drill activation. The mean (standard deviation) of CFU of L. casei Shirota for the positive control group was 3905 (1521), while in the experimental groups the mean using the IBBD was 940 (466) CFU, establishing a reduction on average, of 75% (p<0.0001). For the UV-C group, the mean was 260 (309) CFU and the association of the use of IBBD + UV-C promoted an overall average count of 152 (257) CFU, establishing a reduction on average of 93% and 96%, respectively (p<0.0001). Considering these results and the study model used, the individual biosafety barrier associated with UV-C technology showed to be efficient strategies to reduce the dispersion of bioaerosols generated in an environment with high rate of PCDP generation and may be an alternative for the improvement of biosafety in different healthy environment.","output":"Biosafety devices to control the spread of potentially contaminated dispersion particles.

To minimise this, the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust elective surgery hub and the executive team at London Bridge Hospital (LBH) created an elective operating framework at LBH, a COVID-19 minimal site, in which patients self-isolated for two weeks and proceeded with surgery only following a negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction swab. The aim was to determine the rates of rates of postoperative COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The collaboration involved three large hospital trusts, covering the geographic area of south-east London. All patients were referred to LBH for elective surgery. Patients were followed up by telephone interview at four weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-eight patients from 13 surgical specialties were included in the analysis. The median age was 60 (IQR 29-71) years. Sixty-three per cent (252/398) were female. In total, 78.4% of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 1-2 and the average BMI was 27.2 (IQR 23.7-31.8) kg/m2. Some 83.6% (336/402) were 'major' operations. The rate of COVID-19-related death in our cohort was 0.25% (1/398). Overall, there was a 1.26% (5/398) 30-day postoperative all-cause mortality rate. Seven patients (1.76%) reported COVID-19 symptoms, but none attended the emergency department or were readmitted to hospital as a result.

In general surgery, locoregional anaesthesia was applied to laparoscopic procedures, increasing minimally invasive surgery advantages. Aims: To assess and compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic adnexal procedures for benign conditions under spinal anaesthesia (SA) versus general anaesthesia (GA). Furthermore, anaesthesiologic, surgical and clinical data were evaluated in both groups. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective cohort study performed in a tertiary level referral centre for minimally invasive gynaecological surgery (Gynaecology and Human Reproduction Physiopathology, University of Bologna). Women scheduled for adnexal laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions between February and May 2019 were assigned to receive either SA or GA with endotracheal intubation. A sample size of 13 women per group was needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores. Main findings: 13 women were enrolled in the SA arm, 15 in the GA arm. In the SA cohort, the most common intraoperative adverse event was shoulder pain, reported by 3/12 women. At 1, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery pain was significantly lower in the SA arm (p < .05). Patients submitted to SA experienced no need for opioid drugs administration, unlike those receiving GA. Patients' mobilization and return of bowel function were noted significantly earlier in the SA group (p < .05). Conclusions: SA is a feasible, safe and effective anaesthesiologic technique for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures for benign conditions, allowing a better control of postoperative pain. Women undergoing SA achieve earlier mobilization and bowel canalization.

Vaccines differ fundamentally from other classes of medicines in that they are usually administered as a preventive measure to a healthy individual rather than to a sick person already with an infection, although exceptions to this practice exist. Most currently used prophylactic vaccines are based on established platforms, but many vaccine candidates, in late development stages, including several COVID-19 vaccines, use highly novel vaccine platforms not available historically.

With increasing automation, autonomous agents are expected to take over a lot of this interaction process. Much of automated negotiation literature focuses on agents having a static and known reservation value. In situations involving dynamic environments e.g., an agent negotiating on behalf of a human regarding a meeting, agents can have a reservation value (RV) that is a function of time. This leads to a different set of challenges that may need additional reasoning about the concession behavior. In this paper, we build upon Negotiation algorithms such as ONAC (Optimal Non-Adaptive Concession) and Time-Dependent Techniques such as Boulware which work on settings where the reservation value of the agent is fixed and known. Although these algorithms can encode dynamic RV, their concession behavior and hence the properties they were expected to display would be different from when the RV is static, even though the underlying negotiation algorithm remains the same. We, therefore, propose to use one of Counter, Bayesian Learning with Regression Analysis or LSTM model on top of each algorithm to develop the PredictRV strategy and show that PredictRV indeed performs better on two different metrics tested on two different domains on a variety of parameter settings.","output":"PredictRV: A Prediction Based Strategy for Negotiations with Dynamically Changing Reservation Value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: E-Cigarette use or vaping has rapidly become the most common alternative to traditional tobacco smoking among youth. The use of e-cigarettes is still highly controversial from medical, scientific and psychological standpoints because of the insufficient formal research available on the effects of vaping on the public health. Moreover, as of September 2019;CDC and FDA started a wide investigation after a multistate outbreak of lung injury associated with e-cigarette products use (EVALI). Here, we present a case report of EVALI in the COVID-19 era that was initially isolated for a high suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia due to its similarities. CASE PRESENTATION: 20-year-old female presented to the hospital with worsening dysnea, productive cough with gray/yellow sputum, nausea, vomiting, and fever for 1 week. She was in severe respiratory distress and was subsequently sedated and intubated. Lung examination was consistent with diffuse rhonchi throughout the lungs. Chest radiograph showed bilateral extensive areas of parenchymal infiltrates concerning for atypical infectious process. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and reticulations. Laboratory workup was remarkable for leukocytosis with lymphopenia, and elevated inflammatory markers and transaminases. Due to high suspicion of COVID-19, nasopharyngeal specimen was sent for PCR analysis, and isolation precautions were initiated. Patient was started on empiric antibiotics and steroids. Influenza antigen, streptococcus pneumonia, legionella and mycoplasma were all negative. Upon further questioning, her mother reported that the patient has recently started vaping and uses orange juice in her vape. COVID-19, MRSA screen, and sputum culture were all negative. Pro-calcitonin was negative. Patient was extubated and showed significant improvement. She was discharged home with supplemental oxygen. DISCUSSION: According to CDC statistics in 2018, more than 3.6 million U.S middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in 30 days. Among current users aged 18-24 years, 40% had never been regular cigarette smokers. E-cigarettes use has been linked to hazardous adverse effects, most importantly EVALI, through triggering cytokine expression, airway hyper-reactivity, altered mucin secretion, oxidative stress and lung tissue destruction.

Nuclear Factor 90 (NF90) is an RBP encoded by the interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) gene that has been found to influence RNA metabolism at several levels, including pre-RNA splicing, mRNA turnover, and translation. To systematically identify the RNAs that interact with NF90, we carried out iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) analysis in the human embryonic fibroblast cell line HEK-293. Interestingly, many of the identified RNAs encoded proteins involved in the response to viral infection and RNA metabolism. We validated a subset of targets and investigated the impact of NF90 on their expression levels. Two of the top targets, IRF3 and IRF9 mRNAs, encode the proteins IRF3 and IRF9, crucial regulators of the interferon pathway involved in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response. Our results support a role for NF90 in modulating key genes implicated in the immune response and offer insight into the immunological response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Systematic identification of NF90 target RNAs by iCLIP analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Efflux pumps are transmembrane proteins associated with bacterial resistance mechanisms. Bacteria use these proteins to actively transport antibiotics to the extracellular medium, preventing the pharmacological action of these drugs. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the antibacterial activity of 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides as well as its ability to inhibit efflux systems of Staphylococcus aureus strains expressing different levels of the NorA efflux pump. METHODS The broth microdilution test was performed to assess antibacterial activity. Efflux pump inhibition was evaluated in silico by molecular docking and in vitro,by fluorometric tests, and determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC was determined in the association between 1,8-naphthyridine and norfloxacin or ethidium bromide. RESULTS The 1,8-naphthyridines did not show direct antibacterial activity. In contrast, they effectively reduced the MIC of multidrug-resistant bacteria by associating with norfloxacin and ethidium bromide, in addition to increasing the fluorescence emission of this. The in silico analysis addressing the binding between NorA and 1,8-naphthyridines suggests that hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic interactions represent the interactions with the most favorable binding energy, corroborating the experimental data. CONCLUSION In conclusion, our data suggest that 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides inhibit bacterial resistance through molecular mechanisms associated with inhibition of the NorA efflux pump in S. aureus strains.","output":"The 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides are NorA efflux pump inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have encountered signs such as \\"No entry without face mask\\"in public spaces such as theatres, restaurants, shopping malls, other places. The Face mask is one among the necessary preventive measures taken against COVID-19. Many doctors and scientists have suggested the continued use of face masks even after the vaccination drive. This new change in the way of life necessitates the use of a face mask in public places. Open public spaces cannot be monitored but enclosed public spaces can be monitored. The passageway of these public spaces should monitor if an individual has put on a face mask. Without manual supervision, the CNN algorithm could potentially be used to check the face mask of the persons entering the enclosed public spaces. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network prototype is constructed using TensorFlow, OpenCV and, Keras to detect, if an individual has put on a face mask to protect themselves. At the entrance of these public spaces, a monitor scans the faces of the people entering and detects if they are wearing a facemask using the CNN deep learning model.

They experience numerous difficulties during their work, which result in occupational stress. During the COVID-19 pandemic, their work has become even more demanding. The aim of the current study was to examine the role of resilience in the subjective experience of stress among paramedics during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in two phases, in October-November 2019 (N = 75) and in May-June 2020 (N = 84), using the Sense of Stress Questionnaire (Skala Poczucia Stresu) and the Resilience Scale (Skala Pomiaru Prno?ci). RESULTS: Paramedics exhibited higher intrapsychic stress before the COVID-19 pandemic. Tolerance of failure and treating life as a challenge were higher during the pandemic, in contrast to optimism and the ability to mobilize in difficult situations. Paramedics who were in contact with patients with COVID-19 experienced higher stress. Perseverance and determination, openness to new experiences and sense of humor, as well as competences and tolerance of negative emotions were revealed to play a key part in mitigating subjectively experienced stress. CONCLUSION: Paramedics subjectively experienced stress was lower during the COVID-19 pandemic. Paramedics who were in direct contact with patients with COVID-19 experienced higher stress.

These findings have been attributed to factors such as inexperienced operators, prolonged intubation times and other airway related complications. As an initial step to examine outcomes of advanced airway placement during in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), where immediate assistance and experienced operators are continuously available, we examined whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts affect intubation difficulty. Additionally, we examined whether or not the use of videolaryngoscopy increases the odds of first attempt intubation success compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy. METHODS The study setting is a large urban university-affiliated teaching hospital where experienced airway managers are available to perform emergent intubation for any indication in any out-of-the-operating room location 24 hours a day, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year. Intubations occurring in all adults >18 years-of-age who required emergent tracheal intubation outside of the operating room between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012 were examined retrospectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of difficult intubation during IHCA compared to other emergent non-IHCA indications with adjustment for a priori defined potential confounders (body mass index, operator experience, use of videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy, and age). RESULTS In adjusted analyses, the odds of difficult intubation were higher when taking place during IHCA (OR=2.63; 95% CI 1.1-6.3, p=0.03) compared to other emergent indications. Use of video versus direct laryngoscopy for initial intubation attempts during IHCA, however, did not improve the odds of success (adjusted OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.35-1.43, p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS Difficult intubation is more likely when intubation takes place during IHCA compared to other emergent indications, even when experienced operators are available. Under these conditions, direct laryngoscopy (versus videolaryngoscopy) remains a reasonable first choice intubation technique.","output":"Cardiac arrest is a predictor of difficult tracheal intubation independent of operator experience in hospitalized patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prioritizing Ontarios long-term care home (LTCH) residents for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has drastically reduced their disease burden; however, recent LTCH outbreaks of variants of concern (VOCs) have raised questions regarding their immune responses.

That is why continuum models based on theories of membrane elasticity are actively applied for the construction of physical models of membrane fusion. Started from the view on the membrane as a structureless film with postulated geometry of fusion intermediates, they developed along with experimental and computational techniques to a powerful tool for prediction of the whole process with molecular accuracy.

We previously reported that metformin prevents NGF-induced proliferation and angiogenic potential of EOC cells. In this study, we sought to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which metformin blocks these NGF-induced effects in EOC cells. Human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) and EOC (A2780/SKOV3) cells were stimulated with NGF and/or metformin to assess the expression of c-MYC, -catenin, survivin and VEGF and the abundance of the tumor suppressor miRs 23b and 145. Metformin decreased the NGF-induced transcriptional activity of MYC and -catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF-Lef), as well as the expression of c-MYC, survivin and VEGF in EOC cells, while it increased miR-23b and miR-145 levels.

Elderly patients are at increased risk of PHN. The pathophysiology of PHN is complex, likely involving both peripheral and central processes. This complexity may create opportunities for pharmacologic interventions with multiple differing mechanisms of action. Consequently, complementary combinations of pharmacologic agents are frequently more effective than any monotherapy. Current US and international guidelines on the care of patients with PHN are reviewed and interpreted here to facilitate their effective incorporation into the practice of primary care physicians, acknowledging the contrasts that often exist between the clinical trial populations analyzed to craft so-called evidence-based medicine and the individual patients seen in daily practice, many of whom may not have been candidates for those clinical trials. First-line treatments for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, and the topical lidocaine 5% patch. Opioids, tramadol, capsaicin cream, and the capsaicin 8% patch are recommended as either second- or third-line therapies in different guidelines.

Analysis of the S1 gene established three subclades for historical IBV strains (S1:GI-23.1, S1:GI-23.2.1 and S1:GI-23.2.2) and confirmed NR725/16 as being part of a separate fourth subclade (S1:GI-23.3).

To tune the properties of PLA, block copolymers with poly(propylene adipate) (PPAd) prepolymer were prepared by polymerizing L-lactide and PPAd oligomers via reactive extrusion (REX) in a torque rheometer. The effect of reaction temperature and composition on the molecular weight, chemical structure, and physicochemical properties of the copolymers was studied. The introduction of PPAd successfully increased the elongation and the biodegradation rate of PLA.

Especially, the current body of knowledge about COVID-19 therapeutics needs more data regarding drug effectiveness and safety in the severely ill patients with comorbidities. In the present article, we retrospectively analyze data from 61 patients that received treatment with chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, both drugs administered together, or a standard treatment with no antiviral drugs, and the study was carried in severely ill patients. We found that either drug is ineffective at treating COVID-19, as they are not able to reduce hospitalization length, mortality, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), d-Dimer, or ferritin, or to enhance gasometric parameters, lymphocytes, total leukocytes, and neutrophil levels, whereas both drugs administered together decrease circulating lymphocytes, increase LDH and ferritin levels, and more importantly, enhance mortality. In this way, our results show that both drugs are ineffective and even potentially harmful alternatives against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Both Chloroquine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Are Ineffective for COVID-19 Treatment and Combined Worsen the Pathology: A Single-Center Experience with Severely Ill Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new method for the characterization of coherent laser beams is proposed.

Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning techniques were used to collect metric data about the morphology of the riverbed. Data acquisition was carried out to create a digital model of visible and submerged parts of the riverbed. Then, a second area with a sedimentation pool was selected to monitor the variation of the depth induced by progressive accumulation of sediments. As the pool is constantly covered by water, a low-cost bathymetric drone was used coupling the measured depth values with total station measurements to track the drone. Finally, the paper describes the implementation of an on-line data delivery platform able to facilitate retrieval of heterogeneous geospatial data, which are used in the developed numerical model for sediment transport.

However, the molecular mechanisms integrating melatonin receptor (MT)-mediated lipid metabolism and redox signaling during in vitro cumulusCoocyte complex (COC) development still remain unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the potential role of MTn receptors in lipid metabolic adjustments during in vitro porcine COC development. We observed that MTn-mediated G(s)CcAMP/PKA signaling facilitated lipolysis primarily through the MT2 receptor and subsequently increased fatty acid (FA) release by hydrolyzing intracellular triglycerides (TGs) in cumulus cells. Furthermore, CD36 was a critical FA transporter that transported available FAs from cumulus cells to oocytes and promoted de novo TG synthesis in the latter. In addition, MTn regulated lipogenesis and intracellular lipolysis to maintain lipid homeostasis and limit ROS production, thereby supporting oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and the subsequent embryo development. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the possible mechanism integrating MT2-mediated lipid homeostasis and redox signaling, which limits ROS production during in vitro COC development. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the interactions between lipid homeostasis and redox signaling driven by MT2 is necessary in order to predict drug targets and the effects of therapeutics used to improve female reproductive health.","output":"Melatonin Regulates Lipid Metabolism in Porcine CumulusCOocyte Complexes via the Melatonin Receptor 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present research aims to establish the impact that the current crisis situation the planet is facing, namely the COVID-19 pandemic, has had so far on the Romanian labor force market In this context, given the lack of information and information regarding this pandemic and its effects, the administration of a questionnaire among the population was considered to identify the research results The method of semantic differential and the method of ordering the ranks were used for the interpretation of the results With the help of this questionnaire, it will be possible to answer the question of the research in this study: What are the main effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Romanian labor market?

However, hemorrhagic complications can result. Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduces stroke volume and improves behavioral function in experimental stroke models. One suggested therapeutic mechanism is inhibition of vascular endothelial dysfunction. The objective of this study was to determine whether MSCs suppress hemorrhagic events after rtPA therapy in the acute phase of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats. METHODS After induction of tMCAO, 4 groups were studied: 1) normal saline [NS]+vehicle, 2) rtPA+vehicle, 3) NS+MSCs, and 4) rtPA+MSCs. The incidence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage, both hemorrhagic and ischemic volume, and behavioral performance were examined. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels in the brain were assessed with zymography. Quantitative analysis of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was performed to assess hemodynamic change in the ischemic lesion. RESULTS The MSC-treated groups (Groups 3 and 4) experienced a greater reduction in the incidence rate of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic volume 1 day after tMCAO even if rtPA was received. The application of rtPA enhanced activation of MMP-9, but MSCs inhibited MMP-9 activation. Behavioral testing indicated that both MSC-infused groups had greater improvement than non-MSC groups had, but rtPA+MSCs provided greater improvement than MSCs alone. The rCBF ratio of rtPA groups (Groups 2 and 4) was similar at 2 hours after reperfusion of tMCAO, but both were greater than that in non-rtPA groups. CONCLUSIONS Infused MSCs may inhibit endothelial dysfunction to suppress hemorrhagic events and facilitate functional outcome. Combined therapy of infused MSCs after rtPA therapy facilitated early behavioral recovery.","output":"Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells inhibits intracranial hemorrhage after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy for transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:The COVID-19 pandemic has created a high demand on personal protective equipment, including disposable N95 masks Given the need for mask reuse, we tested the feasibility of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet light (UV), and ethanol decontamination strategies on N95 mask integrity and the ability to remove the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2 Methods:Disposable N95 masks, including medical grade (1860, 1870+) and industrial grade (8511) masks, were treated by vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet light (UV), and ethanol decontamination Mask degradation was tested using a quantitative respirator fit testing Pooled clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 were applied to mask samples, treated and and then either sent immediately for real-time reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or incubated with Vero E6 cells to assess for viracidal effect Results:Both ethanol and UV decontamination showed functional degradation to different degrees while VHP treatment showed no significant change after 2 treatments We also report a single SARS-CoV-2 virucidal experiment using Vero E6 cell infection in which only ethanol treatment eliminated detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA Conclusions:We hope our data will guide further research for evidenced-based decisions for disposable N95 mask reuse and help protect caregivers from SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens","output":"Effect of various decontamination procedures on disposable N95 mask integrity and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is a life-saving rescue therapy in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ECMO has been associated with development of lymphocytopenia that is also common in COVID-19. Hyperinflammation may complicate SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, prompting therapy with steroids and immunomodulatory drugs. We aimed to evaluate the association of therapies such as steroids and Tocilizumab with trajectories of the total leukocytes, lymphocyte subpopulation count, and inflammatory and fibrinolysis markers in COVID-19-related ARDS, requiring or not VV-ECMO support. The association of the trajectories of the leukocytes, lymphocyte subpopulation count, and inflammatory and fibrinolysis markers with treatment with steroids (Steroids), Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab), both drugs (Steroids + Tocilizumab), and absence of treatment (No Treatment) were analyzed using mixed effects regression models, where ECMO was considered as a potential effect modifier. One hundred and thirty-nine leukocyte and eighty-one lymphocyte subpopulation counts were obtained from thirty-one patients who required (VV-ECMO, N = 13) or not (no VV-ECMO, N = 18) extracorporeal support. In both groups, treatment with Steroids + Tocilizumab was independently associated with a significant reduction of 46% and 67% in total lymphocytes, 22% and 60% in CD3(+), and 61% and 91% in CD19(+) (B lymphocytes) compared to those obtained without treatment, respectively. In the no VV-ECMO group, Tocilizumab was associated with a 79% increase in total lymphocytes and with a reduction in procalcitonin compared to no treatment. CD45(+), CD3(+)CD4(+) (Th cell), CD3(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+), the NK cell subpopulation, neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils were significantly reduced by Steroids + Tocilizumab without an effect modification by VV-ECMO support. In critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS, concomitant therapies with steroids and Tocilizumab, beside mitigating the inflammation and fibrinolysis, could reduce the total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and subpopulation count. Moreover, the effect of Tocilizumab in increasing the total lymphocytes and reducing procalcitonin might be blunted by VV-ECMO.","output":"Effects of Steroids and Tocilizumab on the Immune Response Profile of Patients with COVID-19-Associated ARDS Requiring or Not Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the main cellular target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is thought to be alveolar cells, the absence of their tractable culture system precludes the development of a clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 infection model.

Progress has been such that the basic mechanisms of transcription, translation, and nucleic acid replication have been characterized for all the major families of animal viruses and the strategy of gene expression and its regulation clarified. Many important biochemical phenomena such as the splicing and other types of posttranscriptional processing of RNA, the posttranslational cleavage and glycosylation of proteins, the replication of RNA, reverse transcription, integration, and the transposition of viral genes and cellular oncogenes were first elucidated by virologists and have general application in cell biology.

Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles vaccine uptake declined; as a result, after the pandemic, European countries will have to increase vaccination rates to restore the extent of vaccination coverage among the population. Because information obtained from social media are one of the main causes of vaccine hesitancy, knowledge of the nature of information pertaining to measles that is shared on social media may help create educational campaigns. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to define the characteristics of European news about measles shared on social media platforms (ie, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest) from 2017 to 2019. METHODS: We downloaded and translated (into English) 10,305 articles on measles published in European Union countries. Using latent Dirichlet allocation, we identified main topics and estimated the sentiments expressed in these articles. Furthermore, we used linear regression to determine factors related to the number of times a given article was shared on social media. RESULTS: We found that, in most European social media posts, measles is only discussed in the context of local European events. Articles containing educational information and describing world outbreaks appeared less frequently. The most common emotions identified from the studys news data set were fear and trust. Yet, it was found that readers were more likely to share information on educational topics and the situation in Germany, Ukraine, Italy, and Samoa. A high amount of anger, joy, and sadness expressed within the text was also associated with a higher number of shares. CONCLUSIONS: We identified which features of news articles were related to increased social media shares. We found that social media users prefer sharing educational news to sharing informational news. Appropriate emotional content can also increase the willingness of social media users to share an article. Effective media content that promotes measles vaccinations should contain educational or scientific information, as well as specific emotions (such as anger, joy, or sadness). Articles with this type of content may offer the best chance of disseminating vital messages to a broad social media audience.","output":"Social Media Sharing of Articles About Measles in a European Context: Text Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 has affected care home residents internationally, but detailed information on outbreaks is scarce. We aimed to describe the evolution of outbreaks of COVID-19 in all care homes in one large health region in Scotland. Methods We did a population analysis of testing, cases, and deaths in care homes in the National Health Service (NHS) Lothian health region of the UK. We obtained data for COVID-19 testing (PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) and deaths (COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related), and we analysed data by several variables including type of care home, number of beds, and locality. Outcome measures were timing of outbreaks, number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in care home residents, care home characteristics associated with the presence of an outbreak, and deaths of residents in both care homes and hospitals. We calculated excess deaths (both COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related), which we defined as the sum of deaths over and above the historical average in the same period over the past 5 years. Findings Between March 10 and Aug 2, 2020, residents at 189 care homes (5843 beds) were tested for COVID-19 when symptomatic. A COVID-19 outbreak was confirmed at 69 (37%) care homes, of which 66 (96%) were care homes for older people. The size of care homes for older people was strongly associated with a COVID-19 outbreak (odds ratio per 20-bed increase 335, 95% CI 199C563). 907 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded during the study period, and 432 COVID-19-related deaths. 229 (25%) COVID-19-related cases and 99 (24%) COVID-related deaths occurred in five (3%) of 189 care homes, and 441 (49%) cases and 207 (50%) deaths were in 13 (7%) care homes. 411 (95%) COVID-19-related deaths occurred in the 69 care homes with a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak, 19 (4%) deaths were in hospital, and two (<1%) were in one of the 120 care homes without a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. At the 69 care homes with a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak, 74 excess non-COVID-19-related deaths were reported, whereas ten non-COVID-19-related excess deaths were observed in the 120 care homes without a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. 32 fewer non-COVID-19-related deaths than expected were reported among care home residents in hospital. Interpretation The effect of COVID-19 on care homes has been substantial but concentrated in care homes with known outbreaks. A key implication from our findings is that, if community incidence of COVID-19 increases again, many care home residents will be susceptible. Shielding care home residents from potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and ensuring rapid action to minimise outbreak size if infection is introduced, will be important for any second wave.

Due to the lack of specific therapies, the management of viral CNS infections is mainly based on supportive care, and empiric treatment against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection should be started as soon as possible. Some researchers have questioned the role of acyclovir as an empiric antiviral in older children due to the low incidence of HSV infection in this population and observed that HSV encephalitis may be clinically recognizable beyond neonatal age. However, the real benefit-risk ratio of selective approaches is unclear, and further studies are needed to define appropriate indications for empiric acyclovir.

It is argued that societies reaction to epidemics should adapt to the emerging evidence, and that they should more strictly adhere to well-established public health principles.","output":"Coronaphobia - An Emerging Mental Disorder Super-Spreading Globally by Communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Japan, convenience store operators have hailed their stores as social infrastructure. Policy makers have acknowledged this role, striving to involve the private sector in the process of strengthening communities, especially in light of Japans greatest societal challenge: its rapidly aging population. Convenience store companies have also earned such recognition through their responses to natural disasters. This is, however, somewhat paradoxical, since their just-in-time business model is in principle highly vulnerable to such events. This article introduces the case of the Japanese convenience store to demonstrate how responding to grand societal challenges canbeyond demonstrating corporate social responsibility or striving for legitimacybecome an essential part of corporate business models. It argues that such an approach creates the need for higher-level capabilities and increases the number of involved stakeholders, and concludes that this might throw previously successful business models off balance.","output":"Business models, stakeholders and capabilities in coping with societal grand challenges: the case of Japans convenience stores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triggered by the COVID-19 crisis, Israel's Ministry of Health (MoH) held a virtual Datathon based on deidentified governmental data. Organized by a multidisciplinary committee, Israel's research community was invited to offer insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1) develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy challenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry, and government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies, special needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance with COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable, up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80 participants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent all sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18 multidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5 presentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future projects. Detailed feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the structure and organization of future government-led datathons.","output":"COVID-19 Datathon Based on Deidentified Governmental Data as an Approach for Solving Policy Challenges, Increasing Trust, and Building a Community: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To identify the metabolites produced by the endophytic fungus, Aspergillus terreus and to explore the anti-viral activity of the identified metabolites against the pandemic disease COVID-19 in-silico. METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we reported the isolation of A. terreus, the endophytic fungus associated with soybean roots, which is then subcultured using OSMAC approach in five different culture media. Analytical analysis of media ethylacetate extracts using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was carried out. Furthermore, the obtained LC-MS data were statistically processed with MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Molecular docking studies were performed for the dereplicated metabolites against COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ). Metabolomic profiling revealed the presence of 18 compounds belonging to different chemical classes. Quinones, polyketides and isocoumarins were the most abundant classes. Multivariate analysis revealed that potato dextrose broth and modified potato dextrose broth are the optimal media for metabolites production. Molecular docking studies declared that the metabolites, Aspergillide B1 and 3a-Hydroxy-3, 5-dihydromonacolin L showed the highest binding energy scores towards COVID-19 main protease (Mpro ) (-9473) and (-9386), respectively, and they interact strongly with the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) amino acid residues of Mpro . CONCLUSIONS: A combination of metabolomics and in-silico approaches have allowed a shorter route to search for anti-COVID-19 natural products in a shorter time. The dereplicated metabolites, aspergillide B1 and 3&#945;-Hydroxy-3, 5-dihydromonacolin L were found to be potent anti-COVID-19 drug candidates in the molecular docking study.

There are several modifications to performing general anaesthesia for COVID-19 patients in Australia. We hypothesised that the performance time of these techniques amongst specialist anaesthetists would be similar for COVID-19 parturients undergoing emergency caesarean delivery. Methods: We designed a simulation cross-over study. The primary outcome was the time taken to perform general anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia in this setting. We also examined the decision-making process time, the decision to incision time and the level of stress associated with both scenarios. Results: Nine specialist anaesthetists participated in the research. There was no difference in the time taken to perform spinal or general anaesthesia (mean difference (GACSA scenario) C1.2 (C5.3C2.8) minutes, p = 0.5). Irrespective of group allocation the mean time to complete the spinal anaesthesia scenario was 27.4 (standard deviation = 7.8) minutes, while for the general anaesthesia scenario was 24.0 (7.2) minutes. There was no difference between these times (mean difference (GACSA scenario) = C3.5 minutes, 95th percent confidence interval C9.7C2.8 minutes, p = 0.24). There was no evidence of a carryover effect for the two scenarios based on the group allocation (p = 0.69) and no significant difference between stress levels (p = 0.44).

While exponential growth in the availability of private hospitals has been recorded in the past few years, many hospitals are not able to attract enough patients due to poor quality of services, unavailability of skilled healthcare workers, and unethical medical practices. These issues were painfully exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients rely on recommendations from friends and relatives to select a physician or hospital. This study undertakes a customer-oriented view of patients to explore patients? perceptions of physicians? communication and how it influences the recommendation of a physician. For the study, data are collected from 626 patients spread across three cities of North India. We find that physician communication leads to favourable recommendations, and the patient?s perceived influence and satisfaction play an important role in this process. The physician should display empathy and compassion while communicating to patients, which helps build a favourable perception of the physician. This leads to a higher level of satisfaction with the healthcare provider. Furthermore, the study also examines the effects of socio-demographic variables, such as patient?s income, patient?s gender, and physician?s gender. People with high (vs low) income are more satisfied with physician communication, whereas people with low (vs high) income are more likely to recommend a physician. Interestingly, female patients are more satisfied with a physician?s communication skills than males. Aligned with the patriarchal society, patients show more acceptance of male (vs female) doctors, but in contrast, patients are more likely to recommend a female (vs male) doctor. So, we recommend that healthcare providers ensure that patients get sufficient time to spend with their physicians to discuss problems and not ?rush? the patients to improve revenues.","output":"Role of Communication, Influence, and Satisfaction in Patient Recommendations of a Physician"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify the temporal change in the possible risk of superspreading events, we estimated the overdispersion parameter in 2 different periods of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Typically they comprise a slippery sequence, X XXY YYZ, where the frameshift occurs, and a stimulatory mRNA element. Here we studied the influence of host translational environment and the identity of slippery sequence-decoding tRNAs on the frameshift mechanism. By expressing candidate signals in Escherichia coli, and in wheatgerm extracts depleted of endogenous tRNAs and supplemented with prokaryotic or eukaryotic tRNA populations, we show that when decoding AAG in the ribosomal A-site, E.coli tRNA(Lys) promotes a highly unusual single-tRNA slippage event in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. This event does not appear to require slippage of the adjacent P-site tRNA, although its identity is influential. Conversely, asparaginyl-tRNA promoted a dual slippage event in either system. Thus, the tRNAs themselves are the main determinants in the selection of single- or dual-tRNA slippage mechanisms. We also show for the first time that prokaryotic tRNA(Asn) is not inherently unslippery and induces efficient frameshifting when in the context of a eukaryotic translation system.","output":"Prokaryotic-style frameshifting in a plant translation system: conservation of an unusual single-tRNA slippage event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In several countries, contact tracing apps (CTAs) have been introduced to warn users if they have had high-risk contacts that could expose them to SARS-CoV-2 and could, therefore, develop COVID-19 or further transmit the virus. For CTAs to be effective, a sufficient critical mass of users is needed. Until now, adoption of these apps in several countries has been limited, resulting in questions on which factors prevent app uptake or stimulate discontinuation of app use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate individuals reasons for not using, or stopping use of, a CTA, in particular, the Coronalert app. Users and nonusers attitudes toward the apps potential impact was assessed in Belgium. To further stimulate interest and potential use of a CTA, the study also investigated the populations interest in new functionalities. METHODS: An online survey was administered in Belgium to a sample of 1850 respondents aged 18 to 64 years. Data were collected between October 30 and November 2, 2020. Sociodemographic differences were assessed between users and nonusers. We analyzed both groups attitudes toward the potential impact of CTAs and their acceptance of new app functionalities. RESULTS: Our data showed that 64.9% (1201/1850) of our respondents were nonusers of the CTA under study; this included individuals who did not install the app, those who downloaded but did not activate the app, and those who uninstalled the app. While we did not find any sociodemographic differences between users and nonusers, attitudes toward the app and its functionalities seemed to differ. The main reasons for not downloading and using the app were a perceived lack of advantages (308/991, 31.1%), worries about privacy (290/991, 29.3%), and, to a lesser extent, not having a smartphone (183/991, 18.5%). Users of the CTA agreed more with the potential of such apps to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. Overall, nonusers found the possibility of extending the CTA with future functionalities to be less acceptable than users. However, among users, acceptability also tended to differ. Among users, functionalities relating to access and control, such as digital certificates or green cards for events, were less accepted (358/649, 55.2%) than functionalities focusing on informing citizens about the spread of the virus (453/649, 69.8%) or making an appointment to get tested (525/649, 80.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that app users were more convinced of the CTAs utility and more inclined to accept new app features than nonusers. Moreover, nonusers had more CTA-related privacy concerns. Therefore, to further stimulate app adoption and use, its potential advantages and privacy-preserving mechanisms need to be stressed. Building further knowledge on the forms of resistance among nonusers is important for responding to these barriers through the apps further development and communication campaigns.","output":"Reasons for Nonuse, Discontinuation of Use, and Acceptance of Additional Functionalities of a COVID-19 Contact Tracing App: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we analyzed the replication and budding sites of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at early time points of infection.

In addition to its presence at the replication sites, N also accumulated in the Golgi region and colocalized with the viral spike protein. Immuno-EM revealed that budding occurred at membranes of the ERGIC (ERCGolgi intermediate compartment) and the Golgi region as early as 3 h post infection, demonstrating that SARS-CoV replicates surprisingly fast. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV establishes replication complexes at ER-derived membranes.

Using a sample of 81 developing over the period 2001C2016 and principally focusing on the prevalence of undernourishment, this study provides new empirical evidence. Firstly, it estimates the impact of total trade differentiating the effects that pass through changes in real per capita incomei.e. on the economic access to foodfrom the residual effects that it directly has on the other dimensions of food security. Subsequently, it concentrates on cereals trade, that usually is the most affected by trade restrictions and the most correlated to undernourishment. Finally, it explores the different effects of cereals trade in terms of imports and exports. Three main conclusions emerge: (a) trade openness contributes to lower the prevalence of undernourishment in developing countries and most of this effect is not income-mediated but, rather, passes through the impacts that it directly has on the other dimensions of food security; (b) such impacts are mostly driven by the trade openness of the cereals sector where (c) its import component turns out to play the main role.","output":"Total trade, cereals trade and undernourishment: new empirical evidence for developing countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The production of alternative RNA variants contributes to the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary care referral centers. METHODS: We identified previous cases of irradiation with recurrent or second primary oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma that had no evidence of regional metastasis and required free tissue transfer reconstruction of the primary site. Patients who underwent elective neck dissection or exploration were reviewed. The main outcome measures were the presence and location of occult nodal metastasis. Disease-free survival and overall survival were measured. Odds ratios and hazard ratios were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were included: 52 with oral cavity primary tumors and 31 with oropharynx. An overall 78 (94%) underwent elective salvage neck dissection. Occult metastases were found in 9 (11.5%) patients. The most common nodal station for occult metastasis was level 2. Neither elective neck dissection nor the presence of occult metastasis was significantly associated with regional disease-free or overall survival. Oropharyngeal primary tumors were associated with higher risk of occult metastasis (odds ratio, 1.38; P < .01) and worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.09; P = .01).

Currently, a broad array of small-molecule drugs is known that specifically inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Many of them are well-studied ribosome-targeting antibiotics that block translocation, the peptidyl transferase center or the polypeptide exit tunnel, modulate the binding of translation machinery components to the ribosome, and induce miscoding, premature termination or stop codon readthrough. Such inhibitors are widely used as anticancer, anthelmintic and antifungal agents in medicine, as well as fungicides in agriculture. Chemicals that affect the accuracy of stop codon recognition are promising drugs for the nonsense suppression therapy of hereditary diseases and restoration of tumor suppressor function in cancer cells. Other compounds inhibit aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation factors, and components of translation-associated signaling pathways, including mTOR kinase.

We identified characteristics associated with pandemic-related discrimination and stress applying ordinal logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 218 refugees from 23 states, nearly one third of participants reported experiencing at least one type of discrimination, and more than two-thirds experienced at least one type of pandemic-related stress. Having had COVID-19, having a family member with COVID-19, and being an essential worker were associated with discrimination. Discrimination, financial crisis, and female gender were associated with stress.

Exercise effects on OXS response and antioxidant status of HD was investigated in the present study. METHODS Twelve HD and 12 healthy controls (HC) performed a graded exercise protocol. Blood samples, collected prior to and following exercise, were analyzed for lactate, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (PC), reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. RESULTS HC demonstrated higher time-to-exhaustion (41%), lactate (41%) and VO2 peak (55%) levels. At rest, HD exhibited higher TBARS, PC, and catalase activity values and lower GSH, GSH/GSSG, TAC, and GPX levels. Although exercise elicited a marked change of OXS markers in both groups, these changes were more pronounced (p < 0.05) in HD patients. After adjusting for VO2 peak, differences between groups disappeared. VO2 peak was highly correlated with GSH/GSSG, TBARS, TAC and PC at rest and after exercise. CONCLUSIONS These results imply that HD demonstrate higher OXS levels and a lower antioxidant status than HC at rest and following exercise. Acute exercise appears to exacerbate OXS response in hemodialyzed patients probably due to diminished antioxidant defense.

While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care. Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings. CASE: A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19. His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24. CONCLUSIONS: Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures.

Their biological functions in and beyond innate immunity, structure and activity relationships, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic potential continue to be interesting research topics. This review examines recent progress in our understanding of alpha and theta-defensins - the two structural classes composed of members of myeloid origin. RECENT FINDINGS A novel mode of antibacterial action is described for human enteric alpha-defensin 6, which forms structured nanonets to entrap bacterial pathogens and protect against bacterial invasion of the intestinal epithelium. The functional multiplicity and mechanistic complexity of defensins under different experimental conditions contribute to a debate over the role of enteric alpha-defensins in mucosal immunity against HIV-1 infection. Contrary to common belief, hydrophobicity rather than cationicity plays a dominant functional role in the action of human alpha-defensins; hydrophobicity-mediated high-order assembly endows human alpha-defensins with an extraordinary ability to acquire structural diversity and functional versatility. Growing evidence suggests that theta-defensins offer the best opportunity for therapeutic development as a novel class of broadly active anti-infective and anti-inflammatory agents. SUMMARY Defensins are the 'Swiss army knife' in innate immunity against microbial pathogens. Their modes of action are often reminiscent of the story of 'The Blind Men and the Elephant'. The functional diversity and mechanistic complexity, as well as therapeutic potential of defensins, will continue to attract attention to this important family of antimicrobial peptides.","output":"Defensins in innate immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) negatively affects bone strength; however, the osteoporotic conditions in patients with CKD are not fully understood.

We aimed to evaluate bone microstructures in patients with different stages of CKD. This study included 119 healthy men and 40 men admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital for inpatient education or the initiation of hemodialysis. The distal radius and tibia were scanned with HR-pQCT. Patient clinical characteristics and bone microstructures were evaluated within 3 months of initiation of hemodialysis (in patients with CKD stage 5 D), patients with CKD stage 4C5, and healthy volunteers. Cortical bone parameters were lower in the CKD group than in healthy controls. Tibial cortical and trabecular bone parameters (cortical thickness, cortical area, trabecular volumetric bone mineral density, trabecular-bone volume fraction, and trabecular thickness) differed between patients with CKD stage 5 D and those with CKD stage 4C5 (p < 0.01). These differences were also observed between patients with CKD stage 5 and those with CKD stage 5 D (p < 0.017), but not between patients with CKD stage 4 and those with CKD stage 5, suggesting that the bone microstructure rapidly changed at the start of hemodialysis.

NECs were observed to release SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the apical surface for up to 28 days postinfection (dpi), further corroborated by viral antigen staining. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (sc-seq) was utilized to explore the host response from infected NECs after short-term (3-dpi) and long-term (28-dpi) infection.

This study assessed whether admission patient characteristics were associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. METHODS: The observational study included consecutive patients admitted to a large community teaching hospital with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 between March 6, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Comparisons were made based on the need for ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were admitted, 42 of whom (26.9%) required ICU admission and 114 (73.1%) did not. No difference in age (61.9 years vs 60.5 years, P = 0.67), race/ethnicity, or comorbidities were noted, except that patients requiring ICU care had lower serum albumin levels and lymphocyte counts and higher liver function tests, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count on admission. The average time from admission to death was similar (10 days in an ICU subset vs 9.2 days in a non-ICU subset, P = 0.78), yet patients necessitating ICU care had longer hospital lengths of stay (10.2 vs 5.1 days, P = 0.0002). At the time of data extraction, 15 patients in the ICU had died, 7 were discharged from the hospital, and 20 were still admitted while 5 patients died in the non-ICU cohort with 97 discharged and 12 patients admitted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study assessing clinical differences based on the need for ICU admission in inpatients with SARS-CoV-2. It found few major differences in clinical variables between subsets.

An archetypal operation of distributed sensing is data summarisation over a region of space, by which several higher-level problems can be addressed: counting items, measuring space, averaging environmental values, and so on. A typical coordination strategy to perform data summarisation in a peer-to-peer scenario, where devices can communicate only with a neighbourhood, is to progressively accumulate information towards one or more collector devices, though this typically exhibits problems of reactivity and fragility, especially in scenarios featuring high mobility. In this paper, we propose coordination strategies for data summarisation involving both idempotent and arithmetic aggregation operators, with the idea of controlling the minimum information propagation speed, so as to improve the reactivity to input changes. Given suitable assumptions on the network model, and under the restriction of no data loss, these algorithms achieve optimal reactivity. By empirical evaluation via simulation, accounting for various sources of volatility, and comparing to other existing implementations of data summarisation algorithms, we show that our algorithms are able to retain adequate accuracy even in high-variability scenarios where all other algorithms are significantly diverging from correct estimations.","output":"Resilient Distributed Collection Through Information Speed Thresholds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 many researches were published concening non Covid pathologies.

Outbreaks of FBD have a significant impact on our society due to the high economic losses they cause (hospital treatment of affected patients and destruction of contaminated food). Among its health objectives, the European Union has set itself the goal of reducing the incidence of the main FBDs, approving various regulations that codify requirements in order to produce food that is safe for human consumption. Among these rules, Regulation 2005/2073 establishes precise food safety criteria for foods that are judged to be most at risk of causing episodes of FBD. The food business operator (FBO) must know their food better and know how to estimate whether a food can support the growth of food pathogens or if they are able to hinder it during the foods shelf life. It is becoming crucial for each FBO to schedule specific laboratory tests (challenge tests) to establish the growth potential of individual pathogens and their maximum growth rate. In 2008 the European Union published the guidelines for programming the challenge tests for Listeria monocytogenes in RTE foods. These guidelines were further implemented in 2014 and again in 2019. In June 2019 the UNI EN ISO 20976-1 was published, which contains indications for setting up and carrying out challenge tests for all foodborne pathogens in all foods. In this article, we compare the three official documents to highlight their common aspects and differences, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages that each of them offers for those who have to set up a challenge test for the various foodborne pathogens. Our conclusion is that the challenge test is today the most effective tool to estimate the dynamics and growth potential of pathogenic microorganisms in food, if it is designed and implemented in a scrupulous way. It is important to develop a rational experimental design for each challenge test, and for each food, and this requires professionals who are experts in this specific field of study and who must be properly trained.","output":"Challenge Test as Special Tool to Estimate the Dynamic of Listeria monocytogenes and Other Foodborne Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Akt, a crucial protein involved in a variety of signaling pathways in cancer, acts as an important regulator of survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and provides curative option for the related drugs development.

Due to the high risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), it is associated with prolonged infusion times. These lengthy administrations can limit clinic capacity, require split dose infusions, increase chair time, decrease patient satisfaction, and create access barriers in the era of COVID-19. Recently, a fixed-dose subcutaneous (SC) formulation of daratumumab was approved for the treatment of MM, and the safety-run in results (N=28 patients) from a phase III, randomized trial in AL amyloidosis using the SC formulation were published. The SC formulation has the potential to mitigate some of the setbacks from IV formulation and help improve efficiency in the era of COVID-19, where most clinics are faced with limiting and spreading out volume due to space constraints and social distancing requirements. We present real world evidence from a large academic center's experience with adoption of SC formulation to help overcome current challenges. Methods We prospectively reviewed all patients being treated with IV daratumumab for MM and/or AL amyloidosis at Boston Medical Center Health System (a 500+ bed integrated delivery network) that would be candidates for the SC formulation. A protocol was designed to switch patients that were currently on IV daratumumab as well as patients newly initiating daratumumab to the SC formulation. Patients deemed eligible were switched to the SC formulation under pharmacy benefit (pending insurance authorization by a pharmacy liaison) at their next scheduled infusion visit. Rationale for switching patients to pharmacy benefit was to support home administration during future surge from COVID-19, using our specialty pharmacy travel RN program. Patients that were na?ve to daratumumab, started their first dose as a SC injection. Patients were monitored for 30 minutes following the first SC dose and were pre-medicated with oral acetaminophen, dexamethasone, and diphenhydramine. Patient and nursing satisfaction were assessed after switching to SC daratumumab, using internally developed surveys. Using wholesale acquisition cost, cost analysis was performed between the two formulations. Infusion chair time, improvement in clinic efficiency (using our standard infusion time of 90 minutes for IV daratumumab infusions after the 2nd dose), and safety were assessed and compared. Results A total of 26 patients were treated with daratumumab for MM and AL amyloidosis from June 1, 2020 to August 1, 2020. 85% (22/26) of patients were administered the SC formulation. Of these 22 patients, 68% of patients were switched from the IV formulation (15/22) and 32% (7/22) were na?ve to daratumumab. The majority (14/22) of SC administrations were patients receiving daratumumab monotherapy for relapsed MM. A breakdown of patient regimens and insurance type is seen in table 1. IRRs were reported in 0 patients starting [or transitioning to] SC daratumumab. Injection site reactions were not reported in any patient. One patient had facial and neck swelling 2 days after administration of SC daratumumab (with no other symptoms) but resolved within 24 hours of an additional dose of dexamethasone and did not recur upon re-challenge of SC daratumumab. Severe neutropenia (ANC less than 500) was reported in 9% of patients (2/22), both patients in the group na?ve to daratumumab. Febrile neutropenia was not seen. One patient was being treated with concomitant pomalidomide and the second was treated with lenalidomide and had a baseline ANC of 500 prior to initiation of therapy. Adoption of SC daratumumab led to elimination of 133 hours of chair time and nursing time, or 1260 hours annualized for the year. Cost savings with the elimination of nursing time translates to approximately $100,000 to the institution and approximately $230,000 to the payer. The results compiled from patient and nursing satisfaction surveys are being analyzed and will be presented. Conclusion We report a successful conversion and adoption of SC daratumumab at our ambulatory hematology/oncology clinic. Insurance authorization does not appear to limit the adoption of this therapy in clinic irrespective of diagnosis or regimen used. Furthermore, the reduction in chair time and patient convenience was largely beneficial in light of COVID-19 to minimize patient exposure in clinic.

Controlling infectious diseases requires understanding of the conditions that increase spread. Prior studies have identified sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic associations. Ireland offers an unusual opportunity to quantify how high infection rates in one country impacted cases in a neighbouring country. Methods : We analysed official statistics on confirmed COVID-19 cases on the island of Ireland for 52 weeks from March 2020. Our main research question was: Did higher cases in Northern Ireland (NI) impact the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)? We used least squares regression to compare confirmed cases in ROI counties that border NI with the rest of the state. We included in our model sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic factors. We employed the latitude of each county town as an instrumental variable to isolate a quasi-experimental estimate of the cross-border spread. Results : In the quasi-experimental framework, and controlling for population density, age distribution and circulatory disease prevalence, border counties had an extra 21.0 (95%CI: 8.4-33.6) confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1000 people. This equates to an estimated 9,611 additional cases in ROI, or 4% of the national total in the first year of the pandemic. Our results were substantively similar in non-experimental frameworks, with alternative additional predictors, and in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, population density in ROI counties was positively associated with confirmed cases and higher proportions of residents in the professional classes was negatively associated. Conclusion : On the island of Ireland during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, high infection rates in NI increased cases in the neighbouring ROI. Maximising co-ordination of pandemic responses among neighbouring countries is essential to minimising disease spread, and its associated disruptions to society and the economy.

To boost IPC measures, training to reinforce preventive practices, which are pertinent to needs and encompass the expectations of the HCP, is indispensable. Thus, these expectations of the HCP should be explored. METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive survey, we used convenience sampling technique to ask the participants to list their expectations on of covid-19 IPC training paper based forms. Using the category construction approach, we organised the expectations and grouped the participants on the basis of their work and place of work to analyse the association using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Many participants expected to learn about the use of PPE and masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, cleaning and disinfection, basic precautions for personal protection during the training. Expectations also included various administrative queries, sample collection and clinical skills for diagnosis and management. There was significant association of many categories of expectations with the nature and place of work in the hospital. CONCLUSION: When planning IPC training, these expectations of the HCP may be carefully addressed. Information about causative agent, transmission and clinical aspects may will give a contextual meaning to IPC training. Some important preventive measures, which few participants expected to learn must be analysed in detail to understand the attitude of the HCP towards them. Efforts to appraise the HCP for the importance of these measures and promoting its practice may play a vital role to curb the spread of infectious diseases.","output":"Expectations of healthcare personnel from infection prevention and control services for preparedness of healthcare organisation in view of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated Screening of COVID-19 from chest CT is of emergency and importance during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in 2020. However, accurate screening of COVID-19 is still a massive challenge due to the spatial complexity of 3D volumes, the labeling difficulty of infection areas, and the slight discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in chest CT. While a few pioneering works have made significant progress, they are either demanding manual annotations of infection areas or lack of interpretability. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving highly accurate and interpretable screening of COVID-19 from chest CT with weak labels. We propose an attention-based deep 3D multiple instance learning (AD3D-MIL) where a patient-level label is assigned to a 3D chest CT that is viewed as a bag of instances. AD3D-MIL can semantically generate deep 3D instances following the possible infection area. AD3D-MIL further applies an attention-based pooling approach to 3D instances to provide insight into each instance's contribution to the bag label. AD3D-MIL finally learns Bernoulli distributions of the bag-level labels for more accessible learning. We collected 460 chest CT examples: 230 CT examples from 79 patients with COVID-19, 100 CT examples from 100 patients with common pneumonia, and 130 CT examples from 130 people without pneumonia.

OBJECTIVE The objective was to examine changes in vitamin status after 2 bariatric surgical techniques. DESIGN A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 Scandinavian hospitals. The subjects were 60 superobese patients [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 50-60]. The surgical interventions were either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. All patients received multivitamins, iron, calcium, and vitamin D supplements. Gastric bypass patients also received a vitamin B-12 substitute. The patients were examined before surgery and 6 wk, 6 mo, and 1 y after surgery. RESULTS Of 60 surgically treated patients, 59 completed the follow-up. After surgery, duodenal switch patients had lower mean vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and a steeper decline in thiamine concentrations than did the gastric bypass patients. Other vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin C, and vitamin E adjusted for serum lipids) did not change differently in the surgical groups, and concentrations were either stable or increased. Furthermore, duodenal switch patients had lower hemoglobin and total cholesterol concentrations and a lower BMI (mean reduction: 41% compared with 30%) than did gastric bypass patients 1 y after surgery. Additional dietary supplement use was more frequent among duodenal switch patients (55%) than among gastric bypass patients (26%). CONCLUSIONS Compared with gastric bypass, duodenal switch may be associated with a greater risk of vitamin A and D deficiencies in the first year after surgery and of thiamine deficiency in the initial months after surgery. Patients who undergo these 2 surgical interventions may require different monitoring and supplementation regimens in the first year after surgery.

INTERVENTIONS RALSCP from November 2012 to July 2020. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Information was collected from the electronic medical records. Pre-operative and post-operative assessment included a urogynecologic history, prolapse staging, cough stress test, and validated quality of life questionnaires. Anatomical success was defined as POP stage less than 2 at last follow-up. Mean follow-up was 24.6  17.9 months. Sixteen women (23.9%) reported bulge symptoms at the latest follow-up; upon POP-Q staging, surgical failure or recurrence was observed in 35 (52.2%) patients. On multiple logistic regression analysis, a pre-operative POP-Q point Ba measurement  3 cm beyond the hymen was independently related to surgical failure. Late post-operative complications included three (4.5%) cases of post-operative ventral hernia and five (7.5%) cases of mesh erosion, all in patients operated using Ethibond sutures.

Of 582 respondents, 258 (45%) were in the US, and 314 (55%) were international. 80.4% were affiliated with academic institutions. 94% respondents reported changes in clinical practice; 95% reported conversion to telemedicine for at least some appointments. However, almost 10% practitioners felt the need to see patients in person specifically because of billing concerns and perceived institutional pressure. Over 50% believed neuro-oncology patients were at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. 67% practitioners suspended enrollment for at least one clinical trial: 53% suspended phase II and 62% suspended phase III trial enrollment. 71% clinicians feared for their or their families safety, specifically because of their clinical duties. 20% percent said they did not have enough PPE to work safely; about the same percentage were unhappy with their institutions response to the pandemic. 43% believed the pandemic would negatively affect their academic career, and 52% fellowship program directors were worried about losing funding for their training programs. While 69% respondents reported increased stress, 44% were offered no psychosocial support. 37% had their salary reduced. 36% researchers had to temporarily close their laboratories. In contrast, the pandemic created positive changes in perceived patient and family satisfaction, quality of communication, and use of technology to deliver care and interactions with other practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has altered standard treatment schedules and limited investigational treatment options for patients. In some cases, clinicians felt institutional pressure to continue conducting billable in-person visits when telemedicine visits would have sufficed. A lack of institutional support created anxiety among clinicians and researchers. We make specific recommendations to guide clinical and scientific infrastructure moving forward.","output":"COVD-31.

ANIMALS 837 calves in feedlots in Ohio and Texas. PROCEDURE Nasal swab specimens were obtained from cattle at arrival in a feedlot (day 0) and at various times during the initial 28 days after arrival. Specimens were tested for BCV, using an antigen-capture ELISA. Serum samples were obtained at arrival and again 28 days after arrival and tested for antibodies to BCV, using an antibody-detection ELISA. Information was collected regarding treatment for cattle with respiratory tract disease and average daily gain during the feeding period. Pulmonary lesions were evaluated at slaughter. RESULTS Cattle shedding BCV from the nasal cavity and developing an antibody response against BCV were 1.6 times more likely to require treatment for respiratory tract disease than cattle that did not shed the virus or develop an immune response against BCV. Additionally, cattle that shed BCV from the nasal cavity were 2.2 times more likely to have pulmonary lesions at slaughter than cattle that did not shed the virus. The BCV shedding or seroconversion status did not affect average daily gain.

Little is known about the clinical potential of specifically modulating GABAB-Rs. Here, we tested lesogaberan, a peripherally restricted GABAB-R agonist, as an interventive therapy in diabetic NOD mice. Lesogaberan treatment temporarily restored normoglycemia in most newly diabetic NOD mice. Combined treatment with a suboptimal dose of lesogaberan and proinsulin/alum immunization in newly diabetic NOD mice or a low-dose anti-CD3 in severely hyperglycemic NOD mice greatly increased T1D remission rates relative to each monotherapy. Mice receiving combined lesogaberan and anti-CD3 displayed improved glucose tolerance and, unlike mice that received anti-CD3 alone, had some islets with many insulin+ cells, suggesting that lesogaberan helped to rapidly inhibit ?-cell destruction. Hence, GABAB-R-specific agonists may provide adjunct therapies for T1D. Finally, the analysis of microarray and RNA-Seq databases suggested that the expression of GABAB-Rs and GABAA-Rs, as well as GABA production/secretion-related genes, may be a more common feature of immune cells than currently recognized.","output":"GABAB-Receptor Agonist-Based Immunotherapy for Type 1 Diabetes in NOD Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) has been shown to be an important non-invasive tool to quantify neuronal loss or damage in the investigation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders.

METHODS This study is a systematic review of the literature, conducted during the month of November and December of 2019 of articles published in the last 16 years (2003-2019). The search for relevant references was done through the exploration of electronic databases (PubMed/Medline and Embase). We searched for studied including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, Sj?gren's syndrome (pSS), vasculitis and Beh?et.

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying this connection is limited, however immune activity represents a possible pathway. While there have been numerous studies connecting immune activity to psychosomatic psychopathology, there is a lack of research on patients with HF. We examined forty-one consecutive outpatients affected by HF. We assessed psychosomatic psychopathology using the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15). The Psychosocial Index (PSI) was used for assessing stress and psychosocial dimensions. Depression was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha were ascertained. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to test for associations between inflammatory cytokines and psychosomatic psychopathology (i.e., DCPR syndromes, PHQ-15) and psychological dimensions (i.e., BDI-II, PSI). A significant positive correlation was found between IL-6 levels and psychosomatic psychopathology even when controlling for any confounding variables (i.e., Body-mass index (BMI), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, statin use, aspirin use, beta blockers use, age, and gender). In contrast, the associations between TNF-alpha levels were non-significant. These findings can contribute to research in support of a psychoneuroimmune connection between psychosomatic psychopathology and HF.

Restrictive measures were first announced in the country in March 13-16th of 2020. Participants: The 82,241 Brazilians who died from COVID-19 between 03/12/2020 and 07/22/2020 and the over 60 million Brazilian cell phone users whose mobile devices used at least one of the over 600 applications that have incorporated the In Loco?

Results: The degree of social isolation at a given date showed a strong positive correlation to COVID-19 deaths 39 days later (Spearman Rho=.85, p<.001). The number of deaths as a function of social isolation and number of days passed since 02/01/2020 indicated a specific trajectory of deaths over time for every level of social isolation, with more isolation being associated to a higher peak number of deaths, a sooner arrival of that peak and a higher number of accumulated deaths. A comparison between the daily COVID-19 deaths as projected from data before the implementation of restrictive measures in Brazil and the number of deaths actually observed showed that the increase in social isolation can be directly linked to 10.5% more deaths over the period of observation. Conclusions: There appears to be strong empirical evidence that, in Brazil, the adoption of restrictive measures increasing social isolation have worsened the pandemic in that country instead of mitigating it, likely as a higher-order effect emerging from a combination of factors.","output":"Does Social Isolation Really Curb COVID-19 Deaths?

Wildfire incidents can be an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly for wildland firefighters who congregate in work and living settings. In this review, we examine how exposure to wildfire smoke can contribute to an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Human exposure to particulate matter (PM), a component of wildfire smoke, has been associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses; increasing the likelihood for adverse respiratory symptomology and pathology. In multiple epidemiological studies, wildfire smoke exposure has been associated with acute lower respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and wildfire smoke inhalation may present an increased risk for COVID-19 illness in wildland firefighters due to PM based transport of SARS CoV-2 virus and up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) (i.e. ACE-2 functions as a trans-membrane receptor, allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain entry into the epithelial cell). Wildfire smoke exposure may also increase risk for more severe COVID-19 illness such as cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current infection control measures, including social distancing, wearing cloth masks, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, frequent hand washing, and daily screening for COVID-19 symptoms are very important measures to reduce infections and severe health outcomes. Exposure to wildfire smoke may introduce additive or even multiplicative risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of disease in wildland firefighters. Thus, additional mitigative measures may be needed to prevent the co-occurrence of wildfire smoke exposure and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Wildland firefighter exposure to smoke and COVID-19: A new risk on the fire line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes an AI Book Club as an innovative 20-hour professional development (PD) model designed to prepare teachers with AI content knowledge and an understanding of the ethical issues posed by bias in AI that are foundational to developing AI-literate citizens.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 965 adolescents (mean age = 15.26, SD = 0.46) was conducted in May 2020. PAT, ST and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety were assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, the Youth Self-Rating Insomnia Scales, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale via an online survey platform. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between COVID-19-related fear, PAT, ST and combinations of PAT and ST with insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: COVID-19-related fear was associated with higher odds of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. PAT was associated with lower odds of insomnia and depressive symptoms, while ST was associated with higher odds of these three symptoms. After combining PAT and ST, the group with both low PAT and high ST was set as the referent. For insomnia, groups with low ST reported significantly lower odds of symptoms. For depression, groups with high PAT and/or low ST reported lower odds of symptoms. Regarding anxiety, only the group with both high PAT and low ST reported lower odds of symptoms. Generally, group with both high PAT and low ST reported lower odds of the three symptoms than the referent. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related fear was a risk factor for developing insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents. Fortunately, moving more and sitting less were good for sleep and mental health in Chinese adolescents during the pandemic.

This is the well-known SIR model in which we further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA) simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in many cases (for example like China).

A major focus of this review is to postulate a possible epidemiological cycle for BoTV, based on epidemiological data obtained in our studies and other published data, and progressing from the newborn calf to the adult animal. The distribution, host range, pathogenesis, disease and clinical signs (under experimental and natural exposure), pathology, diagnosis, prevention, treatment and control of BoTV infections are also described. In addition, a discussion of the zoonotic implications of torovirus-like particles detected in patients with gastroenteritis that resemble and cross-react with BoTV is presented. Hopefully, the findings described here will alert others to the existence of BoTV in cattle and its contribution to the diarrheal disease complex. This review also highlights the need for continual vigilance for potential zoonotic viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, such as the SARS coronavirus.","output":"Bovine torovirus (Breda virus) revisited."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19 infections on health and mortality, a growing body of literature indicates there are wide-ranging indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures on population health and wellbeing. Exploring these indirect impacts in the context of a socially deprived UK coastal town will help identify priority areas to focus COVID-19 recovery efforts on. Methods Data on primary care diagnosis, hospital admissions, and several socioeconomic outcomes between 2016 and Spring 2021 in the UK town of Fleetwood were collected and analysed in an exploratory analysis looking at pre- and post- COVID-19 patterns in health and social outcomes. Weekly and monthly trends were plotted by time and differences between periods examined using Chi-squared and t-tests. Results Initial falls in hospital admissions and diagnoses of conditions in primary care in March 2020 were followed by sustained changes to health service activity for specific diagnostic and demographic groups, including for chronic kidney disease and young people. Increases in the number of people receiving Universal Credit and children eligible for free school meals appear to be greater for those in the least deprived areas of the town. Discussion These exploratory findings provide initial evidence of the sustained impact of the pandemic across several health and social outcomes. Examining these trends in multivariate analyses will further test these associations and establish the strength of the medium term impact of the pandemic on the population of this coastal town. Advanced modelling of this data is ongoing and will be published shortly.","output":"Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a socially deprived UK coastal town: a preliminary exploratory analysis of health and socioeconomic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although with exceptions, evidence seems to indicate that children have lower susceptibility than adults to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function). Further studies are needed and the development of a validated score based on all the most common presumed markers of disease severity seems essential.","output":"What are the risk factors for admission to the pediatric intensive unit among pediatric patients with COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To demonstrate the use of a cohort for assessing knowledge, perceptions and behaviours of the Singapore population towards infectious disease outbre","output":"Use of a Community-Based Cohort for Rapid and Repeated Assessments of Public Knowledge, Perceptions and Behaviours During the Evolving COVID-19 Outbreak in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tumor size is one of the most important issues for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment and prognosis, but the classification of it is still controversial. The aim of this study was to screen appropriate cutoffs for size of solitary hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. METHODS: A cohort of 1760 patients with solitary HBV-related HCC undergoing curative liver resection was divided into 11 groups based on tumor size in 1-cm interval. The minimum p value method was used to screen the appropriate size cutoff according to overall survival (OS). If multiple cutoffs meet the above standard, a univariate analysis will be performed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and hazard ratio (HR) will be considered as a criterion to assess the difference in survival. RESULTS: There are 8 dichotomy, 8 trichotomy, and no inquartation cutoffs that were screened when classifying tumor sizes in accordance with OS. The HR values of tumor size at these trichotomy cutoffs for OS were compared, and the highest HR value is 2.79 when size cutoff is 3/9 cm. Then, we reclassified patients into three new classifications: &#8804; 3 cm (n = 422), > 3 and &#8804; 9 cm (n = 1072), and > 9 cm (n = 266). The comparison of clinicopathologic characteristics among these three classifications showed that the increase of tumor size was associated with the increase of &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP), microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor differentiation, and liver cirrhosis. And the comparison of the OS among three classifications showed statistical differences.

Access to social media in low- and middle-income countries has increased exponentially in recent years due to technological advances. Despite this growth, the use of social media in low- and middle-income countries is less well-researched than in high-income countries. OBJECTIVE: To identify, explore and summarize the current state of the literature on the use of social media for health in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted on literature available to December 2017. Six databases were searched, and grey literature was identified through the Google and Google Scholar search engines. Literature was considered for inclusion if it (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in or in relation to a low or middle-income country, (3) reported on as least one type of social media or social media use generally for health purposes, and (4) reported on at least one aspect of human health. Content analysis was performed to identify themes. RESULTS: Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one were research articles, and nine were review/discussion/descriptive and evaluative reports. Since 2010, when the first article was published, most of the literature has focused on Asian (n = 15) and African (n = 12) countries. Twitter (n = 11) and Facebook (n = 10) were the most frequently discussed individual social media platforms. Four themes were identified: (1) use for health education and influence (sub-themes were health behaviour and health education); (2) use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; (3) use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and (4) producers and consumers of social media for health (sub-themes were misinformation, organizational challenges, users expectations, and challenges of unique sub-populations). Most studies addressed more than one theme. CONCLUSION: Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration amongst health providers in low- and middle-income countries. Misinformation or poorly communicated information can contribute to negative health behaviours and adverse health outcomes amongst consumers, as well as hysteria and chaos. Organizations using social media should provide accurate and readable information. Promotion of credible social media sites by governments, health care professionals and researchers, as well as education on the appropriate use of social media, could help to lessen the effect of misinformation. This is a nascent body of literature and future research should investigate the relative effectiveness of various platforms for different users, other potential uses, and pursue a broader geographical focus.","output":"The emerging use of social media for health-related purposes in low and middle-income countries: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections during pregnancy can have devastating consequences on pregnancy outcomes, fetal development, and maternal health.

AIMS: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing reports to investigate the impact of anti-TNF treatments on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search at PubMed and SCOPUS databases using specific keywords was performed. All reports of COVID-19 outcomes for patients receiving anti-TNF therapy by September 2021 were included. Pooled effect measures were calculated using a random-effects model. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale for observational studies was used to assess bias. Studies that were not eligible for meta-analysis were described qualitatively. RESULTS: In total, 84 studies were included in the systematic review, and 35 were included in the meta-analysis. Patients receiving anti-TNF treatment, compared to non-anti-TNF, among COVID-19 cases had a lower probability of hospitalisation (eight studies, 2555 patients, pooled OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.42-0.67, I2 = 0) and severe disease defined as intensive care unit admission or death (two studies, 1823 patients, pooled OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.96, I2 = 0), after adjustment for validated predictors of adverse disease outcomes. No difference was found for the risk for hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in populations without COVID-19 for patients receiving anti-TNF treatment compared to non-anti-TNF (three studies, 5 994 958 participants, pooled risk ratio = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.68-1.39, I2 = 20) adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities.

It is correlated with critical outcomes; therefore, constant monitoring in neonatal intensive care units or home environments is required. The aim of this work was to develop solutions for remote neonatal intensive supervision systems, which should assist medical diagnosis of premature infants and raise alarm at cardiac abnormalities, such as bradycardia. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has put a worldwide stress upon the medical staff and the management of healthcare units. Materials and Methods: A traditional medical diagnosing scheme was set up, implemented with the aid of powerful mathematical operators. The algorithm was tailored to the infants personal ECG characteristics and was tested on real ECG data from the publicly available PhysioNet database Preterm Infant Cardio-Respiratory Signals Database. Different processing problems were solved: noise filtering, baseline drift removal, event detection and compression of medical data using the  trous wavelet transform. Results: In all 10 available clinical cases, the bradycardia events annotated by the physicians were correctly detected using the RR intervals. Compressing the ECG signals for remote transmission, we obtained compression ratios (CR) varying from 1.72 to 7.42, with the median CR value around 3. Conclusions: We noticed that a significant amount of noise can be added to a signal while monitoring using standard clinical sensors. We tried to offer solutions for these technical problems. Recent studies have shown that persons infected with the COVID-19 disease are frequently reported to develop cardiovascular symptoms and cardiac arrhythmias. An automatic surveillance system (both for neonates and adults) has a practical medical application. The proposed algorithm is personalized, no fixed reference value being applied, and the algorithm follows the neonates cardiac rhythm changes. The performance depends on the characteristics of the input ECG. The signal-to-noise ratio of the processed ECG was improved, with a value of up to 10 dB.","output":"Automated Medical Care: Bradycardia Detection and Cardiac Monitoring of Preterm Infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While institutional repositories are common in medical schools and academic health centers, they have been used by only a small number of health systems to track and promote their research and scholarly activity.

Palliative care organizations have responded to the growing demand for the rapid dissemination of research, clinical guidance, and instructions for care to clinicians, patients with COVID-19, and their caregivers by creating COVID-19 resource Web pages. Here, end users can access resources that can be updated in real time. These Web pages, however, can be variable in what resources they offer and for whom they are designed for (clinicians, patients, caregivers). Therefore, this project was conducted to consolidate these resources via summary tables of specific contents available through each Web page grouped by palliative care domains (eg, care discussion and planning, communication, symptom management, care access) and to identify the target audience. This environmental scan was conducted by compiling a comprehensive list of COVID-19 resource Web pages of palliative care organizations generated by reviewing previously published research studies and consulting with palliative care research experts. Snowballing techniques were used to identify resource Web pages not captured in the initial scan. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible Web pages for content via a form developed for the study, and Cohen  statistic was calculated to ensure interrater reliability. The final  statistic was 0.76. Of the 24 websites screened, 15 websites met our eligibility criteria. Among the eligible resource Web pages, most (n = 12, 80%) had specific target audiences and care settings, whereas the rest presented information targeted to all audiences.

Methods: Students and lecturers from the Medical Faculty of Ulm were asked to voluntarily participate in online surveys during the summer semesters of 2019 and 2020. The data was subsequently analyzed from a longitudinal and cross-sectional view descriptively as well as by using t-tests and Chi(2)-tests. In addition, using regression analyses, the results were controlled for associations with age, study progress, and media affinity. Results: In the summer semester 2019, 163 students (6.1% response rate) and 56 lecturers (11.5%) participated in the surveys. In the following year, the participation increased to 285 students (10.4%) and 64 lecturers (12.8%). Video-based teaching elements such as videoconferencing and lecture recordings were increasingly used after the COVID-19 outbreak and considered more significant for future teaching. In contrast, virtual reality, augmented reality and 360-videos, grouped under the term extended reality (XR), are descriptively becoming less important. Most lecturers would like to teach more digitally even after the pandemic but fear a decrease in learning effectiveness and contact with students, who tend to prefer asynchronous learning opportunities. Conclusion: Video-based teaching elements proved to be a low-threshold and time-efficient solution during the lockdown and were also recommended for future use. The XR technology has been put on the back burner for the time being, but in view of the increased digital teaching motivation and capabilities, it can be assumed that lecturers will recognize and use the potential of XR as soon as they have the freedom to design innovative teaching again.","output":"Did video kill the XR star?

Yet, Africa faces numerous challenges in the availability, analyses, and use of data to inform health decision-making. Countries have limited access to their population data. Those with access, struggle to utilize these data for program improvements. Owing to the rapid growth of mobile phone ownership and use in the region, Africa is poised to leverage AI technologies to increase the adoption, access and use of data for health. To discuss and propose solutions for responsible development and adoption of innovations like AI in Africa, a virtual workshop was organized from the 21st to 24th June, 2021. This report highlights critical policy dimensions of strengthening digital health ecosystems by high-level policymakers, technical experts, academia, public and private sector partners. METHOD: The four days workshop focused on nine sessions, with each session focusing on three themes. Discussions during the sessions concentrated on public and private sectors, the academia and multilateral organizations deployment of AI. These discussions expanded participants understanding of AI, the opportunities and challenges that exist during adoption, including the future of AI for health in the African region. Approximately 250 participants attended the workshop, including countries representatives from ministries of Health, Information and Technology, Developmental Organizations, Private Sector, Academia and Research Institutions among others. RESULTS: The workshop resolved that governments and relevant stakeholders should collaborate to ensure that AI and digital health receive critical attention. Government ownership and leadership were identified as critical for sustainable financing and effective scale-up of AI-enabled applications in Africa. Thus, government is to ensure that key recommendations from the workshop are implemented to improve health sector development in Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The AI workshop was a good forum to deliberate important issues regarding AI for health in the African context. It was concluded that there is a need to focus on vital priorities in deploying AI in Africa: Data protection, privacy and sharing protocols; training and creating platforms for researchers; funding and business models; developing frameworks for assessing and implementing AI; organizing forums and conferences on AI; and instituting regulations, governance and ethical guidelines for AI. There is a need to adopt a health systems approach in planning for AI to reduce inefficiencies, redundancies while increasing effectiveness in the use of AI. Thus, robust collaborations and partnerships among governments and various stakeholders were identified as key.","output":"Data revolution, health status transformation and the role of artificial intelligence for health and pandemic preparedness in the African context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Public-Private Partnership is also used, at international level, to carry out interventions in urban variant on areas or buildings that, by enhancing the value of (private) real estate properties, guarantee an economic return for the local community through an extraordinary contribution of urbanization (ECU) paid to the Administration by the private entity.

In this study, we applied a zero-valent nanosilver/titania-chitosan (nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS) filter bed, whose broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy has been proven previously, for the removal of viral aerosols to minimize the risk of airborne transmission. Methods: The photochemical deposition method was used to synthesize the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS antiviral material. The surface morphology, elemental composition, and microstructure of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophages were used as surrogate viral aerosols. The antiviral efficacy of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS was evaluated by the MS2 plaque reduction assay (PRA) and filtration experiments. In the filtration experiments, the MS2 aerosols passed through the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter, and the MS2 aerosol removal efficiency was evaluated by an optical particle counter and culture method. Results and Conclusions: In the MS2 PRA, 3 g of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS inactivated 97% of MS2 bacteriophages in 20 mL liquid culture (2  0.5  1016 PFU/mL) within 2 hours. The removal efficiency of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter (thickness: 6 cm) for MS2 aerosols reached up to 93%. Over 95% of MS2 bacteriophages on the surface of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter were inactivated within 20 minutes.

The current literature is controversial regarding the potential risk factors for developing SP or SPM (SP-SPM) in non-ventilated COVID-19 patients. Our research addressed a twofold objective: (a) to investigate the characteristics of patients with SP-SPM (both with and without COVID-19) and compare them to patients with sole COVID-19; (b) to quantify the risk of in-hospital mortality associated with SP-SPM and COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective caseCcontrol study was conducted in the emergency departments (ED) of two tertiary hospitals in Timisoara, Romania, over one year (1st April 2020?31st March 2021; 64,845 records in total) and 70 cases of SP-SPM were identified (both SARS-CoV-2 positives and negatives). The control group comprised COVID-19 patients with no SP-SPM, included at a 2:1 ratio. Logistic regression was employed to quantify the in-hospital mortality risk associated with age, SP-SPM, and COVID-19. RESULTS: SP-SPM and COVID-19 were connected with prolonged hospitalization, a higher percentage of intensive care admission, and a higher mortality.

The purpose of this study was to offer a descriptive report of the psychosocial functioning, perceived risk and fear of cancer progression, and COVID-19 pandemic impact and experiences in a unique, high-risk patient cohort: breast cancer survivors whose cancer treatment was delayed and/or changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 50 women with dual carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or invasive breast cancer whose cancer surgery was postponed due to the pandemic. As they awaited delayed surgery or shortly after they received delayed surgery, participants completed questionnaires on psychosocial functioning (depression, anxiety, sleep, and quality of life), their perceived risk and fear of cancer progression, patient-provider communication about disruptions in their care, personal impact of the pandemic, worry/threat about COVID-19, and COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses. Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were computed among continuous study variables. Independent samples t-tests explored group differences in psychosocial functioning between survivors who were still awaiting delayed surgery and those who had recently received it. Results: Overall, the sample denied that the pandemic seriously negatively impacted their finances or resource access and reported low-to-moderate levels of psychosocial distress and fear about COVID-19. Twenty-six percent had clinically significant levels of fear of cancer progression, with levels comparable to other recent work. About a third were still awaiting delayed cancer surgery and this group reported lower satisfaction with communication from oncology providers but overall did not seem to report more psychosocial difficulties than those who already had surgery. Conclusion: Shortly before or after primary breast cancer surgery that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this sample of survivors appears to be generally managing well psychosocially. However, many psychosocial difficulties (e.g., fear of cancer recurrence/progression) typically have an onset after the completion of treatment, therefore, research should continue to follow this cohort of cancer survivors as the pandemics direct impact on their care likely increases their risk for these difficulties later in survivorship.","output":"Psychosocial Impact of Cancer Care Disruptions in Women With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dried blood samples (DBSs) have many advantages; yet, impediments have limited the clinical utilization of DBSs.

We also provided a thorough procedure validation using this volumetric DBS collection device with an established quantitative proteomics analysis method, and then analyzed 1000 proteins using this approach in DBSs concomitantly with serum for future consideration of utility in clinical applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Telehealth consultations were performed by the departments of Otolaryngology of Foggia and Bari University Hospitals. Patients affected by cypress pollen allergy took part in a phone interview and were asked about their sinonasal symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown, by answering the sinonasal outcome test (I-SNOT-22) questionnaire. Further data concerning the medications used to treat allergy and the number of days per month in which they were used were collected. The responses about the COVID-19 lockdown were compared to those obtained by the same patients in our clinics the previous year. The statistical analysis was executed by using the paired sample t-test and the Bartlett test considering as significant values with p values <0.05. RESULTS: Forty patients affected by cypress pollen allergy visited at Foggia and Bari University Hospitals were enrolled in this study. All I-SNOT-22 scores concerning the COVID-19 lockdown were lower than those of the previous year; moreover, 18 (81.8%) clinical parameters were statistically significant (p<0.05). Also, in regard to the treatment, results about COVID-19 lockdown were overall better than those of 2019, with 50% (n=3) of the investigated drugs, reporting statistical significance (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study was able to evidence the fundamental role of primary prevention in Allergology.

Little is known about variant B.1.1.519 with spike mutation T478K, dominant in Mexico. We describe a linked SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.519 outbreak in three IDD facilities in the Netherlands. METHODS: Following notification of the index, subsequent cases were identified through serial PCR group testing. Positive specimens were submitted for whole-genome-sequencing. Clinical information was gathered through interviews with staff members of the three facilities. RESULTS: Attack rate (AR) in clients of the index facility was 92% (23/25), total AR in clients 45% (33/73) and in staff members 24% (8/34). 55% (18/33) of client cases were asymptomatic, versus 25% (2/8) of staff members. Five client cases (15%) were hospitalized, two died (6%). Sequencing yielded the same specific B.1.1.519 genotype in all three facilities. No significant difference in median viral load was established comparing the B.1.1.519 variant with other circulating variants. The index of the linked outbreak reported no travel history or link to suspected or confirmed cases suggesting regional surveillance. Observed peak regional prevalence of B.1.1.519 during the outbreak supports this. CONCLUSION: AR, morbidity and mortality prior to control measures taking effect were high, probably related to the specific characteristics of the IDD setting and its clients. We assessed no evidence for intrinsic contributing properties of variant B.1.1.519. Our study argues for enhanced infection prevention protocols in the IDD setting, and prioritization of this group for vaccination against COVID-19.

METHODS: 502,640 participants aged 40C69 years at baseline (54C79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK during 2006C10. A modified assessment of frailty using Frieds classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available for 16/03/2020C01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. RESULTS: 4510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1326, negative = 3184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid ( 4 comorbidity groupings vs 0C1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups.

The evaluation was conducted on 40 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Jingzhou Hospital of Infectious Disease(Chest Hospital) of Hubei Pro-vince from January 30~(th) to March 21~(th), 2020. In these cases, patients were treated with other integrated Chinese and Western medicines regimens in the recommended Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection diagnosis and treatment regimen. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data, nucleic acid clearance time, and imaging data were compared and analyzed before and after treatment. After administration with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection, the clinical symptoms of 40 cases were alleviated markedly, and their blood analysis and biochemical indexes returned to normal. The lung CT showed more than 50% of lesion absorption rate, and the viral nucleic acid test showed the average clearance time of patients was 16.6 days, and the average length of hospital stay was 25.9 days. After administration with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection, the symptoms of cough and fatigue were alleviated significantly, and the appetite was significantly improved compared with before, especially for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.

Aging is also a reason for corneal degeneration. Depending on the level of the injury, conservative therapies and donor tissue transplantation are the most common treatments for corneal diseases. Not only is there a lack of donor tissue and risk of infection/rejection, but the inherent ability of corneal cells and layers to regenerate has led to research in regenerative approaches and treatments. METHODS: In this review, we first discussed the anatomy of the cornea and the required properties for reconstructing layers of the cornea. Regenerative approaches are divided into two main categories; using direct cell/growth factor delivery or using scaffold-based cell delivery. It is expected delivered cells migrate and integrate into the host tissue and restore its structure and function to restore vision. Growth factor delivery also has shown promising results for corneal surface regeneration. Scaffold-based approaches are categorized based on the type of scaffold, since it has a significant impact on the efficiency of regeneration, into the hydrogel and non-hydrogel based scaffolds. Various types of cells, biomaterials, and techniques are well covered. RESULTS: The most important characteristics to be considered for biomaterials in corneal regeneration are suitable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and transparency. Moreover, a curved shape structure and spatial arrangement of the fibrils have been shown to mimic the corneal extracellular matrix for cells and enhance cell differentiation. CONCLUSION: Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches showed to have promising outcomes for corneal regeneration. However, besides proper mechanical and optical properties, other factors such as appropriate sterilization method, storage, shelf life and etc. should be taken into account in order to develop an engineered cornea for clinical trials.

Patients are less disabled than before. However, primary prevention has remained a dilemma. Factors predicting allergy and asthma risk have proven complex: risk factors increase the risk while protective factors counteract them. Interaction of human body with environmental biodiversity with micro-organisms and biogenic compounds as well as the central role of epigenetic adaptation in immune homeostasis have given new insight.Allergic diseases are good indicators of the twisted relation to environment. In various non-communicable diseases, the protective mode of the immune system indicates low-grade inflammation without apparent cause.Giving microbes, pro- and prebiotics, has shownsome promise in prevention and treatment.

Recent reports have pointed to thrombosis with associated thrombocytopenia as an adverse effect occurring at a low frequency in some individuals after vaccination. The causes of such events may be related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions with different C-type lectin receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the CD147 receptor, or to different soluble splice variants of the spike protein, adenovirus vector interactions with the CD46 receptor or platelet factor 4 antibodies. Similar findings have been reported for several viral diseases after vaccine administration. In addition, immunological mechanisms elicited by viral vectors related to cellular delivery could play a relevant role in individuals with certain genetic backgrounds. Although rare, the potential COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) requires immediate validation, especially in risk groups, such as the elderly, chronic smokers, and individuals with pre-existing incidences of thrombocytopenia; and if necessary, a reformulation of existing vaccines.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccines and ThrombosisRoadblock or Dead-End Street?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no denying the fact that, for a developing country like Bangladesh, the economic consequences of lockdown for containing COVID-19 pandemic can be far reaching affecting livelihoods of millions of households. Given that the share of food consumption expenditure to total expenditure is higher in the lower income groups of Bangladesh, this shock is expected to directly affect affordability of consumption of basic food items of these households. Using nationally representative household survey data of Bangladesh, and while following the Feasible Generalized Least Square method, this paper attempts to examine food poverty, food consumption inequality along with vulnerability to food poverty of households and explores the importance of different socio-demographic and environmental factors in this connection. Our estimation reflects that, greater percentage of households with young children or with elderly people are found to suffer high food vulnerability. In addition, households in environmentally endangered regions e.g. drought prone areas or river erosion affected places are more food vulnerable than those in other parts of the country. Certain occupation groups e.g. day labourer and self-employed are found to be highly vulnerable to food poverty while according to our decomposition analysis of food consumption inequality, area of residence (urban vs. rural) is expected to cause sizable inequality in food consumption. This study can therefore, help in identifying food vulnerable households for government's social protection programs and COVID-19 incentive packages, and thereby can contribute towards designing effective poverty reduction strategies.","output":"Assessing Food Poverty, Vulnerability and Food Consumption Inequality in the Context of COVID-19: A Case of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anxiety is the biggest mental health problem in children, and research tells us it's on the rise.

METHODS The study is a retrospective chart review of patients admitted between 16 March and 23 April 2020. All infected children in Jordan were hospitalised. Serial RT-PCR testing was undertaken 7 days after the first test and then on alternate days until discharge. The association between patient symptoms and laboratory results and whether there was a statistically significant median difference in the number of days until negative RT-PCR results between patients was studied. RESULTS Sixty-one patients with positive SARS-CoV2 swabs were admitted, 34 (55.7%) of whom were symptomatic. The most common symptom was nasal congestion (21/61, 34.3%), followed by generalised malaise and headache (12/6, 19.7%). A rash was detected in 5/61 (8.2%) of them. Fifty-five patients (90.1%) underwent investigations: 4 (7.4%) of them had lymphopenia, 4 (7.4%) had eosinopenia, 8 (14.5%) had eosinophilia, and platelets were elevated in 5 (9.1%) children.

Limiting data to uncomplicated elective surgery with minimal blood loss, we quantified variability in fluid administration within individual providers, between providers, and between types of procedures using a corrected coefficient of variation (cCOV). Regression was performed using a general linear model to determine factors most predictive of fluid administration. RESULTS For provider analysis and model building, 1327 UCI and 4585 VU patients were used. The average corrected crystalloid infusion rate across all providers at both institutions was 7.1 (sd 4.9) ml kg(-1) h(-1), an overall cCOV of 70%. Individual providers ranged from 2.3 (sd 3.7) to 14 (sd 10) ml kg(-1) h(-1). The final regression model strongly favoured personnel as predictors over other patient predictors.

Multiple observational epidemiological studies have shown that periodontitis is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence. Large systematic reviews and metanalyses further show that periodontitis increases the risk of hypertension and is associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Genetic and clinical evidence, utilizing mendelian randomization and randomized clinical trials, support the causal role of periodontitis in hypertension. The mechanisms of this link remain unclear. Critical components of immune and inflammatory pathogenesis of periodontitis considerably overlap with immune mechanisms of hypertension. Clinical studies support that both C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and white blood cell counts (WBC) mediate the relationship between periodontal disease and high blood pressure. In particular, activation of Th1, Th17, T regulatory cells, and proinflammatory monocytes has been shown to be essential in both conditions. Immunosenescent dysregulated CD28null T cells have been implicated, along with key effector cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-alpha (TNF-), interferon-gamma (IFN-?3), and interleukin 17 (IL-17). A better understanding of the relationships between hypertension and periodontitis is essential not only for possible utilization of this knowledge for a non-pharmacological approach to improving blood pressure control.

METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey among patients aged  20 years with RA receiving bDMARDs. Participants were recruited through an internet research company in Japan. Study endpoints included factors affecting the preferred bDMARD treatment mode, namely, in-hospital intravenous infusion (infusion), in-hospital subcutaneous injection (in-hospital injection), or self-administered subcutaneous injection (self-injection), and discrepancies between the current and preferred treatment mode. RESULTS: Of the 400 patients surveyed for preferred treatment mode, 15.3% preferred infusion, 18.0% preferred in-hospital injection, and 66.8% preferred self-injection. A preference for infusion (odds ratio [OR] 2.218 and 6.165) and in-hospital injection (OR 4.735 and 6.026) versus self-injection was significantly associated with higher current frequency of hospital visits and anxiety or other hurdles related to self-injection. A flexible administration setting was significantly associated with a preference for self-injection versus infusion (OR 0.401) and versus in-hospital injection (OR 0.445). Further, age (< 40 vs.  60 years) was significantly associated with a preference for self-injection versus in-hospital injection (OR 0.120). Many patients reported no discrepancy between their current and preferred treatment mode (patients receiving infusion, 68.0%; in-hospital injection, 71.2%; and self-injection, 94.0%). However, > 90% of patients responded that they would change their current mode in the future following a recommendation by a medical professional, aging, or a change in RA symptoms.

METHODS: A retrospective review and grading of CXRs in 161 COVID-19 positive patients was caried out in this single centre study. CXR changes primarily constituted that of presence or absence of ground glass opacification (GGO) or consolidation and their distribution across both lung fields. We used two grading systems normal/ mild/ moderate/ severe grading and a numeric 0?8 grading system. We defined mild severity as up to 25 % lung involvement, moderate as 25C62.5 % and severe as 62.5C100% lung involvement. RESULTS: Peripheral GGO in lower +/- mid zones of the lungs is the most common finding. Mid zone and perihilar GGO is associated with increased mortality. We additionally show that CXRs have a higher severity score in the non-survivor group and a CXR graded as severe has a relative risk ratio for mortality of 3.28. Finally, we describe the change in CXR severity with length of symptoms, finding 42.3 % of CXR were normal in the first 2 days of symptoms and 0% at 13 days.

The level of adherence (low and optimal) and the noncompliance behavior pattern (erratic, deliberate and unwitting) were determined by the Test of the adherence to Inhalers (TAI). This questionnaire allows you to determine the level of adherence and the types of noncompliance. Low Adherence (LowAd) was defined as a score less than 49 points. All patients received individualized educational inhaler technique intervention (IEITI). Before the IEITI, 67.5% of the patients had LowAd. Following IEITI, on week 24, LowAd was 55% (p = 0.024). Each patient can present one or more types of noncompliance. The most frequent type was forgetting to use the inhaler (erratic), 65.8%. The other types were deliberate: 43.3%, and unwitting: 57.5%. All of them had decreased on the final visit: 51.7% (p = 0.009), 25.8% (p = 0.002), 39.2% (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in adherence between asthma and COPD patients at the start of the study. The only predicting factor of LowAd was the female gender. An individualized educational intervention, in ambulatory patients with COPD and asthma, in real-world clinical practice conditions, improves adherence to the inhaled treatment.","output":"Effectiveness of individualized inhaler technique training on low adherence (LowAd) in ambulatory patients with COPD and asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: recent infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 highlights the importance of personal protective equipments and competent professionals on public health preparedness and response in health care systems. Hence, understanding availability of personal protective equipments and training status of health professionals is very important to fill the gap of COVID-19 preparedness and response. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess availability and adequacy of personal protective equipments and health professional's training status on COVID-19 in Silte Zone, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: cross sectional study was conducted from August to October 2020 in Silte Zone. First four weredas from 13 were selected randomly. Systematic sampling technique was used to select 351 health professionals from 13 health facilities of selected weredas. RESULTS: overall, only 36.1% of the health professionals have received adequate training on COVID-19. About 30% of the health professionals had taken training on emergency plan of COVID-19, about 33% had been taught on COVID-19 treatment procedures. Majority 80.9% of the respondents indicated that personal protective equipments are inadequately available. Face masks, hand sanitizers and eye goggles were most scarce PPEs. CONCLUSION: health professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipments and inadequate training of healthcare professions was identified by this study.

(Intelligent Research in Sight) Registry database. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS IRIS Registry patients who underwent cataract surgery during 2013-2018. METHODS Patients who underwent cataract surgery were divided into two groups: (1) ISBCS and (2) DSBCS (second eye surgery 1 day following the first eye surgery) or unilateral surgery. Postoperative endophthalmitis was defined as endophthalmitis occurring within four weeks of surgery by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code and ICD code with additional clinical criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rate of postoperative endophthalmitis. RESULTS Of 5,573,639 IRIS Registry patients who underwent cataract extraction, 165,609 had ISBCS and 5,408,030 had DSBCS or unilateral surgery (3,695,449 DSBCS, 1,712,590 unilateral surgery only). A total of 3,102 participants (0.056%) met study criteria of postoperative endophthalmitis with supporting clinical findings. The rates of endophthalmitis in either surgery eye between the two surgery groups were similar (0.059% in ISBCS group vs 0.056% in DSBCS or unilateral, P=0.53). Although the incidence of endophthalmitis was slightly higher in the ISBCS group compared to the DSBCS or unilateral group, the odds ratio (OR) did not reach statistical significance (1.08, 95% confidence interval: 0.87 - 1.31, P=0.47) after adjusting for age, sex, race, insurance status, and comorbid eye disease.

Precise and early detection of PF is of pivotal importance to slow the disease progression. However, there are currently no effective tools to detect PF directly. PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop an imaging modality to detect PF directly. Excessive collagen deposition is the hallmark of PF. Herein, we developed a novel PF diagnostic agent, namely PVD (platelets-derived nanovesicles labeled with dye), by utilizing near-infrared (NIR)-responsive biomimetic platelets that specifically recognize collagen. METHODS: In brief, platelets membrane was extracted from purified platelets by freeze/thaw and formed to PVD nanovesicles via sonication and extrusion, when loaded with DiR dye. Red blood cells membrane loaded with DiR was prepared in the same way as PVD to form RVD as control. Collagen self-assembled on microplates was used as an in vitro collagen fibrils model and monocrotaline-induced rats were used as an in vivo PF model. RESULTS: We demonstrated that PVD, but not RVD nor other controls, could bind collagen both in vitro and in vivo, and directly detect pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and ex vivo at the early PF stage. CONCLUSION: Collectively, PVD is a versatile NIR-responsive probe for the direct visualization of collagen, and can be particularly helpful in direct detecting PF.

We estimated series completion among individuals initiating MenB vaccination for the 2 available vaccines: MenB 4-component (MenB-4C, doses at 0 and 1 month) and MenB factor H binding protein (MenB-FHbp, doses at 0 and 6 months). METHODS: This retrospective health insurance claims data analysis included 16C23-year-olds who initiated MenB vaccination (index date) during January 2017 to November 2018 (MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database) or January 2017 to September 2018 (MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database) and had continuous enrollment for 6 months before and 15 months after index. The main outcome was MenB vaccine series completion within 15 months. Among noncompleters, preventive care/well-child and vaccine administrative office visits were identified as potential missed opportunities for series completion. Robust Poisson regression models identified independent predictors of series completion. RESULTS: In the Commercial (n = 156,080) and Medicaid (n = 57,082) populations, series completion was 56.7% and 44.7%, respectively, and was higher among those who initiated MenB-4C versus MenB-FHbp (61.1% versus 49.8% and 47.8% versus 33.9%, respectively; both P < 0.001).

However, it is known that zinc is a necessary micronutrient that is involved in many important metabolic processes. In a coronavirus pandemic, the positive role of zinc in controlling COVID is important. Zinc is one of the priority micronutrients that are deficient for most regions of the planet and its deficiency can lead to serious diseases and Ukraine is no exception. It is established that zinc is in short supply for most regions of Ukraine and products that are part of the diet of Ukrainians do not contain enough of it and do not provide the daily physiological needs of people. One of the reasons for such an unsatisfactory situation may be the insufficient amount of zinc in the soils of Ukraine, or the low level of its mobility. It is shown that Zn was characterized by a low level of transition from soil to crop production - the average transition coefficient ranged from 0.10. The reason for this phenomenon could be the low content of zinc in the soils of Ukraine. The grouping of soils of Ukraine by the potential ability to provide plants with a sufficient amount of Zn, taking into account the physiological needs of man was carried out. Using Zn transition coefficients in the soil-plant system and potential mobility of the element in soils of different soil-climatic zones of Ukraine, the division into groups was made: very low potential <= 21 mg Zn kg(-1), low potential from 22 to 48 mg Zn kg(-1), average potential from 49 to 77 mg Zn kg(-1), high potential >= 78 mg Zn kg(-1). According to the division, an assessment was made and it was found that the population of most of Ukraine cannot get enough zinc naturally through food of plant and, accordingly, animal origin. It is shown that one of the effective mechanisms of regulation of zinc inflow into the soil and increase of its mobility is the system of fertilization of agricultural plants. The analysis of traditional fertilizers of Ukraine and phosphorites from deposits of Ukraine is presented. It was found that the highest content of Zn was in phosphorites - it ranged from 7.8 to 14.2 mg kg(-1). It is shown that, depending on the peculiarities of the technology of growing crops, the soil can be annually introduced from 200 to 20.000 and more mg kg(-1) of Zn. It is proved that it is possible to increase the content of zinc in soils by applying agrochemicals, first of all, phosphorus fertilizers, and to increase its mobility and transition to plants - by introduction of technological operations of cultivation of crops. especially in conditions of low level of natural mobility Zn (south and east of Ukraine).","output":"Zinc Deficiency in Soils of Ukraine: Possible Causes and Regulatory Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de la COVID ha enfrentado a Atencin Primaria a un desafo excepcional, con escenarios inesperados.

However, the degree of the association between mental health and chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the general population is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of CLBP in Chinese college students and to examine the association between students' unhealthy mental states and the prevalence of CLBP. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 10,000 questionnaires were distributed in the second semester of the 2017-2018 academic year by the School of Medicine, Shanghai JiaoTong University. Eligible participants were students aged  18 years from randomly selected Chinese colleges. Participants completed a questionnaire survey that included items from the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and items on demographic factors, LBP prevalence, quality of life at their university, study-related stress and interpersonal relationships. The evaluation of students' mental states in the survey was divided into two major parts: direct and indirect indicators. A multivariate logistic regression model was mainly used to explore the relationship between CLBP and the students' mental health. Results There was a high incidence of CLBP in the college students. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk of CLBP increased with increasing scores on the SCL-90, and a clinically unhealthy mental state (scores greater than 3) was significantly associated with CLBP (adjusted odds ratios for depression, anxiety, coercion, paranoia, and interpersonal sensitivity were 7.209, 6.593, 3.959, 4.465, and 4.283, respectively; p < 0.001). Participants who had poor living habits or uncomfortable campus lives and those who experienced heavy academic pressure also showed a higher positive association with CLBP compared with the full sample. Conclusions Unhealthy psychological conditions, which may be attributed to unsatisfying school lives, excessive learning pressure, and uncomfortable interpersonal relationships, represent a risk factor for CLBP in college students.","output":"The relationship between the psychological stress of adolescents in school and the prevalence of chronic low back pain: a cross-sectional study in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of commercial enzymes (pectinases, cellulases, beta-1-3-glucanases, and pectin lyases) on the recovery of anthocyanins and polyphenols from blackcurrant press cake were studied considering two solid:solvent ratios (1:10 and 1:4 w/v). -glucanase enabled the recovery of the highest total phenolic content - 1142 mg/100 g, and the extraction of anthocyanins was similar using all enzymes (400 mg/100 g).

The panellists were 11 culturally, geographically, and professionally diverse Indigenous Australian health and wellbeing experts. A group consensus level of 80% was set prior to each survey round. RESULTS: There was 100% participant retention across all three Delphi rounds. The panel reached consensus on five key programme modifications (composition of a separate facilitator and group member handbook; culturally appropriate language, terminology, and literacy level; culturally meaningful programme activities; supplementary storytelling resources; and customisation for diverse community contexts).

In an effort to reduce both the economic and environmental costs of managing port waste, many ports are looking for sustainable solutions for marine waste management. Plasma-assisted gasification (PAG) is an innovative combination of two technologies, namely plasma treatment and gasification, which can be used to efficiently convert carbon-containing wastes to a clean syngas (H2 + CO). The latter can be used to generate electricity directly in gas engines, dual-fuel generators, gas turbines or fuel cells. PAG provides several key benefits which allow removing all the environmental, regulatory and commercial risks typically associated with the potential eco-toxicity of leachable bottom ash produced by incinerators or other thermal processes. PAG does not produce any waste (zero waste), reduces the need for landfilling of waste, and produces a high-value construction material (Plasmarok) which is recognized as a product. All these reasons make PAG a technology capable of optimally solving waste management in ports in line with a circular economy logic. This study is based upon the IMPATTI-NO Project (Interreg IT-FR Maritime Program 2014C2020) which implements several laboratory applications aimed at the chemical-physical treatment of the non-recyclable waste containing plastics deriving from the collection of beached waste and wastes collected by fishermens trawls and passenger ships. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PAG for the treatment of port waste, IMPATTI-NO performs experimental tests that simulate PAG pilot plants using artificial samples representative of port waste.

Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex. Moreover, ACE2 expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia. ACE2 was also detectable in primary hBMVECs maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48 h exposure window. Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in-vitro models of the human bloodCbrain barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally.

The periods were separated by several weeks with no incident cases. RESULTS: We analyzed data on 289 children and adolescents (6.5% of all cases; incidence rate [IR]=3.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.14-3.97/million person-days), 124 in the first wave (IR=2.27) and 165 in the second wave (IR=6.37): IRR second/first=2.71 (2.13-3.44). During the first wave, the incidence was highest in infants (IR=3.48), while during the second wave it progressively increased to IR = 7.37 in 15-19-year olds. Family members were the key epidemiological contacts (72.6% cases), particularly during the first wave (95.8% vs 56.3%). Overall, 41.3% patients were asymptomatic, 25.3% in the first and 52.6% in the second wave.

The present study aimed to test the performance of a new diagnostic interview for depression focusing on the core symptoms of depression. METHOD: We developed a diagnostic interview for depression: the CORE Diagnostic Interview, CORE-DI, which assesses each of the core features of depression on the four dimensions: quality, reactivity, globality, and fluctuations over time. The diagnostic performance of this interview was tested in a clinical study including 83 individuals presenting with various depressive symptoms, who were interviewed independently (1) by means of the CORE-DI and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), and (2) by highly skilled specialists in depression representing gold standard diagnoses. RESULTS: We compared the outcome of the CORE-DI, the M.I.N.I., and the diagnosis made by clinicians, respectively, versus the gold standard diagnosis, using diagnostic efficiency statistics. The CORE-DI diagnosed depression with a high specificity (0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97, for International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 criteria and 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] criteria) compared to both M.I.N.I (specificity 0.44, 95% CI: 0.33-0.55) and clinical diagnoses (specificity 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.85).

DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The CORE-DI increased the specificity of the depression diagnosis substantially compared to clinical diagnoses and the diagnoses obtained by M.I.N.I. The results point to the usefulness of an elaborated and systematic assessment of the core symptoms in the examination of patients with depressive symptoms and thereby indicate a way for further development of specific diagnostic tools for depression in both clinical and research settings.

Also, fully automatic segmentation techniques frequently produce results that would need further editing for clinical use. In this work, we propose a new single network model for interactive segmentation that fully utilizes all available past information to refine the segmentation of follow-up scans. In the first segmentation round, our model takes 3D volumes of medical images from two-time points (target and reference) as concatenated slices with the additional reference time point segmentation as a guide to segment the target scan. In subsequent segmentation refinement rounds, user feedback in the form of scribbles that correct the segmentation and the target's previous segmentation results are additionally fed into the model. This ensures that the segmentation information from previous refinement rounds is retained.

METHODS: Authors first identified areas of conceptual importance within differential attainment (learning, assessment, and systems/institutional factors) which were then the focus of a targeted review of the literature on differential attainment related to ethnicity/race in medical education and, where available and relevant, literature from higher education more generally. Each author then conducted a review of the literature and proposed guidelines based on their experience and research literature. The guidelines were iteratively reviewed and refined between all authors until we reached consensus on the Dos, Donts and Dont Knows. RESULTS: We present 13 guidelines with a summary of the research evidence for each. Guidelines address assessment practices (assessment design, assessment formats, use of assessments and post-hoc analysis) and educational systems and cultures (student experience, learning environment, faculty diversity and diversity practices). CONCLUSIONS: Differential attainment related to ethnicity/race is a complex, systemic problem reflective of unequal norms and practices within broader society and evident throughout assessment practices, the learning environment and student experiences at medical school. Currently, the strongest empirical evidence is around assessment processes themselves.

Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to follow disease progression and demonstrated differences between the parent avian coronavirus and mutated avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site. Magnetic resonance imaging and biological dye to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability showed that avian coronavirus with a furin-S2' site had increased permeability compared with parent avian coronavirus. Immunohistochemistry of brains after intracerebral injection of avian coronavirus and immunofluorescence staining of primary neuron cells demonstrated the furin-S2' site expanded the cell tropism of the mutant avian coronavirus to neuron cells.

The Global Asthma Network (GAN) Phase I study aimed to determine if the worldwide burden of asthma symptoms is changing. METHODS: This updated cross-sectional study used the same methods as the International study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase III. Asthma symptoms were assessed from centres that completed GAN Phase I and ISAAC Phase I (1993C95), ISAAC Phase III (2001C03), or both. We included individuals from two age groups (children aged 6C7 years and adolescents aged 13C14 years) who self-completed written questionnaires at school. We estimated the 10-year rate of change in prevalence of current wheeze, severe asthma symptoms, ever having asthma, exercise wheeze, and night cough (defined by core questions in the questionnaire) for each centre, and we estimated trends across world regions and income levels using mixed-effects linear regression models with region and country income level as confounders. FINDINGS: Overall, 119 795 participants from 27 centres in 14 countries were included: 74 361 adolescents (response rate 90%) and 45 434 children (response rate 79%). About one in ten individuals of both age groups had wheeze in the preceding year, of whom almost half had severe symptoms. Most centres showed a change in prevalence of 2 SE or more between ISAAC Phase III to GAN Phase I. Over the 27-year period (1993C2020), adolescents showed a significant decrease in percentage point prevalence per decade in severe asthma symptoms (C037, 95% CI C069 to C004) and an increase in ever having asthma (125, 067 to 183) and night cough (425, 306 to 544), which was also found in children (321, 180 to 462). The prevalence of current wheeze decreased in low-income countries (C137, C247 to C027], in children and C167, C270 to C064, in adolescents) and increased in lower-middle-income countries (199, 033 to 366, in children and 169, 013 to 325, in adolescents), but it was stable in upper-middle-income and high-income countries.

Cost-effectiveness was performed using cost/QALY ratios. RESULTS Average index hospitalization costs were significantly higher for patients with unruptured aneurysms treated with clip ligation ($71 400  $47 100) compared with coil embolization ($33 500  $22 600), balloon-assisted coiling ($26 200  $11 600), and stent-assisted coiling ($38 500  $20 900). Multivariate predictors for higher index hospitalization cost included vasospasm requiring endovascular intervention, placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, longer length of stay, larger aneurysm neck and width, higher Hunt-Hess grade, and treatment-associated complications. At 1 year, endovascular treatment was associated with lower cost/QALY than clip ligation in unruptured aneurysms ($52 000/QALY vs $137 000/QALY, respectively, p=0.006), but comparable rates in ruptured aneurysms ($193 000/QALY vs $233 000/QALY, p=0.277). Multivariate predictors for higher cost/QALY included worse mRS score at discharge, procedural complications, and larger aneurysm width. CONCLUSIONS Coil embolization of basilar tip aneurysms is associated with a lower cost/QALY. This effect is sustained during follow-up. Clinical condition at discharge is the most significant predictor of overall cost/QALY at 1 year.","output":"Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis for the treatment of basilar tip aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. The high diversity of viral envelope proteins permits viruses to escape host immunity. Therefore, the development of a universal vaccine and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is essential for controlling various mutant viruses. Here, we review some potentially valuable bnAbs for influenza; one is a novel passive immunotherapy using a variable domain of heavy chain-only antibody (V(H)H), and the other is polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) induced by intranasal vaccination. Recently, it was reported that a tetravalent multidomain antibody (MDAb) was developed by genetic fusion of four V(H)Hs, which are bnAbs against the influenza A or B viruses. The transfer of a gene encoding the MDAbCFc fusion protein provided cross-protection against both influenza A and B viruses in vivo. An intranasal universal influenza vaccine, which can induce neutralizing pIgAs in the upper respiratory tract, is currently undergoing clinical studies. A recent study has revealed that tetrameric IgAs formed in nasal mucosa are more broadly protective against influenza than the monomeric and dimeric forms.

According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. METHODS: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. RESULTS: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3.","output":"COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis Using a Simple 2D Deep Learning Framework With a Single Chest CT Image: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early days of a pandemic, repurposing biospecimens from established research projects could prove to be extraordinarily useful in achieving substantial and timely public health benefits.

To answer this question, we introduce a novel metric that encompasses demographic complexity and social context to summarize unpaid family care work provided to children, elderly, and other family members across the life cycle at a population level. The measure (Care Life Expectancy), an application of the Sullivan method, estimates the number of years and proportion of adult life that people spend in an unpaid caregiving role. We demonstrate the value of the metric by using it to describe gender differences in unpaid care work in 23 European aging countries. We find that at age 15, women and men are expected to be in an unpaid caregiving role for over half of their remaining life. For women in most of the countries, over half of those years will involve high-level caregiving for a family member. We also find that men lag in caregiving across most countries, even when using the lowest threshold of caregiving. As we show here, demographic techniques can be used to enhance our understanding of the gendered implications of population aging, particularly as they relate to policy research and public debate.

The window Reynolds number (Re(w)) was specified to characterize the indoor flow and dispersion. The indicators of RRC (ratio of relative change) or DR (K_DR) (difference ratio of dimensionless concentration)  5% were applied to quantitatively determine the critical Re(w) for indoor flow and turbulent diffusion. The results show that the critical Re (Re(crit)) value is position-dependent, and Re(crit) at the most unfavorable position should be suggested as the optimal value within the whole areas of interest. Thus Re(H,crit) = 27,000 is recommended for the outdoor flows; while Re(w,crit) = 15,000 is determined for the indoor flows due to the lower part below the window showing the most unfavorable. The suggested Re(w,crit) (=15,000) for indoor airflow and cross ventilation is independence of the window size. Moreover, taking K_DR  5% as the indicator, the suggested Re(w,crit) for ensuring indoor pollutant diffusion enter the Re-independence regime should also be 15,000, indicating that indoor passive diffusion is completely determined by the flow structures. The contours of dimensionless velocity (U/U(0)) and concentration (K) against the increasing Re(w) further confirmed this critical value.

The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 75 young patients (46 males and 29 females, mean age 23.952.9 years) were divided into three groups of 25 individuals. The first group was composed of non-smoking patients using toothpaste with NovaMin. The second group (reference group) comprised patients using placebo toothpaste. The third group was composed of smoking patients using toothpaste with NovaMin. The clinical trials of patients included assessment of functional activity of minor salivary glands, the sialometric analysis, the study on microcrystallization of mixed saliva. The non-specific resistance of oral cavity was studied based on the analysis of absorption reaction of microorganisms by epithelial cells. All patients were questioned about the organoleptic characteristics of the toothpaste. The abovementioned features were assessed before the study, after the first use of the toothpaste, after day 7 and day 14. RESULTS: The course use of toothpaste with NovaMin resulted in the plaque inhibiting effect (p&#8804;0.05), increased functional activity of minor salivary glands (p&#8804;0.05) promoting increased salivation and oral cavity cleansing. The concept of local recovery of the receptor apparatus of epithelial cells is confirmed for the first group of patients; the non-specific resistance in tobacco users is low, prevalence of Type I epithelial cells is defined (p&#8804;0.05).

There remains an 'artificial intelligence chasm' in the spheres of validation, regulation, safe implementation, and demonstration of clinical impact that needs to be bridged before the full potential of artificial intelligence to deliver PHC can be realized. SUMMARY Ophthalmology is currently in a stage between the demonstration of the potential of artificial intelligence and widespread deployment. Next stages include aggregating and curating datasets, training and validating artificial intelligence systems, establishing the regulatory framework, implementation and adoption with ongoing evaluation and model adjustment, and finally, meaningful human-artificial intelligence interaction with clinically validated tools that have demonstrated measurable impact on patient and healthcare system outcomes. Ophthalmologists should leverage the ability of artificial intelligence systems to glean insights from large volumes of multivariate data, and to interpret artificial intelligence recommendations in a clinical context. In doing so, the field will be well positioned to lead the transformation of health care in a personalized direction.

Report of a young anesthesiologist in Assam developing cardiac arrest following HCQ intake for COVID-19 prophylaxis made us even more concerned. A conscious decision has been made by a large majority among usCCto have or not to have HCQ. However, less severe complications such as gastrointestinal upset, skin-rash, visual-disturbance, headache, and dizziness even if experienced by HCQ users were likely to go unreported unless shared. The present survey was conducted to assess the prevailing perception among Indian anesthesiologists about HCQ's preventive effect against COVID-19. The information has been pooled together and discussed in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 247 respondents participated in this pan-India survey.

For the bacteriophage (P22), the proposed method gave the correct reconstruction compared to the model, while the classical method failed to resolve the correct orientations of the smooth spherical P22 viruses. CONCLUSION: This paper introduces a new method for orientation determination of low contrast images and highly noisy virus particles. This method is based on weighted projection matching in wavelet space, which increases the accuracy of the orientations. A hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination. The estimated number of particles needed for a higher resolution reconstruction increased exponentially. For a 6 ? resolution reconstruction of the HSV virus, 50,000 particles are necessary. The results show that the proposed method reduces the amount of data needed in a reconstruction by at least 50 %. This may result in savings 2 to 3 man-years invested in acquiring images from the microscope and data processing. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to determine orientations for some difficult particles like P22 with accuracy and consistency. Recently a low PH sindbis capsid was determined with the proposed method, where other methods based on the common line fail.","output":"Orientation determination by wavelets matching for 3D reconstruction of very noisy electron microscopic virus images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Wild birds may harbor and transmit viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans, domestic animals, and other wildlife. RESULTS: Using the viral metagenomic approach, we investigated the virome of cloacal swab specimens collected from 3182 birds (the majority of them wild species) consisting of > 87 different species in 10 different orders within the Aves classes. The virus diversity in wild birds was higher than that in breeding birds. We acquired 707 viral genomes from 18 defined families and 4 unclassified virus groups, with 265 virus genomes sharing < 60% protein sequence identities with their best matches in GenBank comprising new virus families, genera, or species. RNA viruses containing the conserved RdRp domain with no phylogenetic affinity to currently defined virus families existed in different bird species. Genomes of the astrovirus, picornavirus, coronavirus, calicivirus, parvovirus, circovirus, retrovirus, and adenovirus families which include known avian pathogens were fully characterized. Putative cross-species transmissions were observed with viruses in wild birds showing > 95% amino acid sequence identity to previously reported viruses in domestic poultry. Genomic recombination was observed for some genomes showing discordant phylogenies based on structural and non-structural regions. Mapping the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data respectively against the 707 genomes revealed that these viruses showed distribution pattern differences among birds with different habitats (breeding or wild), orders, and sampling sites but no significant differences between birds with different behavioral features (migratory and resident). CONCLUSIONS: The existence of a highly diverse virome highlights the challenges in elucidating the evolution, etiology, and ecology of viruses in wild birds.

We previously demonstrated in vitro that the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 cleaves influenza A and B virus (IAV/IBV) HA possessing a monobasic cleavage site. Subsequent studies revealed that TMPRSS2 is crucial for activation and pathogenesis of H1N1pdm and H7N9 IAV in mice. In contrast, activation of H3N2 IAV and IBV was found to be independent of TMPRSS2 expression and supported by as-yet undetermined protease(s).Here, we investigated the role of TMPRSS2 in proteolytic activation of IAV and IBV in three human airway cell culture systems: primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) and Calu-3 cells. Knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression was performed using a previously described antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, T-ex5, that interferes with splicing of TMPRSS2 pre-mRNA, resulting in the expression of enzymatically inactive TMPRSS2. T-ex5 treatment produced efficient knockdown of active TMPRSS2 in all three airway cell culture models and prevented proteolytic activation and multiplication of H7N9 IAV in Calu-3 cells and H1N1pdm, H7N9 and H3N2 IAV in HBEC and AECII. T-ex5 treatment also inhibited activation and spread of IBV in AECII, but did not affect IBV activation in HBEC and Calu-3 cells.This study identifies TMPRSS2 as the major HA-activating protease of IAV in human airway cells and IBV in type II pneumocytes and as a potential target for the development of novel drugs to treat influenza infections.ImportanceInfluenza A and B viruses (IAV/IBV) cause significant morbidity and mortality during seasonal outbreaks. Cleavage of the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is a prerequisite for membrane fusion and essential for virus infectivity. Inhibition of relevant proteases provides a promising therapeutic approach that may avoid the development of drug resistance. HA of most influenza viruses is cleaved at a monobasic cleavage site and a number of proteases have been shown to cleave HA in vitro This study demonstrates that the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 is the major HA-activating protease of IAV in primary human bronchial cells and of both IAV and IBV in primary human type II pneumocytes. It further reveals that human and murine airway cells can differ in their HA-cleaving protease repertoire.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential mechanism of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19 employing network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The corresponding target genes of 45 main active ingredients in XBJ injection and COVID-19 were obtained by using multiple database retrieval and literature mining. 102 overlapping targets of them were screened as the core targets for analysis. Then built the PPI network, TCM-compound-target-disease, and disease-target-pathway networks with the help of Cytoscape 3.6.1 software. After that, utilized DAVID to perform gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to predict the action mechanism of overlapping targets. Finally, by applying molecular docking technology, all compounds were docked with COVID-19 3 CL protease(3CLpro), spike protein (S protein), and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2).

They are, therefore, regarded as a potential source for stem cell therapy. Fisetin is a bioactive flavonoid known as an active antioxidant molecule that has been reported to inhibit cell growth in various cell types. Fisetin was shown to play a role in regulating osteogenic differentiation in animal-derived MSCs; however, its molecular mechanism is not well understood. We, therefore, studied the effect of fisetin on the biological properties of human MSCs derived from chorion tissue and its role in human osteogenesis using MSCs and osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2) as a model. We found that fisetin inhibited proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as human SaOs-2 cells. Fisetin could reduce Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity, which results in downregulation of osteogenic genes and upregulation of fibroblast genes. Further analysis using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggests that fisetin occupied the hydrophobic TEAD pocket preventing YAP from associating with TEA domain (TEAD). This finding supports the potential application of flavonoids like fisetin as a proteinCprotein interaction disruptor and also suggesting an implication of fisetin in regulating human osteogenesis.","output":"Fisetin Inhibits Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells via the Inhibition of YAP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) have the potential to deliver energy-neutral wastewater treatment. Pilot-scale tests have proven that they can operate at low temperatures with real wastewaters.

This paper describes a pilot-scale microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) operated in continuous flow for 6 months. The reactor was fed return sludge liquor, the concentrated filtrate of anaerobic digestion sludge that has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD). The use of a wastewater with increased soluble organics, along with optimisation of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), resulted in the highest VTR achieved by a pilot-scale MEC treating real wastewater. Peak HRT was 0.5-days, resulting in an average VTR of 3.82 kgCOD/m3aday and a 55% COD removal efficiency. Finally, using the data obtained, a direct analysis of the potential savings from the reduced loading on AS was then made.

This study aimed to find the causal relationship of CACS on MI and preventive effect of antiplatelet therapy. METHODS: From 2005 to 2013, all patients with cardiovascular risk factors or symptoms of suspected CAD underwent coronary computed tomography. CACSs were measured using Agatston method and stratified into 4 groups: 0, 1C99, 100C399, and  400. Antiplatelet therapy was prescribed following physician discretion. Outcomes of interest were MI and bleeding. A mediation analysis was applied to find association pathways. CACS was considered as an independent variable, whereas antiplatelet therapy was considered as a mediator and MI considered the outcome of interest. RESULTS: A total of 7,849 subjects were enrolled. During an average of 9.9  2.4 years follow-up, MI and bleeding events occurred in 2.24% (n = 176) and 2.82% (n = 221) of subjects, respectively.

While previous studies have reported the score characteristics in TF questions in conventional supervised examinations, this study investigates the efficacy of using TF questions in online, unsupervised examinations at the undergraduate level of Biomedical Engineering. We examine the TF and other question-type scores of 57 students across three examinations held in 2020 under online, unsupervised conditions. Our analysis shows significantly larger coefficient of variance (CV) in scores in TF questions (42.7%) than other question types (22.3%). The high CV in TF questions may be explained by different answering strategies among students, with 13.3  17.2% of TF questions left unanswered (zero marks) and 16.4  11.5% of TF questions guessed incorrectly (negative marks awarded).

Curbing this trend is a major challenge that requires urgent and multifaceted action. Based on scientific and gray literature mainly published during the last 10 years, this review summarizes key solutions currently in use globally that have the potential to address at scale the plastic and microplastic contaminations from source to sea. They include technologies to control plastics in solid wastes (i.e. mechanical and chemical plastic recycling or incineration), in-stream (i.e. booms and clean-up boats, trash racks, and sea bins), and microplastics (i.e. stormwater, municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment), as well as general policy measures (i.e. measures to support the informal sector, bans, enforcement of levies, voluntary measures, extended producer responsibility, measures to enhance recycling and guidelines, standards and protocols to guide activities and interventions) to reduce use, reuse, and recycle plastics and microplastics in support of the technological options.

A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated no significant differences in PHQ-9, ESS, and AIS scores between 2019 and 2020 within both the strong self-isolation group and no/little self-isolation group. With respect to sleep habits, earlier bedtime (p = 0.006) and increased sleep duration (p = 0.014) were found in the strong self-isolation group. The former (p = 0.009) was also found in the no/little self-isolation group, but we found significant differences in sleep duration between the no/little self-isolation group and the strong self-isolation group (p = 0.047). Therefore, self-isolation due to COVID-19 had relatively small one-year effects on depression, sleepiness, and insomnia in a clinical population.","output":"Self-Isolation Due to COVID-19 Is Linked to Small One-Year Changes in Depression, Sleepiness, and Insomnia: Results from a Clinic for Sleep Disorders in Shiga Prefecture, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypoparathyroidism is usually caused by postsurgical or autoimmune damage to the parathyroid gland We present the case of a 46-year-old Hispanic male with no significant past medical history who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and had a prolonged hospital course He was incidentally found to have hyperphosphatemia and low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels During the second month of hospitalization, his phosphorus levels rose to 6 9 mg/dL (normal range: 2 4-4 7 mg/dl) His PTH levels were found to be at 8 pg/mL Vitamin D levels obtained were also low (7 ng/dL), phosphorus was at 5 8 mg/dL with albumin of 2 9 g/dL, and calcium level was normal at 9 2 mg/dl Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) level was low at 10 Malignancy and genetic causes were ruled out The patient was started on 50,000 units of ergocalciferol once a week He was also started on calcium acetate 1,334 mg three times a day for hyperphosphatemia Phosphorus levels remained elevated, and sevelamer was added on discharge after he was weaned off oxygen and cleared by physical therapy No explanation for persistent hyperphosphatemia and hypoparathyroidism was found To date, there have been some reports linking severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to widespread tissue injury;however, there have been no reports so far on the effect of the parathyroid gland Further studies are necessary to elaborate and to confirm the causative relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and hyperphosphatemia","output":"A Novel Case of Hypoparathyroidism Secondary to SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined mothers online community (OC) use and its structural relationship with parental stress, social support, and quality of life (QoL) under the social perspective of leisure and the theory of social support as a stress buffer The population comprised employed mothers in two countries, Korea and Taiwan, which constitute appropriate settings for cross-cultural comparisons in the context of mothers OC use The online questionnaire was distributed to 12 Korean mothers OCs and 14 Taiwanese mothers OCs, targeting employed mothers who have at least one child under seven-years-old and access mothers OCs on a regular basis A total of 232 Korean and 303 Taiwanese responses were analyzed to examine the structural relationships among four key variables using structural equation modelling in AMOS 20 This study confirms that more parental stress leads to worse QoL However, more parental stress results in less frequent participation in OCs, and OC use exerts a negative influence on QoL, which contradicts the hypothesized positive correlations In comparison among Korean and Taiwanese mothers, Korean respondents showed a stronger influence of parental stress to mobilize more social support than did Taiwanese This multidisciplinary study contributes to expanding the literature in noncommercial OCs, employed mothers in online leisure, and online social support in cross-cultural settings to promote the sustainability of families wellbeing","output":"Structural Relationships among Online Community Use, Parental Stress, Social Support, and Quality of Life between Korean and Taiwanese Employed Mothers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Subphenotypes were recently reported within clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with distinct outcomes and therapeutic responses. Experimental models have long been used to mimic features of ARDS pathophysiology, but the presence of distinct subphenotypes among preclinical ARDS remains unknown. This review will investigate whether: 1) subphenotypes can be identified among preclinical ARDS models; 2) such subphenotypes can identify some responsive traits. METHODS: We will include comparative preclinical (in vivo and ex vivo) ARDS studies published between 2009 and 2019 in which pre-specified therapies were assessed (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, stem cells, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, fibroblast growth factors, modulators of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products pathway, anticoagulants, and halogenated agents) and outcomes compared to a control condition. The primary outcome will be a composite of the four key features of preclinical ARDS as per the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar-capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction). Secondary outcomes will include the single components of the primary composite outcome, net alveolar fluid clearance, and death. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases will be searched electronically and data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models. Individual study reporting will be assessed according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Meta-regressions will be performed to identify subphenotypes prior to comparing outcomes across subphenotypes and treatment effects. DISCUSSION: This study will inform on the presence and underlying pathophysiological features of subphenotypes among preclinical models of ARDS and should help to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to perform preclinical trials of subphenotype-targeted therapies, prior to potential clinical translation.

Two-dose mRNA vaccines reduce COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality, but immune protection declines over time. As such, third vaccine doses are now recommended, particularly for older adults. We examined immune response durability up to six months after two vaccine doses, and immunogenicity after a third vaccine dose, in 151 adults ranging in age from 24 to 98 years. METHODS. Specimens were collected from 81 healthcare workers (median age 41 years), 56 older adults (median 78 years) and 14 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (median 48 years), at one, three and six months following the second vaccine dose, and from 15 HCW, 28 older adults and 3 convalescent individuals at one month following a third vaccine dose. Binding antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain were quantified using a commercial immunoassay. Virus neutralizing activity was assessed using a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. RESULTS. Compared to healthcare workers, older adults displayed ~0.3 log(10) lower peak binding antibodies one month after the second vaccine dose (p<0.0001) and modestly faster rates of antibody decline thereafter (p=0.0067). A higher burden of chronic health conditions was independently associated with faster rates of antibody decline after correction for age, sociodemographic factors, and vaccine-related variables. Peak neutralizing activity was 4-fold lower in older adults one month after the second vaccine dose (p<0.0001) and became undetectable in the majority of individuals by six months. One month after a third vaccine dose, binding antibodies and neutralizing activities surpassed peak values achieved after two doses in both healthcare workers and older adults, and differences between these groups were no longer statistically significant. Compared to both na?ve groups, convalescent individuals displayed slower rates of binding antibody decline (p<0.006) and maintained higher neutralizing activity six months after the second vaccine dose. CONCLUSIONS. Immune responses to two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are overall weaker in older adults, and also decline more quickly over time, compared to younger adults. A third COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose enhanced binding and neutralizing antibodies to levels higher than those observed after two vaccine doses, but the rate of decline of these responses should be monitored, particularly in older adults with a higher burden of chronic health conditions.","output":"Older Adults Mount Less Durable Humoral Responses to a Two-dose COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Regimen, but Strong Initial Responses to a Third Dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, mass tourism was the main driver for the unusual growth of tourist accommodations in World Heritage Cities (WHC).

Selecting the Historic Centers of Siena and Florence as the case studies, we explain how the two cities experienced an unusual increase in tourist accommodation before the pandemic. By reviewing scenarios for the COVID-19 virus outbreak in Italy, we argue insights for a new cultural heritage policy and management framework that can effectively moderate mass tourism in WHC. Our findings suggest the new policies should be initiated based on a multi-sectoral and multi-level approaches in planning practice. By creating a dynamic tourism map on the macro level, international cultural heritage and tourism organisations may agree on policies that mitigate tourist flows in vulnerable WHC. On the micro-level, there is a demand for regional directives that monitor the growth of tourist accommodations in WHC.

We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 32 DV service providers operating in organizations across 24 U.S. cities. The majority of providers described a decrease in contact volume when shelter-in-place orders were first established, which they attributed to safety concerns, competing survival priorities, and miscommunication about what resources were available. For most organizations, this decrease was followed by an increase in contacts after the lifting of shelter-in-place orders, often surpassing typical contact counts from the pre-pandemic period. Providers identified survivors ability to return to some aspects of their pre-pandemic lives, increased stress levels, and increased lethality of cases as key factors driving this increase. In addition, providers described several unique challenges faced by DV survivors during the pandemic, such as the use of the virus as an additional tool for control by abusers and an exacerbated lack of social support. These findings provide insight into the lived experiences driving observed trends in DV rates during COVID-19.

However, epidemic dynamics in 2021 are largely driven by the spread of more transmissible and/or immune-evading variants, which in turn are countered by vaccination programs. Here we describe updates to the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator) to account for immune trajectories over time, correlates of protection, co-circulation of different variants and the roll-out of multiple vaccines. We have extended recent work on neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) as a correlate of protection to account for protection against infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe disease using a joint estimation approach. We find that NAbs are strongly correlated with infection blocking and that natural infection provides stronger protection than vaccination for the same level of NAbs, though vaccines typically produce higher NAbs. We find only relatively weak correlations between NAbs and the probability of developing symptoms given a breakthrough infection, or the probability of severe disease given symptoms. A more refined understanding of breakthrough infections in individuals with natural and vaccine-derived immunity will have implications for timing of booster vaccines, the impact of emerging variants of concern on critical vaccination thresholds, and the need for ongoing non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Mechanistic modeling of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory, variants, and vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) is a crucial driver for promoting the manufacturing green transformation.

Thyroid hormone affects glomerular filtration, which in turn affects excretion of PFOA and PFOS.

The launch of a mass vaccination program in many countries in late December 2020 with mRNA vaccines, adenovirus-based vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines has generated hope for the end of the pandemic.

We propose here the use of state of the art optical fiber biosensors to address two aspects of the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Fiber optic biosensors functionalized with HCoV spikes could be used to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) effective against known HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and likely future ones. In turn, identified bnAbs, once immobilized onto fiber optic biosensors, should be capable to detect HCoVs as diagnostic and environmental sensing devices. The therapeutic and preventative value of bnAbs is immense as they can be used for passive immunization and for the educated development of a universal vaccine (active immunization). Hence, HCoV bnAbs represent an extremely important resource for future preparedness against coronavirus-borne pandemics. Furthermore, the assembly of bnAb-based biosensors constitutes an innovative approach to counteract public health threats, as it bears diagnostic competence additional to environmental detection of a range of pandemic strains. This concept can be extended to different pandemic viruses, as well as bio-warfare threats that entail existing, emerging and extinct viruses (e.g., the smallpox-causing Variola virus). We report here the forefront fiber optic biosensor technology that could be implemented to achieve these aims.","output":"Perspectives on Assembling Coronavirus Spikes on Fiber Optics to Reveal

mechanisms by which interventions and exposures may influence health outcomes. Publications of mediation analyses are increasing, but the quality of their reporting is suboptimal. Objective To develop international, consensus-based guidance for the reporting of mediation analyses of randomized trials and observational studies (A Guideline for Reporting Mediation Analyses; AGReMA). Design, Setting, and Participants The AGReMA statement was developed using the Enhancing Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) methodological framework for developing reporting guidelines. The guideline development process included (1) an overview of systematic reviews to assess the need for a reporting guideline; (2) review of systematic reviews of relevant evidence on reporting mediation analyses; (3) conducting a Delphi survey with panel members that included methodologists, statisticians, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, psychologists, applied clinical researchers, clinicians, implementation scientists, evidence synthesis experts, representatives from the EQUATOR Network, and journal editors (n = 19; June-November 2019); (4) having a consensus meeting (n = 15; April 28-29, 2020); and (5) conducting a 4-week external review and pilot test that included methodologists and potential users of AGReMA (n = 21; November 2020). Results A previously reported overview of 54 systematic reviews of mediation studies demonstrated the need for a reporting guideline. Thirty-three potential reporting items were identified from 3 systematic reviews of mediation studies. Over 3 rounds, the Delphi panelists ranked the importance of these items, provided 60 qualitative comments for item refinement and prioritization, and suggested new items for consideration. All items were reviewed during a 2-day consensus meeting and participants agreed on a 25-item AGReMA statement for studies in which mediation analyses are the primary focus and a 9-item short-form AGReMA statement for studies in which mediation analyses are a secondary focus. These checklists were externally reviewed and pilot tested by 21 expert methodologists and potential users, which led to minor adjustments and consolidation of the checklists. Conclusions and Relevance The AGReMA statement provides recommendations for reporting primary and secondary mediation analyses of randomized trials and observational studies. Improved reporting of studies that use mediation analyses could facilitate peer review and help produce publications that are complete, accurate, transparent, and reproducible.","output":"A Guideline for Reporting Mediation Analyses of Randomized Trials and Observational Studies: The AGReMA Statement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that in conventional open surgery, approximately 10% of surgical gloves are perforated during surgery without being noticed. To protect both the patient and medical staff from harm, double gloving or changing gloves routinely at certain intervals during surgery is recommended. However, whether these protective measures are also necessary for laparoscopic colorectal surgery is unknown because the actual perforation rate during laparoscopic procedures is unclear. METHODS: Seventy-seven laparoscopic colorectal surgeries were evaluated, and a total of 616 surgical gloves used in the surgeries were collected for analysis. The presence of glove perforation was tested by the standard water-leak test method (EN455-1). RESULTS: Seven perforations were detected (1.1%). The duration of the laparoscopic procedure was not a statistically significant risk factor for glove perforation (p = 0.41). Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) were observed in 12 cases (15.6%), but there was no significant correlation between the presence of glove perforation and SSI (p = 0.92). According to the bacterial cultivation results, the majority of causative agents of SSI were enterobacteria, which belong to the major gut flora. CONCLUSION: Although the perforation rate was considerably lower than that in open surgery, surgical glove perforation occurred during laparoscopic procedures. Double gloving in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is recommended not to prevent SSI but to protect medical workers from harmful infections after direct contact with the patient.","output":"Surgical glove perforation during laparoscopic colorectal procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Positive patient outcomes depend on successful communication.

Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the\\"COVID-FACT\\". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments, COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its counterparts.","output":"COVID-FACT: A Fully-Automated Capsule Network-based Framework for Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we demonstrate on a new interconnection technology which can be used for bonding Flip-Chips with 5-m-Bumps and fine pitches <5 m. In this technology, the bumps on both joint partners are coated with metallic nanowires (in most cases copper, in rare cases gold), through an in situ electrochemical deposition process, the so-called NanoWiring process. The diameter of the wires can be adjusted between 30 and 4000 nm, and their length is ranged from 4 to 50 m. The process is scaled up for 12 inch wafers. The bonding process can be performed directly at wafer level or also at Flip-Chip level. The nanowires overcome the dicing step. The diced chips can be bonded by adjusting and pressing the NanoWired bumps together at room temperature, using the standard bonding devices. The required bonding forces range from 5 to 50 MPa for flip chips, LEDs and sensors. The bonding with nanowires, the so-called KlettWelding, can be explained by diffusion of the nanowires in each other under compression and weaving of the wires as well. The measured shear strength of these connections yields 15-24 MPa. The very large achieved Surface/Volume quotient of NanoWired surface causes this strength. For a better performance, a prior copper oxide reducing step for the copper NanoWires is needed. This can be done by using standard processes like forming gas plasma or formic acid vapor. By heating during the pressing process up to 230 C, the shear strength increases to 60 MPa. The nanowired interconnections have an electrical conduction in the range of bulk metal, because of their pure metallic nature. Beside microelectronic applications, the bonding of larger metallic plates like aluminium, copper, steel and also flexible polymers, glass, silicon and ceramics are also enabled.","output":"Low-Resistance Room-Temperature Interconnection Technique for Bonding Fine Pitch Bumps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clearly, a distal approach to this challenge would be to dismantle a system of incarceration that also doubles as a system of housing people with mental illness and to replace that with a compassionate approach that considers how we tackle the influences that might drive mental illness and how we create systems that can provide support and care for persons with mental illness rather than consign them to a carceral system that, at best, does not tend to their core mental health problems and, at worst, exacerbates them 5 The challenge for public health is that we have a large, and seemingly intractable, system of incarceration as a clear and present reality, and thinking only about undoing such a system exposes us to reasonable charges of unhelpful idealism Hedden et al study such systems with the aim of finding whether race/ethnicity is associated with access to jail- and community-based mental health treatment Given the simple observation that those with more power, privilege, and access are more likely to obtain benefit from any intervention,6 even in, for example, a jail system, it stands to reason that an intervention that targets only the more proximal mechanisms of action will result in exposing underlying inequities, potentially widening health gaps","output":"The Public Health Penalty of Attending to the Proximal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Population-based seroprevalence surveys can provide useful estimates of the number of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still susceptible as well as contribute to better estimates of the case fatality rate and other measures of COVID-19 severity.

The objective is to enable a safe return to offices through compliance with COVID-19 space-capacity regulations and in consideration of the health and wellbeing of employees. Workplaces, teams, and people have become more digitalized and therefore more mobile due to the globalization of knowledge and cutting-edge technological innovations, a process that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis. Now, hybrid work and fully remote working routines are increasing in a significant number of companies. Nevertheless, with the return to the office, understanding how to calibrate spatial capacity is now key for workplaces and companies. Traditional assessment methods are obsolete;new methods that respond to mobility, changing occupancy rates, and comfort are essential. This paper analyzes, through the case study of a pre-COVID-19 activity-based office, the advantages of using digital indoor-location techniques (such as Wi-Fi networks, which additionally have the advantage of being previously installed in the majority of these spaces).

METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists in the US from 4/8/20-5/4/20 via social media and group emails. Survey respondents provided demographic information such as, age, gender, state of practice, and practice type. We asked questions about COVID-19 risk in rheumatic patients, as well as their medication management during the pandemic. We conducted descriptive analysis and Multivariable regression models. RESULTS: 271 respondents completed the survey nationally. 48% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \\"Patients with rheumatic diseases are at a higher risk of COVID-19 irrespective of their immunosuppressive medications\\". 50% disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement \\"The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of biologics\\", while 56% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \\"The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of steroids\\".

The current paper tends to give an indepth look at the teaching and learning situation of English in the Algerian context during the pandemic. It also sheds light on the nature of the learning mode. The researcher conducted the study with four universities from different regions in Algeria. Data were collected quantitatively and qualitatively using a questionnaire, an interview, and observation. Findings revealed that most universities use asynchronous online mode in learning. The analysis also demonstrated that the asynchronous mode affects EFL students' motivation towards e-learning and raises their technostress since they have not developed e-learning readiness yet.","output":"Learning in the Algerian Context during the Pandemic: Is it online or offline?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS In patients with current or a history of hyperkalaemia, treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) is often compromised. Patiromer, a novel potassium (K+ ) binder, may improve serum K+ levels and adherence to RAASi. METHODS The DIAMOND trial will enrol ~820 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; ejection fraction 40%). Patients meeting the screening criteria will enter a single-blinded run-in phase where they will be started or continued on a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) titrated to 50 mg/day and other RAASi therapy to 50% target dose, and patiromer. Patiromer will be titrated up to a maximum three packs/day (8.4 g/pack) to achieve optimal doses of RAASi without hyperkalaemia. The run-in phase will last up to 12 weeks, following which patients will undergo double-blind randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive either continued patiromer or placebo (patiromer withdrawal). The primary endpoint is the mean difference in serum K+ from randomization between patiromer and placebo arms. Secondary endpoints will include hyperkalaemia events with K+ value >5.5 mEq/L, durable enablement of MRA at target dose, investigator-reported adverse events of hyperkalaemia, hyperkalaemia-related clinical endpoints and an overall RAASi Use Score (using a 0-8-point scale) comprising all-cause death, occurrence of cardiovascular hospitalization or usage of comprehensive HF medication. CONCLUSION The DIAMOND trial is designed to determine if patiromer can favourably impact K+ control in patients with HFrEF with hyperkalaemia or a history of hyperkalaemia leading to RAASi therapy compromise, and in turn improve RAASi use.","output":"Patiromer for the management of hyperkalaemia in patients receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors for heart failure: design and rationale of the DIAMOND trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delirium is reported to be one of the manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

This study aimed to investigate how marijuana use changed in a cohort of PLWH during the first year of the pandemic and identify factors associated with the change. METHOD: 222 PLWH (mean age = 50.2  11.2, 50.9 % female, 14.5 % Hispanic, 64.7 % Black, 15.8 % White, 5 % other, 80.2 % persons using marijuana [at least weekly use], 19.8 % persons not using marijuana) completed a baseline survey on demographics and behavioral/health characteristics between 2018 and 2020 and a brief phone survey between May and October 2020 that assessed changes in marijuana use and overall/mental health, and perceived risks/benefits of marijuana use during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 64/222(28.8 %) of the whole sample reported increased marijuana use, 36(16.2 %) reported decreased use, and 122(55 %) reported no change. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated that: Compared to those reporting no change, increased marijuana use during the pandemic was associated with more frequent marijuana use and PTSD symptoms at baseline, worsened mental health during the pandemic, and not perceiving marijuana use as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. More frequent marijuana use at baseline was the only factor significantly associated with decreased marijuana use during the pandemic.

The current pandemic has disrupted routine immunization globally. We aimed to analyze the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunizations practice in Pakistan. A retrospective study was conducted. The data were extracted from the immunization registry in order to assess the disruption in routine immunization coverage during 5 months of the lockdown period. We compared 5 months post lockdown against the baseline period of 5 months preceding lockdown. To broaden the horizon of our research we also collected data of vaccination from rural areas within the country. The results of the current study showed that on average, there was a disruption in routine immunization by 36% during lockdown when compared with the prepandemic period. The largest decline was observed for measles vaccination with a decline of 48%. In rural areas there was a lower decline in vaccination coverage with the highest decline noted for rotavirus vaccination of 15%. This monthly decrease in routine vaccination continued to be at a decline for several months during lockdown; however, it slightly increased post lockdown. In conclusion, on average, there was more than 30% declined in routine vaccination during the lockdown period, while somewhat improved post lockdown, i.e. 12%. Thus, this ongoing pandemic is a reminder for the national immunization programs to consider to tackle the disruption in routine immunization, otherwise, this continued disruption may lead to secondary outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases amongst the public.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on routine vaccination in Pakistan: a hospital-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease has had a catastrophic impact on the world resulting in several deaths.

Several processes used in COVID-19 diagnostic procedures are detailed in further depth to demonstrate optimal practices. Therefore, we debate the main factors that influence the viral detection of SARS-COV-2 and how they can affect the diagnosis of patients.

Although contact reductions and wearing face coverings have reduced infection rates, and vaccines have reduced illness severity, emergence of new variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and the shift from pandemic to endemic patterns of infection, highlights the importance of ongoing preventive behavior adherence to manage future outbreaks. Research applying social cognition theories may assist in explaining variance in these behaviors and inform the development of efficacious behavior change interventions to promote adherence. In the present article, we summarize research applying these theories to identify modifiable determinants of COVID-19 preventive behaviors and the mechanisms involved, and their utility in informing interventions. We identify limitations of these applications (e.g., overreliance on correlational data, lack of long-term behavioral follow-up), and suggest how they can be addressed. We demonstrate the virtue of augmenting theories with additional constructs (e.g., moral norms, anticipated regret) and processes (e.g., multiple action phases, automatic processes) to provide comprehensive, parsimonious behavioral explanations. We also outline how the theories contribute to testing mechanisms of action of behavioral interventions. Finally, we recommend future studies applying these theories to inform and test interventions to promote COVID-19 preventive behavior adherence.","output":"Social cognition theories and behavior change in COVID-19: A conceptual review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress is omnipresent in our everyday lives.

However, for other forms of social touch, potential stress-buffering effects have not been investigated in detail. Furthermore, the possible stress-buffering effects of social touch on men have not been researched so far. The present study focused on embracing, one of the most common forms of social touch across many cultures. We used a short-term embrace between romantic partners as a social touch intervention prior to the induction of acute stress via the Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test. Women who embraced their partner prior to being stressed showed a reduced cortisol response compared to a control group in which no embrace occurred. No stress-buffering effect could be observed in men. No differences between the embrace and control group were observed regarding sympathetic nervous system activation measured via blood pressure or subjective affect ratings. These findings suggest that in women, short-term embraces prior to stressful social situations such as examinations or stressful interviews can reduce the cortisol response in that situation.","output":"Romantic partner embraces reduce cortisol release after acute stress induction in women but not in men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repositioning represents an effective way to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Regulations such as physical distancing, mentioned as social distancing, and the closure of public facilities during the lockdown could be perceived as burdensome especially by individuals who feel a strong need for social exchange and belonging. These components such as need to belong and the fear of missing out also play a major role in the development and maintenance of a problematic use of social networks. Researchers have argued recently that an increase of addictive (online) behaviors may be a likely consequence of subjectively experienced restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study investigates the interplay of perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions and the fear of missing out (FoMO) as well as of symptoms of problematic social-networks use. We hypothesized that perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions mediates the effect of specific predisposing variables related to social needs on the symptom severity of a problematic use. To assess the perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions, we developed a specific questionnaire asking for perceived COVID-19-related strain in several domains of everyday-life. An exploratory factor analysis identified five factors: perceived strain related to restrictions of (1) social contacts, (2) travel, (3) childcare, (4) work, and (5) own health. In a sample of 719 German participants and data collection during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 30th until April 3rd 2020), a structural equation model was calculated showing that higher levels of need to belong and FoMO increase perceived COVID-19-related strain, which is related to symptoms of a problematic social-networks use. The effect of need to belong on problematic social-networks use is mediated by experienced COVID-19-related strain and FoMO-online. Even if the use of social networks is not pathological per se, it may be associated with suffering for a vulnerable part of users. We conclude that specific needs and fear-associated predisposing variables contribute to experiencing physical distance and other pandemic-related restrictions as more stressful, which may increase problematic social-networks use and potentially other addictive behaviors as well in the context of the COVID-19-related lockdown.","output":"Perceived Strain Due to COVID-19-Related Restrictions Mediates the Effect of Social Needs and Fear of Missing Out on the Risk of a Problematic Use of Social Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied antibody response in 9 healthcare workers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who survived Middle East respiratory syndrome, by using serial ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assay testing.

Out of the 18 CBCT screened outcomes, only nine parameters were sufficient for the quantitative meta-analysis. The parameters were classified into three main groups: 1) skeletal changes, 2) alveolar change, and 3) dental changes. Heterogeneity test, estimation of pooled means, publication bias, sensitivity analysis and risk of bias assessment were also performed. Results: Upon database searching, only 14 full-text articles were qualified from the 364 obtained results. Heterogeneity test indicated the use of the random-effects model. The pooled mean estimate were as follows: 1) Skeletal expansion: zygomatic width, 2.39 mm; nasal width, 2.68 mm; jugular width, 3.12 mm; and midpalatal suture at the posterior nasal spine and anterior nasal spine, 3.34 mm and 4.56 mm, respectively; 2) Alveolar molar width expansion, 4.80 mm; and 3) Dental expansion: inter-canine width, 3.96 mm; inter-premolar width, 4.99 mm and inter-molar width, 5.99 mm.

As CD8(+) T cells can provide broadly cross-reactive immunity to distinct influenza strains and subtypes, including influenza A, B and C viruses, understanding CD8(+) T cell immunity to influenza viruses across prominent HLA types is needed to rationally design a universal influenza vaccine and generate protective immunity especially for high-risk populations. As only a handful of HLA-A*11:01-restricted CD8(+) T cell epitopes have been described for influenza A viruses (IAVs) and epitopes for influenza B viruses (IBVs) were still unknown, we embarked on an epitope discovery study to define a CD8(+) T cell landscape for HLA-A*11:01-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian people. Using mass-spectrometry, we identified IAV- and IBV-derived peptides presented by HLA-A*11:01 during infection. 79 IAV and 57 IBV peptides were subsequently screened for immunogenicity in vitro with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A*11:01-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian donors.

During the pandemic, 11.7% (95%CI: 8.5-16.0) stopped hiring third-party caregivers, which can be explained by social distancing to reduce risk of transmission and/or by the decline in families' purchasing power. Those who lost hired caregivers during the pandemic were more likely to experience an increase in the burden of care, regardless of their socioeconomic status. There was an unequal distribution of caregiving work in the population, intensified by the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The heavier load of care for elderly persons with functional dependency was sharper in more socioeconomically privileged groups such as whites and those with higher income. One hypothesis is that more vulnerable groups already bore a high burden of care before the pandemic.

Among them, there were 22 male and 2 female patients, with the onset age ranging from 3 to 71 years old. A total of 10 children (including the child we examined) and 14 adults were identified, and 17 patients (70.8%) had HSP/IgAV complicated with renal involvement. The majority of patients were treated with glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressants or biological agents, 4 patients died (16.7%), 8 patients were completely relieved (33.3%), and 3 patients had unknown prognoses. This article suggests that HSP/IgAV complicated with cardiac involvement may result in a poor prognosis and early treatment may therefore be essential. Our case revealed that glucocorticoid does not prevent the occurrence of renal and cardiac involvement in HSP/IgAV patients. If HSP/IgAV is complicated with coronary artery dilation, the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoid combined with immunosuppressants is not satisfactory, and early administration of biological agents or IVIG may be an effective therapeutic regimen.","output":"Henoch-Sch?nlein Purpura /IgA Vasculitis Complicated by Coronary Artery Aneurysm: A Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE)-derived hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) plays an essential role in preserving cardiac functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, exerting anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory properties within the body. The interplays of CSE/H(2)S signaling and ACE2 in cardiac aging are unclear. In this study, the regulatory roles of H(2)S on ACE2 expression in mouse heart tissue and rat cardiomyocytes under different stress conditions were investigated. It was found that ACE2 protein level was lower in heart tissues from old mice (56-week-old) than young mice (8-week-old), and the knockout of CSE (CSE KO) induced moderate oxidative stress and further inhibited ACE2 protein level in mouse hearts at both young and old age. Incubation of rat cardiac cells (H9C2) with a low dose of H(2)O(2) (50 M) suppressed ACE2 protein level and induced cellular senescence, which was completely reversed by co-incubation with 30 M NaHS (a H(2)S donor). Prolonged nutrient excess is an increased risk of heart disorders by causing metabolic dysfunction and cardiac remodeling. We further found high-fat diet feeding stimulated ACE2 expression and induced severe oxidative stress in CSE KO heart in comparison with wild-type heart. Lipid overload in H9C2 cells to mimic a status of nutrient excess also enhanced the expression of ACE2 protein and induced severe oxidative stress and cell senescence, which were significantly attenuated by the supplementation of exogenous H(2)S. Furthermore, the manipulation of ACE2 expression partially abolished the protective role of H(2)S against cellular senescence. These results demonstrate the dynamic roles of H(2)S in the maintenance of ACE2 levels under different levels of oxidative stress, pointing to the potential implications in targeting the CSE/H(2)S system for the interruption of aging and diabetes-related heart disorders.","output":"H(2)S protects from oxidative stress-driven ACE2 expression and cardiac aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coagulopathy is a significant aspect of morbidity in COVID-19 patients. The clotting cascade is propagated by a series of proteases, including factor Xa and thrombin. While certain host proteases, including TMPRSS2 and furin, are known to be important for cleavage activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike to promote viral entry in the respiratory tract, other proteases may also contribute. Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that factor Xa and thrombin can also directly cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike, enhancing infection at the stage of viral entry. Coagulation factors increased SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids. A drug-repurposing screen identified a subset of protease inhibitors that promiscuously inhibited spike cleavage by both transmembrane serine proteases and coagulation factors. The mechanism of the protease inhibitors nafamostat and camostat may extend beyond inhibition of TMPRSS2 to coagulation-induced spike cleavage. Anticoagulation is critical in the management of COVID-19, and early intervention could provide collateral benefit by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.

We aimed to identify an optimal cut-off and timing for a proprietary high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay to facilitate post-operative clinical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing elective isolated CABG at our centre between January 2013 and May 2019. Of 4684 consecutive patients, 161 patients (3.48%) underwent invasive coronary angiography after surgery, of whom 86 patients (53.4%) underwent repeat revascularization. We found an optimal cut-off value for peak hs-cTnI of >13 000 ng/L [>500 the upper reference limit (URL)] to be significantly associated with repeat revascularization within 48 h after surgery, which was internally validated through random repeated sampling with 1000 iterations. The same cut-off also predicted 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality after a median follow-up of 3.1 years, which was validated in an external cohort. A decision tree analysis of serial hs-cTnI measurements showed no added benefit of hs-cTnI measurements in patients with electrocardiographic or echocardiographic abnormalities or haemodynamic instability. Likewise, early post-operative hs-cTnI elevations had a low yield for clinical decision-making and only later elevations (at 12-16 h post-operatively) using a threshold of 8000 ng/L (307 URL) were significantly associated with repeat revascularization with an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.95). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that for hs-cTnI, higher cut-offs than currently recommended should be used in the post-operative management of patients following CABG.

KEY FINDING High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels determined 12-16 h after surgery with a cut-off of 8000 ng/L (307 upper reference limit) correlated best with a decision to repeat revascularization, while at earlier time-points, clinical decision should rather be based on electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiographic, and haemodynamic criteria.

Later in June, the World Health Organization announced that the focus of the outbreak had shifted to Latin America, where countries already had poor control indicators of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD). Concerns about coronavirus infection led to a reduced number of visits and hospitalizations in patients with NCD, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. There is a need to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cardiometabolic diseases who do not have clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection. Methods: The CorCOVID LATAM is a cross sectional survey including ambulatory cardiometabolic patients without history or evidence of COVID-19 infection. The study will be conducted by Interamerican Society of Cardiology. An online survey composed by 38 questions using Google Forms will be distributed to patients of 13 Latin American Spanish-speaking countries from June 15th to July 15th, 2020. Data will be analyzed by country and regions. Seven clusters of questions will be analyzed: demographics, socioeconomic and educational level, cardiometabolic profile, lifestyle and habits, body weight perception, medical follow-up and treatments, and psychological symptoms. Results: Final results will be available upon completion of the study.

Our models parameters take into account the conversion rates from acute wards into wards equipped with Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and Mechanical Ventilation (MV), the typical time that these conversions take place and, the historical non-COVID usage of NIV and MV beds. We have observed that this clinical performance is mathematically identical to a series of linear delays on the time varying inpatient level. High frequency inpatient data, sampled [~]4 hourly, has allowed our hospital trust to predict total critical care usage up to 4 days in advance without making any assumptions on upcoming inpatients. It is based entirely upon current bed occupancy levels and measured clinical pathways. Through back-testing over the recent 4 months, the bounds of this model include 93.8% of all 4 day inpatient sequences. The average next-day error is 0.8 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.15) and so the system tends to over-predict the next day critical care inpatients by approximately 1 bed.

Here we show that the decrease in global fossil CO2 emissions during the first quarter of 2020 was of 5.8% (542 Mt CO2 with a 20% 1-{\\\\sigma} uncertainty). Unlike other emerging estimates, ours show the temporal dynamics of emissions based on actual emissions data from power generation (for 29 countries) and industry (for 73 countries), on near real time activity data for road transportation (for 132 countries), aviation and maritime transportation, and on heating degree days for commercial and residential sectors emissions (for 206 countries). These dynamic estimates cover all of the human induced CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. The largest share of COVID-related decreases in emissions are due to decreases in industry (157.9 Mt CO2, -7.1% compared to 2019), followed by road transportation (145.7 Mt CO2, -8.3%), power generation (131.6 Mt CO2, -3.8%), residential (47.8 Mt CO2, -3.6%), fishing and maritime transport (35.5Mt CO2, -13.3%) and aviation (33.4 Mt CO2, -8.0%). Regionally, decreases in emissions from China were the largest and earliest (-10.3%), followed by Europe (EU-27&UK) (-4.3%) and the U.S. (-4.2%). Relative decreases of regional CO2 emissions are consistent with regional nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based networks. Despite the unprecedented decreases in CO2 emissions and comparable decreases in economic activities, we monitored decreases in the carbon intensity (Emission per unit of GDP) in China (3.5%), the U.S. (4.5%) and Europe (5.4%) over the first quarter, suggesting that carbon-intensive activities have been disproportionally impacted.","output":"COVID-19 causes record decline in global CO2 emissions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid roll-out of a vaccine and the implementation of a worldwide immunization campaign is critical, but its success will depend on the availability of an operational and transparent distribution chain that can be audited by all relevant stakeholders.

This chemokine is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract, suggesting a role in lung defenses. However, little is known about the participation of CXCL17 against relevant respiratory pathogens in humans. Here, we evaluated the serum levels and lung tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in a cohort of patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from Mexico City. Peripheral blood samples obtained on admission and seven days after hospitalization were processed for determinations of serum CXCL17 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CXCL17 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHQ) in lung autopsy specimens from patients that succumbed to the disease. Serum CXCL17 levels were also analyzed in two additional comparative cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients. Additionally, the expression of CXCL17 was tested in lung autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients. A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, from which 68 had pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 24 had COVID-19, and 30 with PTB. CXCL17 was detected in post-mortem lung specimens from patients that died of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and COVID-19. Interestingly, serum levels of CXCL17 were increased only in patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB. CXCL17 not only differentiated pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from other respiratory infections but showed prognostic value for influenza-associated mortality and renal failure in machine-learning algorithms and regression analyses. Using cell culture assays, we also identified that human alveolar A549 cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages increase their CXCL17 production capacity after influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection. Our results for the first time demonstrate an induction of CXCL17 specifically during pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not COVID-19 and PTB in humans.

Based on nationwide Danish data, we estimate the transmission dynamics of BA.1 and BA.2 following the spread of Omicron VOC within Danish households in late December 2021 and early January 2022. Among 8,541 primary household cases, of which 2,122 were BA.2, we identified a total of 5,702 secondary infections among 17,945 potential secondary cases during a 1-7 day follow-up period. The secondary attack rate (SAR) was estimated as 29% and 39% in households infected with Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. We found BA.2 to be associated with an increased susceptibility of infection for unvaccinated individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.19; 95%-CI 1.58-3.04), fully vaccinated individuals (OR 2.45; 95%-CI 1.77-3.40) and booster-vaccinated individuals (OR 2.99; 95%-CI 2.11-4.24), compared to BA.1.

The pattern of increased transmissibility in BA.2 households was not observed for fully vaccinated and booster-vaccinated primary cases, where the OR of transmission was below 1 for BA.2 compared to BA.1.

This study aimed to evaluate clinical data and outcomes of NIV in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients with sudden worsening of respiratory failure were evaluated. All patients (71% male) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and signs, symptoms and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and all of them underwent a trial of NIV. Primary outcomes were NIV success and failure defined by intubation and mortality rate. Secondary outcome was the duration of NIV. RESULTS: NIV was successful in 38 (48.1%) patients (Table 1). EOT was necessary in 21 patients (26.6%). Death occurred in 20 patients (25.3%). In the group of patients having failed a trial with NIV and then being intubated, compared to those who continued NIV, there was no higher mortality rate. By evaluating the ICU survival outcome of the subgroup of patients intubated after NIV, 57% of the patients were discharged and 43% died. CONCLUSION: Previous studies conducted on patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation showed higher mortality rate than the present study.

METHODS: The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on 22 January 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (&#8805; 10 minutes within 2 m). Medium-risk contacts wore all US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), &#8805; 1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive.

Data-use patterns were diverse by authorship, geographic extent, taxonomic group, and dataset type. Despite facilitating global authorship, legacies of colonial science remain. Studies involving species distribution modeling were most prevalent (31% of literature surveyed) but recently shifted in focus from theory to application.

Translocation of tRNAs through the ribosome from aminoacyl (A) site to peptidyl (P) site, and from P-site to exit (E) site is catalysed in eukaryotes by the translocase elongation factor 2 (EF-2), and in prokaryotes by its homologue EF-G. During tRNA movement one or more hybrid states (A/P) is occupied, but molecular details of them and of the translocation process are limited. Here we show by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that a population of mammalian ribosomes stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot structure contains structurally-distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states. In one (A/P) the tRNA is in contact with the translocase EF-2 which induces it. In the other (A/P) the translocase is absent. The existence of these alternative A/P intermediate states has relevance to our understanding of the mechanics and kinetics of translocation.","output":"Direct observation of distinct A/P hybrid-state tRNAs in translocating ribosomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forty-five wildcats (Felis silvestris), 17 sand cats (Felis margarita), and 17 feral domestic cats were captured in central west Saudi Arabia, between May 1998 and April 2000, with the aim to assess their exposure to feline immunodeficiency virus/puma lentivirus (FIV/PLV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), and feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV).

We aimed to understand the psychological impact in the form of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of sleep, and coping during this pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using social networking sites. The questionnaire meant for this study was sent as a link to a respondent. Initial part of questionnaire collected the socio-demographic details of the respondents. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the quality of sleep. There was also an open-ended question to look for coping skills used. RESULTS: The majority of our respondents were below 45 years (around 95%) with 54.9% from 18 to 30 years age group. 72.3% were males and 27.7% were females. 58.7% were from rural background. 55.7% were employed, and 32.2% were students. In our respondents, 55% had anxiety symptoms, 55% had depressive symptoms, around 53% had poor quality of sleep, and around 30% of used maladaptive coping skills. Significant depressive symptoms were there in the younger age group, 18C30 years (p = 0.03). Significant depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms were present in females (p = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively). In urban population, significant anxiety symptoms (p = 0.03) were present. The mean score for anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 8.05  4.53 and 8.07  4.56, respectively. Mean global PSQI score was 6.90  3.82 and was positively correlated with score on depressive symptom scale (p = 0.001) as well as score on anxiety symptom scale (p = 0.001).

The development and delivery of new programmes are designed to meet the evolving needs of our participants and pathology practice. A cytopathology technical programme was established in 2018 to provide proficiency testing in routine cytopreparatory techniques. The cytopathology technical pilot focused on standard operating procedures and laboratory performance during rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). The exercise aimed to assess the diagnostic adequacy and provide technical recommendations on each of the whole slide images from four fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples of the thyroid in a setting of ROSE. METHODS Four whole slide imaging cases, each comprising one Diff-QuikTM stained preparation of an FNAB of the thyroid, were provided to all laboratories currently enrolled in the RCPAQAP Cytopathology diagnostic programmes. Each scanned image represented one slide from the first pass collected by a radiologist under ultrasound guidance. Participating laboratories were encouraged to distribute the exercise to individual staff members who attend ROSE procedures. A laboratory practice questionnaire was also conducted. RESULTS There were a total of 186 submissions received for the assessment across the four virtual cases provided. Although the assessment of on-site adequacy by participants showed high concordance across some of the cases, there was variation in the initial diagnostic evaluation and technical recommendation. CONCLUSIONS ROSE has been adopted as a standard procedure in many laboratories worldwide. A peer comparison of participating laboratories in an EQA exercise has highlighted ROSE as susceptible to variation across standard operating procedures, the provision of diagnostic adequacy, diagnostic feedback to the attending clinician, and technical recommendation.","output":"Rapid On-Site Evaluation Technical Exercise Using Digital Pathology: Peer Comparison in an External Quality Assurance Setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study evaluated the state of international activities of extractive industry enterprises of Ukraine in the conditions of overcoming the consequences of corona crisis.

Clinical applications of EV-based therapeutics are being trialed in immunomodulation, tissue regeneration and recovery, and as delivery vectors for combination therapies. Native/biological EVs possess diverse endogenous properties that offer stability and facilitate crossing of biological barriers for delivery of molecular cargo to cells, acting as a form of intercellular communication to regulate function and phenotype. Moreover, EVs are important components of paracrine signaling in stem/progenitor cell-based therapies, are employed as standalone therapies, and can be used as a drug delivery system. Despite remarkable utility of native/biological EVs, they can be improved using bio/engineering approaches to further therapeutic potential. EVs can be engineered to harbor specific pharmaceutical content, enhance their stability, and modify surface epitopes for improved tropism and targeting to cells and tissues in vivo. Limitations currently challenging the full realization of their therapeutic utility include scalability and standardization of generation, molecular characterization for design and regulation, therapeutic potency assessment, and targeted delivery. The fields utilization of advanced technologies (imaging, quantitative analyses, multi-omics, labeling/live-cell reporters), and utility of biocompatible natural sources for producing EVs (plants, bacteria, milk) will play an important role in overcoming these limitations.

In our sample, 3% reported being COVID-19 positive and 15% were unsure of their status. This relatively high positive rate enabled us to conduct the analysis at the 5% significance level. At the time of the survey, 44% of the adults worked from home; 26% still went to work in their workplaces; 27% had stopped working due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3% were unemployed. Adults who exercised more were more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Each additional hour of exercise per day predicted a 78% increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative. Adults with chronic medical illnesses were 48% more likely to be COVID-19 negative. In terms of work situation, those who worked from home were the most likely to be COVID-19 negative, and those who had stopped working were the most likely to be COVID-19 positive. Individuals in larger organizations were less likely to be COVID-19 positive.

Among them, one of the most invalidating is Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by motor- and non-motor dysfunctions which strongly impair the quality of life of affected individuals. PD is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, with consequent dopamine depletion, and the accumulation of misfolded -synuclein aggregates. Although 150 years have passed since PD first description, no effective therapies are currently available, but only palliative treatments. Importantly, PD is often diagnosed when the neuronal loss is elevated, making difficult any therapeutic intervention. In this context, two key challenges remain unanswered: (i) the early diagnosis to avoid the insurgence of irreversible symptoms; and (ii) the reliable monitoring of therapy efficacy. Research strives to identify novel biomarkers for PD diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic follow-up. One of the most promising sources of biomarkers is represented by extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous population of nanoparticles, released by all cells in the microenvironment. Brain-derived EVs are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, protecting their payload from enzymatic degradation, and are easily recovered from biofluids. Interestingly, EV content is strongly influenced by the specific pathophysiological status of the donor cell. In this manuscript, the role of EVs as source of novel PD biomarkers is discussed, providing all recent findings concerning relevant proteins and miRNAs carried by PD patient-derived EVs, from several biological specimens. Moreover, the contribution of mitochondria-derived EVs will be dissected. Finally, the promising possibility to use EVs as source of markers to monitor PD therapy efficacy will be also examined.

A multi-task sentiment analysis model based on BERT was proposed, which combined sentiment analysis and entity recognition. This model is used to extract sentiment information of Weibo comments related to COVID-19 and judge whether the entities in the text are targeted by emotions. The composition layer was constructed by combining the emotional information and entity information, and the loss function was designed to integrate the multi-task into the same model. More than 5000 Weibo text data about COVID-19 were preprocessed and annotated to form an entity-level corpus. Finally, several common methods were used to compare with the proposed method. Several comparison indexes were used to evaluate the model. The experimental results showed that the proposed model had better overall performance than other models. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Research on sentiment analysis and entity recognition of COVID-19 based on multi-task sentiment analysis model in artificial intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in catastrophic levels of morbidity and mortality for care home residents. Despite this, research platforms for COVID-19 in care homes arrived late in the pandemic compared with other care settings. The Prophylactic Therapy in Care Homes Trial (PROTECT-CH) was established to provide a platform to deliver multi-centre cluster-randomized clinical trials of investigational medicinal products for COVID-19 prophylaxis in UK care homes. Commencing set-up in January 2021, this involved the design and development of novel infrastructure for contracting and recruitment, remote consent, staff training, research insurance, eligibility screening, prescribing, dispensing, and adverse event reporting; such infrastructure being previously absent. By the time this infrastructure was in place, the widespread uptake of vaccination in care homes had changed the epidemiology of COVID-19 rendering the trial unfeasible. Whilst some of the resources developed through PROTECT-CH will enable the future establishment of care home platform research, the near absence of care home trial infrastructure and nationally-linked databases involving the care home sector will continue to significantly hamper progress. These issues are replicated in most other countries. Beyond COVID-19, there are many other research questions that require addressing to provide better care to people living in care homes. PROTECT-CH has exposed a clear need for research funders to invest in, and legislate for, an effective care home research infrastructure as part of national pandemic preparedness planning.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic promoted the development of online health care. Higher demand for accessing information from the Internet was seen. METHODS: This was a sequential explanatory mixed-method study, involving a survey of older adults to explore the status and influencing factors of eHealth literacy regarding COVID-19. Semi-structured interviews were used to understand experiences and challenges regarding information retrieval, judgment and utilization. RESULTS: A total of 337 older adults participated in the online questionnaire survey. Overall, older adults had slightly higher scores on eHealth literacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants' location in the past month and current health issues were associated with eHealth literacy. Qualitative data were collected from nine older adults and included that some older adults retrieved health-related information during the pandemic. However, those who used non-smartphones described difficulties in information retrieval. A glut of misinformation has resulted in an 'infodemic', which has not only increased the difficulty of judging information but also posed challenges in information utilization for older adults. CONCLUSION: Improving older adults' eHealth literacy is essential in promoting an improved response to major public health events and in providing better health care for this group in the future. It is essential that government health agencies and health care providers provide evidence-based health information via social media platforms. Further efforts are needed to combine aspects of traditional and online health care services and provide reliable and updated online information and resources for older adults.

India initiated social distancing measures to combat the epidemic of COVID-19. The course of the epidemic of COVID-19 for India was predicted using stochastic probabilityCbased mathematical modeling. METHODS: Data synthesis for the top few countries affected was studied for various factors affecting the epidemic. For projections of infected cases for India, the modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed/recovered framework modified for the effect of social distancing (Rho) was used. Simulation was carried out for 10,000 runs using python. Projections for infected cases and hospitalization requirement were estimated. RESULTS: The epidemic curve will peak in the third week of June in India with 17,525,869 and 2,153,200 infected people with reproduction number of 1.8 and Rho of 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Compared with the baseline scenario of no social distancing, for transmissibility with R0 = 1.8, the reduction in infections due to social distancing measure is 78% (Rho = 0.7) and 97% (Rho = 0.6). Similarly for R0 = 2.2 and 2.4, the reduction in infected numbers slightly lowers to 62% and 66% with Rho = 0.7 and 92% and 75% with Rho = 0.6, respectively. With R0 = 1.8 and Rho = 0.6, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed requirement is 107,660, whereas if transmissibility is high, the ICU bed requirement would increase to 1,994,682. CONCLUSIONS: The social distancing measures seem to have been working for India in absence of treatment in sight for COVID-19. Although with the government's response strategy of social distancing, the peak of the epidemic is extended giving more months for preparedness to the country; however, the sustainability of these measures is uncertain.","output":"Projections for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and evaluation of epidemic response strategies for India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The distribution of phosphatidylcholine between inner and outer monolayers of rat brain synaptic plasma membrane was investigated by means of a phosphatidylcholine specific exchange protein.

Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place.

However, many uncertainties remain pertaining to optimal intervention time, administration schedule, and predictors of response. To date, data on the use of subcutaneous sarilumab is limited and no randomized trial results are available. Methods Open label randomized controlled trial at a single center in Spain. We included adult patients admitted with microbiology documented COVID-19 infection, imaging confirmed pneumonia, fever and/or laboratory evidence of inflammatory phenotype, and no need for invasive ventilation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sarilumab, a single 400 mg dose in two 200 mg subcutaneous injections, added to standard care or standard care, in a 2:1 proportion. Primary endpoints included 30-day mortality, mean change in clinical status at day 7 scored in a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharge (category 7), and duration of hospitalization. The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on the intention-to-treat population. Results A total of 30 patients underwent randomization: 20 to sarilumab and 10 to standard care. Most patients were male (20/30, 67%) with a median (interquartile range) age of 61.5 years (56C72). At day 30, 2/20 (10%) patients died in the sarilumab arm vs. none (0/10) in standard care (Log HR 15.11, SE 22.64;p = 0.54). At day 7, no significant differences were observed in the median change in clinical status (2 [0C3]) vs. 3 [0C3], p = 0.32). Median time to discharge (days) was similar (7 [6C11] vs. 6 [4C12];HR 0.65, SE 0.26;p = 0.27).

Despite advances in medical therapy, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, congestive heart failure remains a common cause of hospital visits. The extent to which these advances have been implemented in primary care is uncertain. We therefore sought to assess current practice patterns of primary care physicians and identify obstacles to optimal diagnosis and management of congestive heart failure in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS Telephone interviews of 100 primary care physicians using structured questionnaires. RESULTS Primary care physicians diagnose congestive heart failure based on the presence of breathlessness (92.5%), lung crackles (52.5%), peripheral oedema (55.0%) and findings on chest radiography (76.8%). Only 1 in 3 mentioned raised jugular venous pressure as a useful diagnostic sign. Echocardiography was not commonly obtained (5%), mainly due to inaccessibility. While many (47.5%) were aware of the importance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, few (16.2%) knew of the impact of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality. Instead, diuretics were thought to be most important for prolonging survival in congestive heart failure (47.5%). The main obstacle to widespread angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors usage was dry cough. Patient compliance (57.5%) and cost (82.5%) were the main obstacles to optimising care. CONCLUSIONS Local primary care physicians diagnose congestive heart failure using non-specific symptoms and signs. Obstacles to optimal congestive heart failure management were identified. We hope our results will lead to strategies to improve patient care.","output":"Pilot survey of the diagnosis and management of heart failure in primary care: a Singaporean perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated by chemical reaction rules, we introduce a rule-based epidemiological framework for the mathematical modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic which lies the foundations for further study of this class of models. Here we stress that we do not have a specific model in mind, but a whole collection of models which can be transformed into each other, or represent different aspects of the pandemic. Each single model is based on a mathematical formulation that we call a rule-based system. They have several advantages, for example that they can be both interpreted both stochastically and deterministically without changing the model structure. Rule-based systems should be easier to communicate to non-specialists, when compared to differential equations. Due to their combinatorial nature, the rule-based model framework we propose is ideal for systematic mathematical modelling, systematic links to statistics, data analysis in general and machine learning. Most importantly, the framework can be used inside a Bayesian model selection algorithm, which can extend unsupervised machine learning technology to gain mechanistic insight through mathematical models. We first introduce the Bayesian model selection algorithm and give an introduction to rule-based systems. We propose precursor models, all consistent with our rule-based framework and relevant for the COVID-19 pandemic. We complement the models with numerical results and, for some of them, we include analytical results such as the calculation of the number of new infections generated by an infected person during their infectious period.

In the second case, a partial restriction to mobility could lead to a massive contagion if this was not complemented with sanitary measures such as the use of masks and social distancing. Finally, a local isolation policy was proposed, conditioned to the health status of each block. It was observed that this mitigation strategy was able to contain and even reduce the outbreak of the disease by intervening in specific regions of the city according to their level of contagion.

More specifically, the paper explores how Odaka Yoga's philosophical backdrops and practical repertoire, composed by a mixture of exotic resources such as Bushido, zen, yoga, and a constant reference to the ocean waves and biomechanics, constitute a very specific vision of health at the intersection of Western science and esoteric knowledge. Theoretically, the paper borrows from Jennings' theory of martial creation and enriches it with some of the central analytical tools proposed by theorists such as Bourdieu and Foucault. Methodologically, it relies on a multimodal approach including discursive analysis of the school's promotional materials, interviews with the founders and other key teachers, and observant participation of practitioners' apprenticeship processes. More Specifically, this paper discusses the birth of Odaka Yoga as occurring at the intersection of Asian martial arts and yoga, as well as the founders' biographical trajectories from the world of competitive martial arts and fitness, to yoga; it then turns to an examination of Odaka Yoga's conception of health as a mixture of the Western biomedical model and the subtle body model of Asian traditions such as yoga and martial arts. It argues that the conception of health promoted by this school gives rise to the Odaka Yoga Warrior, the ideal-typical practitioner whose body is simultaneously exposed to the medical gaze and its imperatives of control, knowledge, and manipulation; while it also deifies it, as it is animated by the elusive flows of energy (qi or prana) that prolonged practice aims to master. The paper concludes with a reflection on hybrid conceptions of health and the ubiquitous role of health discourses and narratives across sociocultural domains.","output":"Blending Martial Arts and Yoga for Health: From the Last Samurai to the First Odaka Yoga Warrior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) pandemic reduced real and perceived access to healthcare services, exacerbating pandemic fear, and thus influencing consumers' adoption of preventative health behaviors.

High perceived access reduces pandemic fear through its buffering effects on perceived health vulnerability and pandemic\\\\related health system concern, especially with telehealth usage during the pandemic. While pandemic fear motivates COVID\\\\19 vaccination, pandemic fear reduces personal preventative health behavior (e.g., healthy eating, exercising) and has little effect on personal COVID\\\\preventative behaviors (e.g., wearing a mask, social distancing) when individuals perceive high pandemic\\\\related control.

Many of these responses, which identify the best action sequence in each situation, are taught as part of the recurrent Neonatal Resuscitation Program training, but they have a low incidence in practice, which leaves health care providers (HCPs) less prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently when they do occur. Computer-based simulators are increasingly used to complement traditional training in medical education, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic era of mass transition to digital education. However, it is not known how learners attitudes toward computer-based learning and assessment environments influence their performance. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relation between HCPs attitudes toward a computer-based simulator and their performance in the computer-based simulator, RETAIN (REsuscitation TrAINing), to uncover the predictors of performance in computer-based simulation environments for neonatal resuscitation. METHODS: Participants were 50 neonatal HCPs (45 females, 4 males, 1 not reported; 16 respiratory therapists, 33 registered nurses and nurse practitioners, and 1 physician) affiliated with a large university hospital. Participants completed a demographic presurvey before playing the game and an attitudinal postsurvey after completing the RETAIN game. Participants survey responses were collected to measure attitudes toward the computer-based simulator, among other factors. Knowledge on neonatal resuscitation was assessed in each round of the game through increasingly difficult neonatal resuscitation scenarios. This study investigated the moderating role of mindset on the association between the perceived benefits of understanding the terminology used in the computer-based simulator, RETAIN, and their performance on the neonatal resuscitation tasks covered by RETAIN. RESULTS: The results revealed that mindset moderated the relation between participants perceived terminology used in RETAIN and their actual performance in the game (F(3,44)=4.56, R(2)=0.24, adjusted R(2)=0.19; P=.007; estimate=C1.19, SE=0.38, t(44)=C3.12, 95% CI C1.96 to C0.42; P=.003). Specifically, participants who perceived the terminology useful also performed better but only when endorsing more of a growth mindset; they also performed worse when endorsing more of a fixed mindset. Most participants reported that they enjoyed playing the game. The more the HCPs agreed that the terminology in the tutorial and in the game was accessible, the better they performed in the game, but only when they reported endorsing a growth mindset exceeding the average mindset of all the participants (F(3,44)=6.31, R(2)=0.30, adjusted R(2)=0.25; P=.001; estimate=C1.21, SE=0.38, t(44)=?3.16, 95% CI C1.99 to C0.44; P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: Mindset moderates the strength of the relationship between HCPs perception of the role that the terminology employed in a game simulator has on their performance and their actual performance in a computer-based simulator designed for neonatal resuscitation training. Implications of this research include the design and development of interactive learning environments that can support HCPs in performing better on neonatal resuscitation tasks.","output":"Health Care Providers Performance, Mindset, and Attitudes Toward a Neonatal Resuscitation Computer-Based Simulator: Empirical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of the outbreak and containment of COVID-19 in its early stage and analyze the causes for conservative judgment of the disease control experts who are blamed for delayed action and inadequate response by the government. We find that the disease control experts have a clear tendency and preference to make conservative judgment about the epidemic risk of a low probability and high impact new disease. This conservative preference may have been a major factor in the judging and communicating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic. The experts perception of the epidemic risk is affected by their habitual thinking facing a low probability event with uncertain progression. Their conservative preference is augmented by political concerns due to the high social and political impact of the event and the potential political consequence of a false judgment. Balancing personal payoffs of decision options, the experts rational choice would lean towards a conservative decision. We propose a three-factor decision model that integrates habitual thinking, political concerns and rational choice to explain the experts conservative judgment, and corroborate the model with evidences from the case.

Establishing a causal relation between two variables can help us in answering that question of why something happens.

The combination of observational and experimental data may give adequate information to properly estimate causal relations. In this study, we consider the conditions where estimating causal relations might work and we show how well different algorithms, namely the Peter and Clark algorithm, the Downward Ranking of Feed-Forward Loops algorithm, the Transitive Reduction for Weighted Signed Digraphs algorithm, the Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) algorithm and the Hidden Invariant Causal Prediction (HICP) algorithm, determine causal relations in a simulation study. Results showed that the ICP and the HICP algorithms perform best in most simulation conditions. We also apply every algorithm to an empirical example to show the similarities and differences between the algorithms.

Six key elements of SDM can be distinguished: situation diagnosis, choice awareness, option clarification, discussion of harms and benefits, deliberation of patient preferences and making the decision. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that facilitate SDM. The impact of DAs for chronic illnesses on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes remains uncertain. METHODS We will perform a systematic review aiming to describe (a) which SDM elements are incorporated in DAs for adult patients with chronic conditions and (b) the effects of DA use on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes. This manuscript reports on the protocol for this systematic review. The following databases will be searched for relevant articles: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO, from their inception to October 2016. We will ascertain ongoing research by querying experts and searching trial registries. To enhance feasibility, we will limit the review to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including patients with chronic cardiovascular and/or respiratory diseases and/or diabetes. SDM elements incorporated in DAs, DA effects and DA itself will be described. DISCUSSION This study will characterize DAs for chronic illness and will provide an overview of their effects on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes.

The differences in IgM and IgG antibody prevalence in different serological assays were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 637 participants were included in this research. Two staff were IgM positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test (cutoff value: 10 AU/ml) of 51 staff who were IgM positive in the rapid test kit. Six staff were IgG positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test of 56 staff who were IgG positive in the rapid test kit. The proportion of antibody positive staff differed greatly between the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test. CONCLUSIONS: There was a vast difference in the proportions of IgG and IgM antibody positive staff in the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test results. The results from the only rapid test kit might have to be interpreted with caution.

For this, after an oral acute toxicity study, adult male mice were treated with MEUL (250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) and/or diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.), and subjected to a number of behavioral studies. In the open-field test, the number of square field cross, grooming, and rearing, was counted, while in the light/dark and swing test, the time spent in the dark portion and number of swings was calculated, respectively. Additionally, the phytochemical analysis was also done. Results reveal that the MEUL possesses alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, terpenes (including triterpenes), gums, and reducing sugars. MEUL showed a significant (p < 0.05) anxiolytic-like effect in experimental animals, where its dose-dependently modulated the test parameters in an open-field test. The MEUL also increased the light residence time and the number of swings in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of 500 mg/kg of MEUL caused the highest calming effect when combined with the experimental animals diazepam group.

Testicular torsion is an emergent condition with higher risk of testicular loss with longer ischemic times. We sought to investigate whether patients with testicular torsion had longer time from symptom onset to initial presentation, longer total ischemic time, and higher rate of orchiectomy during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using billing data, we identified all patients age >1yo seen in our hospital from 1/1/2018 through 5/31/2020 who underwent emergent scrotal exploration for confirmed testicular torsion, comparing the COVID-19 crisis (3/1/2020-5/31/20) to the pre-COVID-19 period (1/1/2018-2/29/20). The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to initial presentation and secondary outcomes were ischemic time (time from symptom onset to entry of the OR) and orchiectomy rate. Parameters were compared with Mann-Whitney U and Fishers exact tests; Poisson regression compared rates of torsion. RESULTS: Of 94 total cases, 77 occurred during the pre-COVID-19 period and 17 during the COVID-19 crisis. Median time from symptom onset to initial presentation was not significantly different (2.4 hr [IQR 1.1 hr C 38.9] during COVID-19 vs. 5.6 hrs [IQR 1.6 C 16.9] during pre-COVID-19 period, p=0.476). Time to presentation was >12 hrs in 5/17 patients (29%) during COVID-19 and 24/77 patients (31%) during pre-COVID-19 period (p=1.00). Median ischemic time during COVID-19 was 7.5 hr (IQR 4.7 hr C 45.5 hr) compared to 9.4 hr (IQR 5.4 hr C 22.5 hr) during pre-COVID-19 period (p=0.694). Incidence of orchiectomy in our center was 29% (5/17) during COVID-19 and 17% (13/77) during pre-COVID-19 period (p=0.397). About half of patients were seen initially at outside facilities prior to arrival (47% [8/17] during COVID-19 vs. 49% [38/77] during pre-COVID-19 period, p=1.00). The number of torsion case presentations per week to our facility increased from 0.7 cases/week in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p=0.015); when comparing only the March 1 to May 31 calendar period, there were 0.6 cases/week during the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p=0.021).

The aim of the study was to verify whether the level of religious commitment significantly influences health behaviors and whether in selected religions the faithful have a different approach to health behaviors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a group of 296 people118 Seventh-day Adventists (SDA), 134 Catholics, and 14 Jews living in southern Poland, and 31 Muslims living in southern and north-eastern Poland. The following research tools were used as part of the diagnostic survey method: a questionnaire survey designed by us; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); the Inventory of Health Behaviours (IHB); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10) and anthropometric measurements, physical examination, laboratory tests. Results: Only 75% of Catholics who participated in the study declared a high level of religious commitment. On the other hand, all (100%) of SDA, Jews, and Muslim respondents declared their religious commitment at a high level. SDA were characterized by the most desirable health behaviors on the IHB (high and average levels), especially eating habits. They did not consume alcohol, did not smoke cigarettes. The physical activity of most ADS was high and moderate. Most of the SDA subjects were characterized by an average and low level of stress intensity. The most common correct scores for homocysteine, triglycerides, and CRP were SDA, cholesterol by Jews, glucose by Muslims, and HDL by Catholics. The most common negative results were: homocysteine, glucose and triglycerides among Jews, cholesterol and CRP among Catholics, HDL among Muslims. Optimal blood pressure was most common among Catholics, and hypertension was most often diagnosed among Jews. Most often, Muslims had the correct body weight, and at the same time it was the group of respondents most often diagnosed with obesity. In contrast, underweight was observed only among Catholics.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted using inductive thematic analysis of observations of Washington state triage team simulations and semistructured interviews with participants during the COVID-19 pandemic from December 2020 to February 2021. Participants included clinician and ethicist triage team members. Data were analyzed from December 2020 through November 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Emergent themes describing the triage process and experience of triage team members. RESULTS: Among 41 triage team members (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [11.4] years; 21 [51.2%] women) who participated in 12 simulations and 21 follow-up interviews, there were 5 Asian individuals (12.2%) and 35 White individuals (85.4%); most participants worked in urban hospital settings (32 individuals [78.0%]). Three interrelated themes emerged from qualitative analysis: (1) understanding the broader approach to resource allocation: participants strove to understand operational and ethical foundations of the triage process, which was necessary to appreciate their teams specific role; (2) contending with uncertainty: team members could find it difficult or feel irresponsible making consequential decisions based on limited clinical and contextual patient information, and they grappled with ethically ambiguous features of individual cases and of the triage process as a whole; and (3) transforming mindset: participants struggled to disentangle narrow determinations about patients likelihood of survival to discharge from implicit biases and other ethically relevant factors, such as quality of life. They cited the teams open deliberative process, as well as practice and personal experience with triage as important in helping to reshape their usual cognitive approach to align with this unique task. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that there were challenges in adapting clinical intuition and training to a distinctive role in the process of scarce resource allocation. These findings suggest that clinical experience, education in ethical and operational foundations of triage, and experiential training, such as triage simulations, may help prepare clinicians for this difficult role.","output":"Perspectives of Triage Team Members Participating in Statewide Triage Simulations for Scarce Resource Allocation During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Washington State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses how preventive and promotional discourses have been incorporated by the Brazilian population in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It analyzes materials posted on the internet and social after the first case of COVID 19-related death in Brazil that are related health promotion and COVID-19 aimed at orienting society's response to the pandemic. The analysis considers two key factors: the mismanagement of the pandemic by the Brazilian government and infodemic. There is complex use of scientific information with recommendations that focus on what people should do (intervention) and in transforming individuals' behaviors, based on an ideal model of healthy behaviors. Narratives aimed to delegate to the population and specific groups the task of taking care of themselves have been reinforced, removing from the State the responsibility to offer conditions for the population to address the situation. There is a sophistication of strategies that blame individual practices, personal organization and that are disconnected from the collective, especially for those who live in situation of extreme vulnerability. Concomitantly, there are also discourses based on notions of solidarity and renewed social connections, which are empowering and consistent with the practice of health promotion as it attributes meanings to the subjects and their ways of life. We conclude that greatest advocacy in the field of health promotion at this moment is political and could be directed toward reaffirming health promotion principles, supporting permanent mobilization against setbacks in the public sphere and defending a new, democratic, inclusive and collective vision of society.","output":"Information, control and health promotion in the Brazilian context of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medical subspecialties including neurosurgery have seen a dramatic shift in operative volume in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on operative volume at 2 academic neurosurgery centers in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA from equivalent periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted analyzing neurosurgical case records for 2 tertiary academic centers from March to June 2020 and March to June 2019. The records were reviewed for variables including institution and physician coverage, operative volume by month and year, cases per subspecialty, patient demographics, mortality, and morbidity. RESULTS: Comparison of groups showed a 34% reduction in monthly neurosurgical volume per institution during the pandemic compared with earlier time points, including a 77% decrease during April 2020. There was no change in mortality and morbidity across institutions during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on neurosurgical practice and will likely continue to have long-term effects on patients at a time when global gross domestic products decrease and relative health expenditures increase.

This study examines the role of localized urban SIPO policy in curbing COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we explore (i) the comparative effectiveness of county-level SIPOs in urbanized as compared to non-urbanized areas, (ii) the mechanisms through which SIPO adoption in urban counties yields COVID-related health benefits, and (iii) whether late adoption of a statewide SIPO yields health benefits beyond those achieved from early adopting counties. We exploit the unique laboratory of Texas, a state in which the early adoption of local SIPOs by densely populated counties covered almost two-thirds of the state's population prior to adoption of a statewide SIPO on April 2, 2020. Using an event study framework, we document that countywide SIPO adoption is associated with an 8 percent increase in the percent of residents who remain at home full-time and between a 13 to 19 percent decrease in foot-traffic at venues that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 such as restaurants, bars, hotels, and entertainment venues. These social distancing effects are largest in urbanized and densely populated counties. Then, we find that in early adopting urban counties, COVID-19 case growth fell by 21 to 26 percentage points two-and-a-half weeks following adoption of a SIPO, a result robust to controls for county-level heterogeneity in COVID-19 outbreak timing, coronavirus testing, the age distribution, and political preferences. We find that approximately 90 percent of the curbed growth in COVID-19 cases in Texas came from the early adoption of SIPOs by urbanized counties, suggesting that the later statewide shelter-in-place mandate yielded relatively few health benefits.","output":"Were Urban Cowboys Enough to Control COVID-19?

Main measurements: Frailty was calculated at baseline from the computerized medical records. Results during follow-up: diagnosis of COVID-19, possible or confirmed with PCR and all-cause mortality. Results: 251788 patients over 64 years of age were analysed, 61.3% had some level of frailty, 27.8% moderate or severe. The incidence of COVID-19 was 3.13 cases per 100 inhabitants (N = 7883) and the mortality from COVID-19 was 21.5% (N = 1691). Both the incidence and mortality from COVID-19 were higher at older age, in men, at greater deprivation and at a higher level of frailty.

However, in indexed sequencing, the sequential paradigm of data acquisition, demultiplexing, and analysis restrain read assignment in advance and real-time analysis, resulting in lengthy turnaround time for clinical metagenomic detection. METHODS We described the utility of internal-index adaptors with different lengths of barcode in multiplex sequencing. The base composition for each position within these adaptors was well-balanced to ensure nucleotide diversity and optimal sequencing performance and to achieve the early assignment of reads by first sequencing the barcodes. Combined with an automated library preparation device, we delivered a rapid and real-time bioinformatics pathogen identification solution for the Illumina NextSeq platform. The diagnostic performance was evaluated by testing 153 lower respiratory tract specimens using mNGS in comparison to culture, 16S/internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing, and additional PCR-based tests. RESULTS By calculating the average F1 scores of all read lengths under different threshold values, we established the optimal threshold for pathogens identification, and found that 36 bp was the optimal shortest read length for rapid mNGS analysis. Rapid detection had a negative percentage agreement and positive percentage agreement of 100% and 85.1% for bacteria and 97.4% and 80.3% for fungi, when compared to a composite standard.

People with ID were identified by entitlements to residential ID\\\\care services as retrieved from a national database. RESULTS: Data covered the entire adult Dutch population (12.6 million; GenPop), of which 91 064 individuals were identified with an ID.

The relevance of the subject stems from the key role of airborne virus transmission by viral particles released by an infected person via coughing, sneezing, speaking or simply breathing. Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic disease carriers are also considered for their viral load and potential for infection. Proper understanding of the mechanics of the complex processes whereby the two-phase flow emitted by an infected individual disperses into the environment would allow us to infer from first principles the practical rules to be imposed on social distancing and on the use of facial and eye protection, which to date have been adopted on a rather empirical basis. These measures need compelling scientific validation. A deeper understanding of the relevant biological fluid dynamics would also allow us to evaluate the contrasting effects of natural or forced ventilation of environments on the transmission of contagion: the risk decreases as the viral load is diluted by mixing effects but contagion is potentially allowed to reach larger distances from the infected source.

This work aims to evaluate mood disorders of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy during COVID-19 in comparison with cancer patients who underwent radiation therapy in 2019. Materials and Methods: We included all the patients undergoing radiation therapy at our department in two-time points (once a week for a month in May 2019) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (in April 2020). All the patients were asked to fulfill a validated questionnaire (STAI-Y1, State trait anxiety inventory scale), the Symptom Distress thermometer (SDT) (from 0 to 10 score), and the Beck Depression Inventory v.2 (BDI-2). We took into account the COVID-19 outbreak and also sex, age, week of radiation treatment, and disease. Results: We included 458 patients (220 males and 238 females), with a median age of 64 years. STAI-Y1 median score was 40 (mean 41,3, range 19C79), whereas the median score of SDT was five and BDI-2 median score was 11. STAI-Y1, SDT, and BDI-2 were significantly correlated with the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0,001 for all the tests), sex (p: 0,016 for STAI-Y1, p < 0.001 for SDT, p:0.013 for BDI-2), week of treatment (p: 0.012 for STAI-Y1 and p: 0.031 for SDT), and disease (p:0.015 for STAI-Y1, p < 0.001 for SDT and p:0.020 for BDI-2). Conclusions: The prevalence of mood disorders in patients undergoing radiation therapy is higher than expected and even higher during the COVID-19 outbreak.

One of the key differences between these two assumptions was whether the virus actively replicated since, so far, no reports showed viruses could stop evolution in alive hosts. We studied SARS-CoV-2 sequences in this outbreak by a modified leaf-dating method with the Bayes factor. The numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) found in SARS-CoV-2 sequences were significantly lower than those called from B.1.1 records collected at the matching time worldwide (p = 0.047). In addition, results of the Leaf-dating method showed ages of viruses sampled from this outbreak were earlier than their recorded dates of collection (Bayes factors > 10), while control sequences (selected randomly with ten replicates) showed no differences in their collection dates (Bayes factors < 10). Our results which indicated that the re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Beijing in June 2020 was caused by a virus that exhibited a lack of evolutionary changes compared to viruses collected at the corresponding time, provided evolutionary evidence to the contaminated imported frozen food should be responsible for the reappearance of COVID-19 cases in Beijing.

Rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial regression while investigating the effects of adjusting for several sociodemographic and medical factors RESULTS: Faster implementation of mask mandates was consistently shown to be protective. States with mask mandates made at three to six months had a 1.61 times higher rate than those who implemented within one month (adjusted rate ratioa?=a?1.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.10, P = .001).

It comprises a platform ecosystem that facilitates the recombination and exchange of data around a stable core between a wide range of complements of data providers and prospective customers.

METHODS: Anticipating a surge in patients requiring testing, Beaumont Health implemented curbside testing, operated by a multidisciplinary team of health care workers, including physicians, advanced practice providers, residents, nurses, technicians, and registration staff. We report on the following outcomes over a period of 26 days (March 12, 2020, to April 6, 2020): time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records, overall screening time, and emergency center return evaluations. RESULTS: In total, 2782 patients received curbside services. A nasopharyngeal swab was performed on 1176 patients (41%), out of whom 348 (29.6%) tested positive. The median time for the entire process (from registration to discharge) was 28 minutes (IQR 17-44). The median time to final medical decision was 15 minutes (IQR 8-27). The median time from medical decision to discharge was 9 minutes (IQR 5-16).

Cytokine storm risk was categorized by ferritin. RESULTS: 939/1039 COVID-19 positive patients (median age 69ys, 563/939 (60%) male) completed hospital encounters to death or discharge by 21(st) May 2020. Thromboembolic flag criteria were reached by 568/939 (60.4%), including 238/275 (86.6%) of the patients who died, and 330/664 (49.7%) of the patients who survived to discharge, p < 0.0001. Cytokine storm flag criteria were reached by 212 (22.5%) of admissions, including 80/275 (29.0%) of the patients who died, and 132/664 (19.9%) of the patients who survived, p < 0.0001. The maximum thromboembolic flag discriminated completed encounter mortality (no flag: 37/371 [9.97%] died; medium-risk: 68/239 [28.5%]; high-risk: 105/205 [51.2%]; and suspected thromboembolism: 65/124 [52.4%], p < 0.0001). Flag criteria were reached by 535 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients whose hospital encounter completed before traffic-light introduction: 173/535 (32.3% [95% confidence intervals 28.0, 36.0]) died. For the 200 consecutive admissions after implementation of real-time traffic light flags, 46/200 (23.0% [95% confidence intervals 17.1 - 28.9]) died, p = 0.013. Adjusted for age and sex, the probability of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.30 - 0.37) before traffic light implementation, 0.22 (0.17 - 0.27) after implementation, p < 0.001.

In addition, this study also tests key hypotheses relating to reasoned and implicit pathways to ULFE and its maintenance among postoperative patients with breast cancer. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit patients from two breast cancer wards in a provincial hospital in Jiangsu, China. Patients (N = 430) completed self-reported questionnaire about constructs from integrated theories concerning ULFE at an initial time point (T1): task self-efficacy, positive outcome expectations, negative outcome expectations, risk perception, attitude behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, and ULFE-in hospital (ULFE-IH). Three months later (T2), patients self-reported: maintenance self-efficacy, action planning, coping planning, recovery self-efficacy, and ULFE-maintenance (ULFE-M). Results: The model has a good fit (GoF = 0.48). For behavioral intention of ULFE, subjective norm ( = 0.35) and perceived behavioral control ( = 0.61) were positively directly related to behavioral intention. Regarding the initiation of ULFE, perceived behavioral control ( = 0.47) and behavioral intention ( = 0.42) had a direct positive relation to ULFE-IH. In the maintenance of ULFE, action planning ( = 0.30), coping planning ( = 0.21), maintenance self-efficacy ( = 0.32), and recovery self-efficacy ( = 0.09) all had significant positive relation on ULFE-M. In addition, maintenance self-efficacy had a significant positive association on action planning ( = 0.80), coping planning ( = 0.74), and recovery self-efficacy ( = 0.67). Coping planning was significantly predicted by behavioral intention ( = 0.07).

STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center, randomized control pilot study of 60 infants <29 weeks' gestation with a high PDAsc (&#8805;5.0) at 36-48 hours of age receiving either Ibuprofen or Placebo intravenously. The study protocol did not allow for additional PDA therapy within the first two weeks. We reported the rate of consent, open label treatment and PDA closure rates. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease/Death. RESULTS: 83 families were approached for enrollment with 73 (88%) providing consent; 13 infants had a PDAsc < 5; of the remaining infants, 30 were assigned Ibuprofen and 30 received placebo. Eight infants received open label treatment in the first two weeks (12%). The overall PDA closure rate after treatment was 57% in the Intervention Group and 17% in the Control Group (p<0.01). There was no difference in the primary clinical outcome (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.3-2.1).

However, it is difficult to predict the combinations that result in globular and protein-like conformations without simulations. In this study, we used single-chain three-helix bundles as simple models of protein tertiary structures and sought to thoroughly investigate the conditions required to construct them, starting from the identification of the typical -hairpin motifs. RESULTS: First, by statistical analysis of naturally occurring protein structures, we identified three -hairpins motifs that were specifically related to the left- and right-handedness of helix-helix packing. Second, specifying these -hairpins motifs as junctions, we performed sequence-independent backbone-building simulations to comparatively build single-chain three-helix bundle structures and identified the promising combinations of the length of the -helix and -hairpins types that results in tight packing between the first and third -helices. Third, using those single-chain three-helix bundle backbone structures as template structures, we designed amino acid sequences that were predicted to fold into the target topologies, which supports that the compact single-chain three-helix bundles structures that we sampled show sufficient quality to allow amino-acid sequence design. CONCLUSION: The enumeration of the dominant subsets of possible backbone structures for small single-chain three-helical bundle topologies revealed that the compact foldable structures are discontinuously and sparsely distributed in the conformational space. Additionally, although the designs have not been experimentally validated in the present research, the comprehensive set of computational structural models generated also offers protein designers the opportunity to skip building similar structures by themselves and enables them to quickly focus on building specialized designs using the prebuilt structure models.

Based on correlations between the coronavirus-induced modifications of lipid metabolism in host cells, plasmalogen deficiency in the lung surfactant of COVID-19 patients, and the alterations of lipid membrane structural organization and composition including the induction of CM, we emphasize the key role of plasmalogens in the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV) entry and replication in host cells. Considering that plasmalogen-enriched lung surfactant formulations may improve the respiratory process in severe infected individuals, plasmalogens can be suggested as an anti-viral prophylactic, a lipid biomarker in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and a potential anti-viral therapeutic component of lung surfactant development for COVID-19 patients.","output":"Coronavirus-Induced Host Cubic Membranes and Lipid-Related Antiviral Therapies: A Focus on Bioactive Plasmalogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Flow diverters and conventional coiling are established modalities for the retreatment of intracranial recurrent aneurysms after initial endovascular treatment. We aimed to compare the efficacy of these techniques. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data for patients with recurrent aneurysms after initial endovascular treatment retreated in our center with either a pipeline embolization device (PED) or conventional coil embolization from January 2012 to July 2020. We performed 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) using the nearest neighbor method. We controlled for: initial treatment strategy, aneurysm size, neck diameter, symptom presentation, history of aneurysm rupture, age, sex, fusiform-dissecting aneurysm, bifurcation aneurysm, and aneurysm location. The clinical and morphological factors of all patients at initial treatment and the angiographic and clinical results at the second treatment were collected and compared between the propensity-matched pairs. Results: A total of 105 intracranial aneurysms were identified; 18 patients (17.1%) were treated with a PED, and 87 (82.9%) were treated via conventional coil embolization. PSM resulted in 12 matched pairs (12 patients in the PED group and 24 in the coiling group). There was no significant difference of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications between the groups, the obliteration rate of branches covered by stent, or modified Rankin Scale scores at the last clinical follow-up. Importantly, the retreatment strategy in the PED group provided significantly different results vs. the coiling group (P < 0.001), with a lower recurrence rate (0.0 vs. 29.2%, respectively; P = 0.037). However, the procedural failure rate and the parent artery stenosis were more frequently in PED group compared with coiling group (both were 16.7 vs. 0.0%; P = 0.040). Conclusions: Endovascular retreatment for recurrent aneurysms after initial endovascular treatment might be safe and effective. Flow diverters might be associated with reduced risk of recanalization and an increased risk of procedural failure and mild parent artery stenosis.","output":"Retreatment With Flow Diverters and Coiling for Recurrent Aneurysms After Initial Endovascular Treatment: A Propensity Score-Matched Comparative Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

Purposeful sampling was used, and the participant criteria was: age 55+, have good thinking skills, resident of Alabama, have chronic/serious health conditions, and experienced pain or discomfort in the last 3 months. Twenty-three participants were recruited from rural counties of West and South Alabama through the local Area Agency on Aging and health and senior service centers.

Compounds with antiviral activity were recently identified that bind to the N-terminal domain of CA (CA N) and inhibit capsid assembly during viral maturation. We have determined the structure of the complex between CA N and the antiviral assembly inhibitor N-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-N'-{2-[({5-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-2-furyl}-methyl)-sulfanyl]ethyl}-urea) (CAP-1) using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The protein undergoes a remarkable conformational change upon CAP-1 binding, in which Phe32 is displaced from its buried position in the protein core to open a deep hydrophobic cavity that serves as the ligand binding site. The aromatic ring of CAP-1 inserts into the cavity, with the urea NH groups forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of Val59 and the dimethylamonium group interacting with the side-chains of Glu28 and Glu29. Elements that could be exploited to improve binding affinity are apparent in the structure. The displacement of Phe32 by CAP-1 appears to be facilitated by a strained main-chain conformation, which suggests a potential role for a Phe32 conformational switch during normal capsid assembly.","output":"Structure of the antiviral assembly inhibitor CAP-1 complex with the HIV-1 CA protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare gas exchange indices behavior by using liberal versus conservative oxygenation targets in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 under invasive mechanical ventilation.

Subsequently, there is a need for a rapid, user-friendly, and inexpensive on-site monitoring system for diagnosis. The early and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in combating the outbreak. Although conventional methods such as PCR, RT-PCR, and ELISA, etc., offer a gold-standard solution to manage the pandemic, they cannot be implemented as a point-of-care (POC) testing arrangement. Moreover, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) having a high enhancement factor provides quantitative results with high specificity, sensitivity, and multiplex detection ability but lacks in POC setup. In contrast, POC devices such as lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) offer rapid, simple-to-use, cost-effective, reliable platform. However, LFIA has limitations in quantitative and sensitive analyses of SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Conceptually, switching is facilitated when ENDS provide adequate nicotine delivery. Switching rates among smokers who purchased the JUUL System (JUUL) were compared in the United Kingdom (UK), where regulations limit nicotine concentration to 20 mg/mL versus North America (N.Am.; United States and Canada), where higher concentrations are available. AIMS AND METHODS: Adult established smokers (age 21, smoked 100 cigarettes, smoking some days or every day at baseline) who newly purchased JUUL were recruited into a longitudinal study (UK: N = 1247; N.Am.: N = 8835). Complete switching (no smoking for 30 days) was assessed 1, 3, and 6 months after purchase; propensity score matching (PSM) and logistic regression compared switching after adjusting for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: In both N.Am. and UK, 82% of participants reported using the highest JUUL nicotine concentration available (UK: 18 mg/mL; N.Am.: 59 mg/mL). Unadjusted switching rates did not differ at 1 month (17%C18%); unadjusted and adjusted rates were significantly higher in N.Am. (vs. UK) at 3 and 6 months. In the PSM sample, after additional covariate adjustment, rates were significantly higher in N.Am. (vs. UK) at 3 months (31.5% vs. 22.7%; odds ratio [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.59 [1.25, 2.02]) and 6 months (38.0% vs. 26.0%; odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.79 [1.37, 2.35]). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest availability of ENDS in nicotine concentrations greater than 20 mg/mL may be associated with increased switching among adult smokers. Differences in smoking and ENDS use characteristics did not explain associations of location and switching; however, between-country differences may be affected by unmeasured factors. IMPLICATIONS: Switching rates were lower among smokers who purchased the JUUL System (JUUL) in the UK, where regulations limit nicotine concentration to 20 mg/mL versus N.Am.

The past decade has seen several major advances in organoid culture technologies and this has enhanced our understanding of mimicking organ reconstruction. The term organoid has generally been used to describe cellular aggregates derived from primary tissues or stem cells that can self-organize into organotypic structures. Organoids mimic the cellular microenvironment of tissues better than 2D cell culture systems and represent the tissue physiology. Human organoids of brain, thyroid, gastrointestinal, lung, cardiac, liver, pancreatic and kidney have been established from various diseases, healthy tissues and from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Advances in patient-derived organoid culture further provides a unique perspective from which treatment modalities can be personalized.

Mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell-surface tumor antigen expressed in different subtypes of breast and non-breast cancer. Its recent identification as a marker of some triple-negative breast tumors renders it an attractive target, presently investigated in clinical trials employing antibody drug conjugates and CAR-T cells. The availability of MSLN-retargeted oncolytic viruses may complement the current immunotherapeutic panel of biological drugs against HER2-negative breast and non-breast tumors. Methods: A fully virulent, tumor-targeted oncolytic Herpes simplex virus-1 (MSLN-THV) with a selectivity for mesothelin-expressing cancer cells was generated. Recombineering technology was used to replace an essential moiety of the viral glycoprotein D with antibody fragments derived from clinically validated MSLN monoclonal antibodies, and to allow IL12 cargo expression in infected cells. Panels of breast and female reproductive system cell lines were used to verify the oncolytic potential of the viral constructs. A platform for production of the retargeted viruses was developed in HEK 293 cells, providing stable expression of a suitable chimeric receptor. Results: We demonstrated the selectivity of viral infection and cytotoxicity by MSLN-retargeted viruses in a panel of mesothelin-positive cancer cells, originating from breast and female reproductive system tumors. We also developed a second-generation oncolytic MSLN-THV, encoding IL12, to enhance the immunotherapeutic potential of the viral backbone. A non-tumor cell line expressing a chimeric MSLN/Nectin-1 receptor, de-sensitized from antiviral responses by genetic inactivation of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)-dependent pathway was engineered, to optimize viral yields.

SETTING: One teaching hospital Intensive Care Unit. SUBJECTS: All the patients who presented at the Emergency Department (ED) and were thereafter admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a final diagnosis of sepsis were included in this retrospective observational three-year study.

Baseline characteristics, infection main features and sepsis management were compared. The impact of a vague presentation on 28-day mortality was then evaluated. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 348 included patients, 103 (29.6%) had a vague sepsis presentation. Underlying chronic diseases were more likely in those patients [e.g., peripheral arterial occlusive disease: adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 2.01, (1.08-3.77) 95% confidence interval (CI); p = 0.028], but organ failure was less likely at the ED [SOFA score value: 4.7 (3.2) vs. 5.2 (3.1), p = 0.09].

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1,573 government employees from 46 public institutions located in Addis Ababa was undertaken from 8th to 19th June 2020. Paper-based self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. ANOVA test and t-test were used to assess the difference between groups. Results: The respondents demonstrated very high knowledge of the cause of COVID-19 (93%), its main clinical symptoms (>90%), the main modes of transmission (89%), the main preventive measures (>90%). Almost all respondents reported that people with recent travel history (86.8%) or people who had contact with COVID-19 patients (93.5%) were the high-risk groups to be infected with coronavirus. In addition, more than half (50.9%) of the study participants reported that people without travel history nor had contact with confirmed cases are also most likely to be infected with the virus. About 84% of the respondents perceived that older adults and elderly were most at risk to die from COVID-19.

An individual that has contracted the two-stage contagious disease will initially show no symptoms of the disease but is capable of spreading it. If the initial stages are not detected which could lead to complications eventually, then symptoms start appearing in the latter stage when it would be necessary to perform expensive treatment. Under a constrained budget situation, policymakers are faced with the decision of how to allocate budget for prevention (via vaccinations), subsidizing treatment, and examination to detect the presence of initial stages of the contagious disease. These decisions need to be performed in each period of a given time horizon. To aid this decision-making exercise, we formulate a stochastic dynamic optimal control problem with feedback which can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, solving the MDP is computationally intractable due to the large state space as the embedded stochastic network cannot be decomposed.

We heuristically fine-tune the asymptotically optimal solution for the non-asymptotic case, and test it extensively for several numerical cases. In particular we investigate the effect of budget, length of planning horizon, type of disease, population size, and ratio of costs on the policy for budget allocation.","output":"An analytic framework to develop policies for testing, prevention, and treatment of two-stage contagious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Technology-driven control measures could be an important tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 C 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms.

METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we reviewed the charts of all patients who had a visit at a medical retina referral center during the Italian quarantine (from 9th of March 2020 to 3rd of May 2020). Number and characteristics of these data were compared with data from the same period in 2019 (from 9th of March 2019 to 3rd of May 2019). RESULTS: In the 2019 study period, there were 303 patients attending clinic (150 males, 153 females). In the 2020 study period, patients decreased to 75 (48 males, 27 females; P = 0.022 comparing gender prevalence between the two periods) with an overall reduction of 75.2%. Mean  SD age was 71.4  14.3 years (range 25-93 years) in the 2019 study period and 66.7  13.1 years (range 32-91 years) in the 2020 study period (P = 0.005). The largest drop in outpatient volume was recorded in AMD patients (- 79.9%). Regarding the intravitreal treatments, there were 1252 injections in the 2019 period and 583 injections in the 2020 period (- 53.6% in injections). The drop in intravitreal treatments was larger in patients with posterior uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetes (- 85.7%, - 61.9%, and - 59.6%, respectively).

DESIGN Prospective, internally controlled, observational study. SETTING A University Teaching Hospital ANIMALS Six apparently healthy, owned cats. INTERVENTIONS Blood collection by jugular venipuncture. Transfusion with labeled, autologous, fresh RBCs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Anticoagulated whole blood (35 mL/cat) was collected in 2 equal aliquots. RBCs were washed and labeled at 2 different biotin densities, before suspension in autologous plasma. Labeled RBCs were then transfused using 2 methods, gravity flow and pump delivery using a 20 mL syringe and 18 m microaggregate filter. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat at 2-hour intervals for 12 hours following completion of the transfusions. Additional samples were collected at weekly intervals up to 6 weeks to assess circulating half-life of the transfused cells. Cell survival was assessed via flow cytometry. The proportion of transfused cells remaining in each of the 2 populations was measured. Biotinylated RBCs were readily detected in all cats over the 6-week sampling period. There was a significant decrease in both populations of labeled cells over the 6-week period (P < 0.01), as expected. There was no difference in probability that the RBCs would survive up to 12 hours immediately following transfusion, and no significant difference in survival between the 2 groups over 6 weeks. The average half-life of all labeled cells was approximately 23 days. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that, in contrast to findings from dogs, transfusion of autologous feline RBCs using a syringe + aggregate filter method does not significantly impact short- or long-term survival of the transfused cells.","output":"Effect of syringe and aggregate filter administration on survival of transfused autologous fresh feline red blood cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We recently experienced a patient with viral isolation by culture 4 months after the acute infection. an 83-year-old Japanese man visited our outpatient clinic with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The patient was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test. Three months after his clinic visit, he had regained most of his pre-COVID-19 level of health. However, qRT-PCR tests continued to be positive. At day 111, specimens from a nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.(1) Three to five days post-inoculation, cytopathic effects were observed, and viral RNA was detected in the culture supernatant by qRT-PCR (Ct values: 29-37). The culture supernatant of the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells cocultured with the nasopharyngeal swab was passaged to the fresh VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, and after 3 days of the passage, cytopathic effect was observed again. In the supernatant of the passaged cell culture, viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR (Ct value: 29). By sequencing the qRT-PCR product using Illumina iSEQ100, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was verified. These results indicate the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal specimen even at day 111.

Recent reports have proposed the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for inducing tissue repair in burn injuries. OBJECTIVE We aim to evaluate the effect of allogeneic MSC transplantation on full-thickness burns with delayed healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study includes five patients with AB B/B burns. All patients received conservative treatments, including cleaning, debridement of necrotic tissue, and silver based dressing on the burn wounds. Cryopreserved allogeneic MSCs were thawed and rapidly expanded and used for application in burned patients. MSCs were implanted into preclotted platelet-rich plasma onto the surface of burn wounds. RESULTS All treated burn wounds showed early granulation tissue and rapid re-epithelialization after MSC transplantation. Healing took between 1 and 5 months after MSC transplantation. Repair of burn wounds was associated with slight discoloration of the regenerated skin without hypertrophic scarring or contractures. CONCLUSION Our results provide evidence of healing in deep- and full-thickness burns by allogeneic MSC transplantation. Rapid healing of burn patients, after MSC transplantation, improves their quality of life and reduces the length of hospitalization.

Objective: To assess the complications, safety, and timing of tracheotomy performed for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study assessed consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who had COVID-19 that required tracheotomy. Patients were recruited from March 16 to April 10, 2020, at a tertiary referral center. Exposures: A surgical tracheotomy was performed for all patients following recommended criteria for use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Main Outcomes and Measures: The number of subthyroid operations, the tracheal entrance protocol, and use of PPE. Infections among the surgeons were monitored weekly by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab samples. Short-term complications, weaning, and the association of timing of tracheotomy (early [&#8804;10 days] vs late [>10 days]) with total required days of invasive ventilation were assessed. Results: A total of 50 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.8 [9.2] years; 33 [66%] male) participated in the study. All tracheotomies were performed at the bedside. The median time from intubation to tracheotomy was 9 days (interquartile range, 2-24 days). A subthyroid approach was completed for 46 patients (92%), and the tracheal protocol was adequately achieved for 40 patients (80%). Adequate PPE was used, with no infection among surgeons identified 4 weeks after the last tracheotomy. Postoperative complications were rare, with minor bleeding (in 6 patients [12%]) being the most common complication. The successful weaning rate was higher in the early tracheotomy group than in the late tracheotomy group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.96-6.75), but the difference was not statistically significant. There was less time of invasive mechanical ventilatory support with early tracheotomy compared with late tracheotomy (mean [SD], 18 [5.4] vs 22.3 [5.7] days). The reduction of invasive ventilatory support was achieved at the expense of the pretracheotomy period. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, with the use of a standardized protocol aimed at minimizing COVID-19 risks, bedside open tracheotomy was a safe procedure for patients and surgeons, with minimal complications. Timing of tracheotomy may be important in reducing time of invasive mechanical ventilation, with potential implications to intensive care unit availability during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Timing, Complications, and Safety of Tracheotomy in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a comprehensive evaluation of the federalism-implicated aspects of Australias response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

That is to say, the inquiry identifies what were widely considered to be important policies, and considers the extent to which the formulation and implementation of those policies was furthered or hindered by the institutions and relations forming Australias federal structure. Five policy areas are considered, namely: the National Cabinet; social distancing and related policies; international travel and quarantine; interstate travel; and cities and local government. The conclusions reached are that a number of policy responses achieved federalisms objectives of enhancing local decision-making power, increasing state and federal cooperation, and cabining policy failure.

The United Nation (UN) Decade of Action for road safety aimed to reduce road traffic deaths by 50% by the year 2020. We aimed to study the factors affecting the death rates of motorized 2C3 wheelers injured victims and whether the reduction in the death rates has met the UN target. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the WHO Global Status Reports on Road Safety published over 2009 to 2018 which covered the years of 2007 to 2016. Studied variables included motorized 2C3 wheelers death rates, percentage of helmet-wearing rate, helmet law enforcement, speed law enforcement, gross national income per capita, vehicles/person ratio, and motorized 2C3 wheelers/person ratio. A mixed linear model was used to define factors affecting the change of motorized 2C3 wheelers death rates over time. RESULTS: The global mean motorized 2C3 wheelers death rates increased from 2.37/100,000 population to 3.23/100,000 population over the studied decade (a relative ratio of 1.36) which was not statistically significant. Factors that affected mortality included GNI (p = 0.025), motorized 2C3 wheelers per person ratio (p < 0.0001), percentage of helmet wearing rate (p = 0.046), and the interaction between vehicle/person ratio and motorized 2C3 wheelers/person ratio (p = 0.016). There was a significant increase in the death rates over time in the low-income countries (a relative ratio of 2.52, p = 0.019, Friedman test), and middle-income countries (a relative ratio of 1.46, p < 0.0001, Friedman test), compared with a significant decrease in the high-income countries (a relative ratio of 0.72, p < 0.0001, Friedman test). CONCLUSIONS: Global mortality of motorized 2C3 wheelers has increased by a relative ratio of 1.36 over a recent decade. The UN target of reducing death was not met. The increase was related to the increase in motorized 2C3 wheelers per person ratio and economic inequity which has to be addressed globally.

The potential effects of these interactions on their learning process are not fully understood and the outcomes may depend on the tool used. This study explores the communication patterns and learning effectiveness developed by students using two basic synchronous and asynchronous communication tools in e-learning environments, specifically business simulation games.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conduct a quasi-experiment research with 478 online business students, 267 of whom used online discussion forums and 211 interacted via an instant messaging app. The application of learning analytics and text mining on natural language processing allows us to explore the student communication patterns with each of tools and their effectiveness in terms of learning.FindingsThe results confirm the complementarity of the communication tools, asynchronous tools being especially the suitable for task-related communication and synchronous ones for speeding up and facilitating student social interactions.Originality/valueThe main value of this research lies in the use of data analytics and text mining to access and analyse the content of student interactions to assess the learning process in greater depth, comparing synchronous and asynchronous learning modes, considering that little is known about the impact of online synchronous interaction or instant messaging, and even less about the different features, content and performance that emerge when these two learner interaction modalities are compared.","output":"Game learning analytics of instant messaging and online discussion forums in higher education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the large increase in online instruction, including remote instruction with online materials during the COVID-19 pandemic, there also was an increase in the use of instructional materials that were made to be displayed online or were digitized for online use.

The neural models used were Hodgkin-Huxley, Hindmarsh-Rose, Integrate-and-Fire, and Spike-Response-Model. Discrete models such as Aihara, Rulkov, Izhikevic, and Courbage-Nekorkin-Vdovin were also evaluated. The dynamical systems parameters were varied in the search for chaos, by analyzing trajectories and bifurcation diagrams. Then, a coupling term was added to the models to analyze synchronization in a couple, a vector, and a lattice of oscillators. Later, a lattice with variable parameters is used to simulate different biological neurons. Discrete models did not synchronize in vectors and lattices, but the continuous models were successful in all stages, including the Spike Response Model, which synchronized without the use of a coupling force, only by the synchronous time arrival of presynaptic stimuli. However, this model did not show chaotic characteristics. Finally, in the models in which the previous results were satisfactory, lattices were studied where the coupling force between neurons varied in a non-random way, forming clusters of oscillators with strong coupling to each other, and low coupling with others. The possibility of identifying the clusters was observed in the trajectories and phase differences among all neurons in the reticulum detecting where it occurred and where there was no synchronization.

However, while robots can increase efficiency and enable service offerings with reduced human contact, prior research shows a systematic consumer aversion toward service robots relative to human service providers. This potential dilemma raises the managerial question of how firms can overcome consumer aversion and better employ service robots. Drawing on prior research that supports the use of language for building interpersonal relationships, this research examines whether the type of language (social-oriented vs. task-oriented language) a service robot uses can improve consumer responses to and evaluations of the focal service robot, particularly in light of consumers COVID-19-related stress. The results show that consumers respond more favorably to a service robot that uses a social-oriented (vs. task-oriented) language style, particularly when these consumers experience relatively higher levels of COVID-19-related stress. These findings contribute to initial empirical evidence in marketing for the efficacy of leveraging robots language style to improve customer evaluations of service robots, especially under stressful circumstances. Overall, the results from two experimental studies not only point to actionable managerial implications but also to a new avenue of research on service robots that examines customer-robot interactions through the lens of language and in contexts that can be stressful for consumers (e.g., healthcare or some financial service settings).

Quantifying intercepted PAR requires accurate measurements of total incident PAR above canopies and direct beam and diffuse PAR components. While some regional data sets include these data, e.g. from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program sites, they are not often applicable to local research sites because of the variable nature (spatial and temporal) of environmental variables that influence incoming PAR. Currently available instrumentation that measures diffuse and direct beam radiation separately can be cost prohibitive and require frequent adjustments. Alternatively, generalized empirical relationships that relate atmospheric variables and radiation components can be used but require assumptions that increase the potential for error. Our goal here was to construct and test a cheaper, highly portable instrument alternative that could be used at remote field sites to measure total, diffuse and direct beam PAR for extended time periods without supervision. The apparatus tested here uses a fabricated, solar powered rotating shadowband and other commercially available parts to collect continuous hourly PAR data. Measurements of total incident PAR had nearly a one-to-one relationship with total incident radiation measurements taken at the same research site by an unobstructed point quantum sensor. Additionally, measurements of diffuse PAR compared favorably with modeled estimates from previously published data, but displayed significant differences that were attributed to the important influence of rapidly changing local environmental conditions. The cost of the system is about 50% less than comparable commercially available systems that require periodic, but not continual adjustments. Overall, the data produced using this apparatus indicates that this instrumentation has the potential to support ecological research via a relatively inexpensive method to collect continuous measurements of total, direct beam and diffuse PAR in remote locations.","output":"Using a simple apparatus to measure direct and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation at remote locations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, may ameliorate the inflammatory manifestations associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and thus improve clinical outcomes. This was a retrospective review of patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 who received tocilizumab and completed 14 days of follow up. Twenty-five patients were included, median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50-63) and the majority were males (92%). Co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (48%), chronic kidney disease (16%), and cardiovascular disease (12%). Fever (92%), cough (84%), and dyspnea (72%) were the commonest presenting symptoms. All patients received at least two concomitant investigational antiviral agents. Median oral temperature was on day 1, 3, and 7 was 38.0C, 37.3C (P = .043), and 37.0C (P = .064), respectively. Corresponding median C-reactive protein was 193 and 7.9 mg/L (P < .0001) and <6 mg/L (P = .0001). Radiological improvement was noted in 44% of patients by day 7% and 68% by day 14.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the similarities and differences of TCM syndrome distribution in different age groups to promote the optimization of treatment strategies. Methods This study was based on a real-world survey conducted in 3 hospitals in China. There are 1262 collected cases of MS meeting the inclusion criteria, which were divided into the young group, middle-aged group, and elderly group. Factor analysis (FA) was conducted for syndrome element extraction, and K-means cluster analysis was processed for syndrome type classification. Frequency analysis and Chi-square test were used to compare the syndrome characteristics of each group. Results Common factors extracted were assigned to 18 syndrome elements including 11 nature syndrome elements and 7 location syndrome elements. Phlegm and dampness are the most frequent syndrome elements in general. Compared with the middle-aged group and elderly group, the young group has more obvious nature syndrome elements in heat and Qi deficiency, and location syndrome elements in the stomach. As for the middle-aged group, the frequency of location syndrome in kidney syndrome was higher than that in other groups. When it comes to the elderly group, it is shown that the symptoms of Yin deficiency and blood deficiency increase with age and the old patients may have more location syndrome elements in the lung and gallbladder. Conclusion The TCM syndrome of MS is complex in that there may be the characteristics of deficiency and excess syndrome simultaneously. The main pathological factors of MS were phlegm and dampness. Besides, MS patients at different age periods may have their own syndrome distribution features. So, it is reasonable to adhere to the method of resolving phlegm and removing dampness and, at the same time, adopt the ways of clearing heat, promoting Qi, nourishing Yin, supplementing blood as well as regulating the liver, promoting the lung, transporting the spleen, nourishing the heart, and nourishing the kidney based on the syndrome feature of MS in different age stages.","output":"Factor and Cluster Analysis for TCM Syndromes of Real-World Metabolic Syndrome at Different Age Stage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the planning and development of alternate care site (ACS) trainings for community COVID care delivery.

Despite the undoubted benefits, it is vigorously debated whether too much oxygen can also have unpredicted side-effects. Uncertainty is also due to the fact that the molecular mechanisms are still insufficiently understood. The lung endothelium is covered with an exceptionally broad glycocalyx, carrying N- and O-glycans, proteoglycans, glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans. Glycan structures are not genetically determined but depend on the metabolic state and the expression level and activity of biosynthetic and glycan remodeling enzymes, which can be influenced by oxygen and the redox status of the cell. Altered glycan structures can affect cell interactions and signaling. In this study, we investigated the effect of different oxygen conditions on aspects of the glycobiology of the pulmonary endothelium with an emphasis on N-glycans and terminal sialylation using an in vitro cell culture system. We combined a proteomic approach with N-glycan structure analysis by LC-MS, qRT-PCR, sialic acid analysis and lectin binding to show that constant and intermittent hyperoxia induced time dependent changes in global and surface glycosylation.

We here introduce an unsupervised clustering approach suitable for mixed data types combining the Gower distance with the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm k-Medoids. We were able to identify three clusters differing significantly in subjects well-being, psychological distress, and current financial and occupational concerns. The clusters also differed in age with younger persons reporting greater financial and occupational concerns, increased anxiety, higher psychological distress, and reduced subjective well-being. Features with the strongest impact on the clustering were examined using a wrapping method and the feature importance implemented in the random forest. Particularly, answers regarding financial and occupational concern, psychological distress, and current well-being were decisive for the assignment to a cluster.

The aim of this audit was to assess patient outcomes following epistaxis care during the initial COVID-19 peak, exploring factors relating to unscheduled re-presentations. METHODS: A UK-wide prospective multicentre national audit was performed over 12-weeks from 6th April 2020 at ENT departments treating adults with epistaxis. The primary outcome was re-presentation within 10-days. Univariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant determinants of the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: 83 centres from all four UK nations submitted 2,631 cases, the majority of which were Emergency Department (ED) referrals (89.7%). ENT clinicians used a dissolvable intranasal product in 34.7% of patients overall (n = 816/2,351), and in 61.1% of those receiving an intranasal product (n = 816/1,336). 54.6% were discharged from the ED following ENT review. The overall re-presentation rate was 19.5% for ED discharges (n = 245/1,259) and 9.9% for ED admissions (n = 104/1,046). 6.8% of ED discharges and 5.7% of ED admissions were admitted following their re-presentations (n = 86 and 60 respectively). Not being packed by ED clinicians, antiplatelet medications, failed cautery and recent epistaxis treatment were predictors of re-presentation within 10-days.

Background: Late 2019, a new highly contagious corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged in Wuhan, China, causing within two month a pandemic with the highest disease burden in elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions. The pandemic has highlighted that new and more flexible clinical trial approaches, such as trial platforms, are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of interventions in a timely manner. The two existing Swiss cohorts of immunocompromised patients (i.e. Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS)) are an ideal foundation to set-up a trial platform in Switzerland leveraging routinely collected data. Within a newly founded trial platform we plan to assess the efficacy of the first two mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that reached market authorisation in Switzerland in the frame of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) while at the same time assessing the functionality of the trial platform.? Methods: We will conduct a multicenter randomised controlled, open-label, 2-arm sub-study pilot trial of a platform trial nested into two Swiss cohorts. Patients included in the SHCS or the STCS will be eligible for randomization to either receiving the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty? (Pfizer / BioNTech) or the Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine Moderna?. The primary clinical outcome will be change in pan-lg antibody response (pan-Ig anti-S1-RBD;baseline vs. three months after first vaccination). The pilot study will also enable us to assess endpoints related to trial conduct feasibility (i.e. duration of RCT set-up;time of patient recruitment;patient consent rate;proportion of missing data). Assuming vaccine reactivity of 90% in both vaccine groups we power our trial, using a non-inferiority margin such that a 95% two-sided confidence interval excludes a difference in favour of the reference group of more than 10%.

At present, diagnosis COVID-19 were based on real-time RT-PCR, which have to be performed in biosafe laboratory and is unsatisfactory for suspect case screening. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body detection in suspected COVID-19 cases. METHODS: In the prospective cohort, 150 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang province, China, between January 20 to February 2, 2020. All patients were tested by the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for COVID-19. At least two samples of each patient were collected for RT-PCR assay analysis, and the PCR results were performed as the reference standard of diagnosis. Meanwhile 26 heathy blood donor were recruited. The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated. Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity. RESULTS: The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993].

Curcumin, a known Telomerase inhibitor was used as the standard. The front-runner compounds were screened for bioavailability, pharmacokinetic properties, and bioactivity using the SWISSADME, PKCSM, and Molinspiration webservers respectively. The molecular dynamic simulation and analyses of the apo and holo proteins were performed by the Galaxy supercomputing webserver.

The highest percentage increases were seen among Latinx individuals (49.7%; 38.8 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 58.1 per 100a?000 activations in 2020) and Black or African American individuals (50.3%; 21.5 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 32.3 per 100a?000 activations in 2020), people living in more impoverished neighborhoods (46.4%; 42.0 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 61.5 per 100a?000 activations in 2020), and the Pacific states (63.8%; 33.1 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 54.2 per 100a?000 activations in 2020), despite lower rates at baseline for these groups. The EMS records were available 6 to 12 months ahead of CDC mortality figures and showed a high concordance (r = 0.98) for months in which both data sets were available. If the historical association between EMS-observed and total overdose mortality holds true, an expected total of approximately 90a?632 (95% CI, 85a?737-95a?525) overdose deaths may eventually be reported by the CDC for 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, records from EMS agencies provided an effective manner to rapidly surveil shifts in US overdose mortality. Unprecedented overdose deaths during the pandemic necessitate investments in overdose prevention as an essential aspect of the COVID-19 response and postpandemic recovery. This is particularly urgent for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities subjected to the compounded burden of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality and rising overdose deaths.","output":"Racial/Ethnic, Social, and Geographic Trends in Overdose-Associated Cardiac Arrests Observed by US Emergency Medical Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To compare the usage of remote consultations before and after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and explore mental health workers views on the usage of telemedicine. METHOD: An online questionnaire survey was developed, and disseminated to mental healthcare professionals via e-mail and social media. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six step procedure for thematic analysis.1 RESULT: There were 40 responses from mental healthcare professionals of varying grades from different sub-specialties, predominantly from the UK. Compared to before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there was an increase in usage of telephone (9(22.5% to (29)72.5%) and video consultations (4(10%) to 17(42.5%)). Respondents reported an increase in virtual MDTs (35(87.5%) during the pandemic, 9(22.5%) pre-pandemic). Based on a 5-point Likert scale, the mean technical quality of telephone consultations was 3.56/5 (Range 2-5), with 75% rating telephone consultations as not being as good as face-to-face consultations. The mean technical quality of video consultations was 3.58/5 (Range 2-5), with 63% rating video consultations as not being as good as face-to-face consultations. 25 (62.5%) respondents felt comfortable using telephone consultations during the pandemic, 20(50%) felt comfortable using video consultations. Recurring themes identified from the qualitative data regarding reasons for the technical quality ratings were: connection issues, poor infrastructure and security concerns. Nine (23%) respondents felt that using video conferencing consultations had a detrimental impact on the mental health of patients while 14(35%) felt that telephone consultations had a detrimental impact on patients mental health. Recurring themes for health practitioners perceived effect of the use of telemedicine on patients mental heath were the loss of personal touch and reduced patient engagement. CONCLUSION: There was a substantial increase in usage of remote consultations during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among mental healthcare professionals. The results reported in the present study suggest there are numerous barriers to the use of telemedicine in psychiatry, which require future exploration, ideally through interview or ethnographic studies.","output":"Survey of remote consultations in psychiatry during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collaboration among students is fundamental for knowledge building and competency development. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of student collaboration depends on the extent that these interactions take place under conditions that favor commitment, trust, and decision-making among those who interact. The sanitary situation and the transition to remote teaching has added new challenges for collaboration given that students' interactions are mediated by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In this study we explore the effectiveness of different collaborative relationships on physics and mathematics, from a sample of secondary students from two schools located in rural and urban areas in southern Chile. We used Social Network Analysis (SNA) to map students' friendships relations, academic prestige, and collaboration on both courses. Later we combined the collaboration network with friendship and academic prestige on the course, to separate strong from weak friendship working ties, and those among students who enjoy or not academic prestige. Multiple linear regression models showed, on average, positive effects of collaboration on grades. Yet, when isolating the effects of the types of collaboration, the positive effects are observed only between those who display more strong friendship ties. Also, we found differences on the social networks and their effects over grades between both courses, presumably due to their pedagogical nature. With these results we contribute to the literature of collaboration and its effectiveness based on the nature of students' relationships, and advocate for the importance of instructional design in fostering appropriate motivations and guidelines for constructive collaboration in the classroom.","output":"Student networks on online teaching due to COVID-19: Academic effects of strong friendship ties and perceived academic prestige in physics and mathematics courses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The daily work plan of the human has changed dramatically due to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic The viral infection was first detected in Wuhan, China, and was first transmitted via the bat as a zoonotic disease that was confirmed in December 2019 On 30th January 2020, this viral outbreak was declared a public health emergency or epidemic Subsequently, on 11th February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic The potentially lethal virus has become a threat to the global population The WHO provides special precautions and instructions to people all around the world, among which the importance of wearing a face mask, gloves, and a head protector are discussed Many healthcare workers (especially doctors and nurses) and common people suffer from skin infections with the use of a continuous face mask, gloves, or other protective items In order to alleviate skin dermatitis, it is important to use well-known natural herbals in the search for new drug sources It is advisable to use useful herbal extracts in sole or in combination as cosmetic products for the treatment of skin diseases India is a focal point of medicinal plants Many Indian herbal plants are essentially used as cosmetics to cure skin infections Natural herbs are safe, non-toxic, and cost-efficient for treating skin dermatitis during the COVID-19 situation ? 2020 Iranian Society of Dermatology","output":"Application of Indian medicinal herbs for skin problems following safety measures against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The HIV-1 Gag protein playing a key role in HIV-1 viral assembly has recently been shown to interact through its nucleocapsid domain with the ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7) that acts as a cellular co-factor promoting Gag's nucleic acid (NA) chaperone activity.

Gag alone or complexed with RPL7 was found to act as a NA chaperone that destabilizes cTAR stem-loop and promotes its annealing with dTAR through the stem ends via a two-step pathway. In contrast, RPL7 alone acts as a NA annealer that through its NA aggregating properties promotes cTAR/dTAR annealing via two parallel pathways. Remarkably, in contrast to the isolated proteins, their complex promoted efficiently the annealing of cTAR with highly stable dTAR mutants.

METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was performed of 792 patients undergoing RALP. Preoperative patient variables, tumor characteristics, and perioperative variables were collected and analyzed. The first 150 patients were excluded from analysis to account for the learning curve of robotic surgery. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess factors affecting operative time (ORT). RESULTS A total of 257 and 385 patients underwent RALP utilizing the VTS and conventional insufflation, respectively. There were no significant differences in American Society of Anesthesiologist score, body mass index (BMI), prostate volume, final Gleason score, estimated blood loss, and complications between the cohorts. The only difference noted was a significantly shorter mean ORT in the VTS cohort (149.5 vs. 170.1 min, p < 0.0001). In light of this finding, further analysis was performed to identify associations with ORT. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that VTS, BMI, final Gleason score, prostate volume, surgeon, and node dissection were significantly associated with ORT. The use of the VTS decreased mean ORT by 23.2 min when controlling for confounding factors (p < 0.001). The performance of a nerve sparing operation was found to decrease ORT by 15.9 min (p < 0.001), though more often performed for lower-risk disease. CONCLUSION The use of a novel VTS demonstrated decreased ORT in patients undergoing RALP when controlling for confounding factors.

To inform planning for an influenza pandemic, we estimated US demand for N95 filtering facepiece respirators (respirators) by healthcare and emergency services personnel and need for surgical masks by pandemic patients seeking care. Methods. We used a spreadsheet-based model to estimate demand for 3 scenarios of respirator use: base case (usage approximately follows epidemic curve), intermediate demand (usage rises to epidemic peak and then remains constant), and maximum demand (all healthcare workers use respirators from pandemic onset). We assumed that in the base case scenario, up to 16 respirators would be required per day per intensive care unit patient and 8 per day per general ward patient. Outpatient healthcare workers and emergency services personnel would require 4 respirators per day. Patients would require 1.2 surgical masks per day. Results and Conclusions. Assuming that 20% to 30% of the population would become ill, 1.7 to 3.5 billion respirators would be needed in the base case scenario, 2.6 to 4.3 billion in the intermediate demand scenario, and up to 7.3 billion in the maximum demand scenario (for all scenarios, between 0.1 and 0.4 billion surgical masks would be required for patients). For pandemics with a lower attack rate and fewer cases (eg, 2009-like pandemic), the number of respirators needed would be higher because the pandemic would have longer duration. Providing these numbers of respirators and surgical masks represents a logistic challenge for US public health agencies.

We then present and discuss examples dealing with the potential of cardiac RNAi therapy. First, an approach to block a key early step in the pathogenesis of a virus-induced cardiomyopathy by RNAi targeting of a cellular receptor for cardiopathogenic viruses (Section 3). Second, an approach to improve cardiac function by RNAi targeting of late pathway of heart failure pathogenesis common to myocardial disorders of multiple etiologies. This strategy is directed at myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis which is disturbed in heart failure due to coronary heart disease, heart valve dysfunction, cardiac inflammation, or genetic defects (Section 4). Whereas the first type of strategies (directed at early pathogenesis) need to be tailor-made for each different type of pathomechanism, the second type (targeting late common pathways) has a much broader range of application. This advantage of the second type of approaches is of key importance since enormous efforts need to be undertaken before any regulatory RNA therapy enters the stage of possible clinical translation.

Here we show eosinophils migrate into the lungs of macaques and mice as early as one week after Mtb-exposure. In mice this influx was CCR3 independent and instead required cell-intrinsic expression of the oxysterol-receptor GPR183, which is highly expressed on human and macaque eosinophils.

RESULTS: Based on the available evidence at the time of guideline development (20 February, 2021), the panel makes a strong recommendation in favour of the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients requiring supplementary oxygen or ventilatory support, and for the use of anticoagulation in hospitalised patients. The panel makes a conditional recommendation for interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibody treatment and high-flow nasal oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The panel make strong recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir.

While iliac crest autograft (ICBG) is considered the gold standard in bone grafting, this carries risks of morbidity at the donor site as well as prolonging surgery time. Bone graft substitutes (BGS) may provide a viable alternative to autograft but there is little published data concerning its use in trauma. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective review to evaluate the outcomes for fusion among patients who have received a BGS during posterolateral fusion (PLF) for vertebral trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective, consecutive patient cohort. Over a six-month period, we identified 27 patients who had undergone PLF for spine trauma and in whom a BGS comprised of bovine-derived apatite was used. All patients had followed the standard of care. The postoperative plain film radiographs at three, six, 12, and (optionally) 24 months were independently assessed by an orthopedic surgeon who was not affiliated with the hospital. RESULTS We documented a radiographically observed fusion rate of 85% and a successful treatment rate of 92%. There were no adverse events related to the BGS. Patients who received a BGS with ICBG spent significantly longer in surgery than other patients. There were no adverse events related to the BGS. CONCLUSIONS The spondylodesis rate following surgery in which the BGS was used in PLF, whether alone, mixed with local bone, or mixed with ICBG is comparable to the rates that have been reported for iliac crest autograft in these indications. The data indicates that the BGS provides a useful adjunct in PLF for the treatment of traumatic spine vertebral injuries. The use of BGS also allows for shorter time in surgery, which may reduce resource utilization and thus lower the total costs of the procedure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Posterolateral fusion can be obtained with the use of a bio-derived BGS while reducing the time in surgery by avoiding the second procedure necessary to harvest ICBG. This may be advantageous in cases where the surgeon wishes to minimize operating time or when the availability of autograft is limited.","output":"Bio-Derived Apatite As a Bone Graft for Vertebral Trauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. For the prevention and treatment of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, T cell responses are important in mediating recovery and immune-protection. The identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response can be elusive. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes; however, our previous studies find that immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing SARS-CoV-2. We postulated that immunogenic epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 are best defined by directly analyzing peptides eluted from the peptide-MHC complex and then validating immunogenicity empirically by determining if such peptides can elicit T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigen-expressing cells. Using a tandem mass spectrometry approach, we identified epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 derived not only from structural but also non-structural genes in regions highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains including recently recognized variants. We report here, for the first time, several novel SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from membrane glycol-protein (MGP) and non-structure protein-13 (NSP13) defined by mass-spectrometric analysis of MHC-eluted peptides, provide empiric evidence for their immunogenicity to induce T cell response. Significance StatementCurrent state of the art uses putative epitope peptides based on in silico prediction algorithms to evaluate the T cell response among COVID-19 patients. However, none of these peptides have been tested for immunogenicity, i.e. the ability to elicit a T cell response capable of recognizing endogenously presented peptide. In this study, we used MHC immune-precipitation, acid elution and tandem mass spectrometry to define the SARS-CoV-2 immunopeptidome for membrane glycol-protein and the non-structural protein. Furthermore, taking advantage of a highly robust endogenous T cell (ETC) workflow, we verify the immunogenicity of these MS-defined peptides by in vitro generation of MGP and NSP13 peptide-specific T cells and confirm T cell recognition of MGP or NSP13 endogenously expressing cell lines.","output":"Immunogenic SARS-CoV2 Epitopes Defined by Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Study Aim In distance education, students' attitudes towards this method gain importance in the process. The aim of this research is to examine the impact of coronavirus anxiety, academic self-sufficiency and life satisfaction levels of students in the faculty of sports sciences over their attitudes towards online learning. Material and Methods A total of 379 sports science faculty students voluntarily participated for the cross-sectional data collection. A simple random sampling method was used in the selection of students from four universities in the Eastern Anatolian region, which make up the universe of the study. Data were collected electronically and analysed by IBM SPSS and AMOS statistical package program. Results: The structural equity model results revealed that academic self-sufficiency and life satisfaction are positive predictors of online learning attitudes and negative predictors of coronavirus anxiety. Online learning attitude was found to be positively correlated with other variables other than coronavirus anxiety. In addition, it has been determined that the scale total scores are slightly above average, except for coronavirus anxiety. Conclusions: The results have been discussed in terms of their meaning for the environment of physical education. In this research, which created a model for understanding online learning attitudes in students of the faculty of sports sciences, it was understood that coronavirus anxiety has a statistically significant effect on online learning attitudes while academic self-sufficiency and life satisfaction do not have a statistically significant effect. Students' positive attitude towards online learning and understanding the predictors of this attitude will be a development to be appreciated by all stakeholders of the subject.","output":"Examination of sports science faculty students' attitudes towards online learning by different variables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation, school/child care closures and employment instability have created unprecedented conditions for families raising children at home. This study describes the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on families with children in Canada. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This descriptive study used a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of adults living in Canada (n=3000) to examine the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes among parents with children <18 years old living at home (n=618) were compared with the rest of the sample. Data were collected via an online survey between 14 May to 29 May 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported on changes to their mental health since the onset of the pandemic and sources of stress, emotional responses, substance use patterns and suicidality/self-harm. Additionally, parents identified changes in their interactions with their children, impacts on their childrens mental health and sources of support accessed. RESULTS: 44.3% of parents with children <18 years living at home reported worse mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 35.6% of respondents without children <18 living at home, (2) (1, n=3000)=16.2, p<0.001. More parents compared with the rest of the sample reported increased alcohol consumption (27.7% vs 16.1%, (2) (1, n=3000)=43.8, p<0.001), suicidal thoughts/feelings (8.3% vs 5.2%, (2) (1, n=3000)=8.0, p=0.005) and stress about being safe from physical/emotional domestic violence (11.5% vs 7.9%, (2) (1, n=3000)=8.1, p=0.005). 24.8% (95% CI 21.4 to 28.4) of parents reported their childrens mental health had worsened since the pandemic. Parents also reported more frequent negative as well as positive interactions with their children due to the pandemic (eg, more conflicts, 22.2% (95% CI 19.0 to 25.7); increased feelings of closeness, 49.7% (95% CI 45.7 to 53.7)). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies that families with children <18 at home have experienced deteriorated mental health due to the pandemic. Population-level responses are required to adequately respond to families diverse needs and mitigate the potential for widening health and social inequities for parents and children.","output":"Examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family mental health in Canada: findings from a national cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D deficiency co-exists in patients with COVID-19. At this time, dark skin color, increased age, the presence of pre-existing illnesses and vitamin D deficiency are features of severe COVID disease. Of these, only vitamin D deficiency is modifiable. Through its interactions with a multitude of cells, vitamin D may have several ways to reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infections and COVID-19: reducing the survival and replication of viruses, reducing risk of inflammatory cytokine production, increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 concentrations, and maintaining endothelial integrity. Fourteen observational studies offer evidence that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. The evidence to date generally satisfies Hills criteria for causality in a biological system, namely, strength of association, consistency, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility (e.g., mechanisms), and coherence, although experimental verification is lacking. Thus, the evidence seems strong enough that people and physicians can use or recommend vitamin D supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19 in light of their safety and wide therapeutic window.

Several studies around the world have detected an uneven behaviour in tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations. In this work, Seville (Spain) is used as example of faced to traffic place in which the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is drastically reduced (41%) while O3 has no significant changes. In order to evaluate the existence of differences in O3 behaviour that is not detected by statistical procedures, a multifractal approach was used to assess the coupled scale relationship between NO2 and O3 during the 2020 lockdown against a period reference (2017C2019). For this purpose, the two main coupled multifractal method were employed: multifractal detrended cross-correlation and joint multifractal analysis. While cross-correlation analysis did not detect differences between the cross-correlated fluctuations of NO2 and O3 in the periods analysed, the joint multifractal analysis, based on the partition function and the method of moments, found a loss of variability in O3 during the lockdown. This leads to a loss of multifractal characteristic of O3 time series. The drastically reduction of primary pollutants during the lockdown might be the responsible of the tendency to monofractality in O3 time series.

Preliminary evidence suggests that this variability negatively affects people who stutter and that stuttering behaviors are more variable than adverse impact associated with stuttering. More information is needed to determine how variability affects people who stutter and what the clinical and research implications of variability may be. Method Two hundred and four adults who stutter participated in a mixed-methods study exploring (a) how variability of stuttering affects people who stutter in comparison to other aspects of the condition and (b) which aspects of the overall experience of stuttering are variable. Results Analyses indicated that variability is very commonly experienced by people who stutter and that it is among the most frustrating aspects of the condition. Qualitative analyses revealed that variability is experienced in all aspects of the stuttering condition, including the observable behavior other affective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions; and the adverse impact of stuttering. Notable individual differences were found in terms of which specific aspects of the condition were more variable for different respondents. Overall, analyses revealed that the variability of different aspects of stuttering can be viewed in a hierarchy from most variable to least variable: more external aspects (e.g., frequency, duration), more internal aspects (e.g., covert behaviors, physical tension), and cognitive-affective experiences (e.g., negative thoughts, feelings, and self-image).

Adults (N = 3686) completed an online survey with a behavioural measure of delay discounting and questions regarding stress, physical distancing, and stockpiling of food and supplies. Stress was weakly, but positively, correlated with delay discounting (p < 0.01). Delay discounting was positively correlated with stockpiling (p < 0.01); and discounting was negatively correlated with physical distancing (p < 0.01). Mediation models indicated that discounting was a significant mediator of the relationship between stress and physical distancing (-0.003) and stockpiling (0.003); bootstrap 95% CIs (-0.006, -0.001) and (0.001, 0.005), respectively. After accounting for its indirect effects through discounting, stress continued to have a direct effect on these outcomes.

Despite these advances, women living with HIV still face complex medical and psychosocial issues during pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to describe experiences of pregnancy and the relevance of social support among women living with HIV in Nordic countries. METHODS: This qualitative study examined data from pregnant women living with HIV from sites in Denmark, Sweden and Finland from 2019 to 2020. Data were collected in the third trimester via individual interviews using a hybrid, narrative/semistructured format. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using narrative thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 31 women living with HIV were enrolled, of whom 61% originated from an African country and 29% from a Nordic country. The analysis generated four primary narrative themes: just a normal pregnancy, unique considerations and concerns, interactions with healthcare, and social support. Women living with HIV have a strong desire to have normal pregnancies and to be treated like any other pregnant woman. However, this normality is fragile, and being pregnant and living with HIV does come with unique considerations and concerns, such as fear of transmission, antiretroviral therapy, and the need for specialized care, which are fundamental to the womens experiences. Interactions with healthcare providers and social support influence their experiences in both positive and negative ways. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize a sense of normality in pregnancy among women living with HIV. However, pregnancy does come with unique considerations and concerns, which highly influence the womens experience of pregnancy. Healthcare providers should focus on person-centered care, ensuring continuity and that women living with HIV do not feel discriminated against throughout their pregnancy.","output":"The experience of pregnancy among women living with HIV in Nordic countries: A qualitative narrative enquiry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2008, a series of mega-mergers has dramatically changed the U.S. airline industry. Despite the presence of fewer airlines in the market, the competition remains intense, which forces airlines to continually search for ways to increase their efficiency to maintain survival and financial sustainability. To evaluate airline performance and disentangle the causes of inefficiency, this paper applied a two-stage network data envelopment analysis approach and a truncated regression to investigate the performance of nine U.S.-based airlines from 2015 to 2019. Our empirical results reveal that during the sample period, airlines operating efficiency steadily improved, but the efficiency in the profitability stage stagnated. Therefore, strategic resource allocations are needed for airlines to see further advances in their overall efficiency. On average, airlines operating in the low-cost business model yielded higher efficiency scores than their peers operating in the full-service framework. While an airlines size, measured in terms of total assets, has a positive influence on operating efficiency, a larger number of full-time employee equivalents hinders efficiency outcomes, which indicates the importance of enhancing labor efficiency among carriers.","output":"An Evaluation of the Operational Performance and Profitability of the U.S. Airlines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta has been identified as the main contributor of mortality in salmon in the Klamath River, California. The life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the disease it is important to predict the impact of environmental scenarios on spore concentration and infection prevalence. Here, we introduce a model based on partial differential equations to study the spore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. The analysis of the model shows that for current climate conditions, additional dam release can reduce the actinospore concentration up to 48% and the prevalence up to 40% thus providing a potential disease management option. However, the infection risk is likely to increase for future climate conditions by 10C54% and this will lead to an infection level comparable to that of a recent high-disease year. Our simulations show that dam removal cannot be assumed to mitigate the effect of climate change or to have influence on infection prevalence. We show that our detailed model system can be reduced to a simpler exponential dose-response function, which predicts infection levels based on transmission rates, travel time and mean spore concentration, quantities that can be measured in-situ or given empirically. The dose-response function may therefore be a useful tool in disease management.","output":"Fish disease dynamics in changing rivers: Salmonid Ceratomyxosis in the Klamath River"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic situation it triggered panic attacks one of which is against students.

This study aimed to identify the delaying factors in door-to-needle time (DTN) in the emergency department of one of the largest comprehensive stroke centers in New York State. We also recommended measures to reduce the delays. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all AIS patients who received IVT in our emergency department patients between April 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 to identify those with a DTN time of >60min. We categorized the factors causing the delay into different groups. For each group, we recommended measures to reduce the treatment delays. RESULTS A total of 487 patients received IVT for AIS during the 3.7-year period. Of these, 96 patients (20.4%) met our DTN time delay criteria. Delays for obtaining stroke imaging and hypertension control were the most common factors. Thirty eight patients (39.5%) had delay in obtaining CT-based stroke imaging. Twenty-two patients (22.9%) required control of elevated blood pressure prior to IVT. Other causes for delay in DTN time included delay in stroke triage and paging (11.4%), fluctuating neurological symptoms (7.2%), uncertainty about diagnosis (12.5%), delays associated with obtaining consent (9.3%), and uncertainty about the time of symptom onset (5.2%). CONCLUSION Important and common causes of delay in IVT for AIS were identified in a review of charts at our comprehensive stroke center. The authors recommend strategies to achieve faster DTN time for each of the delaying factor categories including faster acquisition and interpretation of stroke imaging, more effective triage protocols and faster blood pressure control for AIS patients who are eligible for IVT.","output":"Delays in door-to-needle time for acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department: A comprehensive stroke center experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Whether race/ethnicity plays a role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) mobilization in autologous donors has not been studied. We hypothesize that donor characteristic including race/ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic groups influences HSPC mobilization. Diagnostic groups include healthy allogeneic donors, autologous multiple myeloma (MM) and non-MM donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we conducted a single-center retrospective study in 64 autologous patients and 48 allogeneic donors. Autologous donors were patients diagnosed with MM or non-MM. All donors were grouped as African American (AA), White (W), or \\"Other\\"(O). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated diagnostic group differences for CD34+ cell yields between race/ethnicity. Specifically, non-MM patients had the lowest CD34+ cell yields in AA and O, but not in W. For pre-apheresis peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell numbers, race/ethnicity had a significant effect both in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Non-MM patients had the lowest, and AA patients had the highest PB CD34+ cells. The results support the view that past therapies used in MM are likely more conducive of recovery of HSPC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that race/ethnicity and diagnostic group differences influenced CD34+ cell mobilization response across donor types. Interestingly, autologous MM donors with the aid of plerixafor displayed comparable CD34 yields to allogeneic donors. Even though both MM and non-MM donors received plerixafor, non-MM donors had significantly lower CD34 yields among AA and O donors but not in W donors.

Health-related human rights have evolved dramatically over the past thirty years to offer a normative framework for justice in preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. Where human rights were long neglected in international health debates, the advent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic response would operationalise human rights for public health, as advocates looked explicitly to human rights in framing public health efforts. In this period of heightened fear and emerging advocacy, policymakers first sought to implement human rights law in public health lawviewing discrimination as counterproductive to public health goals, abandoning coercive tools of public health, and applying human rights to focus on the individual risk behaviours leading to HIV transmission. By finding a link between public health and human rights, the health and human rights movement could move away from its early focus on the conflicts between public health goals and individual human rights, employing human rights to advance public health.

Accurate estimates of future forest productivity are crucial to predict the carbon sequestration and wood provision potential of forests. Since long, forest managers have used empirical yield tables as a cost-effective and reliable way to predict forest growth. However, recent climate change-induced growth shifts raised doubts about the long-term validity of these yield tables. In this study, we propose a methodology to improve available yield tables of 11 tree species in the Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium. The methodology uses scaling functions derived from climate-sensitive process-based modelling (PBM) that reflect state-of-the-art projections of future growth trends. Combining PBM and stand information from the empirical yield tables for the region of Flanders, we found that for the period 1987-2016 stand productivity has on average increased by 13% compared to 1961-1990. Furthermore, simulations indicate that this positive growth trend is most likely to persist in the coming decades, for all considered species, climate or site conditions. Nonetheless, results showed that local site variability is equally important to consider as the in- or exclusion of the CO2 fertilization effect or different climate projections, when assessing the magnitude of forests' response to climate change. Our projections suggest that incorporating these climate change-related productivity changes lead to a 7% increase in standing stock and a 22% increase in sustainably potentially harvestable woody biomass by 2050.

The predicted adsorption capacity of DOX was found to be 291.14 mg g(?1) under optimalizing experimental conditions of 196 min contact time, 0.2 g L(?1) adsorbent dosage and pH 5.78. The adsorption experimental data fitted Langmuir, Koble-Corrigan and Redlich-Peterson models well, and the pseudo-second-order model perfectly described the DOX adsorption process onto NPC. Thermodynamic parameters of DOX adsorbed onto NPC indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. Moreover, the adsorption of DOX on NPC was mostly controlled by electrostatic interaction, - electronCdonatorCacceptor (EDA) interaction, hydrogen-bonding and Lewis acidCbase effect.

The resulting dataset comprised of 8354 tweets. Images were classified as (i) images with text (ii) radiological content (e.g., CT scan snapshots, X-ray images), and (iii) non-medical content like personal images or memes. We trained our deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on training dataset of 1040 labeled images drawn from all three classes. We then trained another DL classifier for segmenting images into categories based on human anatomy. All software used is open-source and adapted for this research. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was assessed by comparing results on a test set of 1885 images. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that in COVID-19 related tweets on radiology, nearly 32% had textual images, another 24% had radiological content, and 44% were not of radiological significance. Our results indicated a 92% accuracy in classifying images originally labeled as chest X-ray or chest CT and a nearly 99% accurate classification of images containing medically relevant text.

In February and March 2020, eight participants received a 3D printed transtibial prosthesis in the village of Masanga in Tonkolili district, Sierra Leone. Research was performed using questionnaires to investigate the use, participants satisfaction, and possible complications related to the prostheses. Questionnaires were conducted prior to production of the prosthesis and five to six weeks after fitting the prosthesis. A personal short-term goal was set by the participants. FINDINGS: Competitively priced and fully functional prostheses were produced locally. After six weeks, all participants were still wearing the prosthesis and six of the eight participants reached their personal rehabilitation goals. Using their prostheses, all participants were no longer in need of their crutches. INTERPRETATION: We have come a step closer to the production of low-cost prostheses for low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The goal of our project is to perform long-term follow-up and to refine our concept of 3D printed prostheses for LMICs to provide practical solutions for a global health need unmet to date.

While evaluating safety in the long term is important to determine if delayed adverse events occur affecting late morbidity and mortality, the most important point to evaluate is the long-term stability of aneurysm occlusion. The current analysis reports the 3-year clinical and anatomical results of WEB treatment in the combined population of two European trials (WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm Therapy) and WEBCAST-2). METHODS Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated using a 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The safety population comprised 79 patients. The efficacy population comprised 61 aneurysms. Aneurysm locations were middle cerebral artery in 32/61 aneurysms (52.5%), anterior communicating artery in 13/61 (21.3%), basilar artery in 9/61 (14.8%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 7/61 (11.5%). No adverse events related to the device or procedure occurred between 2 and 3 years. At 3 years, complete occlusion was observed in 31/61 (50.8%) aneurysms, neck remnant in 20/61 (32.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 10/61 (16.4%). Between 1 year and 3 years, aneurysm occlusion was improved or stable in 53/61 (86.9%) aneurysms and worsened in 8/61 (13.1%). Worsening was mostly from complete occlusion to neck remnant in 6/61 (9.8%) aneurysms. The retreatment rate at 3 years was 11.4%. CONCLUSIONS This analysis confirms the high safety profile of WEB. Moreover, evidence demonstrates the great stability of aneurysm occlusion with adequate occlusion (complete occlusion or neck remnant) in 83.6% of aneurysms.

To answer this, based on the spatial Durbin model, this study empirically examines the impact of regional corruption on carbon emission, using panel data from 30 provinces in China during the period 2002C2017. The results show that: (1) there is an indistinctive N-shaped relationship between regional corruption and carbon emissions at the national level. Regional corruption tends to initially aggravate carbon emissions, then contributes to emission reduction, and then finally boosts carbon emissions. However, this effect is not statistically significant. The results suggest that the role of regional corruption on carbon emissions is twofold. Corruption can exacerbate and can also inhibit regional carbon emissions. (2) Pronounced regional heterogeneity exists with regard to the influence of corruption on carbon emissions. Regional corruption and carbon emissions show a significant N-shaped dynamic relationship in Chinas central region, while the relationship is not significant in the eastern and western regions. (3) The impact of regional corruption on carbon emissions varies with time. For 2002C2009, regional corruption did not have a significant effect on carbon emissions. For 2010C2017, the direct effect became significant, and an apparent N-shaped relationship formed between regional corruption and carbon emissions.

(2012) Comparing the use of, and considering the need for, lumbar puncture in children with influenza or other respiratory virus infections. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses DOI:10.1111/irv.12039. Background The clinical presentation of influenza in infancy may be similar to serious bacterial infection and be investigated with invasive procedures like lumbar puncture (LP), despite very limited evidence that influenza occurs concomitantly with bacterial meningitis, perhaps because the diagnosis of influenza is very often not established when the decision to perform LP is being considered. Methods A retrospective medical record review was undertaken in all children presenting to the Childrens Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia, in one winter season with laboratory\\\\confirmed influenza or other respiratory virus infections (ORVIs) but excluding respiratory syncytial virus, to compare the use of, and reflect on the need for, the performance of invasive diagnostic procedures, principally LP, but also blood culture, in influenza and non\\\\influenza cases. We also determined the rate of concomitant bacterial meningitis or bacteraemia. Findings Of 294 children, 51% had laboratory\\\\confirmed influenza and 49% had ORVIs such as parainfluenza viruses (34%) and adenoviruses (15%). Of those with influenza, 18% had a LP and 71% had a blood culture performed compared with 63% and 555% in the ORVI group (for both P < 001). In multivariate analysis, diagnosis of influenza was a strong independent predictor of both LP (P = 002) and blood culture (P = 005) being performed, and, in comparison with ORVIs, influenza cases were almost three times more likely to have a LP performed on presentation to hospital. One child with influenza (09%) had bacteraemia and none had meningitis. Interpretation Children with influenza were more likely to undergo LP on presentation to hospital compared with those presenting with ORVIs. If influenza is confirmed on admission by near\\\\patient testing, clinicians may be reassured and less inclined to perform LP, although if meningitis is clinically suspected, the clinician should act accordingly. We found that the risk of bacterial meningitis and bacteraemia was very low in hospitalised children with influenza and ORVIs.

Bringing the crises under control means providing the world population with accessible and impactful new therapeutics. We screened a natural product library that contains a unique collection of 2370 natural products into the binding site of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (M pro ). According to the docking score and to the interaction at the active site, three phenylethanoid glycosides (forsythiaside A, isoacteoside and verbascoside) were selected. In order to provide better insight into the atomistic interaction and test the impact of the three selected compounds at the binding site, we resorted to a half microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation. As a result, we are showing that forsythiaside A is the most stable molecule and it is likely to possess the highest inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Phenylethanoid glycosides also have been reported to have both protease and kinase activity.

The lack of an efficient pharmacological treatments are serious problems to be faced by scientists and medical staffs worldwide. In this work, an in silico approach based on the combination of molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and quantum biochemistry revealed that the synthetic peptides RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA, strongly interact with the main protease (Mpro) a pivotal protein for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Although not binding to the proteolytic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA interact with other protein domain and allosterically altered the protease topology. Indeed, such peptide-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes provoked dramatic alterations in the three-dimensional structure of Mpro leading to area and volume shrinkage of the proteolytic site, which could affect the protease activity and thus the virus replication. Based on these findings, it is suggested that RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA could interfere with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro role in vivo. Also, unlike other antiviral drugs, these peptides have no toxicity to human cells.

PEGylation improves solubility, circulation time, and reduces immunogenicity of therapeutic molecules. Currently, there are 21 PEGylated drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more in the developmental stage. In addition to the polymers applications in the clinic, PEG is widely used as a solvent and emulsifying agent in the formulation of cosmetics, cleaning, and personal care products. Due to the ubiquitous presence of the polymer in everyday products, patients can develop antibodies against PEG (PEG Abs) that can be problematic when a PEGylated drug is administered. These PEG Abs can provoke hypersensitivity reactions, accelerated drug clearance, and decreased therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we review how the prevalence of PEG in everyday products has induced PEG Abs within the general public as well as the effect of these Abs on the performance of PEGylated therapeutics. We will focus on clinical manifestations following the administration of PEGylated drugs. LAY SUMMARY: Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a polymer found in products including cosmetics, personal care products, cleaning agents, medicine, and food. Due to the prevalence of PEG, people can develop antibodies (PEG Abs) against the polymer, which recognize PEG as foreign. Of note, PEG is frequently incorporated into drug formulations to improve therapeutic efficacy. Complications can arise when a patient receiving a PEGylated drug has previously developed PEG Abs from interactions with PEG in everyday products. The presence of high concentrations of PEG Abs in blood can result in decreased treatment efficacy and allergic reactions to a wide range of therapeutics.","output":"Clinical Relevance of Pre-Existing and Treatment-Induced Anti-Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Despite worldwide case reports, including Brazilian cases, no frequency study on infection of pets by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been conducted to date in Brazil. Accordingly, the present study was aimed to assess dogs and cats belonging to positive owners in Recife, Northeastern Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal prospective study on dogs and cats in the city of Recife whose owners were in isolation at home due to a confirmed laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Oral and rectal swabs from the pets were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA by means of RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Among the pets tested, 0/16 dogs and 2/15 cats were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the two positive cats were owned by two unrelated asymptomatic veterinary students, which, therefore, post a warning to veterinarians worldwide. CONCLUSION: The findings herein indicate that cats may act as sentinels for human cases, particularly sharing households with asymptomatic human cases. Although with small sampling and convenient recruiting, the presence of infected cats by SARS-CoV-2 was most likely due to close cat-human contact with positive owners, posting a human-animal health threat when pets share the same bed and interact with owners without protection, particularly during owner self-isolation.

This strategy for the design of such inhibitors, in particular boron-based inhibitors, holds great promise for the vast family of -lactamases produced, inter alia, by Gram-negative antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the description of covalent docking processes requires a quantum-mechanical approach, and so far, only a few studies of this type have been presented. This study accurately describes the covalent docking process between two model inhibitors - representing two large families of inhibitors based on boronic-acid and bicyclic boronate scaffolds, and three -lactamases which belong to the A, C, and D classes. Molecular fragments containing boron can be converted from a neutral, trigonal, planar state with sp(2) hybridization to the anionic, tetrahedral sp(3) state in a process sometimes referred to as morphing. This study applies multi-scale modeling methods, in particular, the hybrid QM/MM approach which has predictive power reaching well beyond conventional molecular modeling. Time-dependent QM/MM simulations indicated several structural changes and geometric preferences, ultimately leading to covalent docking processes. With current computing technologies, this approach is not computationally expensive, can be used in standard molecular modeling and molecular design works, and can effectively support experimental research which should allow for a detailed understanding of complex processes important to molecular medicine. In particular, it can support the rational design of covalent boron-based inhibitors for -lactamases as well as for many other enzyme systems of clinical relevance, including SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","output":"Exploring Covalent Docking Mechanisms of Boron-Based Inhibitors to Class A, C and D -Lactamases Using Time-dependent Hybrid QM/MM Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Judgment and decision making (JDM) research in accounting focuses on the judgments and decisions of preparers, users and auditors/assurance providers of financial and non-financial information, including sustainability information.

The first Italian cases occurred in February 2020: since then, there has been an exponential increase in new cases, hospitalizations and intensive care assistance demand. This new and sudden scenario led to a forced National Health System reorganization and review of welfare priorities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of this pandemic on ordinary activities in two plastic surgery divisions in Rome, hosted in a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 hospital. METHODS: The data of this comparative retrospective study was collected between 9 March and 9 April 2019 and the same period of 2020 from two plastic surgery units, one in a COVID-19 hospital and second in a non-COVID-19 hospital in Rome, Italy. The 2019C2020 data of the two hospitals was compared regarding the number of surgeries, post-operative dressings and first consultations performed. RESULTS: Both units sustained a decrease in workload due to lockdown effects. Statistically significant differences for day surgery procedures (p value = 0.0047) and first consultations (p value < 0.0001) were found between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 institutes, with a drastic trend limiting non-urgent access to COVID-19 hospitals.

The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.","output":"Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the early stages of an epidemic: a modelling study in Hubei, China and northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic can impact mental health, triggering symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19 in students from a campus of the Federal Institute in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre/RS. A correlational and exploratory study was performed. The sample of the present research was composed by 208 students, who responded to a self-administered online questionnaire with sociodemographic variables and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale Short Form C DASS-21. The detected prevalence of symptoms classified as moderate-severe was 49% for stress, 39% for depression and 33% for anxiety. An association was found between higher levels of anxiety symptoms (OR = 5.652; 95% CI = 2.872C11.123; p < 0.001), depression (OR = 3.289; 95% CI = 1.810C5.978; p < 0.001) and stress (OR = 5.684; 95% CI = 3.120C10.355; p < 0.001) with occurrence of sleep problems during the period of social distancing.

Methods Children aged 11?12 years and their mothers participating in a UK population-based birth cohort (Wirral Child Health and Development Study) provided mental health data between December 2019 and March 2020, and again 3 months after lockdown, 89% (N = 202) of 226 assessed pre-COVID-19. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed by self- and maternal reports, and long-term vulnerability by maternal report of prior child adjustment, and maternal prenatal depression. Results The young adolescents reported a 44% (95% confidence interval [CI: 23%?65%]) increase in symptoms of depression and 26% (95% CI [12%?40%]) for post-traumatic stress disorder, with corresponding maternal reports of child symptoms of 71% (95% CI [44%?99%]) and 43% (95% CI 29%?86%). Disruptive behaviour problem symptoms increased by 76% (95% CI [43%?109%]) particularly in children without previous externalising symptoms. Both female gender and having had high internalising symptoms earlier in childhood were associated with elevated rates of depression pre-pandemic, and with greater absolute increases during COVID-19. Mothers' own depression symptoms increased by 42% (95% CI [20%?65%]), and this change was greater among mothers who had prenatal depression. No change in anxiety was observed among children or mothers. None of these increases were moderated by COVID-19-related experiences such as frontline worker status of a parent. Prior to the pandemic, rates of maternal and child depression were greater in families experiencing higher deprivation, but changed only in less deprived families, raising their rates to those of the high deprivation group. Conclusions COVID-19 has led to a marked increase in mental health problems in young adolescents and their mothers with concomitant requirements for mental health services to have the resources to adapt to meet the level and nature of the needs.","output":"Interplay between long-term vulnerability and new risk: Young adolescent and maternal mental health immediately before and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review presents up-to-date information on the effects of microbiota on the individual chemotherapy sensitivity in cancer treatment Recent studies have shown that a fine balance between the intestinal microbiota and the immune system is crucial for maintaining an efficacy of cancer chemotherapy A number of antitumor drugs have complex mechanisms of action involving not only direct effects but also the activity of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system A unique combination of these factors contributes to the individual chemotherapy sensitivity","output":"Human microbiota and effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COVID-19 pandemic, patients who are older and residents of long term care facilities (LTCF) are at greatest risk of worse clinical outcomes.

METHODS: A total of 136 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Patients were grouped according to the presence of hypertension and BPV. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. was analyzed, and BPV was calculated as the coefficient of variation of MAP (MAPCV). High BPV was defined as MAPCV values above the median. We compared the age, level of C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), creatinine and in-hospital mortality and investigated the relationship among the groups. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were older (70  12 vs. 53  17 years; P < 0.001), had higher levels of CRP (9.4  9.2 vs. 5.3  8.2 mg/dL; P = 0.009), MAPCV (11.4  4.8 vs. 8.9  3.2; P = 0.002), and higher in-hospital mortality (19.6% vs. 5.9%; P = 0.013) than those without hypertension. There was a proportional relationship between BPV and age, levels of CRP, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, creatinine and in-hospital mortality (all, P < 0.05). In Cox regression analysis, advanced age [&#8805;80 years, hazard ratio (HR) 10.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.264-47.772, P = 0.003] and higher MAPCV (HR 1.617, 95% CI, 1.281-2.040, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: High BPV in COVID-19 patients with hypertension is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Advanced age and systemic inflammation are proportional to high BPV.

This resulted in an unprecedented surge of experimental and computational data and publications, which often translated their findings in the form of databases (DBs) and tools. Over 160 such DBs and more than 80 software tools were developed, which are uncharacterized, unannotated, deployed at different universal resource locators and are challenging to reach out through a normal web search.

Especially in times of social isolation and governmental restrictions, mental health should not be neglected. Innovative approaches are required to support psychologically burdened people. The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' has been developed to offer manualised and evidence-based psychotherapeutic support adapted to COVID-19-related issues in order to overcome psychological distress. In our study, we aim to assess the efficacy of the e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms as well as improving self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, we want to evaluate the programme's usability, feasibility and participants' satisfaction with 'CoPE It' (tertiary outcome). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' consists of four 30 min modules, conducted every other day, involving psychotherapeutic techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The widely applied and previously established content has been adapted to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by experts in psychosomatic medicine and stress prevention. In our longitudinal study, adult participants-with adequate German language and computer skills, and who have provided informed consent-will be recruited via emergency support hotlines in Germany. Flyers will be distributed, and online channels will be used. Participants will complete a baseline assessment (T0), a postintervention assessment (T1) and assessments 1 and 3 months later (T2 and T3, respectively). We will perform repeated measures analysis of covariance, mixed linear models, standard analyses of variance and regression, and correlation coefficients.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a 3D airway model for prediction of the correct ETT size, and compare the results with a conventional age-based formula in pediatric patients. Methods Thirty five pediatric patients under 6 years of age who were scheduled for congenital heart surgery. In the pre-anaesthetic period, the patient's computed tomography (CT) images were converted to STL (Standard Triangle Language) files using the 3D conversion program. An FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) type 3D printer was used to print 3D airway models from the sub-glottis to the upper carina.

Differential considerations for diseases involving primarily the perinephric space differ from those arising from the kidney itself, show variant imaging features, and require identification and characterisation by interpreting radiologists-an imaging diagnosis can be suggested in many cases. Lymphangiomas are congenital cystic lesions that may contain lipid-laden chyle, which may be detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Retroperitoneal fibrosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and lymphoma may present as a perinephric soft tissue rind. Osseous findings favour Erdheim-Chester, ureteric obstruction favours retroperitoneal fibrosis, and associated lymphadenopathy with mass-effect, but without invasion of adjacent structures favours lymphoma. Extramedullary haematopoiesis and brown fat stimulation are both characterised by signal drop on opposed-phase T1-weighted (W) images, the former resulting from severe anaemia and the latter in the context of elevated serum catecholamines, especially in the setting of phaeochromocytoma. Liposarcoma is the most common primary sarcoma of the retroperitoneum. Metastases are uncommon; however, they can be seen in melanoma, among other primary malignancies.

They work maintaining muscular imbalance and asymmetrical positions for a long time. The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence and the factors associated to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) among Italian dental professionals and the most affected body regions. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between March 2019 and February 2020. The Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire (NMQ) was implemented with questions related to working habits (dental occupation, working hours per week and per days, years of work) and lifestyle (practiced physical activity, including frequency and duration, mobilization activities, and knowledge of ergonomic guidelines) was used. The-chi square test was carried out to detect any statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Logistic regression was carried out to detect the most significant factors associated to WMSD occurrence. A total of 284 questionnaires have been used for the analysis. A high proportion of dental professionals (84.6%) were affected by WMSD in the last 12 months. A higher prevalence was found in females (87%) when compared to males (80%). The prevalence of WMSD was correlated to the working hours/day and hour/week, with a higher risk for operators working >5 h/day and >30 h/week. In addition, a high prevalence was found in operators working for 2C5 years after graduation. Most of the surveyed dental professionals practiced physical activity (70.1%) but only a few had satisfactorily knowledge of ergonomic guidelines (12.7%). Interestingly, participants who practiced yoga or stretching as physical activities demonstrated lower WMSD (77%) when compared to other physical activities (84%). We can highlight that generic physical activities have no functional effect on WMSD for dental professionals. The most affected body areas were neck (59.9%), shoulders (43.3%), lumbar region (52.1%), dorsal region (37.7%) and wrists (30.6%). Considering the magnitude of the problem, there is an urgent need to implement the education in ergonomics among dental professionals, that may be achieved by teaching biomechanics, posturology and integrative functional therapies (such as yoga) during the university education and by promoting holistic health of dental operators.","output":"Musculoskeletal Disorders among Italian Dentists and Dental Hygienists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reimbursement structure was relaxed to aid in the rapid adoption nationally of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to limited access to internet service, cellular phone data, and appropriate devices, many patients may be excluded from telemedicine services. Methods: In this study, we present the findings of a survey of patients at an urban primary care clinic regarding their access to the tools needed for telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients provided information about their access to internet services, phone and data plans, and their perceived access to and interest in telemedicine. The survey was conducted in 2019 and then again in September of 2020 after expansion of telemedicine services. Results: In 2019, 168 patients were surveyed; and in 2020, 99 patients participated. In both surveys, 30% of respondents had limited phone data, no data, or no phone at all. In 2019, the patient responses showed a statistically significant difference in phone plan types between patients with different insurance plans (p < 0.10), with a higher proportion (39%) of patients with Medicaid or Medicaid waiver having a prepaid phone or no phone at all compared with patients with commercial insurance (26%). The overall awareness rate increased from 17% to 43% in the 2020 survey. Conclusions: This survey illustrated that not all patients had access to devices, cellular data, and internet service, which are all needed to conduct telemedicine. In this survey, patients with Medicaid or Medicaid waiver insurance were less likely to have these tools than those with a commercial payor. Finally, patients' access to these telemedicine tools correlated with their interest in using telemedicine visits. Providing equitable telemedicine care requires attention to and mitigation strategies for these gaps in access.","output":"Health Care Disparities and Access to Video Visits Before and After the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a Patient Survey in Primary Care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates time-sensitive policy and implementation decisions regarding new therapies in the face of uncertainty. The aim of this study was to quantify consequences of approving therapies or pursuing further research: either immediate approval, use only in research, approval with research (e.g., Emergency Use Authorization), or reject. Methods: Using a cohort state-transition model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs associated with the following interventions: Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Casirivimab-Imdevimab, Dexamethasone, Baricitinib-Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, and Interferon beta-1a, and usual care. We used the model outcomes to conduct cost-effectiveness and value of information analyses from a US healthcare perspective and a lifetime horizon. Results: Assuming a $100,000-per-QALY willingness-to-pay-threshold, only Remdesivir, Casirivimab-Imdevimab, Dexamethasone, Baricitinib-Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were (cost-) effective (incremental net health benefit 0.252, 0.164, 0.545, 0.668 and 0.524 QALYs and incremental net monetary benefit $25,249, $16,375, $54,526, $66,826 and $52,378). Our value of information analyses suggest that most value can be obtained if these 5 therapies are approved for immediate use rather than requiring additional RCTs (net value $20.6 Billion, $13.4 Billion, $7.4 Billion, $54.6 Billion and $7.1 Billion); Hydroxychloroquine (net value $198 Million) only used in further RCTs if seeking to demonstrate decremental cost-effectiveness, and otherwise rejected; and Interferon beta-1a and Lopinavir-Ritonavir are rejected (i.e., neither approved nor additional RCTs).

We aimed to examine interactions among common non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus and further estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these viruses. Methods We analyzed incidence data for seven groups of respiratory viruses in New York City (NYC) during Oct 2015 - May 2021 (i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). We first used elastic net regression to identify potential virus interactions and further examined the robustness of the found interactions by comparing the performance of Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with and without the interactions. We then used the models to compute counterfactual estimates of cumulative incidence and estimate the reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic period from March 2020 to May 2021, for each virus. Results We identified potential interactions for three endemic human coronaviruses (CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU, and CoV-OC43), parainfluenza (PIV)-1, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We found significant reductions (by ~70-90%) in cumulative incidence of CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, human metapneumovirus, PIV-2, PIV-4, RSV, and influenza virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the circulation of adenovirus and rhinovirus was less affected. Conclusions Circulation of several respiratory viruses has been low during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to increased population susceptibility. It is thus important to enhance monitoring of these viruses and promptly enact measures to mitigate their health impacts (e.g., influenza vaccination campaign and hospital infection prevention) in the coming months.","output":"Interactions among common non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses and influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their circulation in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recently, some studies have shown that prolonging flush interval is safe and feasible for patients who complete chemotherapy. However, there is no consensus about the optimal flush interval for those patients. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review was to evaluate whether the flush interval could be prolonged based on monthly interval for regular maintenance and to explore the optimal flush interval. DATA SOURCES We searched the following databases for articles published between 1 January 1982 and 21 February 2020: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Ovid. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials, retrospective and prospective cohort studies of flush interval less than 4 weeks versus longer than 4 weeks for patients who completed chemotherapy, were included. RESULTS Two reviewers extracted information and assessed the quality of the articles independently. In total, 389 articles were retrieved, and 4 studies including 862 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0, p > 0.05) among the included studies. Hence, the fixed-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the total complication rate associated with longer than 4-week interval was higher than that associated with less than 4-week interval. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the two groups (7.2% vs 7.6%, p = 0.83). Moreover, the meta-analysis showed that the total complication and catheter occlusion rates associated with the 4-week interval were higher than those associated with the 8-week interval. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups (total complications: 11.4% vs 9.5%, p = 0.68; catheter occlusions: 4.9% vs 4.1%, p = 0.89). LIMITATIONS Only four non-randomized controlled studies were included, and the outcomes of the included studies were reported incompletely. CONCLUSION Extending the flush interval to longer than 4 weeks is safe and feasible. Based on previous studies, extending the flush interval to 8 weeks might not increase the incidence of total complications and catheter occlusions. However, there is no conclusion on whether the flush interval could be extended to 3 months or longer.","output":"Prolonging the flush-lock interval of totally implantable venous access ports in patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging virus causing the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic with no known effective prophylaxis. We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. RESULTS: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18), and for twice-weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19-compatible illness (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08).

We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, which has various clinical applications, could decontaminate PPE contaminated with coronavirus. DESIGN: The 2 arms of the study included (1) PPE inoculation with coronaviruses followed by MB with light (MBL) decontamination treatment and (2) PPE treatment with MBL for 5 cycles of decontamination to determine maintenance of PPE performance. METHODS: MBL treatment was used to inactivate coronaviruses on 3 N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) and 2 medical mask models. We inoculated FFR and medical mask materials with 3 coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and we treated them with 10 M MB and exposed them to 50,000 lux of white light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes. In parallel, integrity was assessed after 5 cycles of decontamination using multiple US and international test methods, and the process was compared with the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O(3)) decontamination method. RESULTS: Overall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all 3 coronaviruses with 99.8% to >99.9% virus inactivation across all FFRs and medical masks tested. FFR and medical mask integrity was maintained after 5 cycles of MBL treatment, whereas 1 FFR model failed after 5 cycles of VHP+O(3). CONCLUSIONS: MBL treatment decontaminated respirators and masks by inactivating 3 tested coronaviruses without compromising integrity through 5 cycles of decontamination.

In the current paper, we introduce data that show that, on the contrary, learning to know when to take the easy road may be crucial when it comes to avoiding laboring in vain. We presented participants with prior problems C either easy or difficult C followed by choices of selecting an easy or a difficult current problem. Our primary goal was to examine the notion that past failures (which are more likely on the difficult prior items) may be a basis for allowing learners to then choose the easy rather than the difficult current problem. In other words, if one has labored in vain already, the easier items may now be more desirable. In addition, we compare the selections that are made between incremental and entity perspectives, given their fundamentally opposing views on effort. Our results showed that, interestingly, incremental theorists, who generally are proponents of effort, were more likely to select the easy problems, but only when they had experienced failure on prior, and similar, difficult tasks.

This work explored the use of a machine learning method, support vector machines (SVM), for the prediction of RNA-binding proteins directly from their primary sequence. Based on the knowledge of known RNA-binding and non-RNA-binding proteins, an SVM system was trained to recognize RNA-binding proteins.

Results: The patients present with fever (85.29%, n = 29), cough (67.65%, n = 23), fatigue or myalgia (26.47%, n = 9), and pharyngalgia (8.82%, n = 3). The 4 patients (11.76%) with no symptoms were identified during screening for close contacts, who had typical CT findings. On initial CT scans, the bilateral lung involved was shown in 24 cases (70.59%), while 29 (82.35%) cases were distributed in peripheral. The pure ground glass opacity (GGO) was shown in 18 cases (52.94%), the GGO with consolidation was in 12 cases (35.29%), and full consolidation only in 3 cases. The lesion with air bronchogram was seen in 14 (41.18%) cases, with enlarged blood vessel in 17 (50.00%) cases, with crazy-paving pattern in 8 (23.53%) cases, with fine reticular pattern in 4 (11.77%) cases, and with intralesional vacuole sign in 6 (17.65%) cases. The pleural effusion was seen in one patient. Follow-up imaging in 19 patients during the study time window demonstrated mild, moderate or severe progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities. Conclusions: The bilateral GGO with air bronchogram, enlarged blood vessel, fine reticular pattern, and peripheral distribution are the early CT findings of COVID-19. The crazy-paving pattern and intralesional vacuole sign are the features of progressive stage.","output":"CT imaging features of 34 patients infected with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Studies on the immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines are necessary to evaluate the ongoing vaccination programs by correlating serological response data and clinical effectiveness data. We performed a longitudinal immunological profiling of health care workers vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA). Half of these vaccinees had experienced a mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the spring of 2020 (COVID-recovered cohort), whereas the other half of the vaccinees had no previous COVID-19 infection (COVID-naive cohort). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum was drawn at multiple time points and subjected to assays measuring anti-Spike immunoglobulin G (IgG), avidity of anti-Spike IgG, avidity of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, virus neutralizing activity, and interferon- release from stimulated lymphocytes. RESULTS: Between both cohorts and within each cohort, we found remarkable inter-individual differences regarding cellular and humoral immune responses to the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. CONCLUSION: First, our study indicates that the success of mRNA-1273 vaccinations should be verified by serological assays in order to identify low-responders to vaccination. Second, the kinetics of anti-S IgG and neutralizing activity correlate well with clinical effectiveness data, thus explaining incipient protection against infection 2 weeks after the first dose of mRNA-1273 in COVID-naive vaccinees. Third, our IgG-avidity data indicate that this incipient protection is mediated by low-avidity anti-RBD IgG and low-avidity anti-S IgG.","output":"Large inter-individual variability of cellular and humoral immunological responses to mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[2] Dr. Praegers Purely Sensible Foods, a privately held maker of veggie burgers and meat alternatives, closed its factory for sanitization and instituted employee safety procedures earlier than most other food producers, [3] and then paid grocery bills for grocery store workers to thank them for keeping their communities fed.

METHODS: This was a simple random study in which ophthalmologists practicing in Saudi Arabia were asked to fill in a self-administered online survey during the period from March 28, 2020, to April 04, 2020. Four validated psychiatric assessment tools were used to detect symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress perception. RESULTS: One hundred and seven participants successfully completed the survey with a response rate of 30.6%. Males constituted 56.1% (n = 60). Ophthalmology residents constituted the majority (n = 66, 61.7%). About half of the physicians exhibited symptoms of depression (n = 56, 50.5%), anxiety (n = 50, 46.7%), and insomnia (n = 48, 44.9%). Symptoms of stress ranged between low (28%), moderate (68.2%), and high (3.7%). According to the cutoff values for severe symptoms, 29% were identified as having depression, 38.3% had anxiety, and 15% had insomnia.Depression was found to be more common among female ophthalmologists (P = 0.06), those living with an elderly (P = 0.003), and fellows (P = 0.006). Female ophthalmologists suffering from anxiety were significantly more than male ophthalmologists (P = 0.046). There was a trend toward suffering from anxiety in frontline health-care providers (P = 0.139) and in ophthalmologists who are living with an elderly (P = 0.149).

The diversity, distribution, and host associations of bat CoVs were investigated to assess their potential for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate analysis confirmed the classification of betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) into five groups (2A to 2E) and a potentially novel group, with further division of 2D into five subgroups. The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats and limit wildlife-livestock-human interfaces are encouraged to help maintain the natural state of bat BetaCoVs in the wild. Importance Bat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their potential to cause spillover infections.","output":"Global genetic patterns reveal host tropism versus cross-taxon transmission of bat Betacoronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing number of studies has suggested potential impacts of meteorological variables on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts are supported by data from similar viral contagions, such as SARS and the 1918 Flu Pandemic, and corroborated by US influenza data relative to the last decade. However, there is still limited understanding about the extent to which meteorology affects COVID-19 transmission rates and how meteorology can be a relevant element to anticipate social and politic measures. This study demonstrates that such an understanding is attainable through the development of regression models that verify the contribution of meteorology to the modeling of COVID-19 transmission, and the use of feature importance techniques assessing the relative weight of meteorological variables compared to epidemiological, socioeconomic, environmental, and global health indicator factors. The study results show that meteorological factors play an important role in regression models of COVID-19 transmission that have low error rates (R2 0.964).

RESULTS: Among 2363 invited students, 2005 (84.8%) completed the survey. Mean (SD) age was 12 (3.0) years, 51% were male, 53% wore glasses, 56% did not know the 20-20-20 rule (take a 20 second break every 20 min of close work and gaze at objects at least 20 feet away) and 6.5% knew but never followed the 20-20-20 rule. Mean (SD) hours/day was 4.6 (3.4) for screen time and 1.2 (1.0) for outdoor activities. Total of 1543 (77.0%) students reported at least one CVS symptom (median = 4) with eye dryness and itching the most common (48%). In multivariable analysis, CVS score 4 or more was independently associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.05 for per-year increase, p = 0.02), children with myopia not wearing glasses (aOR = 2.12, p = 0.0003), astigmatism (aOR = 1.37, p = 0.04), other ocular diseases (aOR = 1.59, p = 0.005), not complying 20-20-20 rule (aOR = 2.13, p = 0.04), more screen time (aOR = 1.53 for >6 vs. 2 hours, p = 0.0001) and less outdoor activities (aOR = 1.37 for 0.6 vs. 1.9 hours, p = 0.005).

METHODS: We measured proET-1 in 74 consecutively admitted adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and compared its prognostic accuracy to that of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n = 876) and viral bronchitis (n = 371) from a previous study by means of logistic regression analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall, median admission proET-1 levels were lower in COVID-19 patients compared to those with pneumonia and exacerbated bronchitis, respectively (57.0 pmol/l vs. 113.0 pmol/l vs. 96.0 pmol/l, p < 0.01). Although COVID-19 non-survivors had 1.5-fold higher admission proET-1 levels compared to survivors (81.8 pmol/l [IQR: 76 to 118] vs. 53.6 [IQR: 37 to 69]), no significant association of proET-1 levels and mortality was found in a regression model adjusted for age, gender, creatinine level, diastolic blood pressure as well as cancer and coronary artery disease (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0009 to 14.7).

Regarding the high price and low availability of sequencing techniques in developing countries, here we describe a rapid and inexpensive method for the detection of D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2. Using bioinformatics databases and software, we designed the PCR-RFLP method for D614G mutation detection. We evaluated 144 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples isolated in six months in Northeastern Iran. Our results showed that the prevalent type is S-D in our isolates, and a small number of isolated belongs to the S-G type. Of 144 samples, 127 (88.2%) samples have belonged to type S-D, and 13 (9%) samples typed S-G. The first S-G type was detected on 2020 June 10. We have little information about the prevalence of D614G mutation, and it seems that the reason is the lack of cheap and fast methods. We hope that this method will provide more information on the prevalence and epidemiology of D614G mutations worldwide.","output":"Development of a PCR-RFLP method for detection of D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of respiratory tract illness in children. Two HMPV subgroups, A and B, and four genotypes, A1, A2, B1 and B2, have been identified. Concurrent circulation of the different genotypes in yearly epidemics has been recorded globally, but not in Saudi Arabia. The current report was designed to study HMPV epidemiology in Saudi children and to analyze the genetic diversity and circulation patterns. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 174) were collected from hospitalized children in Riyadh (2008-2009). The screening of samples using real-time RT-PCR identified 19 HMPV strains. The majority of the strains belonged to subgroup B, while all strains of subgroup A were members of genotype A2. In 2008, only subgroup B was recognized, whereas in 2009 both subgroups were identified to be cocirculating at similar rates. The full-length attachment (G) gene and a partial sequence of the fusion (F) gene of positive samples were sequenced. The G gene showed a high degree of genetic diversity and exhibited a variable number of positively selected sites in different lineages. In contrast, the F gene demonstrated an extensive genetic stability with a higher tendency toward purifying selection. This is the first report on HMPV genotype circulation in Saudi Arabia; however, the exact circulation kinetics requires further retrospective and prospective study.","output":"Molecular Epidemiology of Human Metapneumovirus in Riyadh Province, Saudi Arabia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment, including coral reefs, seagrasses, terrestrial/aquatic animals, waste/sewage, and the economy of 27 marine national parks and four marine national park operations centers.

The results from national park officers indicated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, natural resources, such as coral, seagrass, and terrestrial/aquatic animals, had recovered and become more productive since animals in the area were observed. In addition, the amount of waste in the area has decreased;however, some national parks still have problems with marine debris.

In this paper, antibody sulfhydrylation and protein A were used to modify the microcantilever Au surface, and the antibody activities on the microcantilever were evaluated with direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dcELISA). The activity of the antibodies immobilized on the microcantilever via protein A was 1.7-fold of that via the sulfhydrylation reagent 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride. A microcantilever immunosensor method with protein A as the functionalization reagent was established to detect the residues of clenbuterol and chloramphenicol at limits of detection (LOD) of approximately 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Such LODs were better than that of the corresponding dcELISAs. The concentration of clenbuterol in a fortified feed sample detected with the microcantilever immunosensor after thorough extraction and purification agreed well with that detected with the dcELISA. Protein A showed to be simple and reproducible for functionalization of the antibodies on the Au surface and, thus, has common application values in microcantilever immunosensor development. The results suggest that microcantilever immunosensors be suitable for detection of small molecules, and the assay sensitivity is mainly related to the quality and activities of the antibodies.","output":"Development of protein A functionalized microcantilever immunosensors for the analyses of small molecules at parts per trillion levels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As countries transition from facing COVID-19 vaccine supply shortfalls to requiring novel strategies to facilitate vaccination, modern retail chainsoften designed and located to target particular demographic groupsare a potential vaccine delivery vehicle.

The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth. Data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 in three selected countries, Sri Lanka, Italy and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 20th April 2020. In this study Gompertz, Logistic and Exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries. Akaikes information criteria (AIC) was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy and China-Hebei are Exponential, Gompertz and Logistic curves respectively. The overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated.

Less reported are the opportunistic fungal infections affecting a subset of patients lacking immunocompromising disease. COVID19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is an underrecognized complication carrying high mortality in an otherwise healthy population. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55 year old male with history of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of worsening dyspnea. In the ED, he was found to be afebrile, requiring high-flow nasal cannula and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The patient showed little improvement despite treatment with IV steroids, convalescent plasma, Remdesivir, and broad antibiotic coverage for suspected superimposed hospital acquired pneumonia. Chest CT without contrast on hospital day 23 revealed interval development of a complex cavitary lesion. HIV and Cryptococcus antigen were negative while QuantiFERON gold was intermediate. Follow-up testing with galactomannan returned elevated and the patient promptly initiated Voriconazole therapy for treatment of CAPA. The patient demonstrated marked clinical improvement and was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation center in stable condition on supplemental oxygen with plans for close monitoring of Voriconazole trough, galactomannan level and repeat chest imaging. DISCUSSION: Hallmarks of severe COVID-19 infection include ARDS, lymphopenia, systemic cytokine response and potential multiorgan failure often necessitating mechanical ventilatory support and ECMO in some cases. The manipulation and ultimate halt of the immunological cascade with the therapeutic agents, in combination with the direct viral damage to respiratory tract epithelium and eventual ciliary dysfunction, may in turn lead to complicated superinfections. Given the decreased use of diagnostic bronchoscopy to limit aerosolized exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have relied on less invasive means to diagnose CAPA including clinical, radiological and mycological criteria. CONCLUSIONS: COVID19 is a complex multiorgan process that descends on the patients with vastly varying clinical manifestations and progression. It is sagacious to raise awareness of the potential COVID19 has for co-infection with CAPA, as immunosuppressive drugs are the current strategy for treatment. Improved screening strategies can identify and enact early treatment of CAPA in critically ill patients who seem to clinically decline despite optimized supportive care.

In the United States, as of November 19, 2021, boosters were recommended for all adults aged 18 years and older. We evaluated the effectiveness of a third dose of BNT162b2 among adults in a large US integrated health system. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern California between Dec 14, 2020 and Dec 5, 2021 to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two and three doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infections (without hospital admission) andCOVID-19-related hospital admission. VE was calculated using hazards ratios from adjusted Cox models. FINDINGS: After only two doses, VE against infection declined from 85% (95% CI 83C86) during the first month to 49% (46C51)  7 months following vaccination. Overall VE against hospitalization was 90% (95% CI 86C92) within one month and did not wane, however, effectiveness against hospitalization appeared to wane among immunocompromised individuals but was not statistically significant (93% [72C98] at 1 month to 74% [45C88] after  7 months; p=0490).

In this paper, we explore the connections between media framing of disasters, and risk communication and preparedness. Through the case of media coverage of eleven newspapers (international and national publications) around the event of Cyclone Amphan in South Asia, we portray a strong media framing around the event. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, the response system in India and Bangladesh could not follow pre-determined disaster action plans and protocols for a coordinated response, due to the risks and restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. Secondly, the journalistic response to cyclone Amphan framed the disaster event as natural, thus reinforcing the reliance on a short-term Response & Recovery centric approach (evacuation, rescue, and relief), over long-term approaches such as disaster preparedness and prevention (adaptation, mitigation, and resilience). Finally, we find that media framing focused on personal stories of individuals helps advance the needs of vulnerable groups;yet at the same time concretizes a relief-centric approach that ignores questions around disaster infrastructure, resilience, and climate change adaptation. We contend that an integrated risk communication approach that is adaptive, takes into account multiple risks and complexities while allowing coordinated efforts between actors and institutions is necessary to develop an effective response policy for disasters and climate-induced extreme events in the future. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Analysing media framing of cyclone Amphan: Implications for risk communication and disaster preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Case reports, case series and cohort studies have been published describing the clinical course and outcomes of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) who contract coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

Epidemiologists predicted that the SARS-Cov 2 pandemic would not be able to be brought under control until a majority of the world's population had been inoculated with safe and effective vaccines. A world-wide effort to expedite vaccine development was successful. Previous research for vaccines to prevent SARS and MERS, also coronaviruses, was vital to this success. Nanotechnology was essential to this vaccine development. Key elements are presented here to better understand the relationship between nanomedicine and the COVID-19 vaccine development. METHODS: NLM PubMed searches for COVID-19 vaccines, nanotechnology and nanomedicine were done. There were 6911 articles screened, 235 of which were deemed appropriate to this subject and utilized here, together with two landmark nanomedicine texts used to expand understanding of the basic science of nanotechnology. RESULTS: SARS-Cov 2, caused by the COVID-19 virus, was first recognized in China in December of 2019 and was declared as a pandemic in March of 2020. The RNA sequence was identified in January of 2020. Within 4 months of the viral genome being released, over 259 vaccines had been in development. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipated a vaccine with a 50-80% efficacy to be developed within 1-2 years. Ahead of schedule, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the emergency authorization approval for two mRNA vaccines within 11 month's time. Nanotechnology was the key to the success of these rapidly developed, safe and effective vaccines. A brief review of pertinent basic science principles of nanomedicine are presented.

Efficacy and safety of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), nivolumab (Niv) plus atezolizumab (Atz), were compared with those of ramucirumab (Ram) plus docetaxel (Doc), and the efficacy and safety of these two ICIs were compared with each other, using patient groups without programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) constraint. Additionally, efficacy and safety of, Niv, Atz, and pembrolizumab (Pem) were compared using a PD-L1 positive (1%) subgroup with refractory or relapsed advanced NSCLC. Niv or Atz was found to be more effective and safer than Ram plus Doc in groups without PD-L1 constraint. In the PD-L1 positive subgroup, Pem (10 mg/kg) showed the highest efficacy for ensuring overall survival, followed by Niv, Pem (2 mg/kg), Atz, and Doc. These results may help clinicians select and evaluate treatment options for relapsed or refractory advanced NSCLC. ABSTRACT: The efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in refractory or relapsed advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not yet been compared with those of ramucirumab (Ram) plus docetaxel (Doc). Furthermore, comprehensive comparisons between ICIs have not been conducted to date. In the current study, a Bayesian network meta-analysis of related phase III clinical trials was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of Ram+Doc, Niv, Atz, and Doc treatments in patient groups lacking the PD-L1 constraint. Surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) revealed that the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with Niv was the highest, followed by Atz, Ram+Doc, and Doc. Regarding grades 3C5 treatment-related adverse events (G3C5AEs), the use of Niv was ranked the safest, followed by Atz, Doc, and Ram+Doc. Significant differences in OS were observed between Niv and Ram+Doc, while significant differences in G3C5AEs were observed between Ram+Doc and Niv or Atz. In the PD-L1 positive (1%) patient subgroup, Pem (10 mg/kg) ranked the highest in efficacy for OS, followed by Niv, Pem (2 mg/kg), Atz, and Doc.

Pharmacy staff are responsible for transcribing these directions so that patients can take their medication as prescribed. However, little is known about the quality of these transcribed directions received by patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of 529 990 e-prescription directions processed at a mail-order pharmacy in the USA. We measured pharmacy staff editing of directions using string edit distance and execution time using the Keystroke-Level Model. Using the New Dale-Chall (NDC) readability formula, we calculated NDC cloze scores of the patient directions before and after transcription. We also evaluated the quality of directions (eg, included a dose, dose unit, frequency of administration) before and after transcription with a random sample of 966 patient directions. RESULTS: Pharmacy staff edited 83.8% of all e-prescription directions received with a median edit distance of 18 per e-prescription. We estimated a median of 6.64 s of transcribing each e-prescription. The median NDC score increased by 68.6% after transcription (26.12 vs 44.03, p<0.001), which indicated a significant readability improvement. In our sample, 51.4% of patient directions on e-prescriptions contained at least one pre-defined direction quality issue. Pharmacy staff corrected 79.5% of the quality issues. CONCLUSION: Pharmacy staff put significant effort into transcribing e-prescription directions. Manual transcription removed the majority of quality issues; however, pharmacy staff still miss or introduce following their manual transcription processes.

To obtain a comprehensive overview of the social and psychological status and needs of IMD patients, especially in Europe, the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Disorders (MetabERN) has performed a dedicated survey among its metabolic patients. RESULTS: A total of 924 patients and caregivers responded to the questionnaire. Most participants were from 25 European countries, with Spain, Italy, and Germany being the most represented; only eight participants were extra-European. The survey showed that most social assistance services, from free educational/development services for those with intellectual disability to transition from childhood to adult care and job placement support, are available for a limited number of patients or are unknown to the majority of patients or their parents/caregivers. Similarly, psychological assistance for the patient or the parent/caregiver is available for a small fraction of respondents, despite the fact that the majority considers this type of support necessary for both the patient and the caregiver. In addition, for most IMD patients local specialised or emergency medical assistance is lacking, although national clinical pathways are defined, and medical professionals of reference are readily available when needed. Lastly, while most national health services in Europe cover all or part of the expenses for medications, medical devices, food supplements, dietary integrators, physiotherapy, and speech therapy, significant gaps in the economic support for healthcare and other expenses still exist. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our survey reveals a widespread lack of social, psychological, and economic support for IMD patients in Europe. More needs to be done to provide daily assistance to IMD patients in order to alleviate the burden on caregivers and to allow patients to become independent and productive adults. Where support is actually available locally or nationally, most IMD patients are not aware of it, so an active dissemination of this information among the metabolic community is essential.

This led to the proliferation of dark images that associate the viral catastrophe with the end as we know it. To problematize the idea of the apocalypse (or the end) this paper speaks of three moments of survival in human existence: the beneath, the behind and the beyond. We argue that the apocalyptic nature of the pandemic and its global horrorism are part of a congeries of apocalyptic simulations that have always been part of the narrative with which we try to define our existence on earth. This paper masks itself against perfunctory examinations of the term apocalypse, and offers instead an understanding that runs along the lines of its Greek etymological sense as apokalyptein (revelation).

METHODS: The British Oculoplastic Surgery Society represents oculoplastic surgeons who usually lead TED care in the UK. A two-stage survey of the membership was conducted to ascertain current practice of existing resources. RESULTS: Seventy percent (45/65) of respondents in Survey 1 were aware of current RCP guidance, but only 49% (22/45) rated it as a good means of improving access to comprehensive TED service. Sixty percent (39/65) of respondents are working in a multidisciplinary TED clinic with co-location of ophthalmologists and endocrinologists.

METHODS: The EHS is an ongoing and deeply-phenotyped prospective cohort study that has recruited 667 participants in northwest Greece until August 31st, 2020. Level of knowledge on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and COVID-19 severity was labeled as poor, moderate or good. Variables assessing knowledge and beliefs towards the pandemic were summarized overall and by sex, age group (25-39, 40-49, 50-59, &#8805;60 years) and period of report (before the lifting of lockdown measures in Greece: March 30th to May 3rd, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st, July 1st to August 31st). A hypothesis generating exposure-wide association analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between 153 agnostically-selected explanatory variables and participants' knowledge. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%. RESULTS: A total of 563 participants (49 years mean age; 60% women) had available information on the standard EHS questionnaire, the clinical and biochemical measurements, and the COVID-19-related questionnaire. Percentages of poor, moderate and good knowledge status regarding COVID-19 were 4.5, 10.0 and 85.6%, respectively. The majority of participants showed absolute or moderate trust in the Greek health authorities for the management of the epidemic (90.1%), as well as in the Greek Government (84.7%) and the official national sources of information (87.4%).

METHODS In the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke Berlin (PROSCIS-B), patients with first-ever ischemic stroke were followed for 3 years. The primary combined endpoint consisted of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. Citrate-blood levels of endothelial MV (EMV), leukocyte-derived MV (LMV), monocytic MV (MMV), and platelet-derived MV (PMV) were measured using flow cytometry. Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effect of MV levels on the combined endpoint. RESULTS Five hundred seventy-one patients were recruited (median age 69 years; 39% female; median NIHSS 2, interquartile range 1-4) and 95 endpoints occurred. Patients with levels of EMV [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.9] or LMV (HR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8) in the highest quartile were more likely to experience an event than participants with lower levels using the lowest quartile as reference category. The association was less pronounced for PMV (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.2) and absent for MMV (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.8).

Methods To clarify the relationship between HLA class I and the severity rate, the binding repertoires of each HLA class I allele to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and the allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B, and -A/B haplotypes in each country were quoted. Results HLA-A1 and the number of deaths per million population (severity rate) in each country had an exponential approximation correlation with correlation coefficient R=0.4879. In addition, the correlation between the infected cases per million (infection rate) and the severity rate was linearly approximated, with R=0.7422. Weak HLA-A alleles with a repertoire of under 300 also had an exponential approximation correlation with the severity rate (R=0.5972), whereas there was a linear approximation with the infection rate (R=0.6808). Weak HLA-B alleles of 30 repertoires or less had no correlation with the severity rate (R=-0.1530). The weak HLA-A/B haplotype has a stronger effect on the severity rate than the weak HLA-A alone. Therefore, the simple HLA class I susceptibility index was calculated, and a strong correlation (R=0.7388) of an exponential approximation with the severity rate was obtained. Conclusions HLA class I susceptible alleles against COVID-19 increase both infection and severity rate.

Surgeons depend on visual and tactile clues to select which tissues should be removed from a patient. Recently, we and others have hypothesized near-infrared (NIR) imaging can be used during surgery to differentiate tumors from normal tissue. METHODS We enrolled 8 canines and 5 humans undergoing cancer surgery for NIR imaging. The patients were injected with indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA approved non-receptor specific NIR dye that accumulates in hyperpermeable tissues, 16-24 hours prior to surgery. During surgery, NIR imaging was used to discriminate the tumor from non-tumor tissue. RESULTS NIR imaging identified all tumors with a mean signal-to-background ratio of 6.7. Optical images were useful during surgery in discriminating normal tissue from cancer. In 3 canine cases and 1 human case, the tissue surrounding the tumor was inflamed due to obstruction of the vascular supply due to mass effect. In these instances, NIR imaging could not distinguish tumor tissue from tissue that was congested, edematous and did not contain cancer. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that NIR imaging can identify tumors from normal tissues, provides excellent tissue contrast, and it facilitates the resection of tumors. However, in situations where there is significant peritumoral inflammation, NIR imaging with ICG is not helpful. This suggests that non-targeted NIR dyes that accumulate in hyperpermeable tissues will have significant limitations in the future, and receptor-specific NIR dyes may be necessary to overcome this problem.","output":"Intraoperative near-infrared imaging can distinguish cancer from normal tissue but not inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are RNA-protein assemblies involved in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism and are linked with memory, development and disease.

The 2003 SARS epidemic marked a new chapter in disease modelling in Canada as it triggered a national discussion on the utility and uptake of modelling research in local and pandemic outbreaks. However, integration and application of model-based outcomes in public health requires knowledge translation and contextualization. We reviewed the history and performance of Pan-InfORM (Pandemic Influenza Outbreak Research Modelling), which created a national infrastructure in Canada with a mandate to develop innovative knowledge translation methodologies to inform policy makers through modelling frameworks that bridge the gaps between theory, policy, and practice. This review demonstrates the importance of a collaborative infrastructure as a \\"Community of Practice\\" to guide public health responses, especially in the context of emerging diseases with substantial uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Dedicated resources to modelling and knowledge translation activities can help create synergistic strategies at the global scale and optimize public health responses to protect at-risk populations and quell socioeconomic and health burden.","output":"Ten years of Pan-InfORM: modelling research for public health in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: To optimize patient outcomes and preserve critical acute care access during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services developed the SAFE @ HOME O2 Expected Practice (expected practice), enabling ambulatory oxygen management for COVID-19. Objective: To assess outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged via the expected practice approach to home or quarantine housing with supplemental home oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 621 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were discharged from 2 large urban public hospitals caring primarily for patients receiving Medicaid from March 20 to August 19, 2020. Patients were included in the analysis cohort if they received emergency or inpatient care for COVID-19 and were discharged with home oxygen. Interventions: Patients receiving at least 3 L per minute of oxygen, stable without other indication for inpatient care, were discharged from either emergency or inpatient encounters with home oxygen equipment, educational resources, and nursing telephone follow-up within 12 to 18 hours of discharge. Nurses provided continued telephone follow up as indicated, always with physician back-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality and all-cause 30-day return admission. Results: A total of 621 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (404 male [65.1%] and 217 female [34.9%]) were discharged with home oxygen. Median age of these patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 45-61 years), with 149 (24.0%) discharged from the emergency department and 472 (76%) discharged from inpatient encounters. The all-cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.5%) and the 30-day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-10.7%) with a median follow-up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15-55 days). No deaths occurred in the ambulatory setting. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged on home oxygen had low rates of mortality and return admission within 30 days of discharge. Ambulatory management of COVID-19 with home oxygen has an acceptable safety profile, and the expected practice approach may help optimize outcomes, by ensuring right care in the right place at the right time and preserving access to acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mortality and Readmission Rates Among Patients With COVID-19 After Discharge From Acute Care Setting With Supplemental Oxygen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has resulted in millions of deaths and a major strain on health systems worldwide.

The majority of patients will recover spontaneously or after acute-phase management, but clinicians are now faced with long-term complications of COVID-19 including a large variety of symptoms, defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Most studies have focused on patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19, but acute COVID-19 syndrome is not restricted to these patients and exists in outpatients. Given the diversity of symptoms and the high prevalence of persistent symptoms, the management of these patients requires a multidisciplinary team approach, which will result in the consumption of large amounts of health resources in the coming months.

Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2 decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV) strains. Results The ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4-fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2. Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used herein. Conclusions Our study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be observed in other organisms.

We investigated the effect of the 'new' TA566 criteria on adult CI at our regional centre. METHODS Adult CI assessments between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2018 (before new criteria) and between 7th March 2019 and 31st August 2019 (after new criteria) were retrospectively examined. Calculated eligibility and uptake rates predicted change in annual implantation under the new guidance. RESULTS 552 patients were identified in the first study period, with a median of 148 assessments per year. Of 533 with complete assessments, 58% were eligible, of whom 74% were implanted. Retrospective application of the new criteria was possible for 277 patients; eligibility and uptake were 67% and 80%, respectively. In the second study period (n = 60), new criteria eligibility was 62% and uptake was 78%. Increased eligibility under the new criteria predicts an increase of between 13 and 23% in annual adult implantation. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate increased implant eligibility under the latest NICE guidance.

It is unclear if home monitoring of young people with CF is feasible or acceptable. The COVID-19 pandemic has made home monitoring more of a necessity. We report the results of CLIMB-CF, exploring home monitoring's feasibility and potential obstacles. METHODS We designed a mobile app and enrolled participants with CF aged 2-17 years and their parents for six months. They were asked to complete a variety of measures either daily or twice a week. During the study, participants and their parents completed questionnaires exploring depression, anxiety and quality of life. At the end of the study parents and participants completed acceptability questionnaires. RESULTS 148 participants were recruited, 4 withdrew prior to starting the study. 82 participants were female with median (IQR) age 7.9 (5.2-12 years). Median data completeness was 40.1% (13.6-69.9%) for the whole cohort; when assessed by age participants aged  12 years contributed significantly less (15.6% [9.8-30%]). Data completeness decreased over time. There was no significant difference between parental depression and anxiety scores at the start and the end of the study nor in CFQ-R respiratory domain scores for participants  14 years.

A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change in incidence across provinces and age groups. Nationwide, a total of 916 426 hepatitis B cases and 39 381 hepatitis C cases were recorded in 2004; the reporting incidences of HBV and HCV were 70.50/100 000 and 3.03/100 000, respectively. The overall relative changes in HBV and HCV reporting incidences in China from 2004 to 2014 were 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00, P = .082) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.12-1.20, P < .001), respectively. Thirteen provinces experienced decline in HBV reporting incidence. Most provinces exhibited an increasing trend in HCV reporting incidence. People aged 24 displayed a significant descending trend in HBV reporting incidence; people aged 55 exhibited a significant increasing trend.

This study describes the adaptation of the in-person curriculum to a streamlined, online format, in the setting of the Covid19 pandemic. We hypothesized that high levels of skill proficiency and learner satisfaction observed in previous in-person cohorts would be sustained amongst trainees in the online setting. OBJECTIVE Our primary aim was to assess the skills proficiency of a cohort of internal medicine interns undergoing online training for GOC discussions with the 3-Act Model. Our secondary goal was to assess learners' satisfaction with the pre-recorded didactic video and online role plays. METHODS Our team used REDCap for the data collection, and as the user-facing hub for learners to access didactic video content and for submitting surveys. We used Zoom to host synchronous discussions and role-play sessions. Trainers used the previously validated Goals of Care Assessment Tool (GCAT) to objectively rate intern proficiency in 2 role plays each. RESULTS Twenty-one internal medicine interns began the training; 20 completed the training and were assessed using the GCAT. All but 1 intern who completed the training (19 of 20, 95%) achieved proficiency in leading a GOC discussion as measured objectively using the GCAT. Learner satisfaction was high: (i) 100% of respondents recommended the training to others as a 'good' (26.7%) or 'outstanding' experience (73.3%); (ii) 93.3% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' using a online, distance-learning format for the pre-recorded didactic component; (iii) 80% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' using an online, distance-learning format for the role-play component; and (iv) 93.3% were content with the number of role plays. The amount of time dedicated to this training decreased compared to prior years when done in person (6 hours) - to 4 hours and 40 minutes for learners and under 4 hours for trainers. CONCLUSION After completing the adapted online 3-Act Model training, nearly all learners were scored to be proficient in GOC communication skills and reported high satisfaction with the online curriculum. Achieving high quality more efficiently represents genuine educational value. Further, these online teaching results show that the 3-Act Model training can be delivered to geographically distanced learners.","output":"Narrative Approach to Goals of Care Discussions: Adapting the 3-Act Model Training to an Online Format."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention knows of about 5800 breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2 so far among the roughly 77 million people in the country who have been fully vaccinated, the agency has said The low figure gives reassurance than the promising results seen in clinical studies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which account for the overwhelming majority of jabs given so far in the US, are being reproduced in real world conditions An Israeli study awaiting peer review but posted online last week indicated that the South African variant (B 1 351) could pose an elevated risk of breakthrough infection in people given the Pfizer vaccine 1 Researchers found the variant in a much higher proportion of breakthrough infections in people who had been vaccinated than in infections among the unvaccinated","output":"Covid-19: US reports low rate of new infections in people already vaccinated"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper develops a robotic manipulation system to treat the pressing needs for handling a large number of test tubes in clinical examination and replace or reduce human labor.

Demographic, comorbidities, and longitudinal (3 days before and 3 days after AKI onset) clinical variables were used to compute odds ratios for and longitudinally predict hospital-acquired AKI onset. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with AKI were more likely to die than NAKI patients (31.5% vs 6.9%, adjusted p < 0.001, OR = 4.67 [95% CI 3.1, 7.0], Stony Brook data). AKI developed on average 3.3 days after hospitalization. Procalcitonin was elevated prior to AKI onset (p < 0.05), peaked, and remained elevated (p < 0.05). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase peaked the same time as creatinine, whereas D-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide peaked a day later. C-reactive protein, white blood cell and lymphocyte showed group differences - 2 days prior (p < 0.05).

Only articles in English were selected, with certain keywords related to EMS calls, ambulance delay, stroke and cardiac arrest. SOURCE OF EVIDENCE: Google Scholar was the main searching source. RESULTS: After applying the selection criteria, a total of 29 citations were chosen, and a pattern of knowledge resulted in the emergence of five themes: EMS calls during COVID-19, Reduced EMS operator response time, Ambulance response delays, Collateral mortality and morbidity among non-COVID-19 cases, and Total ambulance call time. CONCLUSION: Over the course of COVID-19 progress, there was a global phenomenon of exponential increases in EMS calls, which is expected to impose a great pressure on EMS dispatch centers. Several factors contributing to the bottleneck of EMS calls are identified and explained.","output":"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Calls During COVID-19: Early Lessons Learned for Systems Planning (A Narrative Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this report the positive cases of Covid19 in India with effect from 7th September ,2020 to 25th October ,2020 are analysed for statistical relevance .

Tisseel? is a tissue glue commonly used as an adjunct in dural repair but is not optimal for this purpose. DuraSeal? has several properties advantageous for dural repair but is not widely accepted in Canada partly due to its increased cost. OBJECTIVE A cost analysis of DuraSeal? versus Tisseel? in endoscopic pituitary surgery. METHODS A cost analysis was performed based on typical endoscopic pituitary surgery cases performed at our tertiary care institution. Operating room, hospital admission, and surgical sealant costs were obtained directly while estimates of patient recovery time and post-operative CSF leak rates were based on consensus values reported in the literature. Outcomes were reported for various possible clinical scenarios of sealant use. RESULTS In a model where surgical sealant is employed only in high-risk cases, use of DuraSeal? allows for a yearly cost savings of at least $4486.72. If surgical sealant is used in all cases, regular use of DuraSeal? versus Tisseel? either marginally reduces yearly costs or increases them by a maximum of $7619.25, depending on the case volume and estimated post-operative CSF leak rate. CONCLUSION In most clinical scenarios, use of DuraSeal? in endoscopic pituitary surgery may reduce overall yearly hospital costs compared to Tisseel?.","output":"Use of tissue glues in endoscopic pituitary surgery: a cost comparison."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japanese encephalitis is one of the most important causes of viral encephalitis in Asian countries caused by an arbovirus belonging to the flavivirus family.

As early life adversity has the potential to alter an individual's appraisal of threat, we hypothesized that individuals exposed to adversity in childhood may also exhibit increased threat from environmental stressors, which in turn may impact their state anxiety levels. We examined the relations between adverse childhood experiences, assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACEs), perceived threat from COVID-19, and state anxiety in a sample of adults. Additionally, flexibility is implicated in adaptive coping with life's stressors so we also assessed participants' cognitive flexibility. Parallel mediation regression analyses revealed that both perceived threat from COVID-19 and flexibility in the appraisal of challenges mediated the influence of maltreatment, but not household dysfunction, on state anxiety. Our data indicate that experience with early life adversity in the form of maltreatment is associated with increased perceived threat from COVID-19, which results in higher anxiety levels for the individual. In contrast, childhood maltreatment is associated with reduced flexibility in appraising challenges, which in turn mediates the relationship between maltreatment and anxiety. The findings of this study adds to the limited literature on the impact of early life adversity on cognitive flexibility and highlights the psychological toll of COVID-19 on individuals who have been exposed to adverse childhood experiences.","output":"Cognitive flexibility and perceived threat from COVID-19 mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and state anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we report a case of an incarcerated hernia occurring through the peritoneal and muscular defect caused by a previous trocar insertion.

The hernia was reduced via a small extension of the previous incision, and the defect was repaired by separated stitches. This case shows that a trocar site hernia can appear despite correct closure of the fascia, which is poorly described except for obese patients. It suggests the need for careful closure of the abdominal wall including the peritoneum after a laparoscopic procedure.

All these instructions were adopted by the Greek National Health System. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission. Obesity was noted in 8 patients of Group A (mean 31.67) and 14 patients of Group B (mean 37.78).

The uncertainty of this situation produced various questions that perplexed educationists regarding what implications the pandemic would have on educational institutions, especially regarding how the switch to online education would impact the behavior and performance of students. The vast importance of this matter attracted the attention of researchers and served as the motivation for this research, which aims to resolve this confusion by studying the use of mobile learning (ML) among students for educational purposes during the COVID-19 period. This study also examines how this situation has affected student learning behavior (LB) and performance (SP) in the higher education setting. This research is based on collaborative learning theory, sociocultural learning theory, and ML theory. This quantitative research employed the convenient sampling technique to collect data through structured questionnaires distributed to 396 students of higher education institutions who carry a mobile device. This study used descriptive and inferential statistics to make the data more meaningful. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with AMOS software was used for hypothesis testing. The results showed that ML was a significant and positive predictor of SP and LB. Moreover, student LB partially mediated the relationship between ML and SP. The findings suggest that the academic performance of students can be enhanced by building a ML environment that aligns with the LB of students. Nevertheless, content suitable for ML must be developed, and future research should be conducted on this topic.","output":"The Advent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Impact of Mobile Learning on Student Learning Performance: The Mediating Role of Student Learning Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the South African government's response to COVID-19 by exploring the strong emphasis that has been placed on South Africans taking personal responsibility for good health outcomes. This emphasis is based on the principles of the traditional Health Belief Model which is a commonly used model in global health systems. More recently, there has been a drive towards other health behaviour change models, like the COM-B model and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW);nonetheless, these remain entrenched within the principles of individual health responsibility. However, the South African experience with the HIV epidemic serves as a backdrop to demonstrate that holding people personally accountable for health behaviour changes has major pitfalls;health risk is never objective and does not take place outside of subjective experience. This article makes the argument that risk-taking health behaviour change in the South African context has to consider community empowerment and capacity building.

We report SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 12,476 patients in the Houston Methodist healthcare system diagnosed from January 1 through May 31, 2021. Prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant increased rapidly and caused 63%-90% of new cases in the latter half of May. Eleven B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K replacement in spike protein, a change also identified in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Compared with non-B.1.1.7-infected patients, individuals with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold (a proxy for higher virus load) and significantly higher hospitalization rate. Other variants (e.g., B.1.429 and B.1.427 (Epsilon), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta), and R.1) also increased rapidly, although the magnitude was less than B.1.1.7. We identified 22 patients infected with B.1.617.1 (Kappa) or B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants; these patients had a high rate of hospitalization. Breakthrough cases (n=207) in fully vaccinated patients were caused by a heterogeneous array of virus genotypes, including many that are not currently designated variants of interest or concern. In the aggregate, our study delineates the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in a major metropolitan area, documents B.1.1.7 as the major cause of new cases in Houston, and heralds the arrival of B.1.617 variants in the metroplex.","output":"Trajectory of Growth of SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Houston, Texas, January through May 2021 Based on 12,476 Genome Sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the frontline firefighter/paramedic workforce of a South Florida fire department located in the epicentre of a State outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for &#8805;15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","output":"Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among firefighters/paramedics of a US fire department: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A tracheostomy performed on patients infected with SARS CoV-2 is one of the procedures with the highest risks of aerosolization.

Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.","output":"[Analysis of CT features of 15 Children with 2019 novel coronavirus infection]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 led to an unprecedented inflow of hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), requiring high-flow non-invasive oxygenation, if not invasive mechanical ventilation. While the best option in terms of non-invasive systems of oxygen delivery is still a matter of debate, it also remains unclear as to whether or not the optimal in-bed positioning of patients might also help to improve their oxygen saturation levels. On the basis of three representative cases, it is possible to propose the following hypotheses: (i) how patients are positioned has a strong influence on their oxygen saturation levels; (ii) saturation-optimalised positions are patient-specific; (iii) prone positions require ergonomic devices; and (iv) saturation-optimalised positions should aim to place the most affected part(s) of the lung(s) on top. Considered together, these hypotheses have led us to recommend that COVID-19 patients should undergo a specific assessment at admission to determine their saturation-optimalised in-bed position.

In both mice and macaques, vaccine-induced cellular immunity results in the clearance of transduced muscle fibers coincident with macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration at the site of immunization. Additionally, mice demonstrate a strong Type-1 polarized cellular immunophenotype and equivalent ex vivo T cell reactivity to peptides of wt and alpha (B.1.1.7) variant spike. These studies demonstrate not only that AAV6 and AAV9 can function as effective vaccine platforms, but also that vaccines can provide long-term efficacy primarily through the induction of cellular immunity.

A survey was conducted by distributing an online questionnaire to Polish medical students. Data gathered from the survey were analyzed with routine statistical software. Eight hundred four students answered the questionnaire. According to respondents answers, the main advantages of online learning were the ability to stay at home (69%), continuous access to online materials (69%), learning at your own pace (64%), and comfortable surroundings (54%). The majority of respondents chose lack of interactions with patients (70%) and technical problems with IT equipment (54%) as the main disadvantages. There was no statistical difference between face-to-face and online learning in terms of opinions on the ability of the learning method to increase knowledge (P = .46). E-learning was considered less effective than face-to-face learning in terms of increasing skills (P < .001) and social competences (P < .001).

Many students engage with online videos that enable them to watch, and re-watch these support materials flexibly and at their own pace. In our large-enrolment introductory first-year physics unit, many students find the content very challenging. To support their learning, we have developed short videos of 4-7 minutes explaining concepts and providing demonstrations of the problemsolving process. Our study was originally designed to evaluate and compare the effect on conceptual understanding and self-efficacy of students engaging with two different types of videos: screencasts (e.g. Khan Academy style) and lightboard videos, where the teacher presents direct to the camera on a writable transparent board (the image is then inverted to be the right way round). Then COVID struck, and all our learning was moved online. Thus, in the second semester of the study, we only used screencasts, and focused our research on exploring the relationship between online engagement, self-efficacy and conceptual understanding of students. We found that students preferred lightboards, and that both semesters' average survey scores on self-efficacy and conceptual understanding were generally stable or increased only slightly. This is at odds with other studies of similar cohorts. However, the small number of paired responses in our study meant that a self-selection bias may have skewed results. Scores on the conceptual understanding were weakly correlated with assessment performance, suggesting the presence of other contributing variables. Initial self-efficacy scores did not predict subsequent engagement. Instead, missing multiple early assessments was identified as a stronger predictor of failing to pass the subject. ? 2021.

Measure ments: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical and radiological variables, co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65 C 97 years), median CFS score of 7 (range 2 C 9), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within six weeks, eighteen patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = 0.03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = 0.011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r = 0.301, P = 0.009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = 0.02) and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct, r = -0.285, P = 0.015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH and RT-PCR Ct (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival.

The determination of the factors affecting transmission rate is urgent and crucial to combat COVID-19.

At global scale, the R t started to decrease approximately two weeks after policy interventions initiated. This lag from the date of policy interventions initiation to the date when R t started to decrease ranges from 9 to 19 days, largest in Europe and North America. We find that proportion of elderly people or life expectancy can explain 50% of variation in transmission rate across the 277 regions. The transmission rate at the point of inflection (R I ) increases by 29.4% (25.2-34.0%) for 1% uptick in the proportion of people aged above 65, indicating elderly people face ~2.5 times higher infection risk than younger people. Air temperature is negatively correlated with transmission rate, which is mainly attributed to collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. Our model predicted that temperature sensitivity of R I is only -2.7% (-5.2 - 0%) per C after excluding collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors.

We therefore examined the use of forensic mental health orders in Australia using routinely available data. METHOD: We completed a retrospective review of publicly reported data about forensic orders and health or criminal justice outcomes across Australia's jurisdictions. Data on the initiation and prevalence of forensic orders were extracted from annual reports by health and justice system entities with governance of forensic mental health patients. Linear mixed models were used to test for differences between jurisdictions in the number and rate of increase of forensic orders per capita open at the end of each calendar year, and the patterns of forensic order use and reporting were analysed for lessons regarding a minimum data set about the number of forensic orders, rates of re-offending, and vulnerable cohorts including Indigenous and female patients. RESULTS: While larger states generally provided useful information about the health engagement of people on forensic orders, no states routinely reported recidivism data or fully addressed vulnerable cohorts, although Victoria provided some information about Indigenous patients and Victoria and Tasmania about female patients. There were significant differences between jurisdictions on both the number of forensic orders in place in 2003, and in the rate of increase in forensic orders between 2003 and 2020. Consistent with the relative number of forensic orders extant in 2003, Queensland showed a large and NSW a moderate rate of increase in the number of people on forensic orders per capita compared with Victoria and WA.

Contaminated PPE has already made its way to the oceans which will inevitably produce plastic particles alongside other pathogen-driven diseases. This study provided an estimation-based approach in quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of 3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations. Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and policy makers to design effective response plans. Sustainable plastic waste management for the current and post-pandemic period can be imagined and acted upon.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-induced PPE and single-use plastic waste generation scenario."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to assess relations between coronavirus-related psychological distress and its potentially predictive factors. An online sample of 2,860 Croatian adults filled in questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, distress (the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21), coping (the Brief COPE), personality (the International Personality Item Pool), and social support (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire) during the COVID-19 lockdown and after the capital was hit by an earthquake. Results indicated that 15.9% of the respondents experienced severe to extreme depression, 10.7% severe to extreme anxiety, and 26.2% severe to extreme stress. The hierarchical regressions analysis indicated that the considered variables explained a substantial percentage of the variance in depression (51.4%), anxiety (35.2%), and stress (45.5%). Main predictors of emotional distress were lower scores of Emotional Stability, higher scores of Agreeableness, avoidant coping, lack of active coping, and perceived social support. The negative effect of the earthquake was weak. Results provide information on a broad range of potentially protective or vulnerability factors that could help identify those at risk for developing coronavirus-related psychological distress.

After isolation in cell culture, the novel isolate was analysed by RT-PCR and the amplicons obtained were sequenced. In order to characterize the growth properties of the isolate, the size of the plaques, the temperature of inactivation and the kinetics of growth were evaluated. Moreover, the novel strain was used to perform a serological study on 86 canine serum samples and 81 feline sera by virus-neutralization assay. The comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the isolate, named FCV-Te/10/07, revealed the highest identity to strain FCV-F65. The growth kinetic revealed that strain Te/10/07 grew more rapidly than F9 strain. By virus-neutralization assay, dogs from the same region of the isolate showed antibodies against the FCV-F9 vaccinal strain in 63.9% (55/86) of sera, while antibodies against the Te/10/07 were found in seven sera (8.13%). In cats neutralizing antibodies against Te/10/07 strain were recovered in 50.62% (41/81) of samples tested, even if 38 sera were positives for F9 strain with similar titres or higher.

METHODS: : A single-center randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial involving outpatients with early and mild SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted. Inclusion criteria: patients aged between 18 to 65 years with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 for fewer than five days, no significant comorbidities, and positive naso/oropharyngeal swab screening tests (POCT-PCR). Randomized patients received either hydroxychloroquine for seven days plus azithromycin for five days or placebo. The primary endpoint was viral clearance within a 9-day period. Secondary endpoints included viral load reduction, clinical evolution, hospitalization rates, chest computed tomography evolution and adverse effects. RESULTS: : From 107 potential trial participants, 84 were enrolled following pre-determined criteria. Statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat (N=84) and per-protocol (PP) basis (N=70). On the PP analysis, the treatment group (N=36) and the placebo group (N=34) displayed similar demographic characteristics.

We previously published a significant decline in stroke activations and reperfusion treatment (IV thrombolysis and EVT) rates following state announcements of COVID-19 mitigation measures. Here, we update these trends after state reopening guidelines. Methods: We compared Stroke Team activations and reperfusion treatments logged in a prospectively collected database, comparing the same period in 2020 versus 2019. Kentucky and Ohio announced school and restaurant closures on March 12 and 13, respectively, followed by Indiana. A stepwise reopening of our tristate area started on May 1, 2020. We also compared trends in activations and treatment rates before (Weeks 1-10), during (Weeks 11-17), and after (Weeks 18- 26) the lifting of COVID-19 mitigation efforts using the Poisson test, and graphically with segmented regression analysis. Results: Compared to 2019, stroke team activations declined by 12% in 2020 (95% CI 7 - 16%;p&lt;0.01). During 2020, an initial decline in stroke activations following COVID-19 mitigation announcements was followed by a 28% increase in activations after reopening (Weeks 18-26: 95% CI 15 - 42%;p&lt;0.01).

Female, 40-year-old Final Diagnosis: Alcohol liver disease ? COVID-19 Symptoms: Ascites ? cough ? dyspnea ? jaundice Medication:  Clinical Procedure: CT scan Specialty: Anesthesiology ? Gastroenterology and Hepatology ? Infectious Diseases ? General and Internal Medicine OBJECTIVE: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It has spread rapidly through the world, endangering human life. The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs; however, it can involve other organs, including the liver. Patients with severe COVID-19 have an increased incidence of abnormal liver function, and patients with liver disorders are considered to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The mechanism of liver injury reported in 14% to 53% of COVID-19 patients is poorly recognized and several possibilities need to be considered (cytokine storm, direct viral action, hypoxia). The incidence of underlying liver comorbidities in patients with a COVID-19 infection ranges from 1% to 11%. CASE REPORTS: This is a report of 2 nosocomial COVID-19 infections and severe COVID-19 pneumonia in 2 patients who were hospitalized during treatment for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Case 1 and case 2 were a 31-year-old woman and a 40-year-old woman, respectively, with decompensated ALD and symptoms of the COVID-19 infection. Both patients were transferred from another hospital to our hospital after confirmation of COVID-19 during their hospitalization. The course of the infection progressed rapidly in both patients with the development of multiple-organ failure and death over a short period. CONCLUSIONS: There are no clear recommendations on the management of ALD in the COVID-19 pandemic. Alcoholic hepatitis may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and a poor outcome. A high percentage of nosocomial COVID-19 infections are observed; therefore, special precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure.","output":"Nosocomial COVID-19 Infection and Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia in Patients Hospitalized for Alcoholic Liver Disease: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndromeCcoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is primarily a respiratory infection but has been recently associated with a variety of neurological symptoms.

Our objective was to describe the novel application and effect of a telemedicine medical screening evaluation (Tele-MSE) at triage on quality metrics in the pediatric emergency department (PED). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study of patients presenting to an urban PED from December 2017 to November 2019 who received a Tele-MSE at triage. We analyzed 4 diagnostic cohorts: gastroenteritis, psychiatry evaluation, burn injury, and extremity fracture. We matched cases with controls who received standard triage, from December 2015 to November 2017, by age, diagnosis, weekday versus weekend, and season of presentation. Outcome measures included door-to-provider time, time-to-intervention order, and PED length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: We included 557 patients who received Tele-MSE during the study period. Compared with controls, patients who received a Tele-MSE at triage had a shorter median door-to-provider time (median difference [MD], 8.4 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-11.0), time-to-medication order (MD, 27.3 minutes; 95% CI, 22.9-35.2), time-to-consult order (MD, 10.0 minutes; 95% CI, 5.3-12.7), and PED LOS (MD, 0.4 hours; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6).

Finally, nonlegal, pragmatic consequences are considered, such as how the policy risks disproportionately favoring the wealthy, reduces trust in future government pronouncements regarding COVID-19, perpetuates harmful stereotypes about racial inferiority, breeds racial resentment, and causes unnecessary delays in treatment. The racially disparate outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic illuminate numerous background factors that disadvantage minority groups.

It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients.

Alterations in ACE2 gene and protein expression, and activity mediated by A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), a member of the A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM) family are implicated in several cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that activation of kinin B1 receptor (B1R) in the brain increases neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and sympathoexcitation, leading to the development of neurogenic hypertension. We also showed evidence for ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in neurons. However, whether kinin B1 receptor (B1R) activation has any role in altering ADAM17 activity and its effect on ACE2 shedding in neurons is not known. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of B1R upregulates ADAM17 and results in ACE2 shedding in neurons. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated wild-type and B1R gene-deleted mouse neonatal primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures with a B1R-specific agonist and measured the activities of ADAM17 and ACE2 in neurons. B1R stimulation significantly increased ADAM17 activity and decreased ACE2 activity in wild-type neurons, while pretreatment with a B1R-specific antagonist, R715, reversed these changes. Stimulation with specific B1R agonist Lys-Des-Arg(9)-Bradykinin (LDABK) did not show any effect on ADAM17 or ACE2 activities in neurons with B1R gene deletion. These data suggest that B1R activation results in ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in primary hypothalamic neurons. In addition, stimulation with high concentration of glutamate significantly increased B1R gene and protein expression, along with increased ADAM17 and decreased ACE2 activities in wild-type neurons. Pretreatment with B1R-specific antagonist R715 reversed these glutamate-induced effects suggesting that indeed B1R is involved in glutamate-mediated upregulation of ADAM17 activity and ACE2 shedding.","output":"Activation of Kinin B1R Upregulates ADAM17 and Results in ACE2 Shedding in Neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucocorticoids (GCs) have potential anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.

Currently, only a small percentage of the populace is vaccinated, and their protection is likely to have waned. Most therefore are susceptible today. And when the disease re-emerges the susceptible individuals may be manipulated by disinformation on Social Media to refuse vaccines. Thus, a combination of countermeasures consisting of antiviral drugs and vaccines and a range of policies for their application need to be investigated. Opinions as to receptivity of vaccines evolve with time through social exchanges over networks that overlap with but are not identical to the disease propagation networks. These couple the spread of the biological and information contagion and necessitate a joint investigation of the two. Towards these, we develop a computationally tractable metapopulation epidemiological model that captures the joint spatio-temporal evolution of smallpox and opinion dynamics. The computations based on the model show that opinion dynamics has a substantial impact on the fatality count. Towards understanding how perpetrators are likely to seed the infection we identify a) the initial distribution of infected individuals that maximize the overall fatality count regardless of mobility patterns, and b) which habitation structures are more vulnerable to outbreaks. We assess the relative efficacy of different countermeasures and conclude that a combination of vaccines and drugs minimizes the fatalities, and by itself, for smallpox, drugs reduce fatalities more than the vaccine. Accordingly, we assess the efficacies of three separate policies for administering the drugs and identify the best among them for various parameter combinations. When the availability of the drug is finite, we show that increase in its supply substantially reduces the overall fatality. Our findings lead to policy recommendations for public health and urban design authorities towards thwarting smallpox and other infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"Countering the potential re-emergence of a deadly infectious disease - information warfare, identifying strategic threats, launching countermeasures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphical The first major COVID-19 outbreak in Germany occurred in Heinsberg in February 2020 with 388 officially reported cases.

Main funding source(s): Hospital Universitario La Paz INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overloaded health care systems at several fields. Spanish COVID-19 first wave led to the interruption of most cardiac rehabilitation (CRH) programs in our country. Resume activity without compromising patient\\"s safety has been a challenge. At our centre (a third-level hospital), we modified our routine clinical practice from face-to-face interviews to a complete online CRH program since July 1st 2020. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of an online CRH program after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome in health goals and adherence to secondary prevention measures at the end of the program. METHODS: This is a retrospective study made up of patients who, after suffering an acute myocardial infarction, followed an online CRH program from June to November 2020. A first online assessment is made by a cardiology consultant. Then, it is followed by ten online group interviews of up to three patients and a health care proffesional: either a nurse or a physiotherapist. These interviews last around ninety minutes. Four weeks after, an online follow-up interview is made by a cardiology consultant. These interviews focus either on physical exercise instructions (aerobical exercise and endurance exercise) or educational interviews (ischemic cardiomyopathy, Mediterranean diet, pharmacological treatment, sexual dysfunction, stress management techniques and solution of questions). RESULTS: Up to eighty-four patients were included in our CRH program (this means 83% of patients discharged from our hospital after an acute coronary event). Median of time from discharge to first online interview was 8\\"79 days and from this last one to program beginning, 3\\"67 days. Four weeks after the beginning of the program, 82% of the patients presented with a LDL-cholesterol level below aim level (< 55 mg/dL). Workout, Mediterranean diet and tobacco abstinence observance rates were over 90%. There were just three patients who gave up or did not complete the program. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has arisen a huge challenge for ongoing CRH programs in Spain, the benefit that has been showed by them on cardiovascular health, makes it necessary to develop new tools to allow them going on. New technologies are an opportunity for us to keep on following these patients, moreover showing good results as for adherence, availability and patient and operator assesssment.","output":"Impact of an online cardiac rehabilitation program after an acute coronary syndrome during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tracheal intubation and ventilatory support are among the important treatments in patients infected with COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.

Future studies may involve more Nigerian cities, sectors and samples. It may also possibly include quantitative combination to allow generalisation of findings.Practical implicationsIn order to survive in extreme situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, organisations are forced to take drastic and often managerialist-driven work measures which can trigger high stress levels, low productivity and absenteeism among employees. Hence, organisations would benefit from implementing compassion-driven policies that are more inclusive and responsive to the workplace stressors facing employees.Originality/valueEmployee stress has been widely explored in many areas, including definitions, stressors, strains, possible interventions and coping strategies.

In the leadup to widespread vaccine deployment, testing and surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible routes of transmission. Contact tracing has become an important surveillance measure to control COVID-19 in the United States, and mobile health interventions have found increased prominence in this space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use and usability of MyCOVIDKey, a mobile-based web app to assist COVID-19 contact tracing efforts, during the 6-week pilot period. METHODS: A 6-week study was conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The study participants, consisting primarily of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt University, were asked to use the MyCOVIDKey web app during the course of the study period. Paradata were collected as users engaged with the MyCOVIDKey web app. At the end of the study, all participants were asked to report on their user experience in a survey, and the results were analyzed in the context of the user paradata. RESULTS: During the pilot period, 45 users enrolled in MyCOVIDKey. An analysis of their enrollment suggests that initial recruiting efforts were effective; however, participant recruitment and engagement efforts at the midpoint of the study were less effective. App use paralleled the number of users, indicating that incentives were useful for recruiting new users to sign up but did not result in users attempting to artificially inflate their use as a result of prize offers. Times to completion of key tasks were low, indicating that the main features of the app could be used quickly. Of the 45 users, 30 provided feedback through a postpilot survey, with 26 (58%) completing it in its entirety. The MyCOVIDKey app as a whole was rated 70.0 on the System Usability Scale, indicating that it performed above the accepted threshold for usability. When the key-in and self-assessment features were examined on their own, it was found that they individually crossed the same thresholds for acceptable usability but that the key-in feature had a higher margin for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The MyCOVIDKey app was found overall to be a useful tool for COVID-19 contact tracing in a university setting. Most users suggested simple-to-implement improvements, such as replacing the web app framework with a native app format or changing the placement of the scanner within the app workflow. After these updates, this tool could be readily deployed and easily adapted to other settings across the country.

It then extracts multi-level acoustic features to reflect the intrinsic toothprint information for authentication. The key advantages of ToothSonic are that it is suitable for earables and is resistant to various spoofing attacks as the acoustic toothprint is captured via the user's private teeth-ear channel that modulates and encrypts the sonic waves.

MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326C349 and 388C410, with critical residues F(326), T(328), N(333), V(388), G(389), P(390), E(392), I(408), and N(410). Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank? database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.","output":"The CEA/CD3-Bispecific Antibody MEDI-565 (MT111) Binds a Nonlinear Epitope in the Full-Length but Not a Short Splice Variant of CEA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study shows how students can learn about green and sustainable chemistry by using the knowledge perspective of a local indigenous culture as a starting point.

Not only can accurate TC monitoring predict and prevent the spread of contagious illnesses at the worksite, but also can protect workers and athletes from heat-related injuries and illnesses. Although many non-invasive solutions currently exist for conducting spot-checks of TC, the accuracy of these solutions is highly variable, and is dependent upon subject characteristics and their environmental conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new wearable device's TC algorithm in comparison to ground truth TC continuously across 24 h (n=46 male and female subjects for 65 total trials;mean age  SD=31  12 y;age range=18-62 y;mean height  SD=172.2  10.0 cm;mean weight  SD=72.617.9 kg). Subjects ingested a gastrointestinal pill (e-Celsius, BodyCap Inc.) 1 h prior to the start of each trial, and then went about their normal daily routine while wearing a non-invasive wearable device around their upper arm (Kenzen Inc.). Kenzen's wearable device continuously monitors heart rate (via PPG), skin and ambient temperature, relative humidity of the skin and environment, and activity (via accelerometry);gastrointestinal temperatures were recorded every 5 min throughout the monitoring period. Subjects either completed one (n=27 subjects) or two trials (n=19 subjects for 38 trials). Based on gastrointestinal pill transit times, trial times ranged from 8.5 to 84.5 h, with a mean trial time of 34.5 h. To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset to date that has collected ground truth TC continuously throughout a 24 h monitoring period, and across two timepoints. See Table 1 for ground truth TC statistics. Overall accuracy of Kenzen vs. ground truth TC: mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.27C, mean percent error = 0.72%, mean bias = -0.07C, root mean squared error = 0.35C, limits of agreement = 0.68C (see Fig. 1). Subjects? completing two trials had a similar TC range and circadian rhythm of TC during both trials. Resting heart rate was the single best predictor of the TC range for each subject during their trial (r = ?0.41, P=0.01). In conclusion, according to previously established accuracy criteria for TC devices (i.e. MAE 0.27C;Casa et al., JAT, 2007), the Kenzen device can be used as an accurate, non-invasive measurement of continuous core body temperature, where TC ranges from 36-41C.","output":"Accuracy of a wearable device to non-invasively predict continuous core body temperature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elevation of high\\\\sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs\\\\cTn) is a surrogate of myocardial injury, which appears to be a common complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Shortly after, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. The emergence of this virus led many United States governors to enact executive orders in an effort to limit the person-to-person spread of the virus. One state that utilized such measures was New York, which contains New York City (NYC), the most populous city in the United States. Many reports have shown that due to the government-backed shutdowns, the air quality in major global cities improved. However, there has been only limited work on whether this same trend is seen throughout the United States, specifically within the densely populated NYC area. Thus, the focus of this study was to examine whether changes in air quality were observed in NYC resulting from New York State's COVID-19-associated shutdown measures. To do this, daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were obtained from 15 central monitoring stations throughout the five NYC boroughs for the first 17 weeks (January through May) of 2015C2020. Decreases in PM2.5 (36%) and NO2 (51%) concentrations were observed shortly after the shutdown took place; however, using a linear time lag model, when changes in these pollutant concentrations were compared to those measured during the same span of time in 2015C2019, no significant difference between the years were found. Therefore, we highlight the importance of considering temporal variability and long-term trends of pollutant concentrations when analyzing for short-term differences in air pollutant concentrations related to the COVID-19 shutdowns.","output":"Air quality changes in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanoparticles of undoped hematite (-Fe2O3) and Co doped -Fe2O3 were prepared by a simple, green, and cost-efficient process using Co and Fe chlorides and freshly isolated hen egg white.

The incorporation of Co particles into the hematite matrix limits the growth of the -Fe2O3 crystalline grain and favours the apparition of ?3-Fe2O3 phase. SEM analysis reveals that there are no significant morphological differences among -Fe2O3 and Co--Fe2O3 particles, whereas the XPS analysis confirms the existence of Fe and Co particles in the as-prepared samples.

In this study, we analyze the impact of telehealth on neurosurgical healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution and highlight differences in telehealth utilization across different neurosurgical subspecialties. Methods To quantify differences in telehealth utilization, we analyzed all outpatient neurosurgery visits at a single academic institution. Internal surveys were administered to neurosurgeons and to patients to determine both physician and patient satisfaction with telehealth visits. Patient Likelihood-to-Recommend Press Ganey scores were also evaluated. Results There was a decrease in outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic in all neurosurgical subspecialties. Telehealth adoption was higher in spine, tumor, and interventional pain than in functional, peripheral nerve, or vascular neurosurgery. Neurosurgeons agreed that telehealth was an efficient (92%) and effective (85%) methodology; however, they noted it was more difficult to evaluate and bond with patients. The majority of patients were satisfied with their video visits and would recommend video visits over in-person visits. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, neurosurgical subspecialties varied in adoption of telehealth, which may be due to the specific nature of each subspecialty and their necessity to perform in-person evaluations.

By screening purified antibodies and serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinees against 72 S variants with the mSAIS assay, we identified new S mutations that are sensitive and resistant to neutralization. Serum from both infected and vaccinated groups with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) displayed a broader capacity to neutralize S variants than serum with low titer NAbs. These data were validated using serum from a large vaccinated cohort (n=104) with a tiled S peptide microarray. In addition, similar results were obtained using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay specific for wild-type S and four prevalent S variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1), thus demonstrating that high antibody diversity is associated with high NAb titers.

The present survey was thus conducted to assess the knowledge, risk perception, attitude, and preparedness of the dentists in India about COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among registered dentists in India. A self-administered, anonymous, questionnaire comprising of 25 close-ended questions was circulated to gather the relevant information. A total of 765 dentists submitted a response, out of which 646 complete responses were included in the statistical analysis. Pearsons Chi-square test was used for inter-group statistical comparison. RESULTS: The majority (80.8%) of the dentists had a fair knowledge about the characteristics of COVID-19. Nearly 60.7% and 49.7% of the dentists had taken infection control training and special training for COVID-19, respectively. Nearly 50% of the dentists had the perception that COVID-19 is very dangerous. Only 41.8% of the dentists were willing to provide emergency services to patients. Most of the dentists had an opinion that there is a need to enhance personal protective measures. During the survey, it was found that varied technological advances are offered to dentists to ensure good clinical practice. They also concurred that there was a need to standardize the tools and measures available to carry out dental practices. CONCLUSION: In the present study, Indian dentists have presented satisfactory knowledge with adequate preparedness as the majority of them had a fair level of knowledge with significantly higher knowledge among female respondents and those with post-graduation studies.

We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases.

Although no case of SARS-CoV-2 contagion related to surgical smoke has been reported, several international surgical societies recommended caution or even discouraged the use of a laparoscopic approach. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of virus spread due to surgical smoke during surgical procedures. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched PubMed and Scopus for eligible studies, including clinical and preclinical studies assessing the presence of any virus in the surgical smoke from any surgical procedure or experimental model. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 24 studies. No study was found investigating SARS-CoV-2 or any other coronavirus. About other viruses, hepatitis B virus was identified in the surgical smoke collected during different laparoscopic surgeries (colorectal resections, gastrectomies, and hepatic wedge resections). Other clinical studies suggested a consistent risk of transmission for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the surgical treatments of HPV-related disease (mainly genital warts, laryngeal papillomas, or cutaneous lesions). Preclinical studies showed conflicting results, but HPV was shown to have a high risk of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Although all the available data come from different viruses, considering that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown in blood and stools, the theoretical risk of virus diffusion through surgical smoke cannot be excluded. Specific clinical studies are needed to understand the effective presence of the virus in the surgical smoke of different surgical procedures and its concentration. Meanwhile, adoption of all the required protective strategies, including preoperative patient nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19, seems mandatory. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this systematic review, we looked at the risk of virus spread from surgical smoke exposure during surgery. Although no study was found investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or any other coronavirus, we found that the theoretical risk of virus diffusion through surgical smoke cannot be excluded.","output":"Risk of Virus Contamination Through Surgical Smoke During Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Systematic Review of the Literature on a Neglected Issue Revived in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State governments and hospital facilities are often unprepared to handle a complex medical crisis, despite a moral and ethical obligation to be prepared for disaster. The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has drawn attention to the lack of state guidance on how hospitals should provide care in a crisis.

States have a legal responsibility to regulate the medical care within their borders. Failure of hospital facilities to properly prepare for disasters is not a new issue; Hurricane Katrina (2005) demonstrated a lack of planning and coordination.

Public participation in decisions regarding (the relaxation of) these measures has been notably absent, despite being recommended in the literature. Here, as one of the exceptions, we report the results of 30,000 citizens advising the government on eight different possibilities for relaxing lockdown measures in the Netherlands. By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about people's preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to \\"unity\\" and not to \\"division\\". 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option. This increased their awareness of the dilemmas the government faces.","output":"Public participation in crisis policymaking.

We investigated, in natural conceptions and assisted reproductive technique (ART) pregnancies, whether maternal morbidities were more frequent in pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis compared to pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a national cohort of all hospitalizations for births 22 weeks of gestation in France from January to June 2020 using the French national hospitalization database (PMSI). Pregnant women with COVID-19 were identified if they had been recorded in the database using the ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease) code for presence of a hospitalization for COVID-19. A total of 244,645 births were included, of which 874 (0.36%) in the COVID-19 group. Maternal morbidities and adverse obstetrical outcomes among those with or without COVID-19 were analyzed with a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted on patient characteristics. Among pregnant women, older age (31.1 (5.9) years old versus 30.5 (5.4) years old, respectively, p < 0.001), obesity (0.7% versus 0.3%, respectively, p < 0.001), multiple pregnancy (0.7% versus 0.4%, respectively, p < 0.001), and history of hypertension (0.9% versus 0.3%, respectively, p < 0.001) were more frequent with COVID-19 diagnosis. Active smoking (0.2% versus 0.4%, respectively, p < 0.001) and primiparity (0.3% versus 0.4%, respectively, p < 0.03) were less frequent with COVID-19 diagnosis. Frequency of ART conception was not different between those with and without COVID-19 diagnosis (p = 0.28). When compared to the non-COVID-19 group, women in the COVID-19 group had a higher frequency of admission to ICU (5.9% versus 0.1%, p < 0.001), mortality (0.2% versus 0.005%, p < 0.001), preeclampsia/eclampsia (4.8% versus 2.2%, p < 0.001), gestational hypertension (2.3% versus 1.3%, p < 0.03), postpartum hemorrhage (10.0% versus 5.7%, p < 0.001), preterm birth at <37 weeks of gestation (16.7% versus 7.1%, p < 0.001), <32 weeks of gestation (2.2% versus 0.8%, p < 0.001), <28 weeks of gestation (2.4% versus 0.8%, p < 0.001), induced preterm birth (5.4% versus 1.4%, p < 0.001), spontaneous preterm birth (11.3% versus 5.7%, p < 0.001), fetal distress (33.0% versus 26.0%, p < 0.001), and cesarean section (33.0% versus 20.2%, p < 0.001). Rates of pregnancy terminations 22 weeks of gestation, stillbirths, gestational diabetes, placenta praevia, and placenta abruption were not significantly different between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The number of venous thromboembolic events was too low to perform statistical analysis. A limitation of this study relies in the possibility that asymptomatic infected women were not systematically detected. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increased frequency of pregnant women with maternal morbidities and diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to pregnant women without COVID-19. It appears essential to be aware of this, notably in populations at known risk of developing a more severe form of infection or obstetrical morbidities and in order for obstetrical units to better inform pregnant women and provide the best care. Although causality cannot be determined from these associations, these results may be in line with recent recommendations in favor of vaccination for pregnant women.","output":"Obstetrical outcomes and maternal morbidities associated with COVID-19 in pregnant women in France: A national retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are associated with high rates of thromboembolic complications.

However, students and teachers perceive this differently. It is important to study these perceptions to improve the teachingClearning process, and thus to validate the role of online learning in the country. OBJECTIVE: To document the process of a pilot for a questionnaire-based study regarding perception of undergraduate medical students towards on-going online classes. METHODS: Medical Education Department of a teaching hospital developed a new questionnaire with the primary objective of studying the satisfaction and usefulness of the online classes (e-Learning). Content validity was done. For the pilot work, 10% of the total student strength was targeted. Random purposive sampling from each phase of the undergraduate course was done to choose the participants. The questionnaire was administered via Google Classroom. It was an external, undeclared type of pilot. All the responses were documented and analysed for both changes in the questions as well as for statistical sample size derivation for the main study. RESULTS: Responses from 30 students were analysed for the pilot study. Based on the proportion of the level of satisfaction (23.3%) and usefulness (23.3%) of the on-going online classes observed, and with 20% relative precision and 95% confidence, the minimum sample size for the main study was calculated.

Any pulmonologist performing a bronchoscopy procedure was eligible to participate. A total of 18 procedures were observed. Mean particle number and mass concentrations were not elevated during procedures relative to those measured before or after the procedure, on average, but the concentrations were highly variable, exhibiting high levels periodically. Patients frequently coughed during procedures (median 65 coughs, range: 0C565 coughs), and suctioning was commonly performed (median 6.5 suctioning events, range: 0C42). In all procedures, pulmonologists contacted the patient (mean 22.3 contacts, range: 1C48), bronchoscope (mean 19.4 contacts, range: 1C46), and at least one environmental surface (mean 31.2 contacts, range: 3C62).

A 57-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19 via a polymerase chain reaction test and treated as an outpatient with a combination of prednisone and azithromycin. Nine days after his initial diagnosis, he was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure where he required high-flow oxygen support at a maximum of 60 L/minute. Ten days after his admission to the intensive care unit, he was discharged requiring no oxygen at rest, but 2-3 L/minute with exertion. Nine days after his discharge, he was readmitted with a six-day history of bilateral lower extremity weakness, low back pain, diminished sensation, bowel and bladder incontinence, and decreased rectal sensation and tone. Evaluation for cauda equina syndrome was unremarkable; however, cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe central cervical stenosis of C3-4 and C4-5 with spinal cord flattening and intraparenchymal T2 hyperintensity. The examination was notable for muted reflexes in the bilateral lower extremities, T10 sensory level, decreased rectal tone, and ambulation with a walker.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control design for collection of data and a logistic regression prediction model was used. Participants were emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. 33 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and 357 negative patients at Stanford Health Care used for model training. Validation cohorts consisted of emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in Northern California (41 PCR positive, 495 PCR negative), Seattle, Washington (40 PCR positive, 306 PCR negative), Chicago, Illinois (245 PCR positive, 1015 PCR negative), and South Korea (9 PCR positive, 236 PCR negative).

Implementation of NPIs, primarily social distancing and mask wearing, varied widely between communities within the US due to variable government mandates, as well as differences in attitudes and opinions. To understand the interplay of trust, risk perception, behavioral intention, and disease burden, we developed a survey instrument to study attitudes concerning COVID-19 and pandemic behavioral change in three states: Idaho, Texas, and Vermont. We designed our survey (n = 1034) to detect whether these relationships were significantly different in rural populations. The best fitting structural equation models show that trust indirectly affects protective pandemic behaviors via health and economic risk perception. We explore two different variations of this social cognitive model: the first assumes behavioral intention affects future disease burden while the second assumes that observed disease burden affects behavioral intention. In our models we include several exogenous variables to control for demographic and geographic effects. Notably, political ideology is the only exogenous variable which significantly affects all aspects of the social cognitive model (trust, risk perception, and behavioral intention). While there is a direct negative effect associated with rurality on disease burden, likely due to the protective effect of low population density in the early pandemic waves, we found a marginally significant, positive, indirect effect of rurality on disease burden via decreased trust (p = 0.095). This trust deficit creates additional vulnerabilities to COVID-19 in rural communities which also have reduced healthcare capacity. Increasing trust by methods such as in-group messaging could potentially remove some of the disparities inferred by our models and increase NPI effectiveness.","output":"Effects of trust, risk perception, and health behavior on COVID-19 disease burden: Evidence from a multi-state US survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In semantic segmentation, we aim to train a pixel-level classifier to assign category labels to all pixels in an image, where labeled training images and unlabeled test images are from the same distribution and share the same label set.

Hence, in this paper, we consider a new, more realistic, and more challenging problem setting where the pixel-level classifier has to be trained with labeled images and unlabeled open-world images -- we name it open world semantic segmentation (OSS). In OSS, the trained classifier is expected to identify unknown-class pixels and classify known-class pixels well. To solve OSS, we first investigate which distribution that unknown-class pixels obey.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of RV infections in patients admitted to the cardiology unit with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in a tertiary hospitals in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-centre, prospective observational study. A total of 194 adults (aged >21) admitted to the Singapore General Hospital with ADHF were recruited. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human coronavirus (HcoV), adenoviurs, human bocavirus (HboV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RESULTS Twenty-five (13%) had RVs detected by RV multiplex PCR. There comprised 9 rhinoviruses (36%), 4 influenza A viruses (16%), 3 HPIV (12%), 3 HCoV (12%), 2 adenoviruses (8%), 1 human HBoV (4%), 1 hMPV (4%), and 1 RSV (4%). Symptoms-wise, cough was significantly more common in the PCR-positive group (48% vs 24%, P = 0.02). There were no statistically significant differences in laboratory investigations (haemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-muscle/brain, troponin T), and radiology findings between RV PCR-positive and -negative groups. The PCR-positive group did not have increased mortality or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION This study identified a considerable burden of RVs in our ADHF cohort, and highlights the need for prevention of RVs in this group of patients.

ROX is an index that can help in identification of patients with low and those with high risk of intubation. So, this study was planned to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the ROX index for prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia outcome (the need for intubation) and, in addition, to underline the significant association of the ROX index with clinical, radiological, demographic data. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The following data were collected: medical history, clinical classification of COVID-19 infection, the ROX index measured daily and the outcome assessment. RESULTS All patients with severe COVID-19 infection (100%) were intubated (50% of them on the 3rd day of admission), but only 38% of patients with moderate COVID-19 infection required intubation (all of them on the 3rd day of admission). The ROX index on the 1st day of admission was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 clinical classification, CT findings and intubation (p  0.001 for each of them). Regression analysis showed that sex and ROX.1 are the only significant independent predictors of intubation [AOR (95% CI): 16.9 (2.4- 117), 0.77 (0.69-0.86)], respectively. Cut-off point of the ROX index on the 1st day of admission was  25.26 (90.2% of sensitivity and 75% of specificity). CONCLUSIONS ROX is a simple noninvasive promising tool for predicting discontinuation of high-flow oxygen therapy and could be used in the assessment of progress and the risk of intubation in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia.","output":"Validity of ROX index in prediction of risk of intubation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine if calcium scores (CS) could act as a more effective gatekeeper than Diamond Forrester (DF) in the assessment of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

Stable pain was defined as troponin negative pain without symptoms of unstable angina. 250 patients undergoing cardiac CT had both DF scores and CS calculated, with the accuracy of both evaluated against CT coronary angiogram. Criteria given in UK national guidelines were compared. Of the 250 patients, 4 withdrew. 140 (57 %) patients were male. The mean DF was 47.8 and mean CS 172.5. Of the 144 patients with non-anginal pain 19.4 % had significant disease (>50 % stenosis). In general the DF over estimated the presence of CAD whereas the CS reclassified patients to lower risk groups, with 91 in the high risk DF category compared to 26 in the CS. Both receiver operating curve and McNemar Bowker test analysis suggested the DF was less accurate in the prediction of CAD compared to CS [Formula: see text] Projected downstream investigations were also calculated, with the cost per number of significant stenoses identified cheaper with the CS criteria. Patients with suspected stable CAD are more accurately risk stratified by CS compared to the traditional DF.

Prior research has suggested that businesses with strong leadership development practices also demonstrate greater financial success and competitive performance. However, few studies have examined the impact of leadership development on organization-level outcomes, generally, or in the healthcare industry, specifically.Our goal in this study was to examine the association between organizational leadership development practices and external perceptions of creditworthiness in the form of bond ratings. Data were drawn from the 2014 and 2016 distributions of the National Center for Healthcare Leadership's National Health Leadership Survey; organizational credit ratings were obtained from Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Solutions. Spearman's rho correlations and polynomial ranked regressions were used to determine the significance of the relationships between leadership development practices and bond ratings. Results provide preliminary evidence of associations between investing in leadership development and organizational creditworthiness. They also suggest, however, that the most financially successful health systems may de-emphasize certain kinds of leadership development practices relative to their peers.

Health care workers, patients with COVID-19 and other illnesses, children, women, youth, and the elderly are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Virtual mental health services have been established in many settings and social media is being used to impart mental health education and communication resources. This rapid review highlights mental health services across countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. More needs to be done to take these services to scale and ensure equity and efficiency. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health in sub-Saharan Africa could be immense, given the weak health care systems. Similar to the Ebola epidemic of 2014C2016, COVID-19 is expected to cause anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. Uptake of mental health care services is generally low, and communities rely on social resources. Hence, efforts to control the disease transmission should be contextualized. Low digital literacy, low smartphone penetration and limited internet connection make online mental health services a limited option for service delivery. Safeguarding social and cultural resilience factors and coping mechanisms is critical in the sub-Saharan African context. Mass media is a feasible way of providing social resources. Community health workers can be trained quickly to provide mental health education, screening and counselling services. Toll-free mental health helplines can be used to provide services to health care workers and those needing customized care.

Despite tremendous innovation in medical therapy, patients continue to experience refractory congestive symptoms due to adverse left ventricular remodeling, significant functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), and right-sided failure symptoms due to significant functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR). As most of these patients are surgically challenging for open cardiac surgery, the past decade has seen the development and evolution of different percutaneous structural interventions targeted at improving FMR and FTR. There is renewed interest in the sphere of left ventricular restorative devices to effect reverse remodeling and thereby improve effective stroke volume and patient outcomes. For patients suffering from HFpEF, there is still a paucity of disease-modifying effective medical therapies, and these patients continue to have recurrent heart failure exacerbations due to impaired left ventricular relaxation and high filling pressures. Structural therapies involving the implantation of inter-atrial shunt devices to decrease left atrial pressure and the development of implantable devices in the pulmonary artery for real-time hemodynamic monitoring would help redefine treatment and outcomes for patients with HFpEF. Lastly, there is pre-clinical data supportive of soft robotic cardiac sleeves that serve to improve cardiac function, can assist contraction as well as relaxation of the heart, and have the potential to be customized for each patient.

However, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammatory responses remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the regulatory role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in infected cells and attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirions (SCV-2-S) were generated using the spike-expressing virus packaging system. Western blot, mCherry-GFP-LC3 labeling, immunofluorescence, and RNA-seq were performed to examine the regulatory mechanism of SCV-2-S in autophagic response. The effects of SCV-2-S on apoptosis were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Western blot, and flow cytometry analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out to examine the mechanism of SCV-2-S in inflammatory responses. RESULTS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated SCV-2-S infection induced autophagy and apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells. Mechanistically, SCV-2-S inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by upregulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thus promoting the autophagic response. Ultimately, SCV-2-S-induced autophagy triggered inflammatory responses and apoptosis in infected cells. These findings not only improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced pathogenic inflammation but also have important implications for developing anti-inflammatory therapies, such as ROS and autophagy inhibitors, for COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike promotes inflammation and apoptosis through autophagy by ROS-suppressed PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Transesophageal echocardiography is an aerosol-generating procedure, and exercise stress testing is a potentially aerosol-generating activity.

Diabetic retinopathy is a primary vision complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among adults, with 26% prevalence among women. Tele-retina is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care remotely. Screening for diabetic retinopathy has great potential to reduce the incidence of blindness, yet there is an adverse association among screening, income, and gender. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore gender disparity in the provision of tele-retina program services for diabetic retinopathy screening in a cohort of women of low socioeconomic status (SES) receiving services in South Riverdale Community Health Centre (SRCHC) between 2014 and 2019. METHODS: Using a convergent mixed methods design, we want to understand patients', providers', administrators', and decision makers' perceptions of the facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. Multivariate logistic regression will be utilized to assess the association among client characteristics, referral source, and diabetic retinopathy screening. Guided by a grounded theory approach, systematic coding of data and thematic analysis will be utilized to identify key facilitators and barriers to the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. RESULTS: For the quantitative component, we anticipate a cohort of 2500 patients, and we expect to collect data on the overall patterns of tele-retina program use, including descriptions of program utilization rates (such as data on received and completed diabetic retinopathy screening referrals) along the landscape of patient populations receiving these services. For the qualitative component, we plan to interview up to 21 patients and 14 providers, administrators, and decision makers, and to conduct up to 14 hours of observations alongside review of relevant documents. The interview guide is being developed in collaboration with our patient partners. Through the use of mixed methods research, the inquiry will be approached from different perspectives. Mixed methods will guide us in combining the rich subjective insights on complex realities from qualitative inquiry with the standard generalizable data that will be generated through quantitative research.

METHODS: Brazilian legal and regulatory documentation was the basis of this research. The time span from 2000 to 2020 was used to review the legislation. The actual post-market practice in Brazil was examined in detail, and it was pointed out that there is a clear dichotomy between the legal foundation and the patient protective practice. RESULTS: The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency regulates and the Brazilian National Institute of Metrology, Quality, and Technology owns the conformity assessment scheme of medical electrical equipment under a sanitary surveillance system. The conformity assessment is based on a certification process using technical standard series IEC 60601. The certification in its present form does not consider any active post-market surveillance, which is a potential risk for the final users because of the varied medical electrical equipment. From the consumer protection perspective, the objective responsibility of service providers includes accountability to the eventual harm caused by the equipment in normal operation. Therefore, a clear regulation or legislation on post-market technical assistance is of interest to the medical industry and technicians. CONCLUSION: The prospective assurance of the safety and performance of the well-being of citizens would be much more probable to be assured with the renewing of legislation on the post-market evaluation of medical electrical equipment, mainly if international technical standards are used. The dissemination of available medical electrical equipment technology would consequently help public health.

Herein, we investigate the role and effects of GILZ during acute lung injury (ALI) induced by LPS and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. GILZ deficient mice (GILZ(?/?)) presented more severe ALI, characterized by increased inflammation, decreased macrophage efferocytosis and pronounced lung damage. In contrast, pulmonary inflammation, and damage were attenuated in WT mice treated with TAT-GILZ fusion protein. During pneumococcal pneumonia, TAT-GILZ reduced neutrophilic inflammation and prevented the associated lung damage. There was also enhanced macrophage efferocytosis and bacterial clearance in TAT-GILZ-treated mice. Mechanistically, TAT-GILZ enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of pneumococcus, which was lower in GILZ(?/?) macrophages. Noteworthy, early treatment with TAT-GILZ rescued 30% of S. pneumoniae-infected mice from lethal pneumonia. Altogether, we present evidence that TAT-GILZ enhances host resilience and resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia by controlling pulmonary inflammation and bacterial loads leading to decreased lethality.

We used self-administered and postal survey methods to collect data from fourth and fifth-year medical students on online learning perceptions, readiness for online learning, and learning outcomes in two waves. We also collected data from the teachers about their perceptions of online teaching readiness. We received 517 usable students responses (Level-1) and 88 usable teachers responses (Level-2). We tested Level-1 hypotheses about direct and indirect effects in Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS), and a Level-2 hypothesis about moderating effect was tested using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM). The results for the Level-1 hypotheses supported the positive effects of students online learning perceptions and readiness for online learning on learning outcomes. Student readiness for online learning significantly mediated the relationship between online learning perceptions and learning outcomes. HLM results also supported a moderating effect of teachers online teaching readiness on medical students online learning perceptions and learning outcomes in such a way that learning outcomes were high when students online learning perceptions and teachers online teaching readiness were high. Based on the studys findings, we offer contributions to theory and practice.","output":"Medical Students Online Learning Perceptions, Online Learning Readiness, and Learning Outcomes during COVID-19: The Moderating Role of Teachers Readiness to Teach Online"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Smoking negatively impacts COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes. Evidence on whether smoking is associated with SARS-Co-V2 infection and having a positive test is scarce, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, where most of the worlds billion smokers live. The inconsistency in relevant findings calls for study designs and analyses to account for possible confounders including background characteristics and pre-existing co-morbidities, to disentangle the specific effect of smoking. In healthcare workers (HCWs) the frequency of exposure to COVID-19 cases adds another layer of risk that was not factored in previous studies. We examined the association of HCWs tobacco/nicotine use (never, former, and current use) with having a positive SARS-Co-V2 test result and symptoms suggestive of infection, accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 4040 healthcare workers with baseline and follow-up screening took place during AprilCJune 2020 in 12 healthcare facilities in Cairo, Egypt. Data on demographics, tobacco/nicotine use (manufactured or roll-your-own cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco, and electronic devices), co-morbidities, symptoms, exposures, and SARS-Co-V2 investigations were analyzed. Multinomial and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 270/4040 (6.7, 95%CI: 5.9C7.5) had positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 479 (11.9%) were current and 79 (2.0%) were former tobacco/nicotine users. The proportion of positive tests was 7.0% (243/3482, 95%CI: 6.1C7.8) among never, 5.1% (4/79, 95%CI: 0.1C10.0) among former, and 4.8% (23/479, 95%CI: 2.9C6.7) among current users. HCWs SARS-CoV-2 test results did not vary significantly by single/multiple or daily/non-daily tobacco/nicotine use. Compared to never users, former users were more likely to self-report a pre-existing medical condition (OR(adjusted)1.87, 95%CI: 1.05C3.33, p = 0.033), and to experience symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (OR(adjusted)1.76, 95%CI: 1.07C2.90, p = 0.027). After adjustment, former (OR(adjusted)0.45, 95%CI: 0.11C1.89, p = 0.273) and current (OR(adjusted)0.65, 95%CI: 0.38C1.09, p = 0.101) tobacco/nicotine use was not associated with HCWs SARS-CoV-2 positive test results. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on this association from low- and middle-income countries with high tobacco/nicotine use prevalence. In this HCW cohort, having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was not associated with tobacco/nicotine use after accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities. Additional population-based studies could use such preliminary evidence to investigate this controversial association.

Intravenous drug users (IVDU) are presumably at a higher risk of being infected since they have poor personal hygiene, live in groups, and have risky behaviors. The current study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in IVDU in comparison with non-drug users (N-DU). METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on 167 IVDU and 134 N-DU. A questionnaire gathering data on demographics, comorbidities, and use of personal protective equipment was administered to all participants. In addition, 5 cc of blood was taken from each individual to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (Pishtaz Teb SARS-Cov-2 ELISA kits). RESULTS The mean age of N-DU and IVDU were 38.9  12.9 and 40.38  10.24 years, respectively. COVID-19 seroprevalence in IVDU was 9.7%, and 4.8% in N-DU, but this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION While the seroprevalence of COVID-19 was not significantly different among the two groups, IVDU should still be considered by policymakers as a high-risk group due to their lifestyle and risky behaviors.

The eukaryotic actin polymerization/depolymerization cycle is critical for providing force and structure in many processes, including membrane remodeling. In general, Asgard genomes encode two classes of actin-regulating proteins from sequence analysis, profilins and gelsolins. Asgard profilins were demonstrated to regulate actin filament nucleation. Here, we identify actin filament severing, capping, annealing and bundling, and monomer sequestration activities by gelsolin proteins from Thorarchaeota (Thor), which complete a eukaryotic-like actin depolymerization cycle, and indicate complex actin cytoskeleton regulation in Asgard organisms. Thor gelsolins have homologs in other Asgard archaea and comprise one or two copies of the prototypical gelsolin domain. This appears to be a record of an initial preeukaryotic gene duplication event, since eukaryotic gelsolins are generally comprise three to six domains. X-ray structures of these proteins in complex with mammalian actin revealed similar interactions to the first domain of human gelsolin or cofilin with actin. Asgard two-domain, but not one-domain, gelsolins contain calcium-binding sites, which is manifested in calcium-controlled activities. Expression of two-domain gelsolins in mammalian cells enhanced actin filament disassembly on ionomycin-triggered calcium release. This functional demonstration, at the cellular level, provides evidence for a calcium-controlled Asgard actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the calcium-regulated actin cytoskeleton predates eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, dynamic bundled actin filaments are responsible for shaping filopodia and microvilli. By correlation, we hypothesize that the formation of the protrusions observed from Lokiarchaeota cell bodies may involve the gelsolin-regulated actin structures.","output":"Insights into the evolution of regulated actin dynamics via characterization of primitive gelsolin/cofilin proteins from Asgard archaea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of Cannabis sativa L. research for medical purposes has been rapidly advancing in recent decades and a growing body of evidence suggests that phytocannabinoids are beneficial for a range of conditions.

Several mutations have been detected in its genome, but they do not seem to affect the abilities of the virus to spread or infect. We aimed to explore the conserved genomic regions in coronavirus that could contain the key strengths of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were retrieved from Genbank from the period of December 2019 to March 2020. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for 207 sequences using MEGAX compared with the reference sequence (MN908947.3- CHN-Wuhan Dec-2019). The analysis included seven important genomic regions, the ORF1ab gene (21,290 bp), S gene (3,822 bp), Orf3a gene (827 bp), E gene (227 bp), M gene (669 bp), and N gene (1,259 bp), which play critical roles in virus invasion and replication. Furthermore, the variant nucleotides and amino acids were detected by MEGAX and BLAST. Through the phylogenetic analysis and amino acid substitution, the ORF1ab gene showed 11 conserved regions and also several variable sites. The E and M genes were mainly conserved, and all sequences were included in one clade, with one or two amino acid variants. Orf3a and the N gene have four conserved sites distributed along the genes. The S gene has 12 mutations and four main large conserved regionsWe conclude that the favored occurrence of mutations at the ORFab and Orf3a genes during the SARS-CoV epidemic is an important mechanism for virus pathogenesis. The E and M proteins have an almost conserved structure, whereas the S and N genes have many conserved regions, which could serve as possible targets for vaccine design for SARS-CoV.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of variable and conserved genomic regions in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus 2 has spread rapidly around the world and continues to have a massive global health effect, contributing to an infectious respiratory illness called coronavirus infection-19 (COVID-19).

The objective of this study is to identify clinical markers that would predict a better outcome in terms of drop attacks and other types of epileptic seizures. METHODS: We reviewed a retrospective series of children who underwent complete corpus callosotomy at our institution, between January 1998 and February 2019. We analyzed the neurological and cognitive pre- and postoperative status, radiological datas, and electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring data. RESULTS: Fifty children underwent a complete callosotomy at a mean age of 7.5 years. The median postoperative follow-up was 42.5 months. Forty-one patients (82%) had a favorable outcome, 29 (58%) of them becoming totally free of drop attacks. Statistical analysis of correlation between outcome of drop attacks and the characteristics of the patients did not find any trend in terms of age, etiology or developmental level. Regarding seizure types, the probability of being drop attack-free was significantly higher in case of tonic seizures (p = 0.017). Neurological complications occurred in two patients. A transient disconnection syndrome was observed in one child with good preoperative cognitive level. The mean hospital stay was short (5 -10 days).

Results showed a reduction of sexual self-esteem and a decrease in the number of interpersonal sexual relations, although the frequency of masturbation and the consumption of pornography did not vary compared to previous levels. A regression analysis showed that masturbation, the ability to maintain sexual arousal and interpersonal sex were mediating variables in the relationship between gender - specifically being male - and having higher sexual self-esteem during the lockdown.

It brings some clarity on the relationship between sexual self-esteem and gender, about which there is currently no consensus in the scientific literature.","output":"Effect of the Lockdown Due to COVID-19 on Sexuality: The Mediating Role of Sexual Practices and Arousal in the Relationship Between Gender and Sexual Self-Esteem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak is a global public health problem, the disease has spread exponentianally since the end of December 2019, when the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, China Fever is the most common presentation, seen in approximately 88% of cases, cough (68%), vomiting (5%), and diarrhea (3 8%) are the other common symptoms In this case report we are presenting a 34-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with fever that had been ongoing for 3 days Initial diagnostic work up including computerized tomography (CT) scan documented was compatible with viral pneumonia and the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a Brugada -type I pattern,ST segment elevation in the right pericordial leads with no resiprocal changes The patient had no chest pain, or syncope and family history of sudden cardiac death Cardiac enzymes were normal;echocardiographic examination demonstrated normal wall motions and there weren't any pericardial effusion The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was affirmed with positive nasopharengeal swab test for COVID-19 Brugada syndrome is a rare disease manifested by ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads Fever may cause Brugada-like changes in the ECG With reduce of the fever, the Brugada-like ECG changes had also disappeared","output":"Brugada syndrome diagnosed with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global health crisis and mass vaccination programmes provide the best opportunity for controlling transmission and protecting populations. Despite the impressive clinical trial results of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines, important unanswered questions remain, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions. In this position statement endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) section and IBD Clinical Research Group, we consider SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy in patients with IBD. The risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are anticipated to be very low, and we strongly support SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IBD. Based on data from previous studies with other vaccines, there are conceptual concerns that protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be diminished in some patients with IBD, such as those taking anti-TNF drugs. However, the benefits of vaccination, even in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs, are likely to outweigh these theoretical concerns. Key areas for further research are discussed, including vaccine hesitancy and its effect in the IBD community, the effect of immunosuppression on vaccine efficacy, and the search for predictive biomarkers of vaccine success.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease section and IBD Clinical Research Group position statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research has developed a method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 N protein on a paper-based microfluidic chip. The chitosan-glutaraldehyde cross-linking method is used to fix the coated antibody, and the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent method is used to achieve the specific detection of the target antigen. The system studied the influence of coating antibody concentration and enzyme-labeled antibody concentration on target antigen detection. According to the average gray value measured under different N protein concentrations, the standard curve of the method was established and the sensitivity was tested, and its linear regression was obtained. The equation is y = 9.8286x+137.6, R2 = 0.9772 > 0.90, which shows a high degree of fit. When the concentration of coating antibody and enzyme-labeled antibody were 1 g/mL and 2 g/mL, P > 0.05, the difference was not statistically significant, so the lower concentration of 1 g/mL was chosen as the coating antibody concentration. The results show that the minimum concentration of N protein that can be detected by this method is 8 g/mL, and the minimum concentration of coating antibody and enzyme-labeled antibody is 1 g/mL, which has the characteristics of high sensitivity and good repeatability.","output":"Paper-based microfluidic chip for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 N protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water is the common thread and attraction factor of the tourism facilities called spas, which are part of health and beauty services.

Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains. IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.","output":"Trypsin Treatment Unlocks Barrier for Zoonotic Bat Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we will use the differential equations of the SIR model as a non-linear system, by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method to calculate simulated values for known epidemiological diseases related to the time series including the epidemic disease COVID-19, to obtain hypothetical results and compare them with the dailyreal statisticals of the disease for counties of the world and to know the behavior of this disease through mathematical applications, in terms of stability as well as chaos in many applied methods.

In the following weeks, emergency departments in the UK reported a reduction in attendances. We aimed to explore the incidence of emergency calls across North East England, as well as the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) deaths. METHODS: Data were collected for all patients who contacted North East Ambulance Service between 4 March 2019-2 June 2019 and 2 March 2020-31 May 2020 suffering stroke, ST elevation myocardial infarction, allergy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, falls, intoxication, seizure, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome and OHCA. RESULTS: There were a reduction in incidence of calls, excluding OHCA, resulting in ambulance activation during the pandemic compared with same period in 2019, 16 743 versus 19 639, respectively (-14.74%). The decline in calls was partially reversed by the end of May 2020. Incidence of OHCA at the time of the national lockdown had increased by 13.79% with a peak increase of 73.56% in the second week in April 2020. OHCA deaths peaked in the first 2 weeks in April 2020, 95.65% and 90.07%, respectively, but by the end May 2020, incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths had returned to prelockdown levels. CONCLUSION: Incidence of emergency calls were reduced during the pandemic compared with 2019. There was a rise in incidence of OHCA and OHCA deaths during the same period; however, these changes appear transient.

However, we do not yet know how loneliness gets \\"under the skin\\" in ways that may impact the long-term health and development of early adolescents. In particular, loneliness may influence youths' patterns of diurnal cortisol, an index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and a central predictor of health across the lifespan. The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) pandemic represents a salient period in which to study the consequences of loneliness, as recent work has provided evidence that the physical-distancing measures put in place to contain the virus have resulted in greater loneliness, particularly among youth. Thus, the current study aimed to examine the prospective association between loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and diurnal cortisol in early adolescents. We found that greater loneliness was associated with higher levels of cortisol at waking and a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR). These results held even when controlling for covariates that can influence diurnal trajectories of cortisol. Critically, this pattern of HPA-axis functioning increases risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes across adolescence and into adulthood. This study is the first to examine the prospective association between loneliness and diurnal cortisol in early adolescence, and the first to identify mechanisms that contribute to biological markers of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic has further widened the disparities in health care and exposed vulnerable populations. Health care services caring for such populations must not only continue to operate but create innovative methods of care delivery without compromising safety. We present our experience of incorporating telemedicine in our university hospital-based outpatient clinic in one of the worst-hit areas in the world. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to assess the adoption of a telemedicine service in the first month of its implementation in outpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also want to assess the need for transitioning to telemedicine, the benefits and challenges in doing so, and ongoing solutions during the initial phase of the implementation of telemedicine services for our patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective review of clinic operations data from the first month of a telemedicine rollout in the outpatient adult ambulatory clinic from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. A telemedicine visit was defined as synchronous audio-video communication between the provider and patient for clinical care longer than 5 minutes or if the video visit converted to a telephone visit after 5 minutes due to technical problems. We recorded the number of telemedicine visits scheduled, visits completed, and the time for each visit. We also noted the most frequent billing codes used based on the time spent in the patient care and the number of clinical tasks (eg, activity suggested through diagnosis or procedural code) that were addressed remotely by the physicians. RESULTS: During the study period, we had 110 telemedicine visits scheduled, of which 94 (85.4%) visits were completed. The average duration of the video visit was 35 minutes, with the most prolonged visit lasting 120 minutes. Of 94 patients, 24 (25.54%) patients were recently discharged from the hospital, and 70 (74.46%) patients were seen for urgent care needs. There was a 50% increase from the baseline in the number of clinical tasks that were addressed by the physicians during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high acceptance of telemedicine services by the patients, which was evident by a high show rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit.

This is increasingly relevant, with the recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on admission to hospital and critical care being based on the presence of comorbidities and function as opposed to numerical age. Objectives: We performed a systematic review to assess the current qualitative literature exploring attitudes, wishes and perspectives of adult patients with multimorbidity on surviving future acute illness and subsequent acquired functional disability. METHODS: Eligibility criteria: Eligible studies addressed the attitudes, wishes and perspectives of multimorbid adults to illness and treatment-acquired disability using qualitative methods. Information sources: A search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases was conducted from database inception through April 2020. References lists from selected papers and NICE Guidelines on Multimorbidity (NG56) were searched iteratively for additional relevant articles. Review methods: Two researchers reviewed candidate full texts independently. Relevant data was extracted to an evidence table. The risk of bias was avoided by adhering to the previously published extensive search strategy and use of qualitative methodology. RESULTS: From 35606 records of which 6370 were duplicates, 20 full texts were reviewed for inclusion, but none met the eligibility criteria. Coverage of domains of importance to multimorbid adults and those highlighted in the NICE guidelines on multimorbidity (NG56) by the 20 short-listed papers was determined; no publications were found to address all domains. DISCUSSION: No studies were identified which have applied appropriate qualitative methodology to understand the wishes, attitudes, and preferences of multimorbid adults regarding treatment and outcomes of acute illness.

OBJECTIVE We sought to assess food allergy phenotypes in a genetically diverse collection of mice. METHODS We selected 16 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains, as well as the classic inbred C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/cJ strains, for screening. Female mice were sensitized to peanut intragastrically with or without cholera toxin and then challenged with peanut by means of oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection and assessed for anaphylaxis. Peanut-specific immunoglobulins, T-cell cytokines, regulatory T cells, mast cells, and basophils were quantified. RESULTS Eleven of the 16 CC strains had allergic reactions to intraperitoneal peanut challenge, whereas only CC027/GeniUnc mice reproducibly experienced severe symptoms after oral food challenge (OFC). CC027/GeniUnc, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6J mice all mounted a TH2 response against peanut, leading to production of IL-4 and IgE, but only the CC027/GeniUnc mice reacted to OFC. Orally induced anaphylaxis in CC027/GeniUnc mice was correlated with serum levels of Ara h 2 in circulation but not with allergen-specific IgE or mucosal mast cell protease 1 levels, indicating systemic allergen absorption is important for anaphylaxis through the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, CC027/GeniUnc, but not C3H/HeJ or BALB/cJ, mice can be sensitized in the absence of cholera toxin and react on OFC to peanut.

Automatic detecting of pulmonary infections based on computed tomography (CT) images has a huge potential for enhancing the traditional healthcare strategy for treating COVID-19. CT imaging is essential for diagnosis, the process of assessment, and the staging of COVID-19 infection. The detection in association with computed tomography faces many problems, including the high variability, and low density between the infection and normal tissues. Processing is used to solve a variety of diagnostic tasks, including highlighting and contrasting things of interest while taking color-coding into account. In addition, an evaluation is carried out using the relevant criteria for determining the alterations nature and improving a visibility of pathological changes and an accuracy of the X-ray diagnostic report. It is proposed that pre-processing methods for a series of dynamic images be used for these objectives. The lungs are segmented and parts of probable disease are identified using the wavelet transform and the Otsu threshold value. Delta maps and maps created with the Shearlet transform that have contrasting color coding are used to visualize and select features (markers). The efficiency of the suggested combination of approaches for investigating the variability of the internal geometric features (markers) of the object of interest in the photographs is demonstrated by analyzing the experimental and clinical material done in the work. The suggested system indicated that the total average coefficient obtained 97.64% regarding automatic and manual infection sectors, while the Jaccard similarity coefficient achieved 96.73% related to the segmentation of tumor and region infected by COVID-19. ? 2021.

The videolaryngoscope blades have included both traditional Macintosh blades and hyperangulated blades. Macintosh and hyperangulated blades differ in their geometry and technique for tracheal intubation; certain patient populations may benefit from one blade type over another. The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess whether published meta-analyses comparing direct Macintosh laryngoscopy to videolaryngoscopy have accounted for the videolaryngoscope blade type. Secondary objectives evaluated heterogeneity among practitioner experience and specialty, clinical context, patient population, and original primary study outcomes. SOURCE: A search was performed across Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, ClinicalKey, PubMed, TRIP, AccessAnesthesiology, Google Scholar, and ANZCA discovery. A systematic review identified meta-analyses which compared direct Macintosh laryngoscopy to videolaryngoscopy. There were no patient age or clinical specialty restrictions. Exclusion criteria included non-English language, studies comparing non-Macintosh blade to videolaryngoscopy, and studies in awake patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-one meta-analyses were identified that were published between 1 January 2000 and 7 May 2020. Macintosh and hyperangulated videolaryngoscope blades were combined in most studies (16/21; 76%). Heterogeneity was also present among practitioner experience (20/21; 95%), clinician specialty (15/21; 71%), and clinical locations (10/21; 48%). Adult and pediatric patients were combined or not defined in 5/21 studies (24%). The primary outcomes of the meta-analyses varied, with the most common (7/21; 33%) being first-pass tracheal intubation success.

We explored whether people with more frequent and supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during the UK Spring 2020 lockdown, whether this applied to face-to-face and remote electronic contact, and whether people with higher empathy levels, or more frequent pre-COVID social contact with others were more protected. Methods UK dwelling participants aged 18 or older in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about frequency of face-to-face and phone/video social contact, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms assessed with the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern and perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency. Results In 71,117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15) we found that daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower PHQ-9 scores (mean difference 0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225, 0.290) and 0.117 (0.080, 0.154) respectively) compared to having no contact. Those with high social support scored 1.836 (1.801, 1.871) PHQ-9 points lower than those with low support. The odds ratio for depression for those with daily face-to-face social contact compared to no face-to-face contact was 0.712 (0.678, 0.747). Daily compared to no phone/video contact was associated with odds ratio for depression 0.825 (0.779, 0.873). And reporting high, compared to low, social support was associated with 0.145 (95%CI 0.138, 0.152) odds ratio for depression. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability. Conclusions Those who had more face-to-face contact during lockdown had fewer depressive symptoms. Phone or video communication were beneficial but less so. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy were more likely to have depressive symptoms during enforced reduced social contact.

Main funding source(s): Horizon 2020 European Commission Project H2020-MSCA-ITN-2016 BACKGROUND: Although the cardiac burden of COVID-19 has been demonstrated, follow-up imaging studies are scarce. The aim was to use speckle-tracking deformation imaging (STE) to prospectively assess cardiac function during intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation, comparing ventricular and atrial function of COVID-10 patients that died and those that were discharged. METHODS: In a single-centre, COVID-19 patients (n = 41) (71% male, aged 65  11 years) were prospectively followed with echocardiography as part of ICU treatment. The left and right ventricles (LV, RV, respectively) were studied with STE in the 4-chamber cardiac view. The endpoint was defined as death or ICU discharge. Average values of the strain parameters from the first and final scans in the ICU, respectively, were calculated for the two outcome groups. RESULTS: Endpoint was not reached in 15% (n = 6) at the time of analysis. The remaining patients (n = 32) were 69% male, aged 66 (interquartile range (IQR) 60-72) years, and with an ICU mortality 26% (n = 9). The median spent in ICU was 24 (IQR 15-43) days. On average, echocardiography was performed three times during ICU hospitalisation, amounting to 103 examinations. The changes in cardiac strain are shown in Table 1. The change in LV longitudinal strain during ICU hospitalisation is shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: Worsening of LV strain and lack of improvement of RV strain is linked to higher mortality in the ICU. The assessment of cardiac function might contain prognostic information in COVID-19 patients that are admitted to the ICU.","output":"Cardiac function during COVID-19 intensive care unit hospitalisation - deformation analysis and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world is reeling under the effects of the novel corona virus pandemic.

Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1  (IL-1) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1 was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K(+), H(+) and Ca(2+) in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

The incision and temporalis muscle dissection impacts postoperative recovery and cosmetic outcomes. The minipterional (MPT) craniotomy offers similar microsurgical corridors, with a substantially shorter incision, less muscle dissection, and a smaller craniotomy flap. OBJECTIVE To report our experience with the MPT craniotomy in select unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms. METHODS From January 2009 to July 2013, 82 unruptured aneurysms were treated in 72 patients, with 74 MPT craniotomies. Seven patients had multiple aneurysms treated with a single MPT craniotomy. The average patient age was 56 years (range: 24-87). Aneurysms were located along the middle cerebral artery (n = 36), posterior communicating (n = 22), paraophthalmic (n = 22), choroidal (n = 1), and dorsal ICA segments (n = 1). The MPT craniotomy utilized an incision just posterior to the hairline and a single myocutaneous flap. RESULTS The average aneurysm size was 5.45 mm (range: 1-14). There were no instances of compromised operative corridors requiring craniotomy extension. Three significant early postoperative complications included epidural and subdural hematomas requiring evacuation, and a middle cerebral artery infarction. Average length of hospitalization was 3.96 days (range: 2-20). Two patients required reoperation for wound infections. Average follow-up was 421 days (range: 5-1618). Minimal to no temporalis muscle wasting was noted in 96% of patients. CONCLUSION The MPT craniotomy is a worthwhile alternative to the standard pterional craniotomy. There were no instances of suboptimal operative corridors and clip applications when the MPT craniotomy was utilized in the treatment of unruptured middle cerebral artery and supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysms proximal to the terminal internal carotid artery bifurcation.","output":"The minipterional craniotomy for anterior circulation aneurysms: initial experience with 72 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the potential change in trends in the baseline characteristics of patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (M-TEER) over the last decade in a high-volume center.

Patients were divided into quintiles and compared separately. RESULTS: Patients treated in the last quintile had significantly lower surgical risk (Euro Score 7.2  6.8% in the last quintile vs. 10.9  9.4% in the first quintile, p < 0.001), better New York Heart Association (NYHA) status (NYHA IV 14% in the last quintile vs. 40% in the first quintile, p < 0.001), lower NT-pro-BNP, and smaller left ventricle diameter than patients who were treated in the first quintile. There was no difference in age between quintiles. However, an invasive hemodynamic assessment did not show significant changes over the last decade (sPAP 51.35  16.2 mmHg in the first quintile vs. 51.02  14.5 mmHg in the last quintile, p = 0.90, pulmonary capillary wedge V wave 30.7  14.8 mmHg in the first quintile vs. 27.4  10.3 mmHg in the last quintile, p = 0.40). There is a significant trend of a gradually increasing proportion of patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) over the last 10 years (p < 0.001).

Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may protect patients with prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infection or decrease the severity of the disease. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to study the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on COVID-19 in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. All records underwent a two-step screening process to identify the eligible studies. The registered PROSPERO number of this study was CRD42021228398. We evaluated the effect of ADT on the risk of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. RESULTS Six studies met inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this study. We performed meta-analysis on four eligible studies. The overall incidence of COVID-19 was 2.65% among patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT. COVID-19 mortality rate was about 22.7% in ADT (+) patients. ADT did not decrease the risk of any of the major outcomes; infection risk (OR= 0.63, 95% CI= 0.27- 1.48, P= 0.29), hospitalization rate (OR= 0.51, 95% CI= 0.10- 2.53, P= 0.41), ICU admission (OR= 1.11, 95% CI= 0.43- 2.90, P= 0.82), and mortality risk (OR= 1.21, 95% CI= 0.34- 4.32, P= 0.77).

Methods Age, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte(MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR), and C-reactive protein(CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the thresholds for five bio-markers, and their prognostic values were assessed via the KaplanCMeier curve and multivariate COX regression models. Results The median age was 46.4 years old, and 37cases were females. A total of 26.8% of patients had been to Wuhan, and 73.1% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (83.8%) and cough (70.9%) were the two most common symptoms. Elevated NLR and age were significantly associated with illness severity. The binary logistic analysis identified elevated NLR (hazard risk [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98C4.57) and age (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.65C4.83) as independent factors for poor clinical outcome of COVID-19. NLR exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.841, with the highest specificity (63.6%) and sensitivity (88%).

Understanding the utilization and effectiveness of physical literacy in the context of health and the health care setting will support clinical and population health programming. The purpose of this rapid scoping review was to: 1) map the conceptualization of physical literacy as it relates to health; 2) identify and describe the utilization of physical literacy in the context of health and engagement of health care providers; and 3) better understand the relationship between physical literacy, physical activity, and health. METHODS: Following established scoping review methods adapted for a rapid review approach, we searched electronic databases Medline OVID, CINAHL Ebsco, PsycInfo Ebsco, Web of Science ISI, and ERIC Ebsco from conception until September 2019. Tabulation coding was used to identify the key themes across included articles and synthesize findings. The review follows an integrated knowledge translation approach based on a partnership between the health system, community organizations, and researchers. RESULTS: Following removal of duplicates, our search identified 475 articles for title and abstract screening. After full text review, 17 articles were included (12 original research papers and five conceptual or review papers). There was near consensus among included papers with 16 of 17 using the Whiteheadian definition of physical literacy. There was limited involvement of health care providers in the concept of physical literacy. Physical literacy was connected to the following health indicators: BMI and body weight, waist circumference, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour. The primary demographic focus of included studies was children and there was a conceptual focus on the physical domain of physical literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite growing popularity, the empirical evidence base linking physical literacy and health outcomes is limited and the relationship remains theoretical. Physical literacy may present a novel and holistic framework for health-enhancing physical activity interventions that consider factors vital to sustained participation in physical activity across the life course. Future work should continue to explore the nature and direction of the relationship between physical activity and physical literacy to identify appropriate focused approaches for health promotion.","output":"Understanding physical literacy in the context of health: a rapid scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pharmacists are considered to be important sources of drug information (DI) for patients and other healthcare providers. This study aims to examine the characteristics of DI utilization for practicing pharmacists in Jordan and identify the main barriers that impede their ability to utilize them. Method: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between the 27th of November 2020 and 18th of January 2021. Our questionnaire was constructed to explore pharmacists' utilization patterns of DI resources, the types of DI resources they use and barriers impeding them. Results: A total of 1875 pharmacists participated in this study. Only one-fifth of the participating pharmacists reported that they referred to DI databases. The most commonly reported databases/websites were Drugs.com, Jordan FDA, and Medscape. The most commonly reported paper-based resources were Drugs in Jordan, Step up pharmacy, and British Pharmacopeia. The most commonly used mobile applications were Drugs.com, Medscape and Lexicomp. 44% of the pharmacists reported that they use DI resources fewer than five times per week and more than half of them (60.7%, n = 1138) reported that the day-shift was the shift that allowed them more time to use DI resources. Lack of time was the most common barrier (53.2%) that restricted the ability of pharmacists to use DI resources. Conclusion: Using electronic resources is still deficient and far from optimum and interventions to improve the pharmacists' utilization of electronic drug databases are required.

METHODS All members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey using a 20-item questionnaire to collect information on practice preparedness for the COVID-19 outbreak through an email followed by a reminder SMS message between 31 January 2020 and 3 February 2020. RESULTS Of 1589 family doctors invited, 491 (31%) participated in the survey, including 242 (49%) from private sector. In all, 98% surveyed doctors continued to provide clinical services during the survey period, but reduced clinic service demands were observed in 45% private practices and 24% public clinics. Almost all wore masks during consultation and washed hands between or before patient contact. Significantly more private than public doctors (80% vs 26%, P<0.001) experienced difficulties in stocking personal protective equipment (PPE); more public doctors used guidelines to manage suspected patients. The main concern of the respondents was PPE shortage. Respondents appealed for effective public health interventions including border control, quarantine measures, designated clinic setup, and public education. CONCLUSION Family doctors from public and private sectors demonstrated preparedness to serve the community from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak with heightened infection control measures and use of guidelines. However, there is a need for support from local health authorities to secure PPE supply and institute public health interventions.","output":"How are family doctors serving the Hong Kong community during the COVID-19 outbreak?

In the present work, we close a gap in the literature by computing the time delay during the proton tunneling. Our results, based on the well-known dwell time and our model of the entropic time, range from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and completely agree with the time scales of the structural changes in molecules (mutation processes not the complete replication processes). The tunneling delay times are thus nonnegligible and imply that the DNA mutations can be resolved using the attosecond laser technology, if not the femtosecond technology.

A number of other cell entry mediators have also been identified, including neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). More recently, it has been demonstrated that transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) along with TMPRSS2 activate the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, and enhance the viral infection of human small intestinal enterocytes. To date, a systematic analysis of TMPRSS4 in health and disease is lacking. In the present study, using in silico tools, the gene expression and genetic alteration of TMPRSS4 were analysed across numerous tumours and compared to controls. The observations were also expanded to the level of the central nervous system (CNS). The findings revealed that TMPRSS4 was overexpressed in 11 types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, cancer of the rectum, pancreatic cancer, colon and stomach adenocarcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, whilst it was significantly downregulated in kidney carcinomas, acute myeloid leukaemia, skin cutaneous melanoma and testicular germ cell tumours. Finally, a high TMPRSS4 expression was documented in the olfactory tubercle, paraolfactory gyrus and frontal operculum, all brain regions which are associated with the sense of smell and taste. Collectively, these data suggest that TMPRSS4 may play a role in COVID-19 symptomatology as another SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry mediator responsible for the tropism of this coronavirus both in the periphery and the CNS.","output":"COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry mediators: Expression profiling of TMRSS4 in health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"10-O-(N, N-dimethylaminoethyl) ginkgolide B methanesulfonate (XQ-1 H), a novel analog of ginkgolide B, has been preliminarily recognized to show bioactivities against ischemia-induced injury. However, the underlying mechanism still remains to be fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of XQ-1H against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) from the perspective of blood brain barrier (BBB) protection, and explore whether the underlying mechanism is associated with Wnt/GSK3/-catenin signaling pathway activation. The therapeutic effects of XQ-1H were evaluated in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and in immortalized mouse cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd.3) challenged by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Results showed that treatment with XQ-1H improved neurological behavior, reduced brain infarction volume, diminished edema, and attenuated the disruption of BBB in vivo. In vitro, XQ-1H increased cell viability and maintained the barrier function of bEnd.3 monolayer after OGD/R. Moreover, the protection of XQ-1H was accompanied with activation of Wnt/GSK3/-catenin pathway and upregulation of tight junction proteins. Notably, the protection of XQ-1H was abolished by Wnt/GSK3/-catenin inhibitor XAV939 or -catenin siRNA, indicating XQ-1H exerted protection in a Wnt/GSK3/-catenin dependent profile. In summary, XQ-1H attenuated brain injury and maintained BBB integrity after CIRI, and the possible underlying mechanism may be related to the activation of Wnt/GSK3/-catenin pathway and upregulation of tight junction proteins.","output":"XQ-1H regulates Wnt/GSK3/-catenin pathway and ameliorates the integrity of blood brain barrier in mice with acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (C-IVIG) is an unexplored therapy amidst the rapidly evolving spectrum of medical therapies for COVID-19 and is expected to counter the three most life-threatening consequences of COVID-19 including lung injury by the virus, cytokine storm and sepsis. METHODS: A single center, phase I/II, randomized controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted at Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were COVID-19 infected individuals, classified as either severely or critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Participants were randomized through parallel-group design with sequential assignment in a 4:1 allocation to either intervention group with four C-IVIG dosage arms (0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 g/kg), or control group receiving standard of care only (n = 10). Primary outcomes were 28-day mortality, patient's clinical status on ordinal scale and Horowitz index (HI), and were analysed in all randomized participants that completed the follow-up period (intention-to-treat population). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04521309). FINDINGS: Fifty participants were enrolled in the study from June 19, 2020 to February 3, 2021 with a mean age of 56.5413.2 years of which 22 patients (44%) had severe and 28 patients (56%) had critical COVID-19. Mortality occurred in ten of 40 participants (25%) in intervention group compared to six of ten (60%) in control group, with relative risk reduction in intervention arm I (RR, 0.333; 95% CI, 0.087C1.272), arm II (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.171C1.463), arm III (RR, 0.167; 95% CI, 0.024C1.145), and arm IV (RR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.268C1.660). In intervention group, median HI significantly improved to 359 mmHg [interquartile range (IQR) 127C400, P = 0.009)] by outcome day, while the clinical status of intervention group also improved as compared to control group, with around 15 patients (37.5%) being discharged by 7th day with complete recovery. Additionally, resolution of chest X-rays and restoration of biomarkers to normal levels were also seen in intervention groups. No drug-related adverse events were reported during the study.

However, their activities against this enzyme are insufficient and need to be characterized and improved to be of clinical values. Therefore, in this work, by utilizing the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulation method, we achieved multiple unbinding events of Plpro inhibitors, GRL0617, and its derivates, and captured and understood the details of the unbinding pathway. We found that residues of the BL2 loop, such as Tyr268 and Gln269, play major roles in the unbinding pathways, but the most important contributing factor is the natural movements and behavior of the BL2 loop, which can control the entire process.

Clinicians in each participating ICU completed web-based online surveys. Patients: The ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main results: The implementation rate for the elements of the ABCDEF bundle, other supportive ICU care measures, and implementation-associated structures were investigated. Data were collected for 262 patients, of whom 47.3% underwent mechanical ventilation and 4.6% were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Each element was implemented for the following percentages of patients: elements A (regular pain assessment), 45%; B (both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials), 28%; C (regular sedation assessment), 52%; D (regular delirium assessment), 35%; E (early mobility and exercise), 47%; and F (family engagement and empowerment), 16%. The implementation of element E was 4% for patients on mechanical ventilation and 8% for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Supportive care, such as protein provision throughout the ICU stay (under 1.2 g/kg for more than 50% of the patients) and introduction of ICU diary (25%), was infrequent. Implementation rates of elements A and D were higher in ICUs with specific protocols and fewer ICU beds exclusively for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Element E was implemented at a higher rate in ICUs that had more ICU beds assigned for them. Conclusions: This point prevalence study showed low implementation of the ABCDEF bundle.

For this reason, there is a deep need to understand the immunometabolic bases of the main etiological factors of T2D that affect the severity of COVID-19. Here, we discuss how hyperglycemia contributes to the cytokine storm commonly associated with COVID-19 by stimulating monocytes and macrophages to produce interleukin IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the airway epithelium. The main mechanisms through which hyperglycemia promotes reactive oxygen species release, inhibition of T cell activation, and neutrophil extracellular traps in the lungs of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are also studied. We further examine the molecular mechanisms by which proinflammatory cytokines induce insulin resistance, and their deleterious effects on pancreatic -cell exhaustion in T2D patients critically ill with COVID-19. We address the effect of excess glucose on advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation and the role of AGEs in perpetuating pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease - a notion we propose to call \\"digital herd immunity\\", which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel \\"contact tracing\\" phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study in the first place and whose case we discuss briefly.","output":"Digital Herd Immunity and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a COVID-19 epidemic was discovered in Wuhan, China, and since has disseminated around the world impacting human health for millions.

The MolPort database that contains over 100,000 NPs was screened and filtered using molecular docking techniques. Based on calculated docking scores, the top 5,000 NPs/natural-like products (NLPs) were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations. Combined 50 ns MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations revealed nine potent NLPs with binding affinities (&#916;Gbinding ) > -48.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, among the identified NLPs, four bis([1,3]dioxolo)pyran-5-carboxamide derivatives showed &#916;Gbinding > -56.0 kcal/mol, forming essential short hydrogen bonds with HIS163 and GLY143 amino acids via dioxolane oxygen atoms.

The radiotherapy overall treatment time is one of the most important predictive factors in the treatment effectiveness and is associated with better local control and impact on the overall survival. The length of the time from the dia-gnosis to radical radiotherapy or from surgery to adjuvant radiotherapy or the use of alternative fractionation schemes shortening the total treatment time also play an important role. The prevention of prolongation of the radiation series remains a fundamental and well feasible way of applying the time factor in radiotherapy. PURPOSE: Interruption of radiotherapy usually occurs for technical reasons, due to factors at the patients side or for personnel reasons of the department. Standard procedures for the compensation for treatment breaks are part of the treatment protocols at radiotherapy departments. Possible risks of the discontinuation of radiotherapy are considered on the basis of the type and extent of the disease, the treatment intent and the condition of the patient, and the need of compensation for a break in the treatment is set. Patients are classified into three categories according to the above mentioned parameters. Compensation for the pause in radiotherapy is performed by calculating the equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2); the preferred method of compensation is the one which enables observation of the planned total time of radiotherapy without extension. The benefit of local tumor control and the risk of increased acute or especially late toxicity should always be considered. In the current epidemiological situation, radiotherapy is often discontinued for COVID-19, and due to longer breaks in the treatment, it is necessary to combine multiple compensation methods in one patient.","output":"Clinical application of time factor principles in radiotherapy in compensation of radiation series interruptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IL-6 was significantly raised in severe versus mild COVID-19 patients, likely due to its role in cytokine storms, a key contributor to multi-organ failure and acute respiratory distress.

In particular, circular migration remains poorly captured as circular migrants move back and forth between source and destination regions. Based on survey data from rural Bihar, an important source region of migration in India, this paper finds that a vast majority of migrants work and live in precarity in predominantly urban and prosperous destinations across India. However, those at the lowest rungs of the social and economic ladder in source regionsthe scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, other backward classes I and the labouring classare the worst off at destination; they are part of the most precarious shorter-term migration streams, earn the lowest incomes, have the poorest conditions of work, and live in the harshest circumstances. The paper shows that social and economic hierarchies, and in turn, precarity in source region is reproduced at destination, and, thus, there is little evidence that spatial mobility is associated with social mobility. Focusing on migrants location, work, employment, income, housing, and access to basic services at destination, the paper foregrounds migrant precarity and adds to a small body of empirical literature that is significant in understanding the spatial and structural elements of circular migration in India and in turn, the migration crisis that emerged as a result of the economic shock of the COVID 19 pandemic.","output":"Circular Migration and Precarity: Perspectives from Rural Bihar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present study, we analyzed the immune response of calves to Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine (S19) and its association with MHC class I (BoLA-A) alleles (exons 2-3 and 4-5).

The PCR-RFLP analysis revealed five BoLA-A alleles each for exon 2-3 (A10/A19, A19, A18/19, A18 and A31) and exon 4-5 (A, B, C, D and E). Immune response against B. abortus S19 was assessed at the 4th week post vaccination; antibody response by standard tube agglutination test (STAT) and cell-mediated immunity by lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Further, the macrophage function in terms of nitrite production was also analyzed. The association analysis of various BoLA-A alleles with the elicitation of immune response revealed that calves with certain defined genotypes induced significantly higher cell-mediated immune response in terms of lymphocyte proliferation with higher stimulation indices (S.I.) of 1.59 (BoLA-A19), 1.49 (A18/19) and 1.52 (HinfI-D); lymphocyte mediated cytotoxicity (55.52 % in A19) and nitrite production (43.40 M in A31). It is assumed that allelic variants of BoLA-A (exons 2-3 and 4-5) were associated with the differential immune response of calves to B. abortus S19 vaccination.

It uses the latest Brazilian consumption survey (POF 2017/2018) to analyze the composition of household health spending and applies two thresholds of household consumption to identify households facing catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment due to health care payments. Results show that a third of households spend more than 10% of their budget on health, and the share of households facing financial hardship is significantly higher among the Brazilian poor (37% among the bottom consumption deciles). Medicines are the main contributor to component of OOP health spending, reaching 85% of all OOP payments for the lowest consumption deciles. Households with women as household head and those with heads with more years of schooling have higher probability of incurring catastrophic health spending. Yearly, more than 10 million Brazilians are pushed into poverty due to OOP health care payments, which represents a larger percentage of individuals (4.87%) than reported globally (2.5%) or among Latin America and Caribbean countries (1.8%).

We evaluated factors associated with failed de-cannulations to develop a prediction model that could be easily be used at the time of weaning from MV. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 346 tracheostomised patients managed by a standardized de-cannulation program, multivariable logistic regression analysis identified variables that were independently associated with failed de-cannulation. Based on the logistic regression analysis, the new predictive scoring system for successful de-cannulation, referred to as the DECAN score, was developed and then internally validated. RESULTS: The model included age > 67 years, body mass index < 22 kg/m(2), underlying malignancy, non-respiratory causes of mechanical ventilation (MV), presence of neurologic disease, vasopressor requirement, and presence of post-tracheostomy pneumonia, presence of delirium. The DECAN score was associated with good calibration (goodness-of-fit, 0.6477) and discrimination outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.890, 95% CI 0.853C0.921).

Lung resident memory T (T(RM)) cells are sentinels in the secondary immune response. They are mostly differentiated from effector T cells, construct specific niches and stay permanently in lung tissues. If the infection recurs, locally activated lung T(RM) cells can elicit rapid immune response against invading pathogens. In addition, they can significantly limit tumor growth or lead to pathologic immune responses. Vaccines targeting T(RM) cells are under development, with the hope to induce stable and highly reactive lung T(RM) cells through mucosal administration or prime-and-pull strategy.

These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID-19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID-19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID-19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in 'clean' sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus. Importantly, this model has the ability to scale-up activity and lead units and networks into the recovery phase.

Patients without computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-proven PE diagnosis and those who were directly admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) were excluded. Among 1240 patients (58.1% men, mean age 64  17 years), 103 (8.3%) patients had PE confirmed by CTPA. The ICU transfer and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the PE group (for both P < 0.001). In an univariable analysis, traditional venous thrombo-embolic risk factors were not associated with PE (P > 0.05), while patients under therapeutic dose anticoagulation before hospitalization or prophylactic dose anticoagulation introduced during hospitalization had lower PE occurrence [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14C0.91, P = 0.04; and OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.06C0.18, P < 0.001, respectively].

Cisplatin (CDDP) has been utilized to treat NSCLC. However, the efficacy of CDDP is usually restrained owing to the development of drug resistance. This study aims to reveal the molecular mechanism related to the resistance of NSCLC cells to CDDP. METHODS: The expression levels of circRNA_0072088 (circ_0072088), microRNA-944 (miR-944) and LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in CDDP-resistant NSCLC tissues and cells. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting in CDDP-resistant NSCLC tissues and cells. The functional effects of circ_0072088, miR-944 and LASP1 on CDDP sensitivity and NSCLC progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, cell colony formation, wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. The binding relationship between miR-944 and circ_0072088 or LASP1 was identified by a dual-luciferase reporter or RNA immunoprecipitation assay. The effects of circ_0072088 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo were analyzed by an in vivo tumor formation assay. RESULTS: Circ_0072088 and LASP1 expression were significantly upregulated, while miR-944 expression was downregulated in CDDP-resistant NSCLC tissues and cells as compared to control groups. Circ_0072088 expression was significantly associated with tumor-node-metastasis stages and tumor size. Functionally, circ_0072088 knockdown improved CDDP sensitivity and repressed NSCLC cell malignancy, whereas miR-944 inhibitor hindered these effects. Mechanistically, circ_0072088 functioned as a sponge for miR-944 and miR-944 targeted LASP1. Circ_0072088 knockdown improved the sensitivity of tumor to CDDP in vivo. CONCLUSION: Circ_0072088 silencing improved CDDP sensitivity and inhibited NSCLC progression by downregulating LASP1 expression through sponging miR-944. These data provided a novel insight into the study on the resistance of NSCLC to CDDP.","output":"Circ_0072088 knockdown contributes to cisplatin sensitivity and inhibits tumor progression by miR-944/LASP1 axis in non-small cell lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of Covid-19 has caused a pandemic and is a major public health concern. Covid-19 has fundamentally challenged the global health care system in all aspects. However, there is a growing concern for the subsequent detrimental effects of continuing delays or adjustments on time-dependent treatments for Covid-19 negative patients. Patients arriving to the ED with STEMIs and acute CVA are currently presumed to have delays due to Covid-19 related concerns. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid19 patients in emergency care settings. We conducted a retrospective study from February 2020 to April 2020 and compared this to a parallel period in 2019 to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on three distinct non-Covid-19 ED diagnosis that require immediate intervention. Our primary outcome measures were time to primary PCI in acute STEMI, time to fibrinolysis in acute CVA, and time to femoral hip fracture correction surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included a composite outcome of length of stay in hospital and mortality. From 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, the total referrals to ED diagnosed with STEMI, Hip fracture and CVA of which required intervention were 197 within Covid-19 group 2020 compared to 250 in the control group 2019. Mean duration to intervention (PCI, surgery and tPA, respectively) did not differ between COVID-19 group and 2019 group. Among femoral hip fracture patients', the referral numbers to ED were significantly lower in Covid-19 era (p = 0.040) and the hospitalization stay was significantly shorter (p = 0.003). Among CVA patients', we found statistical differences among the number of referrals and the patients' age. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic presents a challenge for the general healthcare system. Our results suggest that with proper management, despite the obstacles of isolation policies and social distancing, any negative impact on the quality of health care for the non-Covid-19 patients can be minimized in the emergency department setting.","output":"The Pandemic's impacts on patients without Covid-19 on multidisciplinary aspects in emergency medicine care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This research examines the equity implications of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 vaccine delivery locations in Aotearoa New Zealand under five potential scenarios: (1) stadium mega-clinics;(2) Community Based Assessment Centres;(3) GP clinics;(4) community pharmacies;and (5) schools METHOD: We mapped the distribution of Aotearoa New Zealand's population and the location of potential vaccine delivery facilities under each scenario Geostatistical techniques identified population clusters for Maori, Pacific peoples and people aged 65 years and over We calculated travel times between all potential facilities and each Statistical Area 1 in the country Descriptive statistics indicate the size and proportion of populations that could face significant travel barriers when accessing COVID-19 vaccinations RESULTS: Several areas with significant travel times to potential vaccine delivery sites were also communities identified as having an elevated risk of COVID-19 disease and severity All potential scenarios for vaccine delivery, with the exception of schools, resulted in travel barriers for a substantial proportion of the population Overall, these travel time barriers disproportionately burden Maori, older communities and people living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation CONCLUSION: The equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines is key to an elimination strategy However, if current health services and facilities are used without well-designed and supported outreach services, then access to vaccination is likely to be inequitable","output":"Will access to COVID-19 vaccine in Aotearoa be equitable for priority populations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid infusion pulse therapy to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with elevated inflammatory biomarkers.

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets twice daily, per os, for 7 to 14 days)  remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + methylprednisolone (once-daily intravenous infusion of 120 mg on days 1, 2 and 3). Control group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets every 12 hours, per os, for 7 to 14 days)  remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + placebo (once-daily intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 0.9% saline on days 1, 2 and 3). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment failure at 14 days after randomisation, defined as: 1) death, 2) need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), 3) initiation of mechanical ventilation, 4) SpO(2) falling to <90% (in ambient air) or PaO(2) <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO(2)FiO(2) <300 mmHg, not explained by a cause other than COVID-19, and/or 5) decrease in PaO(2) 15% from baseline, together with laboratory and radiological deterioration. RANDOMISATION: Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or  75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol. BLINDING (MASKING): The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group).

Electronic financial transactions are gradually taking over traditional banking services in terms of transferring funds, utility payments, insurance premium, mortgages and even stock trading. Despite the widespread popularity of smartphones and the advantages of mobile banking, the adoption rates of the mobile apps have been very low all over the world. Our study explored the consumer acceptance of mobile apps in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by using a structured online questionnaire that was designed using standard variables from the Technology Acceptance Model. Principal component analysis was used to identify and score these factors for the subsequent categorical regression analysis. Consumers were assigned numerical categories depending on their level of usage of the app, and the CATREG nonlinear technique was used to determine the significance of technology acceptance factors. The results show that almost two-thirds of the sample were currently using Mobile Banking apps, and they predominantly belonged to the 30C40 age-group. Perceived usefulness and available information were identified as the main factors influencing acceptance and level of usage of mobile banking apps.

Purpose In this study, silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-loaded nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)@ reduced graphene oxide (RGO) 3D scaffolds (AHRG scaffolds) were designed to alleviate bone infection, inhibit biofilm formation, and promote bone repair through the synergistic effects of AgNPs, RGO, and nHA. Materials and Methods AHRGs were prepared using a one-step preparation method, to create a 3D porous scaffold to facilitate a uniform distribution of AgNPs and nHA. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was used as a model-resistant bacterium, and the effects of different silver loadings on the antimicrobial activity and cytocompatibility of materials were evaluated. Finally, a rabbit IBD model was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the AHRG scaffold in vivo. Results The results showed successful synthesis of the AHRG scaffold. The ideal 3D porous structure was verified using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction measurements revealed uniform distributions of AgNP and nHA. In vitro antibacterial and cytocompatibility indicated that the 4% AHRG scaffolds possessed the most favorable balance of bactericidal properties and cytocompatibility. In vivo evaluation of the IBD model showed promising treatment efficacy of AHRG scaffolds.

Medical oncology communities have developed treatment modifications to balance the risk of contracting the virus with the benefit of improving cancer-related outcomes. METHODS: We systemically examined our community cancer center database to display patterns of change and to unveil factors that have been considered with each decision. We studied a cohort of 282 patients receiving treatment and found that 159 patients (56.4%) had treatment modifications. RESULTS: The incidence of treatment modification was observed in patients undergoing adjuvant and neoadjuvant (41.4%), palliative (62.9%), or injectable endocrine or bone-modulating only (76.0%) treatments. Modifications were applied to regimens with myelosuppressive (56.5%), immunosuppressive (69.2%), and immunomodulating (61.5%) potentials. These modifications also affected intravenous (54.9%) and subcutaneous injectable treatments (62.5%) more than oral treatments (15.8%). Treatment modifications in 112 patients (70.4%) were recommended by providers, and 47 (29.6%) were initiated by patients. The most common strategy of modification was to skip or postpone a scheduled treatment (49%). Among treatment with no modifications, treatment regimens were maintained in patients who tolerated treatment well (37.0%), in treatments with curative intent (22%), and in symptomatic patients who required treatment (14%). CONCLUSION: Our observation and analysis suggested that the primary goal of treatment modification was to decrease potential exposure. The pattern also reflected the negative impact of the pandemic on health care providers who initiated these changes.

These unprecedented measures have had a profound impact on the number and purposes of trips and modes of travel. In China, although the pandemic is now generally under control and transport availability has returned to nearly normal, the extent of the changes in travel behaviour wrought during and after the pandemic still remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the differences in individual travel behaviours during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, using Huzhou as an example. Semi-structured interviews were used to examine the influence of COVID-19 on the travel behaviour and perceptions of different groups. The results indicate that, initially, travel demand was greatly reduced. Second, decreased travel reduced participation in activities, which can have adverse effects on peoples health as well as their subjective well-being. Third, the degree and duration of such impacts varied from person to person. Students, lower income cohorts, groups living in small communities with insufficient green spaces, and those working in tourism, catering, informal businesses and transport-related sectors were more vulnerable than others. Policymakers, urban and transport planners should therefore pay attention to the social inequities that arise from unequal access to transport and heterogeneity between individuals.

Here, we discuss the ways in which donor-reactive memory T cells may arise from environmental exposure to pathogens. Pathogen-specific memory T cells, by virtue of the inherent degeneracy of T-cell receptor recognition of peptide:major histocompatibility complex ligands, may exhibit cross reactivity with allogeneic peptide:major histocompatibility complexes and thereby mediate graft rejection. From the recent explosion in knowledge of the heterogeneity of memory T-cell resulting from variations in frequency and duration of antigen exposure, cytokine milieu, site of priming, and a host of other factors, it is becoming increasingly well appreciated that different memory T-cell populations may exhibit differential susceptibilities to tolerance induction.

Data on medical waste generation at 150 health care establishments were collected for analysis in 2003. General medical waste and infectious waste production at these establishments were examined statistically with the potential associated factors. These factors included the types of hospital and clinic, reimbursement payment by National Health Insurance, total number of beds, bed occupancy, number of infectious disease beds and outpatients per day. The average waste generation rates ranged from 2.41 to 3.26 kg/bed/day for general medical wastes, and 0.19C0.88 kg/bed/day for infectious wastes. The total average quantity of infectious wastes generated was the highest from medical centers, or 3.8 times higher than that from regional hospitals (267.8 vs. 70.3 Tons/yr). The multivariate regression analysis was able to explain 92% of infectious wastes and 64% of general medical wastes, with the amount of insurance reimbursement and number of beds as significant prediction factors.

The primary outcomes were rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 IgG seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody positivity at day 28 and day 69 and immunogenicity dynamics assessed by geometric mean titres (GMTs) of IgG and median neutralising activity in seropositive patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases compared with seronegative patients and seropositive and seronegative controls. We assessed safety in all participants randomly selected for this subgroup analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04754698, and is ongoing for long-term immunogenicity evaluation. FINDINGS: Between Feb 4 and Feb 8, 2021, 1418 patients and 542 controls were recruited, of whom 1685 received two vaccinations (1193 patients and 492 controls). After random sampling, our immunogenicity analysis population comprised 942 participants, of whom 157 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, 157 were seropositive controls, 471 were seronegative patients, and 157 were seronegative controls; the median age was 48 years (IQR 38C56) and 594 (63%) were female and 348 (37%) were male. For seropositive patients and controls, an increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 IgG titres (seropositive patients GMT 523 [95% CI 429C639] at day 0 vs 1289 [1056C1574] at day 28; seropositive controls 533 [454C625] at day 0 vs 2020 [1748C2334] at day 28) and neutralising antibody activity (seropositive patients 59% [IQR 39C83] at day 0 vs 82% [54C96] at day 28; seropositive controls 58% [41C79] at day 0 vs 92% [79C96] at day 28), was observed from day 0 to day 28, without further increases from day 28 to day 69 (at day 69 seropositive patients' GMT was 1371 [1162C1619] and neutralising antibody activity was 79% [57C94]); and seropositive controls' GMT was 1886 [1674C2126] and neutralising antibody activity was 92% [75C96]). By contrast, for seronegative patients and controls, the second dose was required for maximum response at day 69, which was lower in seronegative patients than in seronegative controls. GMTs in seronegative patients were 23 (95% CI 22C23) at day 0, 57 (51C64) at day 28, and 296 (264C333) at day 69, and in seronegative controls were 23 (21C25) at day 0, 106 (87C131) at day 28, and 717 (635C810) at day 69; neutralising antibody activity in seronegative patients was 15% (IQR 15C15) on day 0, 15% (15C15) at day 28, and 39% (15C65) at day 69, and in seronegative controls was 15% (15C15) at day 0, 24% (15C37) at day 28, and 61% (37C79) at day 69. Neither seronegative patients nor seronegative controls reached the GMT or antibody activity levels of seropositive patients at day 69. INTERPRETATION: By contrast with seronegative patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, seropositive patients have a robust response after a single dose of CoronaVac. Our findings raise the possibility that the reduced immunogenicity observed in seronegative patients might not be the optimum response potential to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and therefore emphasise the importance of at least a single booster vaccination in these patients.

Flash glucose monitoring with FreeStyle Libre 2 (FSL2) is a novel alternative to the current standard of care self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). No randomised controlled trials to date have explored the potential benefits of FSL2 in T1D. We aim to assess the impact of FSL2 in people with suboptimal glycaemic control T1D in comparison with SMBG. METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, randomised (via stochastic minimisation), parallel design study conducted at eight UK secondary and primary care centres will aim to recruit 180 people age 16 years with T1D for >1 year and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5%C11%. Eligible participants will be randomised to 24 weeks of FSL2 (intervention) or SMBG (control) periods, after 2-week of blinded sensor wear. Participants will be assessed virtually or in-person owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. HbA1c will be measured at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks (primary outcome). Participants will be contacted at 4 and 12 weeks for glucose optimisation. Control participants will wear a blinded sensor during the last 2 weeks. Psychosocial outcomes will be measured at baseline and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include sensor-based metrics, insulin doses, adverse events and self-report psychosocial measures. Utility, acceptability, expectations and experience of using FSL2 will be explored. Data on health service resource utilisation will be collected. ANALYSIS: Efficacy analyses will follow intention-to-treat principle. Outcomes will be analysed using analysis of covariance, adjusted for the baseline value of the corresponding outcome, minimisation factors and other known prognostic factors. Both within-trial and life-time economic evaluations, informed by modelling from the perspective of the National Health Service setting, will be performed. ETHICS: The study was approved by Greater Manchester West Research Ethics Committee (reference 19/NW/0081). Informed consent will be sought from all participants.

Among them, the actively discussed susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is one of the most reliable. Unfortunately, many factors (i.e., social behaviors) can influence the outcomes as well as the occurrence of multiple contributions corresponding to multiple waves. Therefore, for a reliable evaluation of the conversion rates, data need to be continuously updated and analyzed. In this work, we propose a model using Gaussian functions, coming from the solution of an ordinary differential equation representing a logistic model, able to describe the growth rate of infected, deceased and recovered people in Italy. We correlate the Gaussian parameters with the number of people affected by COVID-19 as a function of the large-scale anti-contagion control measures strength, and also of vaccines effects adopted to reach herd immunity. The superposition of gaussian curves allow modeling the growth rate of the total cases, deceased and recovered people and reproducing the corresponding cumulative distribution and probability density functions. Moreover, we try to predict a time interval in which all people will be infected or vaccinated (with at least one dose) and/or the time end of pandemic in Italy when all people have been infected or vaccinated with two doses.","output":"Gaussian Parameters Correlate with the Spread of COVID-19 Pandemic: The Italian Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness has been associated with poor health. Social capital (SC) could possibly prevent the ill effects of loneliness. The study aims to assess the association of loneliness with physical and mental health in four different communities in Israel and study the impact of structural and cognitive SC on that association. A cross-sectional face-to-face survey with 4620 adults in four towns was conducted. The questionnaire included self-rated health (SRH), mental health (MH), loneliness, cognitive and structural SC and socioeconomic characteristics. Logistic regression analysis and mediation and moderation effects were calculated. Loneliness was associated with worse SRH (OR = 0.4C0.5) and worse MH (OR = 2.0C10). Both SC variables were associated with health. However, towns differ in these associations. Structural SC serves as a significant mediator between loneliness and SRH in all towns and is a mediator between loneliness and MH in two towns. Cognitive social capital was a moderator between loneliness and MH in two towns. This study suggests that increasing SC could possibly compensate for loneliness and buffer its effect on health. The study reinforces the need for the performance of separate health profiles to assess possible interventions for each community, as not always can we generalize these results to all communities.","output":"Social Capital as a Mediator and Moderator in the Association between Loneliness and Health, Israel as a Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Community-based, integrated youth service hubs have the potential to address some of the longstanding issues with mental health services for youth, including problems with access and system fragmentation. Better understanding of these approaches, particularly efforts to create a single point of entry to comprehensive, evidence-based services through youth service hubs, is needed to help guide future implementation and evaluation. This scoping review identifies the key principles and characteristics of these models of care, as well as the state of the literature, particularly with regard to implementation and replicability. Method Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for material from 2001 to 2019, with diverse search terms capturing the concept of \\"integrated\\" or \\"one-stop shop\\" youth mental health services. Title/abstract and full text review were conducted, as well as additional focused searching. After screening 4891 texts at the title/abstract level and 496 at the full-text level, 110 documents were included for data extraction. Results Several integrated care hub models for youth mental health services and related frameworks were identified internationally, largely in high-income countries. Common principles included an emphasis on rapid access to care and early intervention, youth and family engagement, youth-friendly settings and services, evidence-informed approaches, and partnerships and collaboration. Program characteristics also revealed similarities (e.g., providing evidence-informed or evidence-based services in youth-friendly spaces), with some differences (e.g., care coordination methods, types of service providers), potentially attributable to lack of available information about key ingredients. Outcome research was limited, with few rigorous evaluations of youth outcomes. Moreover, sufficient information for replication, community evaluation of feasibility or actual implementation was rarely provided. Conclusion Internationally, integrated youth service hubs were found to share common key principles, while providing comprehensive services to youth with mental health difficulties. There is a great need for common language and measurement framework to facilitate replication, rigorous evaluation of outcomes, knowledge exchange, and dissemination of findings.","output":"Key attributes of integrated community-based youth service hubs for mental health: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Aims To investigate the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and high- resolution CT (HRCT) features and to explore the risk factors for in-hospital death and complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes. Methods From Dec 31, 2019, to Apr 5, 2020, a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes from two hospitals were retrospectively included in our study. Clinical, laboratory and chest CT data were analyzed and compared between the two groups with an admission glucose level of 11mmol/L (group 1) and >11mmol/L (group 2). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the risk factors associated with in-hospital death and complications. Results Of 132 patients, 15 died in hospital and 113 were discharged. Patients in group 2 were more likely to require intensive care unit care (21.4% vs. 9.2%), to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (23.2% vs. 9.25%) and acute cardiac injury (12.5% vs. 1.3%), and had a higher death rate (19.6% vs. 5.3%) than group 1. In the multivariable analysis, patients with admission glucose of >11 mmol/l had an increased risk of death (OR: 7.629, 95%CI: 1.391-37.984) and in-hospital complications (OR: 3.232, 95%CI: 1.393-7.498).

In simple and choice reaction tasks, aerobic exercise appears to increase speed of movement execution while speed of processing is unaffected. In the flanker task, aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce response time on incongruent trials more than congruent trials, purportedly reflecting a selective influence on speed of processing related to cognitive control. However, it is unclear how changes in speed of processing and movement execution contribute to these exercise-induced changes in response time during the flanker task. This study examined how a single session of aerobic exercise influences speed of processing and movement execution during a flanker task using electromyography to partition response time into reaction time and movement time, respectively. Movement time decreased during aerobic exercise regardless of flanker congruence but returned to pre-exercise levels immediately after exercise. Reaction time during incongruent flanker trials decreased over time in both an aerobic exercise and non-exercise control condition indicating it was not specifically influenced by exercise. This disparate influence of aerobic exercise on movement time and reaction time indicates the importance of partitioning response time when examining the influence of aerobic exercise on speed of processing. The decrease in reaction time over time independent of aerobic exercise indicates that interpreting pre-to-post exercise changes in behavior requires caution.","output":"A single aerobic exercise session accelerates movement execution but not central processing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ds les premires heures du confinement de la Covid-19 dans un tablissement dhbergement pour personnes ages dpendantes (EHPAD) du Grand Est, lurgence de protger rsidents et professionnels est mise en balance avec la ncessit dun espace dexpression pour ces derniers, pour cultiver leurs ressources dans leur mission essentielle.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of non-ophthalmic factors on patient decision-making to receive intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 lockdown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on patients who had intravitreal injection appointments at a tertiary care Veterans Health Administration clinic during a seven-week period (March 19, 2020CMay 8, 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Los Angeles County were collected and compared to patients who had intravitreal injection appointments during the same time period in 2019. Demographic characteristics, injection diagnoses, visual acuities, body mass indices, co-morbidities, and psychiatric conditions of patients and clinic volumes were tabulated and compared between the two time periods. RESULTS: There were 86 patients in the injection clinic in 2020 compared to 176 patients in 2019. The mean age and gender of patients in the injection clinic did not differ between 2019 and 2020. Compared to 2019, the number of patients who identified as Hispanic or Latino remained nearly the same, but the number of patients who identified as White, Black, or Asian or Pacific Islander decreased by nearly half. In 2020, a greater proportion of patients came to the injection clinic for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (56.5% vs 39.3%, p=0.017), but a decreased proportion of patients diagnosed with a heart condition (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33, 0.96), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21, 0.91), or asthma (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01, 0.70) came to the injection clinic.

This may be explained by a higher prevalence of patient- or aneurysm-related risk factors for rupture in women than in men or by insufficient power of previous studies. We assessed sex differences in rupture rate taking into account other patient- and aneurysm-related risk factors for aneurysmal rupture. METHODS: We searched Embase and Pubmed for articles published until December 1, 2020. Cohorts with available individual patient data were included in our meta-analysis. We compared rupture rates of women versus men using a Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted for the PHASES score (Population, Hypertension, Age, Size of Aneurysm, Earlier Subarachnoid Hemorrhage From Another Aneurysm, Site of Aneurysm), smoking, and a positive family history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS: We pooled individual patient data from 9 cohorts totaling 9940 patients (6555 women, 66%) with 12 193 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, and 24 357 person-years follow-up. Rupture occurred in 163 women (rupture rate 1.04%/person-years [95% CI, 0.89C1.21]) and 63 men (rupture rate 0.74%/person-years [95% CI, 0.58C0.94]). Women were older (61.9 versus 59.5 years), were less often smokers (20% versus 44%), more often had internal carotid artery aneurysms (24% versus 17%), and larger sized aneurysms (7 mm, 24% versus 23%) than men. The unadjusted women-to-men hazard ratio was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.07C1.93) and the adjusted women/men ratio was 1.39 (95% CI, 1.02C1.90).

The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness-free, disease-free equilibrium are studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness-free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from Colombia and India. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate and the learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease-related deaths.

All the authors described difficulties in addressing social issues in their science textbook writing in the processes of authorization and resistance from science teachers, which located their hope in the transcendent domain. Yet, their immanent hopes with the agency also emerged in the discussion of teachers actions to develop and use alternative texts that engage with local socio-environmental issues, rather than on textbook content innovations.

This approach could be useful in combating COVID-19 surges caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants and should be considered as a countermeasure to future pandemics caused by pre-emergent members, ACE2-dependent CoVs that are poised for zoonosis.","output":"Intranasal gene therapy to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This analysis examined the frequency of dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF) after cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in patients included in a randomized controlled trial comparing dabigatran etexilate with dose-adjusted warfarin (RE-SPECT CVT [A Clinical Trial Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Dabigatran Etexilate With Warfarin in Patients With Cerebral Venous and Dural Sinus Thrombosis]), who had systematic follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. METHODS RE-SPECT CVT was a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, exploratory trial with blinded end point adjudication. We allocated patients with acute CVT to dabigatran 150 mg twice daily or dose-adjusted warfarin, for 24 weeks and obtained a standardized MR protocol including time-of-flight MR angiography, 3-dimensionalphase-contrast venography, and 3-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR venography at the end of the treatment period. A blinded adjudication committee assessed the presence of dAVF in a predefined substudy of the trial. RESULTS We analyzed development of dAVF in 112 of 120 randomized patients; 57 allocated to dabigatran and 55 to warfarin. For 3 (2.7%) of these 112 patients, quality of follow-up imaging was insufficient to evaluate dAVF. A dAVF (Borden I) was found in 1 patient (0.9%) allocated to warfarin; however, this dAVF was already present at baseline. The patient did not present with hemorrhage at baseline or during the trial and was asymptomatic at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Despite systematic imaging, we found no new dAVF 6 months after CVT. Routine follow-up cerebral MR angiography aiming to detect new dAVF 6 months after CVT has a very low yield. REGISTRATION URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Despite the collective efforts in the community to develop models for identifying potential cases of mental disorders, not much work has been done to provide insights that could be used by a predictive system or a health practitioner in the elaboration of a diagnosis. In this paper, we present our research towards better visualising and understanding the factors that characterise and differentiate social media users who are affected by mental disorders from those who are not. Furthermore, we study to which extent various mental disorders, such as depression and anorexia, differ in terms of language use. We conduct different experiments considering various dimensions of language such as vocabulary, psychometric attributes and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that positive instances of mental disorders show significant differences from control individuals in the way they write and express emotions in social media.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Radiology, Shifa International Hospital, from 1st March to June 30th, 2020. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and three consecutive patients' RT PCR positive for COVID-19 were included. Two consultant radiologists, with experience of 7 to 10 years in body imaging, evaluated their HRCT studies in consensus and calculated the CT severity score. A scoring of all 20 individual regions in each lung were assigned by the radiologists attributing a score of 0, 1 or 2 to each region, if parenchymal opacification was none, less than 50%, or 50% or more, respectively. The CT severity score was a summation of scores of all 20 regions of both lungs combined with a range of 0 to 40 points. The scores were compared for clinically mild and severe disease. RESULTS: Significant differences were noted regarding the scoring of lung opacity in mild and severe groups in each lung segment, p <0.05. The most significantly involved segments were right lower lobe's medial and lateral basal segment, left upper lobe's superior lingular segment and left lower lobe's medial basal and lateral basal segments. To discriminate mild versus severe disease, CT-SS threshold value turned out to be 19.5 Conclusion: CTSS may be of value for a prompt and objective means of assessing the degree of severity and disease burden in lungs.

We aimed to study the time profiles of these IgM/IgG levels in COVID-19 patients and their correlations with clinical features. Methods A multicenter clinical study was conducted from February to March 2020. It involved 179 COVID-19 patients (108 males and 71 females) from five hospitals in Huangshi in Hubei Province, China. To detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM/IgG, quantitative antibody assays (two-step indirect immunoassays with direct chemiluminescence technology) based on the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and spike protein 1 (S1) were used. For normally distributed data, means were compared using the t test, 2 test, or exact probability method. For categorical data, medians were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Results The median age was 57(44-69) years (58(38-69) for males and 57(49-68) for females). The median duration of positive nucleic acid test was 22.32 (17.34-27.43) days. The mortality rate was relatively low (3/179, 1.68%). Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was detected around week 1 after illness onset, gradually increased until peaking in weeks 4 and 5, and then declined. Serum IgM peaked in weeks 2 and 3, then gradually declined and returned to its normal range by week 7 in all patients. Notably, children had milder respiratory symptoms with lower SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM/IgG levels. The duration of positive nucleic acid test in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group was 30.36(18.99-34.76) days, which was significantly longer than that in the non-COPD group (21.52(16.75-26.51) days; P=0.011). The peak serum SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was significantly positively correlated with the duration of positive nucleic acid test. The incidence rate of severe and critical cases in the IgMhi group (using the median IgM level of 29.95 AU/ml as the cutoff for grouping) was about 38% (19/50), which was twice as much as that in the IgMlo group (18.37%; 9/49). The patients with positive chest imaging and lymphocytopenia (<1  109/L) had a higher SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM level. Conclusions Quantitative SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels are helpful for the diagnosis, severity classification, and management of COVID-19 patients, and they should be monitored in each stage of this disease.","output":"Clinical Significance of Serum IgM and IgG levels in COVID-19 patients in Hubei Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has spread rapidly, resulting in a worldwide pandemic Even though end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and can develop severe to critical disease, there are limited studies and case reports about COVID-19 in ESRD patients We report a case of a 63-year-old gentleman with ESRD on regular hemodialysis We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment He positively responded to a 14-day course of Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Ribavirin, Azithromycin, and Hydroxychloroquine","output":"A Hemodialysis Patient with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The restrictions experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic had impacts on how clinical teaching and assessment is conducted. The Royal College of Psychiatrists decided to run the final part of the membership exam, the Clinical Assessment of Skills and Competencies (CASC) online for the first time in September 2020. We aimed to prepare candidates in the Northern Ireland deanery for this by developing a virtual mock examination using the Zoom platform. METHOD: In previous years, higher psychiatry trainees in the Northern Ireland deanery have run successful face to face mock examinations to help pre-membership trainees prepare for the CASC. We adapted some of this material to our virtual examination. 16 stations were run in total, in two circuits of eight. These stations were mapped to the Royal College CASC blueprint. Higher trainees were recruited to act as examiners, with core trainees acting as simulated patients. The mock examination was advertised through the local deanery and all candidates sitting in September availed of the opportunity (a total of 8 trainees). Zoom was used as the platform due to ease of use, familiarity and breakout room function. Each station formed one breakout room, and a facilitator moved candidates between rooms and provided timing prompts. Instructions were emailed to candidates in advance. A comfort break was provided between circuits. At the end of the mock examination, everyone was returned to the main room and examiners gave general feedback and tips. Individual feedback was provided by collating mark schemes for each candidate, which included free text feedback, and sending these via email. RESULT: Despite the evident challenges involved, the mock CASC ran smoothly. There was one minor delay of approximately 3 minutes due to technical difficulties, which was easily recouped. We obtained qualitative feedback from candidates which was positive, with trainees commenting that they felt more at ease  less worried about a digital exam, and that it was efficient and effective. All candidates who sat the mock examination were successful in the face to face CASC sitting which followed in September. CONCLUSION: We were able to successfully adapt what was previously an in-person mock CASC exam to the new digital format in a way that reflected how the actual CASC exam will run, and it was considered beneficial preparation by the candidates who sat this mock.

Methods Babies who were hospitalized before the date first coronavirus case was detected in our country were included as control group (CG). The study group was divided into two groups; study group 1 (SG1): the mothers whose babies were hospitalized in the period when mother were asked not to bring breast milk to NICU, study group 2 (SG2): the mothers whose babies were hospitalized after the date we started to use the informed consent form for feeding options. The breast milk delivery rates to NICU during hospitalization and EB rates between discharge and 30th day of life were compared between groups. Results Among 154 mother-baby dyads (CG, n=50; SG1, n=46; SG2, n=58), the percentage of breast milk delivery to NICU was 100%, 79% for CG, SG2, respectively (p<0.001).

People with airways disease are at higher risk of respiratory infection, and viruses can trigger respiratory exacerbations. Patients with airways disease may therefore be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of covid-19, or be at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Here we review susceptibility, based on current epidemiological studies, and explore biological mechanisms. Evidence from multiple large observational studies has shown chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant risk factor for covid-19 related mortality. Whether people with asthma are more susceptible to infection or severe outcomes has been much debated but appears to be related to their asthma phenotype and severity. To what extent these differences are biological or influenced by public health non-pharmacological interventions is difficult to quantify. Biological mechanisms that may influence susceptibility and adverse outcomes in airways disease include the increased expression of protein receptors enabling viral cell entry, dysfunctional epithelial airway immunity, type-2 inflammation and the use of inhaled corticosteroids. A better understanding of the susceptibility and mechanisms is essential for developing preventative and therapeutic strategies.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Shaoxing, and provide an insight into the treatment of COVID-19 across China and elsewhere. Methods In this retrospective, single-center, study, we enrolled 16 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University between February 24 and January 25, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological feature, and treatment data were all collected. Outcomes were followed up until March 16, 2020. Results Among the 16 patients with COVID-19 infection, 11 patients (68.8%) had traveled or lived in Wuhan or surrounding areas, and 2 (12.5%) patients had exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The average age of the patients was 44.1 (16.5) years, and there were 10 women (62.5%) and 6 men (37.5%). More than half had chronic diseases [9 (56.3%)]. The most common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 infection were fever [12 (75%)] and cough [8 (50%)]; 11 (68.8%) patients had lymphopenia, and 12 (75%) had elevated C-reactive protein. On admission, abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) or chest X-ray images were revealed among all patients, and 11 (68.8%) of 16 patients had bilateral involvement. All patients were given psychological counseling, 15 (93.8%) patients were administered with antiviral therapy, 8 (50%) received empirical antibiotic treatment, and 5 (31.3%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation [1 (6.3%)], acute respiratory injury [4 (25%)], acute renal injury [1 (6.3%)], septic shock [1 (6.3%)], liver dysfunction [5 (31.3%)], electrolyte disturbance [8 (50.0%)], and hospital-acquired pneumonia [3 (18.8%)].

SUMMARY ANSWER: The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in the centers following the SEF/ASEBIR screening recommendations was 0.316% after the first survey and 0.364% after the second one WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Due to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, all the Medical Assisted Reproduction (MAR) centers in Spain had to interrupt their activity most of the time during the first pandemic wave. On April 27th activity was restarted, and SEF and ASEBIR jointly elaborated a guide describing their SARS-CoV-2 screening recommendations for MAR centers. This document aims to achieve a safe environment for patients and staff. It includes the possibility of screening patients through a targeted clinical interview and the use of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aim of this study is to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate based on these recommendations. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: National multicenter cross-sectional study. Information was gathered from centers using an anonymous survey asking for aggregated data about the number of positive cases among screened patients, sent twice. The first survey covered the period April 27th - June 30th. Second survey covered July 1st - August 31st. Response rates among centres were 9% (29/319) and 6% (20/319), respectively. This study includes 2,695 and 4,068 screenings performed in the first and the second survey, respectively. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The SEF/ASEBIR recommendations describe two screening strategies. Strategy (a) consists in a targeted clinical interview (TCI) evaluating clinical symptoms and exposure risk, first before starting the cycle, and before egg-retrieval, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and/or embryo transfer (ET). Suspicious cases could be confirmed by further RT-PCR testing. Strategy (b) consists in conducting the same first TCI, and a systematic RT-PCR testing before the medical procedure in all patients. All patients in both strategies have a TCI. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In the 1st survey, 1,177 screenings and 919 RT-PCR (78.07%) were performed before the egg-retrieval. One patient with a negative TCI and positive RT-PCR was detected, and the cycle was cancelled. 1,518 screenings and 1,161 RT-PCRs (76.48%) were performed before the ET/IUI. Two patients with a positive TCI were detected, one did not perform a RT-PCR, while the other resulted in a positive RT-PCR. Both cycles were cancelled. Besides, 5 patients with negative TCI performed a RT-PCR with a positive result; all 5 were cancelled. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 8/2533 (0.316%), of which 7/2533 (0.276%) were identified by RT-PCR testing. The 2nd survey included 1,376 screenings and 1,009 RT-PCR (73.32%) performed before the egg-retrieval. Four patients with negative TCI and further positive RT-PCR were detected, and their cycle was cancelled. 2,692 screenings and 2,134 RT-PCR (79.27%) were performed before ET/IUI. Two patients had a positive TCI, one with a negative, the other with a positive RT-PCR testing; both cycles were cancelled. Besides, 8 patients with negative TCI, but positive RT-PCR testing, were detected and their cycles cancelled. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 14/3846 (0.364%), of which 13/3846 (0.338%) after positive RT-PCR testing. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The criteria for performing the RT-PCR testing were not the same in all MAR Centres or even in the same centre at different times. Due to the low response rate of the study, we should not extend these results to all the MAR Centres in Spain. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results of the surveys suggest that the SEF/ASEBIR recommendations could be a good screening strategy for SARS-Cov-2 at MAR Centres. Further survey collected at different times of the pandemic are warranted, including new strategies for screening as antigen tests or vaccination status.

Changes in ED visit patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect changes in access to outpatient treatment, changes in SUD incidence, or the unintended effects of public policy to mitigate COVID-19. We use a national emergency medicine registry to describe and characterize trends in ED visitation for SUDs since 2019. METHODS: We included all ED visits identified in a national emergency medicine clinical quality registry, which included 174 sites across 33 states with data from January 2019 through June 2021. We defined SUD using ED visit diagnosis codes including: opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD), alcohol use disorders (AUD), and other SUD. To characterize changes in ED utilization, we plotted the 3-week moving average ratio of visit counts in 2020 and 2021 as compared to visit counts in 2019. FINDINGS: While overall ED visits declined in the early pandemic period and had not returned to 2019 baseline by June 2021, ED visit counts for SUD demonstrated smaller declines in March and April of 2020, so that the proportion of overall ED visits that were for SUD increased. Furthermore, in the second half of 2020, ED visits for SUD returned to baseline, and increased above baseline for OUD ever since May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We observe distinct patterns in ED visitation for SUDs over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for OUD for which ED visitation barely declined and now exceeds previous baselines.

We aimed to investigate the perspectives of rheumatology patients on the use of telephone consultations compared with the traditional face-to-face consultation. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective survey of all rheumatology follow-up patients at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust who had received a telephone consultation from a rheumatology consultant during a 4-week period via an online survey tool. RESULTS: Surveys were distributed to 1213 patients, of whom 336 (27.7%) responded, and 306 (91.1%) patients completed all components of the survey. Overall, an equal number of patients would prefer telephone clinics or face-to-face consultations for their next routine appointment. When divided by age group, the majority who preferred the telephone clinics were <50 years old [(2) (d.f. = 3) = 10.075, P = 0.018]. Prevalence of a smartphone was higher among younger patients (<50 years old: 46 of 47, 97.9%) than among older patients (50 years old: 209 of 259, 80.7%) [(2) (d.f. = 3) = 20.919, P < 0.001]. More patients reported that they would prefer a telephone call for urgent advice (168, 54.9%). CONCLUSION: Most patients interviewed were happy with their routine face-to-face appointment being switched to a telephone consultation. Of those interviewed, patients >50 years old were less likely than their younger counterparts to want telephone consultations in place of face-to-face appointments. Most patients in our study would prefer a telephone consultation for urgent advice. We must ensure that older patients and those in vulnerable groups who value in-person contact are not excluded.

This study was designed to compare the maternal and perinatal clinical outcomes in obstetrics patients with COVID-19 between the two waves of infection in Spain. We conducted an observational, analytical, ambispective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up of mothers with confirmed SARV-CoV-2 infection from different hospitals in our country between MarchCNovember 2020. We recruited 1295 pregnant women with SARS-CoV2 infection from 78 hospitals, 846 (65.3%) of whom were diagnosed during the first wave and 449 (34.7%) during the second wave. Our results show that patients developing COVID-19 during the first wave had more symptoms at triage, early in pregnancy with greater rates of COVID-19-related maternal morbidity; caesarean section and preterm birth in the first wave. We register two cases of maternal mortality and only during the first wave. Maternal morbidity events showed a strong link to perinatal mortality events in the first wave compared to the second wave, in which maternal morbidity was more associated with pneumonia. Likewise, maternal morbidity showed a strong correlation with perinatal morbidity events in both waves. We describe the differences between the patients profiles and management between the two waves and related to maternal and perinatal outcomes. Differences were also observed in the management of pregnant women with COVID-19. Thus, there were fewer caesarean sections, and maternal and perinatal morbidity events were reduced in the second wave, while the impacts of respiratory symptoms and their severity, including a greater need for maternal treatment, were greater in this last period.

However, it is still difficult to efficiently control the pollution in time despite numbers of reports on mechanism of ozone pollution. Here we report a method for implementing effective control of ozone pollution through power big data. Combining the observation of surface ozone, NO(2), meteorological parameters together with hourly electricity consumption data from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitting companies, a generalized additive model (GAM) is established for quantifying the influencing factors on the temporal and spatial distribution of surface ozone pollution from 2020 to 2021 in Anhui province, central China. The average R(2) value for the modelling results of 16 cities is 0.82, indicating that the GAM model effectively captures the characteristics of ozone. The model quantifies the contribution of input variables to ozone, with both NO(2) and industrial VOCs being the main contributors to ozone, contributing 33.72% and 21.12% to ozone formation respectively. Further analysis suggested the negative correlation between ozone and NO(2), revealing VOCs primarily control the increase in ozone. Under scenarios controlling for a 10% and 20% reduction in electricity use in VOC-electricity sensitive industries that can be identified by power big data, ozone concentrations decreased by 9.7% and 19.1% during the pollution period. This study suggests a huge potential for controlling ozone pollution through power big data and offers specific control pathways.

We sought to determine the survival benefit of early initiation of aggressive anticoagulation in obese critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 237 intubated patients at a single academic accredited bariatric center and stratified them based on their BMI into 2 groups, obese (BMI > 30) and non-obese (BMI  30). We used chi-square tests to compare categorical variables such as age and sex, and two-sample t-tests or Mann Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether obesity was an independent predictor of survival and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. Survival with respect to BMI and its association with level of anticoagulation in the obese cohort was evaluated using KaplanCMeier models. RESULTS: The overall mortality in the obese and non-obese groups was similar at 47% and 44%, respectively (p = 0.65). Further analysis based on the level of AC showed that obese patients placed on early aggressive AC protocol had improved survival compared to obese patients who did not receive protocol based aggressive AC (ON-aggressive AC protocol 26% versus OFF-aggressive AC protocol 61%, p = 0.0004).

This study is the first investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the current pandemic. METHODS: Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20 to 25 May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher prevalence compared to citizens (odds ratio 13.6, p = 0.001). Having a secondary education as the highest level of education was also significantly associated with high seroprevalence compared to higher education (odds ratio 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%), Madinah (4.1% with an OR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.12-1.94), Jeddah (2.3%; OR 0.27; 95%CI: 0.31-2.25), and Qassim (2.9 %, OR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from the seroprevalence in Makkah region. CONCLUSIONS: At the early stage of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low but was higher among non-citizens These findings showed that non-citizens and the less educated may be less attentive to preventive measures.

Preliminary reports suggest a high incidence of infection and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing KRT in Scotland. METHODS: Study design was an observational cohort study. Data were linked between the Scottish Renal Registry, Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group national data sets using a unique patient identifier (Community Health Index (CHI)) for each individual by the Public Health and Intelligence unit of Public Health, Scotland. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed. RESULTS: During the period 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020, 110 patients receiving KRT tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 amounting to 2% of the prevalent KRT population. Of those affected, 86 were receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. Patients who tested positive were older and more likely to reside in more deprived postcodes. Mortality was high at 26.7% in the dialysis patients and 29.2% in the transplant patients. CONCLUSION: The rate of detected SARS-CoV-2 in people receiving KRT in Scotland was relatively low but with a high mortality for those demonstrating infection.

OBJECTIVES: This scoping review identified the characteristics of research evidence related to mapping the purpose, methodologies used, outcomes, and specific recommendations associated with clinical placement models in undergraduate health professions education. DESIGN: A scoping review method was used in this study. A search string developed from the title of the review was used to search online databases to identify research published between January 2000 and March 2020. RESULTS: Forty-eight articles reporting on ten clinical placement models were included in this review. The majority of these articles originated from Australia and predominantly report on nursing. The aims of these articles aligned with the evaluation of the implementation of a clinical placement model. Seven categories of outcomes of the clinical placement models are reported namely, relationships, influence, environment, facilitation, inputs, knowledge scores, and student perceptions.

Recent evidence points to the important role of reward in SNS behaviours and one avenue to examine reward processes related to SNSs is the use of behavioural paradigms that allow for the measurement of implicit motivational responses, such as the approach avoidance task (AAT). The AAT has been successfully utilised to capture changes in unconscious reward processes in substance use disorders and other behavioural addictions, with faster approach reactions to addiction-related stimuli reflecting increased wanting/urges to have/consume the reward. In the present study 411 young adults completed an online Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task (VAAST) with social media and control logos as well as other subjective (explicit) measures of reward experience related to SNSs. Our results showed that across participants SNS logos elicited strong approach reactions (compared to control stimuli) and that stronger SNS approach tendencies predicted more frequent SNS checking. Importantly, increased approach motivation was not associated with more problematic use. However, both checking frequency and problematic use were related to alterations of explicit reward processing, including the subjective experience of SNS urges or wanting. We conclude that changes in automatic approach motivation towards SNS stimuli are common in most SNS users, which suggests that implicit imbuement of social media with reward has become pervasive among young adults. Problematic SNS use however may be more reliably indicated by changes in explicit reward processing, such as subjective wanting.","output":"The roles of implicit approach motivation and explicit reward in excessive and problematic use of social networking sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health benefits associated with spending time in natural environments have been highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and restrictions to safeguard public health have exacerbated the pre-existing mental health crisis and rise of non-communicable diseases. Thus, the importance of nature as a health resource has been elevated, hastening calls for a better understanding of how health benefits might differ across user groups and nature provisions. In this regard, urban green spaces have become the greatest research focus; however, blue spaces, especially inland freshwater (e.g., wetlands), remain less studied. First-hand user experiences are also under-represented. This exploratory study examines the motivations and benefits of active wetland centre users in the UK, both during and after visits. Responses to three open-ended questions were collated online from 385 participants, and a qualitative content analysis was conducted based on an existing taxonomy from users of urban green spaces. The results showed strong motivations to visit due to the biodiversity at the site (mainly the birdlife), while less tangible nature (e.g., fresh air) and amenities were also important. In contrast to other studies on natural environments, physical activity was a less influential motivation. Salient derived effects included positive and intensely positive emotions, relaxation and mental restoration. After visits to wetland centres, feelings of vitality and satisfaction were the most prominent effects that emerged. For decision-makers looking to leverage inland blue spaces for public health benefit, our results highlight the broad range and relative prominence of the reasons for use and the associated perceived health benefits derived by users of UK wetland centres.

At the time of writing, Northwest Syria (NWS) was outside governmental control and faced the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the emergence of this disease, several studies have looked at the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, predicted its progression, and determined the impact of different preventive measures. While most of these studies' settings were in stable contexts, this study investigated the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northwest Syria, a conflict-affected region, for nine months (from July 2020 to March 2021) using the Suspected-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. We adjusted the SIR model to study the impact of wearing facial masks on the outbreak dynamics and progression. Based on available data and using the basic and adjusted SIR models, we estimated the value of the basic reproduction number (R0), which provides an initial prediction of disease progression. Using the basic SIR model, the estimated R0 for the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Northwest Syria was 2.38. The resulting figures were overestimated in comparison with the reported numbers and data on the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results were significantly reasonable when we adjusted the model for a preventive measure (in this case, wearing face masks). Face masks, the most available preventive measure to be applied in emergency and conflict settings, remarkably affect the outbreak dynamics and may play a key role in controlling and limiting the spread of COVID-19. The novelty of the study is provided by simulating the progress of the COVID-19 outbreak in conflict settings, as it is the first study to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 disease in NWS by adjusting for face-mask-wearing as a preventive measure to explore its impact on outbreak dynamics.","output":"Simulation of the Progression of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Northwest Syria Using a Basic and Adjusted SIR Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which became a global pandemic by March 2020, forced almost all countries over the world to impose the lockdown as a measure of social distancing to control the spread of infection. India also strictly implemented a countrywide lockdown, starting from 24 March to 12 May 2020. This measure resulted in the reduction of the sources of air pollution in general: industrial, commercial, and vehicular pollution in particular, with visible improvement in ambient air quality. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient concentration of air pollutants over the city of Bangalore (India) is assessed using Continuous Ambient Air Quality Measurement (CAAQM) data from 10 monitoring stations spread across the city. The data was obtained from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The analysis of the relative changes in the ambient concentration of six major air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOX, PM2.5, O3, and SO2) has been carried out for two periods: March-May 2020 (COVID-19 lockdown) and the corresponding period of 2019 during when there was no lockdown. The analysis revealed significant reduction in the concentration of ambient air pollutants at both daily and monthly intervals. This can be attributed to the reduction in sources of emission; vehicular traffic, industrial, and other activities. The average reduction in the concentration of NO, NO2, NOX, PM2.5, and O3 between 01 March and 12 May 2020 was found to be 63%, 48%, 48%, 18%, and 23% respectively when compared to the same period in 2019. Similarly, the comparative analysis of pollutant concentrations between pre-lockdown (01-23 March 2020) and lockdown (24 March-12 May 2020) periods has shown a huge reduction in the ambient concentration of air pollutants, 47.3% (NO), 49% (NO2), 49% (NOX), 10% (SO2), 37.7% (PM2.5), and 15.6% (O3), resulting in improved air quality over Bangalore during the COVID-19 lockdown period. It is shown that the strict lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in the pollution levels. Such lockdowns may be useful as emergency intervention strategies to control air pollution in megacities when ambient air quality deteriorates dangerously.","output":"Assessment of air pollution status during COVID-19 lockdown (March-May 2020) over Bangalore City in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this clinical case series, we report our experience to date with neurologic complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to recreate the daily work routines of general practitioners (GPs) and medical assistants (MAs) to explore promising approaches for the digital moderation of delegation processes and to deepen the understanding of subjective and perceptual factors that influence their technology assessment and use. METHODS: We conducted a combination of 19 individual and group interviews with 12 GPs and 14 MAs, seeking to identify relevant technologies for delegation purposes as well as stakeholders perceptions of their effectiveness. Furthermore, a web-based survey was conducted asking the interviewees to order identified technologies based on their assessed applicability in multi-actor patient care. Interview data were analyzed using a three-fold inductive coding procedure. Multidimensional scaling was applied to analyze and visualize the survey data, leading to a triangulation of the results. RESULTS: Our results suggest that digital mediation of delegation underlies complex, reciprocal processes and biases that need to be identified and analyzed to improve the development and distribution of innovative technologies and to improve our understanding of technology use in team-based primary care. Nevertheless, medical delegation enhanced by digital technologies, such as video consultations, portable electrocardiograms, or telemedical stethoscopes, can counteract current challenges in primary care because of its unique ability to ensure both personal, patient-centered care for patients and create efficient and needs-based treatment processes. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-mediated delegation appears to be a promising approach to implement innovative, case-sensitive, and cost-effective ways to treat patients within the paradigm of primary care. The relevance of such innovative approaches increases with the tremendous need for differentiated and effective care, such as during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For the successful and sustainable adoption of innovative technologies, MAs represent essential team members. In their role as mediators between GPs and patients, MAs are potentially able to counteract patients resistance toward using innovative technology and compensate for patients limited access to technology and care facilities.","output":"Investigating the Use of Telemedicine for Digitally Mediated Delegation in Team-Based Primary Care: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main problems in controlling COVID-19 epidemic spread is the delay in confirming cases Having information on changes in the epidemic evolution or outbreaks rise before laboratory-confirmation is crucial in decision making for Public Health policies We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line By modelling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination R-2 &gt; 0 85 This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the laboratory results are available We validate the algorithm with real data We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance of laboratory results One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly We present the details of the explicit example in Villa Azul (Quilmes) where this tool resulted crucial to control an outbreak on time The presented tools have been designed in urgency with the available data at the time of the development, and therefore have their limitations which we describe and discuss We consider possible improvements on the tools, many of which are currently under development","output":"Estimating COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on-stream through phone calls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease can present with varied ophthalmic manifestations like conjunctival congestion, epiphora, chemosis of conjunctiva, cotton wool spots, retinal vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusions.

To identify risks for developing such co-morbidities, we assessed the association of malnutrition, ED illness duration, and pre-morbid weight status with symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents/young adults (AYAs) with EDs. METHODS: 145 participants with restrictive EDs (anorexia nervosa [AN], other specified feeding and eating disorders [OSFED], avoidant restrictive food intake disorder [ARFID]) were included from the RECOVERY study, a longitudinal web-based registry of AYAs with EDs. We measured malnutrition as percent of expected body mass index (%eBMI), based on participants pre-morbid growth trajectory. Outcomes were anxiety and depression scores from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scales. We used multiple linear regression to examine the association of malnutrition, ED duration, and pre-morbid weight status with symptoms of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 16.4(3.0) years; 87% were female; 89% white; 85% had AN, 6% OSFED, 10% ARFID. Of these, 2/3 had ED symptoms 1 year, 1/3 had previous higher level of ED care (HLOC), and half were taking psychiatric medications. Mean %eBMI was 90% (range 57C112%). Mean GAD-7 was 9.4(5.9) and CES-D was 24(13.8), indicating most participants had clinically significant anxiety and/or depression. Degree of malnutrition was not significantly associated with anxiety or depression adjusting for age, sex, sexual orientation, ED diagnosis, and use of psychiatric medication. Those with longer duration of ED symptoms had higher depression scores after adjusting for malnutrition, HLOC, length of ED symptoms, and time in our care (p = 0.038). Patients with pre-morbid BMIs 75th percentile had lower depression scores than those with pre-morbid BMIs <75th percentile (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: We find high degree of clinically relevant anxiety and depression symptoms in a population of AYAs with EDs. Our findings suggest that factors beyond malnutrition play a role in the co-morbid mood and anxiety disorders in this population. Overall, rapid ED diagnosis and comprehensive treatment for patients with EDs across the weight spectrumand especially those with psychiatric co-morbiditieswill likely aid in recovery.","output":"The Association of Malnutrition, illness duration, and pre-morbid weight status with anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents and young adults with restrictive eating disorders: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, a mass spectrometry-based approach was introduced to directly assess the IgG1 immunoglobulin clonal repertoires in plasma. Here we expanded upon this approach by describing a mass spectrometry-based technique to assess specifically the clonal repertoire of another important class of immunoglobulin molecules, IgA1, and show it is efficiently and robustly applicable to either milk or plasma samples. Focusing on two individual healthy donors, whose milk was sampled longitudinally during the first 16 weeks of lactation, we demonstrate that the total repertoire of milk sIgA1 is dominated by only 50-500 clones, even though the human body theoretically can generate several orders of magnitude more clones. We show that in each donor the sIgA1 repertoire only changes marginally and quite gradually over the monitored 16-week period of lactation. Furthermore, the observed overlap in clonal repertoires between the two individual donors is close to non-existent. Mothers provide protection to their newborn infants directly by the transfer of antibodies via breastfeeding. The approach introduced here, can be used to visualize the clonal repertoire transferred from mother to infant and to detect changes in-time in that repertoire adapting to changes in maternal physiology.","output":"A Direct MS-Based Approach to Profile Human Milk Secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA1) Reveals Donor-Specific Clonal Repertoires With High Longitudinal Stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses, however, the lncRNA-mediated genetic networks response to cadmium (Cd) treatment remain elusive in trees, the promising phytoremediation candidates for Cd contamination.

Both angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and insulin/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) show cardioprotective effects after acute MI. The Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism is associated with diminished activity of insulin. In the present study, we explored the association among Arg(972) IRS-1, acute MI, and serum levels of ACE2. METHODS: A total of 711 subjects, including 351 subjects with first-time acute MI and 360 subjects without a history of MI were genotyped for Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism. Serum levels of ACE2 and MI severity scores were determined. Primary human cardiomyocytes with overexpression of wild type IRS-1 or Arg(972) IRS-1 or knockdown of endogenous IRS-1 were exposed to normoxia and hypoxia, and the expression levels of ACE2 were determined. RESULTS: The serum ACE2 level was significantly increased in acute MI patients compared with that of non-MI controls. Compared with wild type IRS-1 carriers, Arg(972) IRS-1 carriers exhibited decreased serum ACE2 levels and increased MI severity scores after MI. Our in vitro data demonstrate that impairment of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling by overexpression of Arg(972)-IRS-1, knockdown of endogenous IRS-1, or PI3K inhibitor can abolish hypoxia-induced IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and ACE2 expression in human cardiomyocytes, which suggests a causal relationship between Arg(972)-IRS-1 and decreased serum ACE2 levels in acute MI patients. Our in vitro data also indicate that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling is required for ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, and that hypoxia can enhance the induction effect of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of crosstalk between insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and RAS after acute MI, thereby adding fresh insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of acute MI.","output":"Arg(972) Insulin receptor substrate-1 is associated with decreased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 levels in acute myocardial infarction patients: in vivo and in vitro evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The tumor microenvironment is an important target of studies in different types of neoplasms.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on psychiatric patients, exacerbating symptoms such as psychosis, depression, and suicidal ideation. Therefore, we aimed to review the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on psychiatric patients and mental healthcare staff and provide practical guidance for medical staff and authorities. The main findings of this review included the impacts of COVID-19 on psychiatric patients and mental health professionals as well as the transformation of mental health care. Greater consideration should be given to the care of patients with psychosis and depression because of their lack of self-care ability, neurocognitive impairment, and impaired immune function. Depressive symptoms can be exacerbated due to several factors, such as economic crises, social isolation, and limited physical activity. Unemployment and financial problems can lead to an increased suicide rate. Consequently, mental healthcare workers workload can increase, which could lead to burnout and psychological symptoms such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety. A transformation of psychiatric care is needed during the time of the pandemic. While emergency care should be maintained, outpatient care should be limited to decrease viral spread. Shifting care to telemedicine and community-based psychiatry can be helpful. Inpatient services should be adapted by tightening admission criteria, shortening the length of hospital stays, suspending some group activities, limiting visitors, and preparing for quarantine if necessary.

Though some researchers have investigated the linkage between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility across different geographical locations and over time, yet these studies are scarce. This study aims to bridge this gap using daily temperature and COVID-19 cases (transmissibility) by employing grey incidence analysis (GIA) models (i.e., Deng's grey incidence analysis (DGIA), the absolute degree GIA (ADGIA), the second synthetic degree GIA (SSDGIA), the conservative (maximin) model) and correlation analysis. Data on temperature are accessed from the NASA database, while the data on COVID-19 cases are collected from the official website of the government of Pakistan. Empirical results reveal the existence of linkages between temperature and COVID-19 in all Pakistani provinces. These linkages vary from a relatively stronger to a relatively weaker linkage. Based on calculated weights, the strength of linkages is ranked across provinces as follows: Gilgit Baltistan (0.715301) > Baluchistan (0.675091) > Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (0.619893) > Punjab (0.619286) > Sindh (0.601736). The disparity in the strength of linkage among provinces is explained by the discrepancy in the intensity of temperature. Besides, the diagrammatic correlation analysis shows that temperature is inversely linked to COVID-19 cases (per million persons) over time, implying that low temperatures are associated with high COVID-19 transmissibility and vice versa. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the linkages between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility for a tropical climate country (Pakistan) using the advanced GIA models. Research findings provide an up-to-date glimpse of the outbreak and emphasize the need to raise public awareness about the devastating impacts of the COVID-19. The educational syllabus should provide information on the causes, signs, and precautions of the pandemic. Additionally, individuals should practice handwashing, social distancing, personal hygiene, mask-wearing, and the use of hand sanitizers to ensure a secure and supportive atmosphere for preventing and controlling the current pandemic.","output":"Does temperature matter for COVID-19 transmissibility?

This study aimed to assess anxiety, hyperarousal stress, the resilience of the Iranian population, and their related factors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 31 provinces in Iran between March 18 and 25, 2020. A four-part questionnaire, including the demographic information, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-y1a 20-item standard questionnaire for obvious anxiety), the ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISCa 25 item standard questionnaire), and the stress hyperarousal subscale from the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), was used to collect data. The ordinal multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to identify correlates of the psychological factors mentioned above. The Fisher exact test was used to investigate the relationship between anxiety, stress, resilience, and the COVID-19 outbreak. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 26 and GIS 10.71. Results: The findings show that most people had moderate-to-severe anxiety (80.17%) and a high level of resilience (96.4%) during the COVID-19 epidemic. The majority of participants had a moderate level of stress (58.9%). The lowest and highest prevalences of psychiatric disorders were in Sistan and Baluchestan (3.14 cases per 100,000 people) and Semnan (75.9 cases per 100,000 people) provinces, respectively. Men and unmarried people were the only variables significantly associated with anxiety and resilience. Age, gender, and education were significantly associated with hyperarousal stress. Conclusion: The high and moderate levels of anxiety and stress in Iranians can have negative effects on the well-being and performance of the people and can lead to serious problems. Also, high resilience during negative life events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) is associated with the well-being in the lives of people.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, and patients were classified as long-COVID-19 or non-long-COVID-19 using consensus criteria. Of 397 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 223 met inclusion criteria, and 62 (27%) had long-COVID-19.

First studies describe a negative impact of pandemic stressors even on individuals without previous mental illnesses. The home lockdown and the shutdown of pain clinics make it difficult for all patients to get the healthcare they need. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent patients with chronic pain felt affected by the pandemic and its consequences on pain treatments, focussing on the beginning of the outbreak. STUDY DESIGN A prospective noninterventional study. SETTING Medical University Center . METHODS One-hundred and forty-nine patients, suffering from chronic pain, treated at a large German interdisciplinary pain center, were studied over a period of 2 months at the beginning of the pandemic. Data from patient charts and questionnaires were evaluated. Patients were asked about postponements or cancellations of pain therapy, the possible effect on pain levels, depression, anxiety and stress, and the impact of intensified hygiene measures. Results were compared to those from standardized and validated questionnaires from the same patients (German version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale = DASS) at the time of the first contact in the pain clinic. RESULTS Eighty-four (56.4%) patients reported cancelled or postponed treatments during the pandemic. Those chronic pain patients with delayed or cancelled treatments reported significantly more pain and psychological distress. The delay or discontinuation of treatments resulted in a deterioration of symptoms. From the patients' point of view this deterioration was unrelated to the timing of treatment and not secondary to increased hygiene measures. In both groups, patients showed a significant amelioration of the DASS values compared to the values they had at the beginning of treatment, despite the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on care structures. The majority of the patients do not think that the quality of pain treatment was significantly affected by the intensified hygiene requirements. LIMITATIONS The limitations of the study are the small number of patients because of the limitation to a short period of time at the beginning of the pandemic and the return rate of 40.2% of the study consents. CONCLUSIONS Even in the event of a pandemic-related restriction of the care structures, patients with chronic pain benefit from pain therapy. Limitations such as the increased hygiene measures caused by the pandemic were not considered detrimental to the therapeutic measures.","output":"Patients with Chronic Pain Prefer Maintenance of Pain Treatment Despite COVID-19 Pandemic Restrictions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marginal zone (MZ) B cells are innate-like B cells that produce poly-reactive antibodies with an affinity for microbial molecular patterns and carbohydrate ligands. MZ B cells have been shown to be important in mediating immunity to various bacteria including Streptococcus pneuomniae and are also implicated in inflammatory syndromes including lupus erythematosus. The intestinal microbiota is responsible for producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which can regulate immune cell function by several mechanisms including ligation of the G-protein coupled receptor, GPR43. Herein, we show that MZ B cells express Gpr43 mRNA and that the absence of this receptor impacts on MZ B cell surface marker expression and antibody production. In T cell-independent responses to the hapten 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid (NP), mice deficient in GPR43 displayed higher serum titres of NP-specific antibodies. Moreover, in response to a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, GPR43-deficient mice developed robust serum antibody responses and had markedly increased numbers of splenic antibody-secreting cells, compared with control mice. Finally, serum IgM autoantibodies to double stranded DNA and phosphatidylcholine were increased in resting 10-15 week-old mice lacking GPR43. Taken together, mice lacking GPR43 have heightened antibody responses to T cell-independent antigens, which may be due to impaired regulation of MZ B cells.","output":"GPR43 regulates marginal zone B cell responses to foreign and endogenous antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer populations remain unknown. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and myelofibrosis (MF) remain a vulnerable patient population and are immunocompromised due to impaired innate and adaptive immunity, heightened inflammation, and effects of ongoing treatment. We evaluate antibody and T-cell responses in MPN patients following completion of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine series. Patients with a known diagnosis of MPN presenting at Massachusetts General Hospital and eligible for COVID-19 vaccination were recruited. All participants gave informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board. 33 MPN patients were enrolled and 23 patients completed vaccination. Baseline and post-vaccination peripheral blood samples were collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated. 26 vaccinated participants with no history of malignancy were included as healthy controls (PMID 33972942). Baseline characteristics are tabled below. Qualitative ELISA for human IgG/A/M against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using donor serum was performed per manufacturer instructions. Seroconversion occurred in 22/23 (96%) of MPN patients and 25/26 (96%) of healthy controls (Figure). To measure SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity, an IFN ELISpot assay previously developed in convalescent and vaccinated healthy individuals was used. Freshly isolated PBMCs from patients were stimulated with commercially available overlapping 15mer peptide pools spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Given its size, the spike protein was split into two pools (Spike A or B). IFN-producing T-cells were quantified by counting the median spot forming units (SFU) per 2.5x10 5 PBMCs from duplicate wells. A positive threshold was defined as >6 SFUs per 2.5x10 5 PBMCs to either Spike A or B after subtraction of background, based on prior receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis of ELISpot responses (sensitivity 90% specificity 92%). Post-vaccination ELISpot responses occurred in 21/23 (91%) of MPN patients and 26/26 (100%) of healthy controls (p=0.99) (Figure). The median SFU to total spike protein (Spike A+B) increased after vaccination in both MPN patients (0 to 38, p=0.02) and healthy controls (6 to 134, p=0.002). MPN patients had significantly lower median SFU's on post-vaccination ELISpot compared to healthy controls (38 vs 134, p=0.044), although this was not significant after adjusting for age in multivariable logistic regression. MF patients had the lowest seroconversion and ELISpot response rates, and lowest median post-vaccination SFUs, although this was not significant. There were no other differences in post-vaccination SFUs with regards to gender, vaccine type, number of days post-vaccine, treatment, and absolute lymphocyte count. Whole-blood assay based on the in vitro diagnostic QuantiFERON TB Gold Plus assay was also used to assess T-cell response. Heparinized whole blood from donors was stimulated with S1 and S2 subdomains for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with measurement of IFN released into plasma with the QuantiFERON ELISA. IFN release of >0.3 IU/mL was considered a positive threshold, based on prior ROC analysis (sensitivity and specificity 100%). MPN patients had significantly lower IFN response rates compared to healthy controls (57% versus 100%, p=0.003) (Figure). Our findings demonstrate robust antibody and T-cell responses to BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccination in MPN patients, with >90% serologic and ELISpot responder rates. We detected subtle differences in T-cell responses in MPN patients compared to healthy controls. MPN patients had lower median post-vaccination ELISpot SFUs and lower rates of T-cell responses on IFN-whole blood assay compared to healthy controls. As the whole blood assay uses whole protein antigen rather than peptide pools, differences from ELISpot testing may reflect deficiencies in antigen processing and presentation. It is unclear whether these subtle differences translate into less clinical protection from COVID-19, or to what extent our results are confounded by the older age of MPN patients. Further evaluation of B and T-cell responses to COVID-19 vaccination in a larger sample size of MPN patients is warranted.

In this context, educators faced the challenge to modify their teaching (planning, design and implementation) in order to answer the need for Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT), which arose during the past months. However, were they ready - or appropriately trained - to teach online at such short notice? What is more, did they manage to integrate the principles of online learning into their teaching practices according to the results of research from the field of educational neuroscience? In order to answer these questions, a qualitative small-scale research was conducted, using interviews with eight educators from private secondary schools in Greece. The research findings lead to the conclusion that the educators lack the theoretical knowledge of relevant learning theories for distance learning and, at the same time, seem to ignore the results of research in educational neuroscience, which clearly suggest the need to integrate multiple representational models into the learning process to activate different areas of the trainee's brain to facilitate the learning of the latter. Moreover, important factors for effective learning, such as collaboration, interaction and time, are neglected during their teaching planning and design.

Clinical studies including &#8805;10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of any study design were eligible. Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A quality effects model was used for the meta-analyses. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression identified sources of heterogeneity. For hospitalized patients, studies were ordered by overall disease severity of each population and this order was used as the modifier variable in meta-regression. Overall, 86 studies (n = 91,621) contributed data to the meta-analyses. Severe disease was strongly associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, any computed tomography findings, any ground glass opacity, lymphocytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, older age and male sex. These variables typically increased in prevalence by 30-73% from mild/early disease through to moderate/severe disease. Among hospitalized patients, 30-78% of heterogeneity was explained by severity of disease. Elevated white blood cell count was strongly associated with more severe disease among moderate/severe hospitalized patients. Elevated lymphocytes, low platelets, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimers showed potential associations, while fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, consolidation and septal thickening showed non-linear association patterns. Headache and sore throat were associated with the presence of disease, but not with more severe disease.

METHODS: Fifty-two structured interviews were conducted with people diagnosed with depression during June 2020 in the province of Zaragoza (Spain). Interviews were conducted by telephone due to lockdown constraints. Inductive thematic content analysis was used to explore, develop, and define emergent categories of analysis, which were mapped against the SDH framework. RESULTS: Listening to peoples experiences of living with depression during lockdown provided insights into their concerns and coping strategies, which are greatly influenced by the conditions in which they live, their job and their age. Examples of these factors include access to and quality of physical spaces, including housing conditions and public spaces for socialising, social support, adverse working conditions which include caring responsibilities, and access to digital technologies and healthcare services.

NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS IN SEVERE COVID-19 IN PUNE, INDIA: Of the 423 patients with severe COVID-19, 20 (4.7%) had pre-existing neurologic co-morbidities, with cerebrovascular disease (8 patients) being the most common. Poliomyelitis (4 patients) was also an important co-morbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Bodyache or myalgia (207/423, 49 %) and headache (59/423, 13.9 %) were the most common neurologic symptoms observed in patients. Encephalopathy (22/423, 5.2 %) and new onset large vessel ischemic stroke secondary to cerebral artery thrombosis (5/423, 1.1%) were the most common secondary neurologic complications noted in our cohort. Two cases of COVID-19/central nervous system tuberculosis co-infection were also identified. CHALLENGES IN MANAGEMENT OF NEURO COVID-19 IN INDIA: Various challenges like an overwhelmed health care system, inadequate workforce, lack of exhaustive reporting of symptoms and poor availability of neuroimaging in ventilated COVID-19 patients leads to underestimation of Neuro COVID-19 in resource limited settings like India.","output":"Neurological issues during severe COVID-19 in a tertiary level hospital in Western India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present research work sought to determine the suitability of applying the Google Classroom platform to develop communicative reading skills in students in the fourth grade of secondary school at the Institucin Educativa Parroquial (I.E.P.) $N","output":"Google Classroom and reading skills in secondary school students at Centro Educativo Parroquial 1327Ancn, Lima, Peru, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital at Home (HaH) provides acute, hospital-level care at home and post-discharge follow-up.

The syndrome has been recognized as a pandemic among physicians. The demanding nature of neurosurgery makes neurosurgeons, particularly prone to burnout. In recent years, pioneering work has shed light on burnout in the field of neurosurgery. METHODS: We have reviewed the literature in PUBMED on burnout in physicians, focusing on neurosurgical publications. RESULTS: In this manuscript, we explore the topic of burnout in neurosurgery by reviewing definitions, magnitude, etiologies, sequelae, and mitigation strategies. CONCLUSION: Ongoing education, recognition, and targeted interventions for neurosurgeons at different career stages are needed to manage burnout proactively and ensure a resilient neurosurgery workforce.","output":"Burnout and work-life balance in neurosurgery: Current state and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the COVID-19 lockdown, the BSc in Human Biology Program of the University of Nicosia switched from face-to-face to online delivery mode.

DESCRIPTION: The Welcome Baby (WB) Program is a voluntary, universal home visiting program for expectant women and women with infants in Los Angeles County implemented in 14 hospitals in Los Angeles County. Oversight of the program is managed by LA Best Babies Network (LABBN) and funded by First 5 LA. The COVID-19 pandemic forced Welcome Baby Home visitors to shift from in-person home visits to virtual visits, which had an impact on programmatic outcomes. ASSESSMENT: LABBN manages a database utilized by WB sites. In assessing data trends before and during the pandemic, shifting to virtual visits resulted in an increase in both missed visits and completed visits, and a decrease in overall visit length. Completion of required assessments and overall client program completion were not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The Welcome Baby sites across Los Angeles County were able to successfully migrate in-person visits to a virtual platform, proving that virtual visits are possible and do provide some programmatic benefits. However, the long-term efficacy of virtual visits remains to be seen, and further research is warranted.","output":"Shifting from in-person to virtual home visiting in Los Angeles County: Impact on programmatic outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, quarantines and sheltering-in-place orders have become important public health tools but, as currently implemented, have eroded human rights, particularly for the marginalized, including essential workers, detainees, women, and children.

The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone 20 mg versus dexamethasone 6 mg. The exploratory objective of this study is to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days. TRIAL DESIGN: REMED is a prospective, phase II, open-label, randomised controlled trial testing superiority of dexamethasone 20 mg vs 6 mg. The trial aims to be pragmatic, i.e. designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in conditions that are close to real-life routine clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: The study is multi-centre and will be conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of ten university hospitals in the Czech Republic. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will be eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Adult (&#8805;18 years of age) at time of enrolment; 2. Present COVID-19 (infection confirmed by RT-PCR or antigen testing); 3. Intubation/mechanical ventilation or ongoing high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy; 4. Moderate or severe ARDS according to Berlin criteria: a? Moderate - PaO2/FiO2 100-200 mmHg; a? Severe - PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg; 5. Admission to ICU in the last 24 hours. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will not be eligible for the trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to dexamethasone or excipients of the investigational medicinal product (e.g. parabens, benzyl alcohol); 2. Fulfilled criteria for ARDS for &#8805;14 days at enrolment; 3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding; 4. Unwillingness to comply with contraception measurements from enrolment until at least 1 week after the last dose of dexamethasone (sexual abstinence is considered an adequate contraception method); 5. End-of-life decision or patient is expected to die within next 24 hours; 6. Decision not to intubate or ceilings of care in place; 7. Immunosuppression and/or immunosuppressive drugs in medical history: a) Systemic immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy in the past 30 days; b) Systemic corticosteroid use before hospitalization; c) Any dose of dexamethasone during the present hospital stay for COVID-19 for &#8805;5 days before enrolment; d) Systemic corticosteroids during present hospital stay for conditions other than COVID-19 (e.g. septic shock); 8. Current haematological or generalized solid malignancy; 9. Any contraindication for corticosteroid administration, e.g. a? intractable hyperglycaemia; a? active gastrointestinal bleeding; a? adrenal gland disorders; a? presence of superinfection diagnosed with locally established clinical and laboratory criteria without adequate antimicrobial treatment; 10. Cardiac arrest before ICU admission; 11. Participation in another interventional trial in the last 30 days. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Dexamethasone solution for injection/infusion is the investigational medicinal product as well as the comparator. The trial will assess two doses, 20 mg (investigational) vs 6 mg (comparator). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily on day 1-5, followed by dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously once daily on day 6-10. Patients in the control group will receive dexamethasone 6 mg day 1-10. All authorized medicinal products containing dexamethasone in the form of solution for i.v. injection/infusion can be used. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days after randomisation, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS: a) Mortality from any cause at 60 days after randomisation; b) Dynamics of inflammatory marker (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) change from Day 1 to Day 14; c) WHO Clinical Progression Scale at Day 14; d) Adverse events related to corticosteroids (new infections, new thrombotic complications) until Day 28 or hospital discharge; e) Independence at 90 days after randomisation assessed by Barthel Index. The long-term outcomes of this study are to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of life at 180 and 360 days through telephone structured interviews using the Barthel Index. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the stratified permuted block randomisation method. Allocation sequences will be prepared by a statistician independent of the study team. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomisation process. The following stratification factors will be applied: a? Age <65 and &#8805; 65; a? Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) <3 and &#8805;3; a? CRP <150 mg/L and &#8805;150 mg/L a? Trial centre. Patients will be randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms. Randomisation through the eCRF will be available 24 hours every day. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial in which the participants and the study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded pre-planned statistical analysis will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is calculated to detect the difference of 3 VFDs at 28 days (primary efficacy endpoint) between the two treatment arms with a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Based on data from a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in COVID-19 ARDS patients in Brazil and a multi-centre observational study from French and Belgian ICUs regarding moderate to severe ARDS related to COVID-19, investigators assumed a standard deviation of VFD at 28 days as 9. Using these assumptions, a total of 142 patients per treatment arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate, 150 per treatment arm (300 patients per study) will be enrolled. TRIAL STATUS: This is protocol version 1.1, 15.01.2021. The trial is due to start on 2 February 2021 and recruitment is expected to be completed by December 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered on EudraCT No.:2020-005887-70, and on December 11, 2020 on ClinicalTrials.gov (Title: Effect of Two Different Doses of Dexamethasone in Patients With ARDS and COVID-19 (REMED)) Identifier: NCT04663555 with a last update posted on February 1, 2021.

A wide variety of liver function test abnormalities and few cases of severe liver failure have been reported. No data on the hepatic phenotype from Europe are available at current. METHODS: We report a case series of 44 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Germany. RESULTS: At the time of admission, aspartate aminotransferase greater than the upper limit of normal was present in 70%, while alanine aminotransferase was elevated in 15.8%. Markers of cholestatic liver injury were altered only in a minority of patients. During hospitalization, 31% and 22% experienced increasing aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, respectively, when transaminases were normal at admission. Severe liver injury defined by 3> upper limit of normal was observed in 9.1% over a mean time of 10.5 days.

The lung contamination is found automatically by chest Computed Tomography images that help to tackle COVID-19. During the separation of the diseased portion from the X-ray slices, it produces lots of demands which include huge difference in the disease attribute and low intensity difference in the middle of infected tissue and usual tissues. The collection of huge quantity of information is impossible in a short period of time and pedagogy of the deep model. For overcoming the Lung disease separation of COVID-19 by using S eg-Net is suggested to analyze the affected portions automatically from chest X-ray scan.

Despite of the advances to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, its tissue tropism and interactions with host cells have not been fully understood. Existing clinical data have suggested possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in human skeleton system. In the present study, we found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 could efficiently infect human and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and alter the expression of macrophage chemotaxis and osteoclast-related genes. Importantly, in a mouse SARS-CoV-2 infection model that was enabled by the intranasal adenoviral (AdV) delivery of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SARS-CoV-2 was found to be present in femoral BMMs as determined by in situ immunofluorescence analysis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we characterized SARS-CoV-2 infection in BMMs. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 entry on BMMs appeared to be dependent on the expression of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) rather than the widely recognized receptor ACE2. It was also noted that unlike brain macrophages which displayed aging-dependent NRP1 expression, BMMs from neonatal and aged mice had constant NRP1 expression, making BMMs constantly vulnerable target cells for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it was found that the abolished SARS-CoV-2 entry in BMM-derived osteoclasts was associated with the loss of NRP1 expression during BMM-to-osteoclast differentiation. Collectively, our study has suggested that NRP1 can mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection in BMMs, which precautions the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human skeleton system.","output":"Neuropilin-1 Mediates SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Managing elderly patients with infection or malfunction deriving from a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) may be challenging. We report the safety and effectiveness of transvenous lead extraction in Chinese octogenarian patients. HYPOTHESIS Transvenous lead extraction can be performed safely and successfully in the Chinese octogenarians. METHODS We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent TLE at our institution between March 2013 and January 2021. This population was divided into the following two groups based solely on age: octogenarians and non-octogenarians. These two groups were compared on the basis of several characteristics and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Consecutive 1106 patients were analyzed, including 184 (16.6%) octogenarians and 922(83.4%) non-octogenarians. The octogenarians presented more comorbidities. A total of 378 leads and 2004 leads were removed from the patients in the octogenarian group and non-octogenarian group, respectively. The mean lead implant duration was 6.1  5.1 and 5.8  4.6 years for octogenarians and non-octogenarians (p = 0.296). The majority of the patients in both groups underwent TLE through the femoral approach (67.5% vs 61.6%, p = 0.14). The complete procedure success rate was similar between the octogenarian and non-octogenarian group (96.7% vs.95.3%, p = 0.39). There were no differences with respect to the proportion of minor, major complications and deaths. Long-term mortality (median time 3.3 years) after TLE in octogenarians was significantly higher compared with younger individuals.

PPP loans were administered by private lenders but federally guaranteed, largely eliminating unobservable credit risk as a factor in explaining differential lending by race. We document that even after controlling for a firms zip code, industry, loan size, PPP approval date, and other characteristics, Black-owned businesses were 12.1 percentage points (70% of the mean) more likely to obtain their PPP loan from a fintech lender than a traditional bank. Among conventional lenders, smaller banks were much less likely to lend to Black-owned firms, while the Top-4 banks exhibited little to no disparity after including controls. We use novel data to show that the disparity is not primarily explained by differences in pre-existing bank or credit relationships, firm financial positions, fintech affinity, or borrower application behavior. In contrast, we document that Black-owned businesses higher rate of borrowing from fintechs compared to smaller banks is particularly large in places with high racial animus, pointing to a potential role for discrimination in explaining some of the racial disparities in small business lending. We find evidence that when small banks automate their lending processes, and thus reduce human involvement in the loan origination process, their rate of PPP lending to Black-owned businesses increases, with larger effects in places with more racial animus.","output":"Racial Disparities in Access to Small Business Credit: Evidence from the Paycheck Protection Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of an inpatient with pneumonia and repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing.

In this paper we present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and forecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data, reported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care occupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases, critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very good for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the pandemic. The model has been slower to pick up the increase in the case numbers in September 2020 but forecasting improves again in the later stages of the epidemic.","output":"Modelling a novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A stochastic SEIR-HCD approach, with real-time parameter estimation&forecasting for Scotland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O editorial A luta dos profissionais de sade no enfrentamento da COVID-19, publicado no peridico Acta Paulista de Enfermagem (vol 33), discute os principais desafios dos profissionais da sade na assistncia aos pacientes com COVID-19 O objetivo  alertar sobre os riscos que os trabalhadores est?o expostos no dia a dia no enfrentamento desta pandemia e como os hospitais brasileiros est?o se organizando para garantir um atendimento seguro e com qualidade (AU)","output":"Blog SCIELO: Os profissionais de sade enfrentam a COVID-19 nos hospitais e exp?e a prpria vida para cuidar dos doentes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pakistan is the worlds sixth most populated country, with a population of approximately 208 million people. Despite this, just 25% of legitimate couples say they have used modern contraceptive methods. A large body of literature has indicated that sexual satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept, since it involves physical and cultural components. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of influencing factors in terms of contraceptive self-efficacy (CSE), contraceptive knowledge, and spousal communication on the adoption of modern contraceptive methods for family planning (FP) under the moderating role of perceived barriers. Methods: Data were collected using an adopted questionnaire issued to married women of reproductive age belonging to the Rawalpindi and Neelum Valley regions in Pakistan. The sample consisted of 250 married women of reproductive age. SPSS was used to analyze the respondents feedback. Results: The findings draw public attention towards CSE, contraceptive knowledge, and spousal communication, because these factors can increase the usage of modern methods for FP among couples, leading to a reduction in unwanted pregnancies and associated risks. Regarding the significant moderation effect of perceived barriers, if individuals (women) are highly motivated (CSE) to overcome perceived barriers by convincing their husbands to use contraceptives, the probability to adopt modern contraceptive methods for FP practices is increased. Conclusions: Policymakers should formulate strategies for the involvement of males by designing male-oriented FP program interventions and incorporating male FP workers to reduce communication barriers between couples. Future research should address several other important variables, such as the desire for additional child, myths/misconceptions, fear of side effects, and partner/friend discouragement, which also affect the adoption of modern contraceptive methods for FP practices.","output":"Exploring Readiness for Birth Control in Improving Women Health Status: Factors Influencing the Adoption of Modern Contraceptives Methods for Family Planning Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic radiation proctopathy is a common sequela of radiation therapy for malignancies in the pelvic region.

LLLT has been used for pain management, wound healing, and other health conditions by physicians, physiotherapists, and nurses worldwide for decades. In addition, it has been used in veterinary medicine for respiratory tract disease such as pneumonia. Laser light with low-power intensity is applied to the surface of the skin to produce local and systemic effects. Based on the clinical experience, peer-reviewed studies, and solid laboratory data in experimental animal models, LLLT attenuates cytokine storm at multiple levels and reduces the major inflammatory metabolites. LLLT is a safe, effective, low-cost modality without any side-effects that may be combined with conventional treatment of ARDS. We summarize the effects of LLLT on pulmonary inflammation and we provide a protocol for augmenting medical treatment in COVID-19 patients. LLLT combined with conventional medical therapy has the potential to prevent the progression of COVID-19, minimize the length of time needed on a ventilator, enhance the healing process, and shorten recovery time.","output":"Low level laser therapy as a modality to attenuate cytokine storm at multiple levels, enhance recovery, and reduce the use of ventilators in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although there has been consistent evidence indicating that school closures have only limited efficacy in reducing community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the question of whether children should be kept home from school has attracted extensive and often divisive public debate in Australia In this article we analyse the factors that drove high levels of concern among parents, teachers and the public and led to both demands for school closures in late March 2020, and to many parents' reluctance to return their children to school in May 2020 We discuss how the use of well-established principles of risk communication might have reduced much of this community concern Then we set out a range of practical suggestions for communication practices that build trust and hence diminish concerns in relation to managing schools over the long term of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"How risk communication could have reduced controversy about school closures in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some amino acids share structural similarities while others vary considerably. These structures determine the chemical and physical properties of amino acids. Grouping amino acids with similar structures potentially improves the ability to identify structurally conserved regions and increases the global structural similarity between proteins. We systematically studied the effects of amino acid grouping on the numbers of Specific/specific, Common/common, and statistically different keys to achieve a better understanding of protein structure relations. Common keys represent substructures found in all types of proteins and Specific keys represent substructures exclusively belonging to a certain type of proteins in a data set. Our results show that applying amino acid grouping to the Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR)-based method, while computing structural similarity among proteins, improves the accuracy of protein clustering in certain cases. In addition, applying amino acid grouping facilitates the process of identification or discovery of conserved structural motifs. The results from the principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrate that applying amino acid grouping captures slightly more structural variation than when amino acid grouping is not used, indicating that amino acid grouping reduces structure diversity as predicted. The TSR-based method uniquely identifies and discovers binding sites for drugs or interacting proteins. The binding sites of nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that we have defined will aid future antiviral drug design for improving therapeutic outcome. This approach for incorporating the amino acid grouping feature into our structural comparison method is promising and provides a deeper insight into understanding of structural relations of proteins.","output":"Exploring the effectiveness of the TSR-based protein 3-D structural comparison method for protein clustering, and structural motif identification and discovery of protein kinases, hydrolases, and SARS-CoV-2's protein via the application of amino acid grouping."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During single-bundle ACLR, femoral tunnel location plays an important role in restoring the intact knee mechanisms, whereas malplacement of the tunnel was cited as the most common cause of knee instability. The objective of this study is to evaluate, objectively, the tibiofemoral contact area and stress after single-bundle (SB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with femoral tunnel positions drilled by transtibial (TT) or anteromedial (AM) portal techniques. METHODS Seven fresh human cadaveric knees underwent ACLR by the use of TT or AM portal techniques in a randomized order. These specimens were reused for ACL-R (TT and AM). The tibiofemoral contact area and stresses were gauged by an electronic stress-sensitive film inserted into the joint space. The knee was under the femoral axial compressive load of 1000 N using a biomechanics testing machine at 0, 10, 20, and 30 of flexion. Three conditions were compared: (1) intact ACL, (2) ACLR by the use of the TT method, and (3) ACLR by the use of the AM portal method. RESULTS Compared with AM portal ACL-reconstructed knees, a significantly decreased tibiofemoral contact area on the medial compartment was detected in the TT ACL-reconstructed knees at 20of knee flexion (P = .047). Compared with the intact group, the TT ACLR group showed a higher mean stress at 20 and 30 of flexion on the medial compartments (P = .001, P = .003, respectively), while the AM portal ACLR group showed no significant differences at 30 of flexion (P = .073). The TT ACLR group also showed a higher mean maximum stress at 20 of flexion on the medial compartments (P = .047), while the AM portal ACLR group showed no significant differences at this angle(P = .319). DISCUSSION The alternation of the tibiofemoral joint contact area and stress in reconstructed knees may be caused by the mismatch of the tibiofemoral joint during knee movement procedures compared with intact knees. CONCLUSIONS SB ACLR by the use of the AM portal method and TT method both alter the tibiofemoral contact area and stress when compared with the intact knee. When compared with the TT technique, ACLR by the AM portal technique more closely restores the intact tibiofemoral contact area and stress at low flexion angles.","output":"Tibiofemoral joint contact area and stress after single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with transtibial versus anteromedial portal drilling techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the work is to study the dynamics of the volume and structure of forensic medical research on cases of non-violent death in the Russian Federation for the period from 2016 to 2020 using the example of two regions of the Federation that differ in socio-economic terms.

While research is slowly expanding and addressing T1D physiology with regards to aging, there is little research addressing specific challenges and barriers to optimal care by those aging with T1D. To address this gap, this study employed human-centered design research to explore the gaps and barriers to care faced by people aging with T1D. METHODS: Researchers employed human-centered design methods of needfinding and user interviews and facilitated participatory workshops. In total, 27 people with T1D (PWT1D), 5 loved ones (partners of PWT1D), and 7 healthcare providers (HCPs) were engaged. RESULTS: Design artifacts were developed, including user personas that help visually articulate the different experiences of PWT1D and their unique needs as they age, as well as a prototype diabetes-specific advance directive that could be further refined to specifically aid those with Type 1 diabetes who are aging and requiring more interactions with the healthcare system. Initial user testing with people with T1D as well as healthcare providers demonstrated the need for such a diabetes advance directive tool or document.

The study used data from the Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis survey. The sample consisted of 1050 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years.

In addition, the emotional status of individuals with less concern for their own health and that of family and friends is less likely to be described as a feeling of uncertainty. Although the results related to age, income, and job losses, as regards concern for health, agree with the international literature, the limited health literacy of lower-class individuals may explain the reduced likelihood of their experiencing feelings of uncertainty.

The Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccine was proposed to all candidates by phone contact or during a scheduled visit. Reasons of refusal were collected by administrating a 6-items-multiple-choice questionnaire. RESULTS: From March 1st to 20th,2021, out 914 eligible pts 102 refused vaccination (11.2%,95%CI9.1-13.2). The most frequent (>10%) reasons reported were concerns about vaccine-related adverse events (48.1%), negative interaction with concomitant antitumor therapy (26.7%) and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%).

We are intrinsically intellectual and social beings knitted with adaptive cognitive architectures. As Foot (2014) succinctly sums it up: \\"humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions\\" and they \\"... make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate\\" and \\"community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning-and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting\\" (p.3). Education remains pivotal in the transmission of social values including language, knowledge, science, technology, and an avalanche of others. Indeed, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have been significant to the advancement of social cultures transcending every epoch to contemporary times. As Jasanoff (2004) poignantly observed, \\"the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we choose to live in it. [...] Scientific knowledge [..] both embeds and is embedded in social practices, identities, norms, conventions, discourses, instruments, and institutions\\" (p.2-3). In essence, science remains both a tacit and an explicit cultural activity through which human beings explore their own world, discover nature, create knowledge and technology towards their progress and existence. This has been possible through the interaction and applications of artifacts, tools, and technologies within the purviews of their environments. The applications of technologies are found across almost every luster of organizational learning especially teacher education, STEM, architecture, manufacturing, and a flurry of others. Thus, human evolution and development are inexplicably linked with education either formally or informally. The 21st century has however seen a surge in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies in education. The proliferation of artificial intelligence and associated technologies are creating new overtures of digital multiculturalism with distinct worldviews of significance to education. For example, learners are demonstrating digital literacy skills and are knowledgeable about AI technologies across every specter of their lives (Bennett et al., 2008). It is also opening new artesian well-springs of educational opportunities and pedagogical applications. This includes mapping new methodological pathways, content creation and curriculum design, career preparations and indeed a seemingly new paradigm shift in teaching STEM.There is growing scholarly evidence about the use and diffusion of these technologies in K-12 and higher education (Bonk & Graham, 2012;Hew & Brush, 2007;Langer, 2018;Mishra & Koehler, 2006). Some of these include the Sphero robots, Micro Bit, Jill Watson, BrickPi3 Classroom kit, Engino STEM Mechanic, Lego Education WeDo Core Set and Spike. Both educators and learners are using these in STEM programs as well as other education related activities. Just as human activities and interactions with artifacts and tools shaped and redefined the scientific-technological feat of previous generations, so the contemporary digital technological era seems to be on a similar trajectory. However, there is sparsity of empirical scholarship on the pedagogical prospects and effectiveness of artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms. Also, it should be noted that scholarship on how AI impacts pedagogical content knowledge of STEM educators and how learners perceive these technologies are just emerging. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Ghandhi et al., 2020;Rasmussen et al., 2020) has unexpectedly created a renewed synergy towards the applications of digital technologies in teaching STEM.

These parameters can be easily interpreted biologically and used both for describing the infection wave dynamics and in further statistical analysis. The usefulness of the parameters obtained was analysed with respect to the relation between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and the population density, and the percentage of the population infected during an infection wave, the starting day and the duration of the infection wave in the 80 countries. We found that all the above parameters were significantly dependent on the GDP per capita, but only the percentage of the population infected was significantly dependent on the population density in these countries.

At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 43%; Catalonia 24%; Brussels 73%; and Stockholm 65%) are closer to reality. In locations where we did not find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spain serology ratio (Paris: 24%; London: 34%). We predict that, with the exception of Brussels, no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). For locations far from the herd immunity threshold (HIT) we searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: March 7 2021; Catalonia: Dec 26 2020; Paris: Jan 12 2021; London: Jan 25 2021).

Also, we evaluate the distribution over time and the correlation between search volume of flu and flu symptoms with reported new cases of SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The reported cases and deaths of flu and the reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 were selected from the reports of ISS, the data have been aggregated by week. The search volume provided by Google Trends (GT) has a relative nature and is calculated as a percentage of query related to a specific term in connection with a determined place and time-frame. RESULTS: The strongest correlation between GT search and influenza cases was found at a lag of +1 week particularly for the period 2015-2019. A strong correlation was also found at a lag of +1 week between influenza death and GT search. About the correlation between GT search and SARS-CoV-2 new cases the strongest correlation was found at a lag of +3 weeks for the term flu. CONCLUSION: In the last years research in health care has used GT data to explore public interest in various fields of medicine.

Radiographic and clinical scoring systems may help clinicians estimate disease severity, but their predictive value is limited, especially in devising treatment strategies. In this study, we aimed to examine whether a machine learning (ML) approach using variables available on admission may improve outcome prediction in aSAH compared to established scoring systems. Combined clinical and radiographic features as well as standard scores (Hunt & Hess, WFNS, BNI, Fisher, and VASOGRADE) available on patient admission were analyzed using a consecutive single-center database of patients that presented with aSAH (n = 388). Different ML models (seven algorithms including three types of traditional generalized linear models, as well as a tree bosting algorithm, a support vector machine classifier (SVMC), a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural net) were trained for single features, scores, and combined features with a random split into training and test sets (4:1 ratio), ten-fold cross-validation, and 50 shuffles. For combined features, feature importance was calculated. There was no difference in performance between traditional and other ML applications using traditional clinico-radiographic features. Also, no relevant difference was identified between a combined set of clinico-radiological features available on admission (highest AUC 0.78, tree boosting) and the best performing clinical score GCS (highest AUC 0.76, tree boosting). GCS and age were the most important variables for the feature combination. In this cohort of patients with aSAH, the performance of functional outcome prediction by machine learning techniques was comparable to traditional methods and established clinical scores. Future work is necessary to examine input variables other than traditional clinico-radiographic features and to evaluate whether a higher performance for outcome prediction in aSAH can be achieved.

This study aimed to investigate how younger and older adults are regulating their emotions during the current pandemic. Specifically, this study measured potential age differences in acceptance (broken down into situational and emotional acceptance), because it has been identified as a possible underlying mechanism of the relationship between aging and reduced negative affect (Shallcross et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 104(4), 734-749, 2013). Methods: Younger (N = 150) and older (N = 150) adults completed trait-level questionnaires of emotional and situational acceptance, and completed a task where they reacted to 24 negative, arousing COVID-19 news headlines, half of which were old-age focused, to capture trial-level acceptance use. Results: Older adults reported greater trait-level acceptance and used emotional acceptance more frequently than younger adults during the headlines task, especially on trials containing old-age focused headlines. Interestingly, younger adults reported reduced trial-level subjective arousal when engaging in emotional acceptance compared to active emotion regulation (suggesting beneficial affective outcomes of acceptance), while older adults reported no differences in arousal between trials when they engaged in acceptance and when they engaged in more active emotion regulation.

Data describing post-hospital discharge outcomes may provide insight into disease course. Studies describing post-hospitalization outcomes of adults following COVID-19 infection are limited to electronic medical record review, which may underestimate the incidence of outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine 30-day post-hospitalization outcomes following COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Quaternary referral hospital and community hospital in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 infected patients discharged alive from the emergency department (ED) or hospital between March 3 and May 15, 2020. MEASUREMENT: Outcomes included return to an ED, re-hospitalization, and mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-day follow-up data were successfully collected on 94.6% of eligible patients. Among 1344 patients, 16.5% returned to an ED, 9.8% were re-hospitalized, and 2.4% died. Among patients who returned to the ED, 50.0% (108/216) went to a different hospital from the hospital of the index presentation, and 61.1% (132/216) of those who returned were re-hospitalized. In Cox models adjusted for variables selected using the lasso method, age (HR 1.01 per year [95% CI 1.00C1.02]), diabetes (1.54 [1.06C2.23]), and the need for inpatient dialysis (3.78 [2.23C6.43]) during the index presentation were independently associated with a higher re-hospitalization rate. Older age (HR 1.08 [1.05C1.11]) and Asian race (2.89 [1.27C6.61]) were significantly associated with mortality.

Two survey studies (total N = 500) tested predictors of donation intentions of British participants to help those suffering from the crisis in Britain (ingroup donations) and overseas (outgroup donations). Perceptions of international, global common fate in our success in managing and overcoming the crisis was positively associated with prosocial intentions towards both national ingroup and outgroup targets. In contrast, a desire to ?close ranks? within the national ingroup in the face of the pandemic threat was associated with more prosocial intentions towards national ingroup targets only, but it was associated with fewer prosocial intentions towards outgroup targets. This suggests that a focus on global solidarity (in the form of global common fate and identification with all humans) has positive effects on helping both within and across group boundaries, whereas a focus on national solidarity (in the form of ?closing ranks? in the face of the pandemic threat) has positive effects on helping within the national group but negative effects on prosocial tendencies towards outgroup members. The effect of perceived global common fate on both ingroup and outgroup helping was mediated by identification with all of humanity.

Resource-limited regions are especially hard hit by this increment with the currently implemented surveillance programs being inadequate for the observed expansion of potential vector species. Cost-effective methods that can be easily implemented in resource-limited settings, e.g. under field conditions, are thus urgently needed to function as an early warning system for vector-borne disease epidemics. Our aim was to enhance entomological capacity in Nepal, a country with endemicity of numerous vector-borne diseases and with frequent outbreaks of dengue fever. METHODS: We used a field barcoding pipeline based on DNA nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and verified its use for different mosquito life stages and storage methods. We furthermore hosted an online workshop to facilitate knowledge transfer to Nepalese scientific experts from different disciplines. RESULTS: The use of the barcoding pipeline could be verified for adult mosquitos and eggs, as well as for homogenized samples, dried specimens, samples that were stored in ethanol and frozen tissue. The transfer of knowledge was successful, as reflected by feedback from the participants and their wish to implement the method. CONCLUSIONS: Cost effective strategies are urgently needed to assess the likelihood of disease outbreaks. We were able to show that field sequencing provides a solution that is cost-effective, undemanding in its implementation and easy to learn. The knowledge transfer to Nepalese scientific experts from different disciplines provides an opportunity for sustainable implementation of low-cost portable sequencing solutions in Nepal.

Thus, MSCs efficiently impair the phagocytic and antigen-presenting capacity of monocytes/macrophages and promote the expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as interleukin (IL)-10 and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 by these cells. They also effectively inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells and their ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines and to stimulate potent T-cell responses. Furthermore, MSCs inhibit the generation and proinflammatory properties of CD4(+) T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, while they promote the proliferation of regulatory T cells and their inhibitory capabilities. MSCs also impair the expansion, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity of proinflammatory CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, MSCs inhibit the differentiation, proliferation, and antibody secretion of B cells, and foster the generation of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells. Various cell membrane-associated and soluble molecules essentially contribute to these MSC-mediated effects on important cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document GPs experiences with the large-scale uptake of VCs in the natural experiment context of the pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Norwegian GPs during the pandemic lockdown (April 14-May 3, 2020). Each respondent was asked to evaluate up to 10 VCs. Basic demographic characteristics of the GPs and their practices were collected. The associations between GPs perceived suitability of the VCs, the nature of the patients main problems, prior knowledge of the patients (relational continuity), and follow-up of previously presented problems (episodic continuity) were explored using descriptive statistics, diagrams, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 1237 GPs (26% of the target group) responded to the survey. Among these, 1000 GPs offered VCs, and 855 GPs evaluated a total of 3484 VCs. Most GPs who offered VCs (1000/1237; 81%) had no experience with VCs before the pandemic. Overall, 51% (1766/3476) of the evaluated VCs were considered to have similar or even better suitability to assess the main reason for contact, compared to face-to-face consultations. In the presence of relational continuity, VCs were considered equal to or better than face-to-face consultations in 57% (1011/1785) of cases, as opposed to 32% (87/274) when the patient was unknown. The suitability rate for follow-up consultations (episodic continuity) was 61% (1165/1919), compared to 35% (544/1556) for new patient problems. Suitability varied considerably across clinical contact reasons. VCs were found most suitable for anxiety and life stress, depression, and administrative purposes, as well as for longstanding or complex problems that normally require multiple follow-up consultations. The GPs estimate that they will conduct about 20% of their consultations by video in a future, nonpandemic setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of VCs performed in general practice during the pandemic lockdown indicates a clear future role for VCs in nonpandemic settings. The strong and consistent association between continuity of care and GPs perceptions of the suitability of VCs is a new and important finding with considerable relevance for future primary health care planning.","output":"Suitability of Video Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: Cross-sectional Survey Among Norwegian General Practitioners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the results of a nationally-representative sample of the US population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is a strong negative relationship between the fraction in a state still commuting to work and the fraction working from home. We find that the share of people switching to remote work can be predicted by the incidence of COVID-19 and that younger people were more likely to switch to remote work. Furthermore, states with a higher share of employment in information work including management, professional and related occupations were more likely to shift toward working from home and had fewer people laid off or furloughed.

Yet, with respect to form itself, more and more favor electronic form over substantive media and signatures. Companies, consumers, and governments increasingly use electronic communications, documents, and signatures instead of ink and paper. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated an existing shift to digitization. Yet, many remain unsure about the legality or effectiveness of different forms of electronic signatures and find laws on the subject confusing. Transactions, documents, and signatures are separate concepts. Transactions and other legally relevant actions, decisions, and declarations can be recorded in documents and effectuated with signatures. Documents and signatures can be created or copied electronically or in other formats. Transactions, actions, decisions, and declarations on the other hand exist in the abstract and independent of the electronic or other form in which they may be documented or signed. In practice, people commonly ask whether electronic signatures are legal. But, the more relevant questions to ask are whether electronic signatures are effective and binding;whether they meet statutory form requirements;whether they protect interests as well as handwritten signatures on paper documents;and whether one is required to create, obtain, or retain paper documents with handwritten signatures in addition to electronic records and signatures. To better answer these and other questions, one has to consult not only newer laws specifically regulating electronic signatures and documents, but also older laws prescribing form requirements. Many older laws do not contemplate modern technologies and therefore do not give clear answers as to whether one can satisfy form requirements electronically. Numerous different form requirements apply in myriad use cases and jurisdictions with respect to particular transactions, documents, and signatures. Legal and political uncertainties hinder adoption of electronic signature products and global harmonization of applicable laws. Existing laws are complex, confusing, and diverse due to historic factors. As electronic signatures, documents, and records were first adopted more broadly, lawmakers were uncertain regarding the purposes of existing form requirements, how well electronic signatures can address purposes of form requirements, which technologies will be adopted by businesses and consumers, and what legal problems could arise from forgeries. Additionally, lawmakers had reason to be concerned that businesses and consumers would need some time to adapt to new technologies and realize and handle the binding effect of electronically issued declarations. These considerations may have provided a valid excuse in the mid-1990s for somewhat timid, complex, and consciously incomplete and experimental legislation, but twenty years later, they no longer do. It is time for change. Lawmakers can and should improve electronic signature laws and harmonize them internationally with clearer default rules favoring electronic form;detailed whitelists enumerating transactions that can be concluded with electronic documents and signatures;possibly blacklists specifying additional form requirements for particular use cases;less complex definitions;and clear conflicts of law rules, ideally permissive ones, possibly paired with bilateral or multilateral recognition or adequacy arrangements to drive international harmonization. At the same time, lawmakers should abandon overly prescriptive regulations that require \\"qualified electronic signatures\\" certified by nationally licensed providers, because such constructs have not been widely adopted in the last twenty years and seem to stand little chance or need of being adopted going forward. This Article analyzes the current landscape, applicable legislation, and options for change. Following an introduction, this Article clarifies terms and definitions in Part I, reviews the history and rationale of form requirements outside the electronic sphere in Part II, compares the advantages and disadvantages of electronic signatures and documents in Part III, examines basic approaches for legislation and their potential impact on public and individual interests in Part IV, describes and compares current electronic signature legislation in key jurisdictions in Part V, examines effects of international divergence in Part VI, proposes policy arguments for changes in Part VII, and concludes with a summary.","output":"Electronic Form Over Substance: eSignature Laws Need Upgrades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging evidence indicates that ambient particulate matter (PM) is harmful to male fertility, but the associations between ambient PM exposure and semen quality were inconsistent. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the association between ambient PM exposure and semen quality based on a large prospective cohort. Using data from the prospective assisted reproduction cohort in Anhui province, China, we included 15,112 males with 28,267 semen tests, whose partner has undergone assisted reproductive technology from September 1, 2015 to September, 22 2020. Individual ambient PM, gaseous air pollutants, and temperature exposures of the participants during 0-90, 0-9, 10-14, and 70-90 days before semen quality tests were evaluated using inverse distance weighting interpolation. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to evaluate the relationship between PM2.5 and PM10 exposures and standardized semen quality parameters. Models were adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, drinking, education attainment, occupation type, sampling month, temperature and the principal component of gaseous air pollutants. PM2.5 and PM10 were inversely associated with sperm concentration, total sperm count, total motility, progressive motility, total motile sperm count, and progressively motile sperm count during 0-90, 0-9, and 70-90 days period (all p < 0.05), but not 10-14 days period. The regression coefficients of PM2.5 exposure on semen quality parameters during 0-90 days period were larger than 0-9 and 70-90 days periods, and the effects of PM2.5 on semen quality parameters were stronger than PM10. Our results showed that ambient PM2.5 and PM10 exposures were associated with semen quality, during 70-90 days and 0-9 days before sampling, and the entire spermatogenesis process. The effects of PM2.5 on semen quality parameters were stronger than PM10, and the long-term effects of PM2.5 and PM10, throughout spermatogenesis, were stronger than the short-term effects.","output":"Inverse association between ambient particulate matter and semen quality in Central China: Evidence from a prospective cohort study of 15,112 participants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Older people are currently the fastest growing segment of the worldwide population. The present study aimed to estimate propofol dose in older patients based on size descriptors measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). METHODS A cross sectional study in adult and older patients with body mass index equal to or lower than 35 kg/m2 was carried out. BIA and Clinical Frail Scale scoring were performed during pre-operative evaluation. Propofol infusion was started at 2000 mg/h until loss of consciousness (LOC) which was defined by \\"loss of eye-lash reflex\\" and \\"loss of response to name calling\\". Total dose of propofol at LOC was recorded. Propofol plasma concentration was measured using gas chromatography/ion trap-mass spectrometry. RESULTS Forty patients were enrolled in the study. Total propofol dose required to LOC was lower in Age  65 group and a higher plasma propofol concentration was measured in this group. 60% of old patients were classified as \\"apparently vulnerable\\" or \\"frail\\" and narrow phase angle values were associated with increasing vulnerability scores. In the Age  65 group, the correlation analysis showed that the relationship between propofol dose and total body weight (TBW) scaled by the corresponding phase angle value is stronger than the correlation between propofol dose and TBW or fat free mass (FFM). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that weight-based reduction of propofol is suitable in older patients; however FFM was not seen to be more effective than TBW to predict the propofol induction dose in these patients. Guiding propofol induction dose according to baseline frailty score should also be considered to estimate individualized dosage profiles. Determination of phase angle value appears to be an easy and reliable tool to assess frailty in older patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02713698 .

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 101 patients with ESKD who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 at King Fahad Central Hospital (single center), Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia. Chi-square test, independent samples t-test, MannCWhitney U-test, and Cox regression were performed in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with ESKD, 20 patients died (19.8%). Patients aged  65 years had a significant mortality risk. Mortality was higher in male patients (70%) than in female patients (30%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88%), diabetes mellitus (47%), and heart disease (17%). The presence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases along with ESKD increased the mortality risk [relative risk (RR) = 6.5 and RR = 3.8, respectively]. The most frequently reported clinical symptoms were fever (50%), shortness of breath (41%), and cough (35%). In total, 17% of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation. Most patients had bilateral lung infiltrates (88%). Hemoglobin levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in the deceased patients than in the surviving ones.

It uses the synthesis of data found on the intemet, from selected reliable sources dealing with the same or similar issues. From these sources it is evident that the effects of working from home are rather negative. The most frequently mentioned advantage is the saving of time, caused mainly by the absence of commuting to the office. The most frequently mentioned disadvantage is the absence of personal contact with co-workers. The disadvantage that a company could feel the most is the extension of the length of communication between employees, and thus the extension of work processes. At first glance, it might seem that a company will save money using this form of work, but the reality is that the company's costs may even increase. This is due to the fact that most companies have chosen to work from home only partly, so the costs of running the offices remain the same or slightly reduced at best, and legislation states that the company must reimburse workers for costs incurred by this form of work. It follows from this contribution that, if possible, workers and employers should avoid the practice of working from home, even though it has a positive effect on the pandemic.

We assess the potential differences in iron metabolism, plasma erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, and soluble -Klotho (-Klotho) levels as an emergent hematopoiesis factor. Methods: Thirty-seven chronic hemodialysis patients were included from January 2010 to November 2011 and randomized (1:1) to continue with EB or to convert to monthly CERA. Primary outcome was the mean change in Hb between groups at months 0, 3 and 6, and the percentage of patients who maintained stable Hb (Hb  1 g/dL from baseline level to month 6). Secondary outcomes were the influence on the erythropoietic process and iron metabolism markers. Thirty-one patients completed the study (CERA: n = 15, EB: n = 16). Results: The mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) Hb difference between groups was 0.28 g/dL (-0.36 to 0.93). There was no difference between the percentages of patients with stable Hb levels.

Conclusions: Monthly CERA maintained Hb concentrations; however, it showed a significant effect on RDW, probably due to its impact on the EPO and hepcidin levels. -Klotho decreased significantly in both groups, and its changes correlated with the changes in iron metabolism.

Poorer outcomes were seen among young people and those who had lost jobs or had less work, those with poor health status, and who had past diagnoses of mental illness. Suicidal ideation was reported by 6%, with 2% reporting making plans for suicide and 2% reporting suicide attempts. Suicidality was highest in those aged 18C34. Just under 10% of participants had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period. However, not all consequences of the lockdown were negative, with 62% reporting silver linings, which included enjoying working from home, spending more time with family, and a quieter, less polluted environment. New Zealands lockdown successfully eliminated COVID-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll. Although much of the debate about lockdown measures has focused on their economic effects, our findings emphasise the need to pay equal attention to their effects on psychological wellbeing.","output":"Psychological distress, anxiety, family violence, suicidality, and wellbeing in New Zealand during the COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we consider a fractional-order mathematical system comprising four different compartments for the recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 with regard to global and singular kernels of Caputo fractional operator.

This has resulted in a lack of reliable information about the patterns of psychological distress within the population, which is a barrier to the development of effective and appropriate mental health services. The aim of the study was to develop a locally-appropriate measure of psychological distress for Sierra Leone. METHODS: The new measure consists of two instruments: the Sierra Leone Psychological Distress Scale (SLPDS) and a gendered measure of ability to carry out daily tasksa Function scaleas an indication of the severity of distress. A three-phase mixed methods exploratory sequential study was conducted. Phase 1 was item generation and testing, leading to the development of a set of potential items for both instruments. Phase 2 was a small pilot study (N = 202) leading to the selection of the final set of items for both measures. Phase 3 was a validation phase where the SLPDS and the Function scale were administered with a larger sample of 904 respondents. Item analysis was used to assess the internal consistency of the scales, and Exploratory Factor Analysis to explore the properties of the SLPDS. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis using the principal axis factoring with an oblique rotation identified a three-factor structure for the 18-item SLPDS. Internal consistency for the SLPDS (Cronbachs alpha = 0.89) and three subscales was good (Cronbachs alpha > 0.73). The internal reliability of the male and female versions of the Function scale was also found to be acceptable (Cronbachs alpha = 0.90 for the female scale and 0.79 for the male scale). CONCLUSIONS: Together the SLPD and Function scales provide a locally-validated tool which will enable government bodies and local and international non-governmental organisations in Sierra Leone to assess mental health and psychosocial needs. This will support both effective service provision and the evaluation of initiatives designed to improve mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.

Single-center 25-(OH)D determinations from 40,996 individuals in a 2019 (pre-pandemic), 32,355 individuals from 1 January to 31 August 2020 (containing the first pandemic wave) and 27,684 individuals from 1 June to 30 November 2020 (containing the second wave) were compared to investigate both the effect of the lockdown on vitamin D status and the association between 25-(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: No direct association was found between UVDVC, 25-(OH)D status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The stringent confinement implemented during the first wave lockdown has not had any effect on 25-(OH)D status, although some peculiar time-restricted profile behaviors can be deduced, possibly due to vitamin D supplementation habits and features of those patients who presented to the hospital during the lockdown period.

Coronaviruses could mainly cause respiratory tract infections in humans and multiple system infections in many animals. The coronavirus enters the host cell through the binding of surface spike glycoprotein (S Protein) with host angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE2) protein. METHODS: ACE2 sequences of various species were aligned with human ACE2, accordingly, homology models for different species were constructed. Then, S protein-ACE2 complexes were constructed using the generated homology models. The molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of the generated S-ACE2 virtual complexes. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) were calculated to evaluate protein stability and compactness. RESULTS: The binding free energies of S protein with ACE2 from Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius are about equal to that of humans. By comparing the free binding energies it were possible to identify potential viral hosts that could transmit the virus to human (risk of cross-species transmission).

In this context, respiratory emergencies are often a challenge at home, in a neurology ward, or even in an intensive care unit, influencing morbidity and mortality. More commonly, patients develop primarily ventilatory impairment causing hypercapnia. Moreover, inadequate bulbar and expiratory muscle function may cause retained secretions, frequently complicated by pneumonia, atelectasis, and, ultimately, hypoxemic ARF. On the basis of the clinical onset, two main categories of ARF can be identified: (i) acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, which is common in slowly progressive neurological diseases, such as movement disorders and most neuromuscular diseases, and (ii) sudden-onset respiratory failure which may develop in rapidly progressive neurological disorders including stroke, convulsive status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, phrenic neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, and GuillainCBarr syndrome. A tailored assistance may include manual and mechanical cough assistance, noninvasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or tracheotomy.

We assessed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence among decedents in Maryland over 6 months in 2020. Methods Data were collected on decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination in Maryland from 24 May through 30 November 2020 from whom a blood specimen could be collected. Those with available blood specimens were tested with the CoronaCHEK lateral flow antibody assay. We assessed monthly seroprevalence compared to the statewide estimated number of cases and proportion of positive test results (testing positivity). We used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of demographic characteristics, homelessness, and manner of death with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results Among 1906 decedents, 305 (16%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Monthly seroprevalence increased from 11% to 22% over time and was consistently higher than state-level estimates of testing positivity. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 2- to 3.2-fold higher seropositivity (P < .05) irrespective of sex. Deaths due to motor vehicle crash were associated with 62% increased seropositivity (aPR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.15C2.28]) vs natural manner of death. Though seroprevalence was lower in decedents of illicit drug overdose vs nonoverdose in early months, this shifted, and seroprevalence was comparable by November 2020. Conclusions Decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination, especially those dying due to motor vehicle trauma, may be a sentinel population for COVID-19 spread in the general population and merits exploration in other states/regions. SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was 16% among Maryland decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination (MayCNovember 2020).

The vehicle for long-range spread is smaller (<5 m) droplets or particles, termed bio-aerosols, or aerosols for short, which have a large surface area to volume ratio such that aerodynamic drag is much larger than gravity forces. The aerosols remain suspended in air for extended time periods, and they essentially move with air currents. Prediction of the danger to occupants in a closed room when exposed to an infected individual requires knowledge of the period of exposure and the concentration level of aerosols in the breathing zone of an occupant. To obtain an estimate of the concentration level, a common assumption is well-mixed conditions within an interior space. This is obtained from a mass balance between the level of aerosol produced by an infected individual along with the airflow rate into and out of the entire space. In this work, we use computational fluid dynamics, compared with experimental results in several cases, to explore the aerosol concentration distribution in a typical classroom for several common conditions and compare these results to the well-mixed assumption. We use a tracer gas to approximately simulate the flow and dispersion of the aerosol-air mixture. The two ventilation systems examined, ceiling diffusers and open windows, yield average concentrations at occupant breathing level 50 % greater than the well mixed case, and some scenarios yield concentrations that are 150 % greater than the well mixed concentration at specific breathing-level locations. Of particular concern are two conditions: horizontal air flow from an open window in line with a row of seating and, second, an infected individual seated near a sealed cold window. For the former, conditions are improved if a baffle is placed inside the open window to direct the air toward the floor, creating a condition similar to displacement ventilation. In the latter, the cold air flowing down along the cold window recirculates aerosols back into the breathing zone. Adding window covers or a portable heater below the window surface will moderate this condition.","output":"Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol spread in typical classrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The spread of tuberculosis (TB) is related to changes in the social network among the population and peoples social interactions. High-speed railway (HSR) fundamentally changed the integrated market across cities in China. This paper aims to examine the impact of HSR on TB transmission in newly integrated areas. Methods: By exploiting the opening and operation of the first HSR in Sichuan province as a quasi-natural experiment, we have collected and used the economic, social, and demographic data of 183 counties in Sichuan province from 2013 to 2016. Results: The new HSR line is associated with a 4.790 increase in newly diagnosed smear-positive TB cases per 100,000 people among newly integrated areas. On average, an additional increase of 34.178 newly diagnosed smear-positive TB cases occur every year in counties (or districts) covered by the new HSR.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the organizational and social commitments and related factors during the coronavirus pandemic of healthcare workers in northern Iran. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2020 among 260 healthcare workers of Babol health centers by a stratified-random sampling method. Data were collected according to a valid and reliable questionnaire consisting of three parts: 8 questions about personal and job characteristics, 15 questions from Porter Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), 15 questions from Carroll's social responsibility. Each question was scored on the Likert scale of organizational and social commitment questionnaires. Data were analyzed by chi-square and logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: None of the healthcare workers belonged to the category of low organizational commitments. A portion of 27.7% of the healthcare workers had moderate organizational commitments and 72.3% had high organizational commitments. A portion of 9.2% of the healthcare workers had moderate social commitments and 90.8% had high social commitments. Chi-square showed that education (p = 0.001), job position (p = 0.001) and the area in which healthcare workers were present for service (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with organizational commitments. According to OR in the logistic regression model, healthcare workers with master's and doctoral education levels had 3.482 times more social commitments than others and the health group had 2.455 times more social commitments compared to the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that at the time of the coronavirus outbreak, the healthcare workers in Babol had very positive and high organizational and social commitments. As the world struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, employee and organizational productivity may decline due to the fear and anxiety of healthcare workers in various organizations. It is expected that managers of health-related organizations, social, economic, and cultural organizations use the results of this study to identify factors affecting the organizational and social commitments of employees and strengthen them.","output":"Evaluation of organizational and social commitments and related factors during the coronavirus pandemic of healthcare workers in northern Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Asthma and bronchiectasis are common chronic respiratory diseases, and their coexistence is frequently observed but not well investigated. Our aim was to study the effect of comorbid bronchiectasis on asthma. METHODS: A propensity score-matched cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort database. From 2005 to 2008, 8,034 participants with asthma were weighted based on propensity scores in a 1:3 ratio with 24,099 participants without asthma. From the asthma group, 141 participants with overlapped bronchiectasis were identified, and 7,892 participants had only asthma. Clinical outcomes of acute asthma exacerbation(s) and mortality rates were compared among the study groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of bronchiectasis (1.7%) was 3 times higher in asthmatics than in the general population of Korea. Patients who had asthma comorbid with bronchiectasis experienced acute exacerbation(s) more frequently than non-comorbid patients (11.3% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.007). Time to the first acute exacerbation was also shorter in the asthmatics with bronchiectasis group (1,970.9 days vs. 2,479.7 days, P = 0.005). Although bronchiectasis was identified as a risk factor for acute exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05C2.86), there was no significant relationship between bronchiectasis and all-cause or respiratory mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.67C2.04 and aHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.11C6.08).

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. METHODS: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. RESULTS: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0a10.8% vs. 33.8a75.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible.","output":"Pilot study of an occupational healthcare program to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune status of employees in a large pharmaceutical company"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to investigate the student-athletes' capability to face the academic, sport, and social challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and to disclose novel aspects of dual careers A 32-item online survey encompassing demographic characteristics, sport and university engagement, support and dual-career benefits, physical activity, sitting time, and the time deemed necessary to recover the previous level of performance was developed Four hundred sixty-seven student-athletes (males: 57%, females: 43%) from 11 countries, competing in 49 different sports (individual: 63 4%, team: 36 6%) at regional (17 5%), national (43 3%), and international (39 2%) levels, and enrolled at high school (21 9%) and university (78 1%) levels completed the survey During the lockdown, the respondents decreased the time dedicated to sport and academics, although they maintained an active lifestyle Student-athletes from countries under severe contagion were more likely to train at home, dedicate to academics, and receive support from the coach but less likely receive support from their teachers With respect to their team sport counterparts, athletes competing in individual sports trained more and were more likely to receive support from their coaches International athletes showed the highest training time and support from their coaches and as student-athletes High school students received more support from their coaches and teachers, whereas university students were more likely considering dual careers useful to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic This study substantiates the relevant role of competitive sports participation in the maintenance of active lifestyles, with student-athletes considering home training and e-learning valuable resources during the lockdown Furthermore, their sport and academic commitments helped student-athletes cope with the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Dual Careers of Athletes During COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We can't lose sight of the climate emergency when dealing with the covid-19 pandemic, say Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac","output":"Tackling two crises at once"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Problematic smartphone use is widespread, and college-age youth faces an especially high risk of its associated consequences.

Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these models contains only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and y terms.

However, the health literacy of urban and rural populations in China has been little known. Thus, this study aims to assess the status of health literacy and explore the differences of its possible determinants (e.g., socio-economic factors) among urban and rural populations in Henan, China. A cross-sectional study, 78,646 participants were recruited from a populous province in central China with a multi-stage random sampling design. The Chinese Resident Health Literacy Scale was adopted to measure the health literacy of the respondents. In the participants, the level of health literacy (10.21%) in central China was significantly lower than the national average, and a big gap was identified between urban and rural populations (16.92% vs. 8.09%). A noticeable difference was reported in different aspects and health issues of health literacy between urban and rural populations. The health literacy level was lower in those with lower levels of education, and a significant difference was identified in the level of health literacy among people of different ages and occupations in both urban and rural areas. Note that in rural areas, as long as residents educated, they all had higher odds to exhibit basic health literacy than those uneducated; in rural areas, compared with those aged 15 to 24 years, residents aged 45 to 54 years (OR = 0.846,95% CI (0.730, 0.981)), 55 to 64 years (OR = 0.716,95% CI (0.614, 0.836)) and above 65 years (OR = 0.679, 95% CI (0.567, 0.812)) were 84.6%, 71.6%, and 67.9%, respectively, less likely to exhibit basic health literacy.

This is the case during the current pandemic of COVID-19. This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This results in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. Due to the overload of the health services, portable X-ray devices are recommended during the pandemic, preventing the spread of the disease. However, these devices entail different complications (such as capture quality) that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult and suggest the necessity for computer-aided diagnosis methodologies despite the scarcity of samples available to do so. To solve this problem, we propose a methodology that allows to adapt the knowledge from a well-known domain with a high number of samples to a new domain with a significantly reduced number and greater complexity. We took advantage of a pre-trained segmentation model from brain magnetic resonance imaging of a unrelated pathology and performed two stages of knowledge transfer to obtain a robust system able to segment lung regions from portable X-ray devices despite the scarcity of samples and lesser quality. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory accuracy of 0.9761  0.0100 for patients with COVID-19, 0.9801  0.0104 for normal patients and 0.9769  0.0111 for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.","output":"Multi-stage transfer learning for lung segmentation using portable X-ray devices for patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim As the rage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread globally, much effort is being directed to contain it through various efforts - genomic studies, drug discoveries, clinical trials, vaccine development, and the innovation of diagnostic techniques.

Psychological support and wellbeing enables them to manage their condition. Social prescribing is a formal process of referring patients to a link worker to co-design a plan to improve their health and wellbeing. Intervention involves supporting participation in activities based within the individuals local community. This study aimed to explore the barriers and enablers to accessing social prescribing for people living with LTNCs (plwLTNCs). METHODS: A total of four focus groups were carried out with 17 participants, including different neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Fragile X Syndrome, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Two participants were family carers and supported people living with epilepsy and motor neurone disease. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: (1) Lack of knowledge; (2) Service provision difficulties; (3) Benefits of social prescribing activities; (4) Physical barriers and (5) Psychological barriers. There was a lack of knowledge about social prescribing and what it actually was. Participants anticipated service provision difficulties relating to funding, link workers need for knowledge of LTNCs and for activities to be varied and individualised. The potential benefits of social prescribing activities were recognised across the groups especially its potential to tackle loneliness and to offer plwLTNCs purpose. Participants highlighted a number of physical barriers such as transport and accessibility; and psychological barriers such as anxiety and stigma. CONCLUSION: Social prescribing aims to address the health inequalities of those living with long-term conditions, however currently it is likely to exclude plwLTNCs.

STUDY DESIGN: Exploratory studies were conducted using spleens from septic patients and from mice with abdominal sepsis. Seven patients with sepsis after injury were identified retrospectively and compared with six injured patients. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, or to IP lipopolysaccharide. Control mice had sham laparotomy or injection of IP saline, respectively. A sepsis classification model was created and tested on blood samples from septic mice. RESULTS: Accuracy of sepsis prediction was obtained using cross-validation of gene expression data from 12 human spleen samples and from 16 mouse spleen samples. For blood studies, classifiers were constructed using data from a training data set of 26 microarrays. The error rate of the classifiers was estimated on seven de-identified microarrays, and then on a subsequent cross-validation for all 33 blood microarrays. Estimates of classification accuracy of sepsis in human spleen were 67.1%; in mouse spleen, 96%; and in mouse blood, 94.4% (all estimates were based on nested cross-validation). Lists of genes with substantial changes in expression between study and control groups were used to identify nine mouse common inflammatory response genes, six of which were mapped into a single pathway using contemporary pathway analysis tools.

In order to evaluate the catalytic activity of 3CLpros according to the presence or absence of the dimerization domain, two forms had been purified and tested. Enzyme kinetic studies with a FRET method revealed that the catalytic domain alone presents enzymatic activity, despite it being approximately 8.6 times less than that in the full domain. The catalytic domain was crystallized and its X-ray crystal structure has been determined to 2.3 ? resolution. There are four protomers in the asymmetric unit. Intriguingly, they were packed as a dimer though the dimerization domain was absent. The RMSD of superimposed two catalytic domains was 0.190 for 182 C atoms. A part of the long hinge loop (LH-loop) from Gln189 to Asp197 was not built in the model due to its flexibility. The crystal structure indicates that the decreased proteolytic activity of the catalytic domain was due to the incomplete construction of the substrate binding part built by the LH-loop. A structural survey with other 3CLpros showed that SARS-CoV families do not have interactions between DM-loop due to the conformational difference at the last turn of helix 7 compared with others. Therefore, we can conclude that the monomeric form contains nascent enzyme activity and that its efficiency increases by dimerization. This new insight may contribute to understanding the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and thus be useful in developing anti-COVID-19 agents.","output":"Dimerization Tendency of 3CLpros of Human Coronaviruses Based on the X-ray Crystal Structure of the Catalytic Domain of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 makes it essential to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic test so that carriers can be isolated at an early stage.

Recent research has highlighted the involvement of NETs in cancer and cancer-related pathologies. We review the role of NET formation in cancer biology, prognosis and potential therapeutic modulators. RECENT FINDINGS: Elevated NET levels are associated with cancer metastasis and may be modified by some anaesthetic-analgesic techniques during tumour resection surgery. It promotes tumour cell migration, angiogenesis and hypercoagulability. Although there are potential anti-NET formation therapeutics available, their role has not been formally assessed in cancer patients.

Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest.

We also sought to illustrate how clinical data can be used to identify children most at-risk for SGAP-induced weight gain, which cannot be done using process-focused measures. METHODS: Electronic health record (EHR) data and Medicaid claims were linked from 2013 to 2019. We quantified sociodemographic differences between children with and without pre- and post-BMI values. We developed a linear regression model of post-BMI to examine pre-post changes in BMI among 4 groups: 1) BH/SGAP+ children had behavioral health conditions and were taking SGAP; 2) BH/SGAP? children had behavioral health conditions without taking SGAP; 3) children with asthma; and 4) healthy children. RESULTS: Of 363,360 EHR-Medicaid linked children, 18,726 were BH/SGAP+. Roughly 4% of linked children and 8% of BH/SGAP+ children had both pre and post values of BMI required to assess quality of SGAP monitoring. The percentage varied with gender and race-ethnicity. The R(2) for the regression model with all predictors was 0.865.

Studies appearing since 1991 indicate health care personnel may not be willing to work in all disaster situations-and if so, this could degrade surge response. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the state of the evidence concerning the willingness of health care personnel to work in disaster. The aims of this review are to collate and assess the literature concerning willingness of health care personnel to work during a disaster, to identify gaps in the literature as areas for future investigation, and to facilitate evidence-based disaster planning. Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria (25 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies). The current evidence indicates there may be certain factors related to willingness to work (or lack of willingness) in disaster including the type of disaster, concern for family, and concerns about personal safety. Barriers to willingness to work have been identified including pet care needs and the lack of personal protective equipment. This review describes the state of an emerging area of science.

This article is aimed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on the oil and gas industry and give a perspective of the post-COVID-19 oil and gas market. Results of this article show that COVID-19 impacts the oil and gas industry. The short-term impact is nearly 25% decrease in petroleum consumption, slowly recovering to its former amount and even growing more. The long-term impacts are the 30% to 40% decrease in the CAPEX and R&D investments over the oil and gas market, which is a regional scale in the United States, caused oil exploitation projects to decrease from more than 800 in 2019 to 265 in 2021. And it is predicted to reduce the competitiveness of oil and gas vs other energy carriers such as ever price-decreasing renewable energies. Thus, the oil and gas industry has to change rapidly before losing a substantial energy market share. Finally, this article discusses acknowledging oil and gas trade as a part of World trade organization (WTO/ECT) regulations. And considering it a general energy commodity.

On June 3, 2020, Chicago entered the reopening phase. This study compares rates of polysubstance use by COVID-19 lockdown phase and across sociodemographic characteristics in a Chicago-based sample of Black cisgender sexual minority men (SMM) and transgender women. METHOD: Data come from the Neighborhood and Networks (N2) cohort, an ongoing study of Black cisgender SMM and transgender women living in Chicago. Participants (N = 226) completed a survey between April 20, 2020, and July 30, 2020, during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chicago. We conducted chi-square tests of independence and modified Poisson regression models with robust error variance and estimated adjusted prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Alcohol and marijuana were the most used substances, with 73.5% reporting at least one drinking day and 71.2% of the sample reporting marijuana use in the past 14 days. Tobacco was used by 41.6% of the sample, and illegal drug use, which does not include marijuana, was reported by 17.7% of the sample. Substance use was consistently associated with the use of other substances. As such, polysubstance use (i.e., using two or more substances) was common in this sample (63.7%). Few sociodemographic differences emerged, and substance use was not associated with lockdown phase. CONCLUSION: Substance use, including polysubstance use, was high in our sample of Black SMM and transgender women during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued monitoring is needed given the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative health consequences associated with substance use in this population.

This study aimed to reveal the effects of miR-486-3p/CTNNBIP1 in osteogenesis. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from healthy individuals and osteoporosis patients and mice with sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgeries were collected. Levels of CTNNBIP1 and miR-486-3p were assessed. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interactions between CTNNBIP1 and miR-486-3p. MiR-486-3p mimics/inhibitor or CTNNBIP1 overexpression lentiviruses were transfected to human BMSCs (hBMSCs) and an osteogenic assay was performed. Alizarin red S (ARS) and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) intensity and expression of osteogenic genes Runx2, Alp, Cola1 and Bglap were measured. Key proteins in the Wnt/?-catenin pathway including active ?-catenin, Bcl-2, and Cyclin D1 were assessed. RESULTS: CTNNBIP1 was upregulated while miR-486-3p was downregulated in osteoporosis patients and OVX mice. CTNNBIP1 was confirmed as a target of miR-486-3p. MiR-486-3p overexpression promoted, while miR-486-3p knockdown suppressed, osteogenic differentiation and Wnt/?-catenin signaling. Rescue experiments confirmed the negative effects of CTNNBIP1 overexpression on osteoblastic differentiation and that miR-486-3p mimics could reverse canonical Wnt signaling.

We performed title and abstract, full-text screening, and data extraction independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using random effect models. Quality assessment was performed using validated tools. Certainty of evidence was established using the GRADE framework. RESULTS One hundred and nineteen studies (n = 38,106) met eligibility criteria: eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 111 observational studies. MMVS was associated with fewer days in hospital (RCT: MD: -2.2 days, 95% CI, [-3.7 to -0.8]; observational: MD: -2.4 days, 95% CI, [-2.7 to -2.1]). Observational studies suggested that MMVS reduced transfusion requirements with fewer units transfused per patient (MD: -1.2; 95% CI, [-1.6 to -0.9]) and fewer patients transfused (RR, 0.7; 95% CI, [0.6-0.7]).

To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) damages the heart, it is critical to elucidate the biology of CoV-2 encoded proteins, each of which may play multiple pathological roles. For example, CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (CoV-2-S) not only engages ACE2 to mediate virus infection, but also directly impairs endothelial function and can trigger innate immune responses in cultured murine macrophages. Here we tested the hypothesis that CoV-2-S damages the heart by activating cardiomyocyte (CM) innate immune responses. HCoV-NL63 is another human coronavirus with a Spike protein (NL63-S) that also engages ACE2 for virus entry but is known to only cause moderate respiratory symptoms. We found that CoV-2-S and not NL63-S interacted with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a crucial pattern recognition receptor that responsible for detecting pathogen and initiating innate immune responses. Our data show that the S1 subunit of CoV-2-S (CoV-2-S1) interacts with the extracellular leucine rich repeats-containing domain of TLR4 and activates NF-kB. To investigate the possible pathological role of CoV-2-S1 in the heart, we generated a construct that expresses membrane-localized CoV-2-S1 (S1-TM). AAV9-mediated, selective expression of the S1-TM in CMs caused heart dysfunction, induced hypertrophic remodeling, and elicited cardiac inflammation. Since CoV-2-S does not interact with murine ACE2, our study presents a novel ACE2-independent pathological role of CoV-2-S, and suggests that the circulating CoV-2-S1 is a TLR4-recognizable alarmin that may harm the CMs by triggering their innate immune responses.","output":"Selectively expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein S1 subunit in cardiomyocytes induces cardiac hypertrophy in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, US public land managers faced the challenge of catering to large increases in camping demand, while maintaining social distancing guidelines. In this paper, we use multivariate linear regression to analyze weekly changes in reservations to US Forest Service (USFS) campgrounds between 2019 and 2020. The regression models estimate the impact of local COVID infection rates, public health restrictions, and spatial spillovers from proximity to National Parks (NPs), metropolitan areas and wildfire on camping demand. Our sample includes 1,688 individual USFS campgrounds from across the contiguous US. The results illustrate the dramatic increases in camping on USFS land that occurred in the summer of 2020 and demonstrate that increases in local infection rates led to significant increases in camping nights reserved in the summer. The results also illustrate that the increase in camping nights reserved at USFS campgrounds was particularly dramatic for campgrounds located near large metropolitan areas and near NPs that saw increases in overall recreational visits. These results point to the important role that public lands played during the pandemic and can help guide public land resource allocations for campground maintenance and operation.","output":"Summer crowds: An analysis of USFS campground reservations during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The frequency of respiratory infections as an infection in cancer patients is high.

In the diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced lung disease, it is important to distinguish pneumonia as an infectious disorder. Immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs)have been widely introduced to treat several types of malignancies. It is currently believed that ICIs do not increase the risk of infections. However, immune-related adverse events(irAEs)induced by ICIs may necessitate the administration of immunosuppressive agents, which could cause opportunistic infections.

It has been reported to have higher incidence and be associated with worse outcomes in patients with cancer. AIM: To examine the characteristics of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and to identify factors which may predict a poorer outcome. METHODS: Patients attending oncology services in Beaumont Hospital who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and May 2020 were included. Demographics and outcomes were determined by chart review. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included in the study. The median age was 62; 59% were male. Ten patients (37%) died all of whom had metastatic or incurable locally advanced disease. Patients with lung cancer had a higher rate of COVID-19 and poorer outcomes. Those with a performance status (PS)  3 were more likely to die than those with PS  2. Compared to those who recovered, patients who died had a higher number of organs affected by cancer and a higher mean Palliative Prognostic Score. CONCLUSION: Patients attending oncology services during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic had an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a higher mortality rate than the general population. Those who died had more advanced cancer as demonstrated by poorer performance status, a greater burden of metastatic disease and a higher Palliative Prognostic Score.","output":"COVID-19-related mortality in cancer patients in an Irish setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is unlikely to be contained anytime soon with conventional medical technology.

We aimed to evaluate the possibility of luteolin evolving into an ideal drug and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We used system pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis to assess the physicochemical properties and biological activities of luteolin and further analyze the binding activities, targets, biological functions, and mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We found that luteolin may exert ideal physicochemical properties and bioactivity, and molecular docking analysis confirmed that luteolin performed effective binding activities in COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. Furthermore, a proteinCprotein interaction network of 538 common targets between drug and disease was constructed and 264 hub targets were obtained. Then, the top 6 hub targets of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity were identified, namely, TP53, AKT1, ALB, IL-6, TNF, and VEGFA. Furthermore, the enrichment analysis suggested that luteolin may exert effects on virus defense, regulation of inflammation, cell growth and cell replication, and immune responses, reducing oxidative stress and regulating blood circulation through the Toll-like receptor; MAPK, TNF, AGE/RAGE, EGFR, ErbB, HIF-1, and PI3KCAKT signaling pathways; PD-L1 expression; and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. The possible dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and asthma is still a potential threat to world health. This research is the first to explore whether luteolin could evolve into a drug candidate for COVID-19/asthma comorbidity.

AIMS: This study was aimed to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a cohort of first responders (i.e. firefighters/paramedics), to detect the underascertainment rate and to assess risk factors associated with seropositivity. METHODS: We conducted a serological survey among 745 first responders in Germany during 27 November and 4 December 2020 to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence using Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). As part of the examination, participants were asked to provide information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like-symptoms, information on sociodemographic characteristics and workplace risk factors for a SARS-CoV-2 infection and any prior COVID-19 infection. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed and seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The test-adjusted seroprevalence was 4% (95% CI 3.1C6.2) and the underascertainment rate was 2.3. Of those tested SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive, 41% were aware that they had been infected in the past. Seropositivity was elevated among paramedics who worked in the emergency rescue team providing first level of pre-hospital emergency care (6% [95% CI 3.4C8.6]) and those directly exposed to a COVID-19 case (5% [95% CI 3.5C8.1]). Overall, the seroprevalence and the underascertainment rate were higher among first responders than among the general population.

However, very little is known regarding its potential role at the cellular level, especially in muscle satellite cells. Therefore, to determine whether vitamin B6 affects the satellite cells, we isolated single myofibers from muscles of vitamin B6-deficient and vitamin B6-supplemented mice. Subsequently, we subjected them to single myofiber culture and observed the number and function of the satellite cells, which remained in their niche on the myofibers. Prior to culture, the vitamin B6-deficient myofibers exhibited a significantly lower number of quiescent satellite cells, as compared to that in the vitamin B6-supplemented myofibers, thereby suggesting that vitamin B6 deficiency induces a decline in the quiescent satellite cell pool in mouse muscles. After 48 and 72 h of culture, the number of proliferating satellite cells per cluster was similar between the vitamin B6-deficient and -supplemented myofibers, but their numbers decreased significantly after culturing the myofibers in vitamin B6-free medium. After 72 h of culture, the number of self-renewing satellite cells per cluster was significantly lower in the vitamin B6-deficient myofibers, and the vitamin B6-free medium further decreased this number. In conclusion, vitamin B6 deficiency appears to reduce the number of quiescent satellite cells and suppress the proliferation and self-renewal of satellite cells during myogenesis.","output":"Satellite Cells Exhibit Decreased Numbers and Impaired Functions on Single Myofibers Isolated from Vitamin B6-Deficient Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Communication in healthcare has influenced and been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit were included. aPL were measured at one time point, with part of the aPL-positive patients retested after 1 month. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were single LAC-positive, two triple-positive, one double-positive, one single aCL, and three aCL IgG and LAC positive. Seven of nine thrombotic patients had at least one aPL. Sixteen of 22 patients without thrombosis were aPL positive, amongst them two triple positives. Nine of 10 retested LAC-positive patients were negative on a second occasion, as well as the double-positive patient. Seven patients were aPS/PT-positive associated to LAC.

The current study aimed to measure the levels of procoagulant MVs and TF-bearing MVs in patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls and to correlate their levels with platelet counts, D-Dimer levels, and other proposed calculated inflammatory markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19 and 37 healthy controls were recruited in the study.

It demonstrated the need for social commitment and pro-social behaviors if societies are to respond successfully. The purpose of this article is to evaluate psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with compliance or noncompliance of individuals with these practices in two different phases of the pandemic experience in Brazil: in the first month and after three months. Participants for the first phase of the study were recruited through advertisements in the media and social networks. 1,914 individuals aged between 14 and 81 years agreed to participate, 78.2% of these were women, from 25 Federative Units in Brazil. In the second phase, 761 individuals who participated in the first phase, were reassessed. The authors used the following instruments for data collection: a standardized questionnaire collecting information of sociodemographic characteristics and dynamics of social isolation; the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; the Life Satisfaction Scale; the Positive and Negative Affections Scale; and the Reduced Personality Markers and Stress Mindset Scale. All instruments used presented evidence of validity and adequate reliability indexes. The comparison of categorical exploratory variables with motives for following social isolation protocols was performed using Pearsons Chi-square, and the comparison of continuous exploratory variables was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Covariance Analysis was performed using as covariates those that showed significance/effect on isolation in previous analyses. The results showed that respondents practicing social isolation to comply with governmental recommendations had lower scores on the scales of neuroticism and conscientiousness. They reported also less stress, anxiety, and depression, and less general distress. Overall, these respondents also displayed more positive affect, and tended to reframe stress in a more positive way than others.

The aim of the work was to identify iron compounds declared by the manufacturer as food supplements and to try to verify compliance with the manufacturers claims. Studies performed by X-ray and thermal analysis confirmed that crystalline iron compounds (iron (II) gluconate, iron (II) fumarate), declared by the manufacturers, were present in the investigated dietary supplements. Iron (II) bisglycinate proved to be semi-crystalline. However, depending on the composition of the formulation, it was possible to identify this compound in the tested supplements. For amorphous iron compounds (iron (III) citrate and iron (III) pyrophosphate), the diffraction pattern does not have characteristic diffraction lines. Food supplements containing crystalline iron compounds have a melting point close to the melting point of pure iron compounds. The presence of excipients was found to affect the shapes and positions of the endothermic peaks significantly. Widening of endothermic peaks and changes in their position were observed, as well as exothermic peaks indicating crystallization of amorphous compounds. Weight loss was determined for all dietary supplements tested. Analysis of the DTG curves showed that the thermal decomposition of most food supplements takes place in several steps.

We sought to understand how people are perceiving these online contents in their networks and how to support tools are being used. To do so, we performed an online survey of 258 social network users and a follow-up interview conducted with 20 of them - 7 of them self-reporting blind and 13 sighted users without a disability. Results show how the different approaches being employed by major platforms are still not sufficient to properly address this issue. Our findings reveal that mainstream users are not aware of the possibility and the benefits of adopting accessible practices. From the general perspectives of end-users experiencing accessible practices, concerning barriers encountered, and motivational factors, we also discuss further approaches to create more user engagement and awareness.","output":"Barriers and Opportunities to Accessible Social Media Content Authoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We determined the effects of perseverance and personal effort costs on durable benefits and leisure identity at various levels of serious leisure.

A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is used to accommodate this cluster covariance. The objective of this research is to develop a new modeling approach that can handle this situation.

Whether these alterations persist and are related to long\\\\term respiratory dysfunction remains unknown. METHODS: Plasma was collected during hospital admission and after 3 months from the NOR\\\\Solidarity trial (n = 181) and analyzed for markers of gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation. At the 3\\\\month follow\\\\up, pulmonary function was assessed by measuring the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)). Rectal swabs for gut microbiota analyses were collected (n = 97) and analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Gut microbiota diversity was reduced in COVID\\\\19 patients with respiratory dysfunction, defined as DL(CO) below the lower limit of normal 3 months after hospitalization. These patients also had an altered global gut microbiota composition, with reduced relative abundance of 20 bacterial taxa and increased abundance of five taxa, including Veillonella, potentially linked to fibrosis. During hospitalization, increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide\\\\binding protein (LBP) were strongly associated with respiratory failure, defined as pO(2)/fiO(2) (P/F ratio) <26.6 kPa. LBP levels remained elevated during and after hospitalization and were associated with low\\\\grade inflammation and respiratory dysfunction after 3 months. CONCLUSION: Respiratory dysfunction after COVID\\\\19 is associated with altered gut microbiota and persistently elevated LBP levels. Our results should be regarded as hypothesis generating, pointing to a potential gutClung axis that should be further investigated in relation to long\\\\term pulmonary dysfunction and long COVID.","output":"Respiratory dysfunction three months after severe COVID\\\\19 is associated with gut microbiota alterations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the effect of national government response measures to Covid-19 on German international capital flows.

After an observation period of 90 days all animals were sacrificed, intrathoracic adhesions classified via thoracoscopy (VATS), meshes explanted and peak peal strength required for lung/mesh separation recorded. RESULTS Adhesions assessed through VATS-exploration were strongest in the PTX-Group while PTE and BM showed comparable results. Tensiometric analyses of peak peal strength confirmed lower values in BM than for PTE and PTX. Both composite materials showed good overall bioincorporation with post-surgical perigraft-fibrosis being strongest in BM.

The concept is based on the continuous emission of unipolar ions. The effect was evaluated through the real-time monitoring of the concentration and size distribution of fine and ultrafine aerosol particles. The measurements were conducted inside and outside of a respiratory mask that was face sealed on a breathing manikin. A commonly used Type N95 respirator and surgical mask were utilized for the tests. The manikin was placed in a 24.3-m(3) indoor test chamber and exposed to polydisperse surrogate aerosols simulating viral and bacterial particles with respect to the aerodynamic size. The particle penetration through the mask was found to decrease by one-to-two orders of magnitude as a result of continuous unipolar ion emission in the chamber. The flux of air ions migrated to the breathing zone and imparted electrical charges of the same polarity to the aerosol particles and the respirator filter surface. This created an electrostatic shield along the external surface of the filter, thus enhancing the protection characteristics provided by the respirator. The above performance enhancement effect is crucial for minimizing the infectious risk in the cases when the conventional filtering-facepiece respirators are not able to provide an adequate protection against airborne viruses and bacteria.","output":"Unipolar ion emission enhances respiratory protection against fine and ultrafine particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

Studies demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell therapy protected blood-brain barrier disruption from several cerebrovascular diseases. However, the underlying mechanism was largely unknown. We therefore hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cells reduced blood-brain barrier destruction by inhibiting matrixmetallo-proteinase-9 and it was related to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). METHODS Adult ICR male mice (n = 118) underwent 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 2  105 mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. Neurobehavioral outcome, infarct volume, and blood-brain barrier permeability were measured after ischemia. The relationship between myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and ICAM-1 release was further determined. RESULTS We found that intracranial injection of mesenchymal stem cells reduced infarct volume and improved behavioral function in experimental stroke models (p < 0.05). IgG leakage, tight junction protein loss, and inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- reduced in mesenchymal stem cell-treated mice compared to the control group following ischemia (p < 0.05). After transplantation, MMP-9 was decreased in protein and activity levels as compared with controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, myeloperoxidase-positive cells and myeloperoxidase activity were decreased in mesenchymal stem cell-treated mice (p < 0.05).

Mesenchymal stem cells attenuated the upward trend of MMP-9 and potentially via downregulating ICAM-1 in endothelial cells.

It is now common in phase III vaccine trials to provide vaccine to those randomized to placebo once efficacy has been demonstrated, precluding a direct assessment of placebo controlled vaccine efficacy after placebo vaccination. In this work we extend methods developed for estimating vaccine efficacy post placebo vaccination to allow variant specific time varying vaccine efficacy, where time is measured since vaccination. The key idea is to infer counterfactual strain specific placebo case counts by using surveillance data that provide the proportions of the different strains. This blending of clinical trial and observational data allows estimation of strain-specific time varying vaccine efficacy, or sieve effects, including for strains that emergent after placebo vaccination. The key requirements are that surveillance strain distribution accurately reflect the strain distribution for a placebo group, throughout follow-up after placebo group vaccination and that at least one strain is present before and after placebo vaccination. For illustration, we develop a Poisson approach for an idealized design under a rare disease assumption and then use a proportional hazards modeling to better reflect the complexities of field trials with staggered entry, crossover, and smoothly varying strain specific vaccine efficacy We evaluate these by theoretical work and simulations, and demonstrate that useful estimation of the efficacy profile is possible for strains that emerge after vaccination of the placebo group. An important principle is to incorporate sensitivity analyses to guard against mis-specfication of the strain distribution.

Additionally, there was no epididymitis associated with the bilateral orchitis. Based on both data in SARS-CoV2 infected males and previous data from prior SARS infections, spermatocyte function may be compromised secondary to this infection. With the various symptoms associated with this virulent pathogen, we characterize the potential complications and importance of fertility follow up.","output":"A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient with bilateral orchitis: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are a highly threatened species because of habitat loss, human conflict, and high prevalence of disease in captivity. An epidemic of feline infectious peritonitis and concern for spread of infectious disease resulted in decreased movement of cheetahs between U.S. zoological facilities for managed captive breeding. Identifying the true feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection status of cheetahs is challenging because of inconsistent correlation between seropositivity and fecal viral shedding. Because the pattern of fecal shedding of FCoV is unknown in cheetahs, this study aimed to assess the frequency of detectable fecal viral shedding in a 30-day period and to determine the most efficient fecal sampling strategy to identify cheetahs shedding FCoV. Fecal samples were collected from 16 cheetahs housed at seven zoological facilities for 30 to 46 consecutive days; the samples were evaluated for the presence of FCoV by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR). Forty-four percent (7/16) of cheetahs had detectable FCoV in feces, and the proportion of positive samples for individual animals ranged from 13 to 93%. Cheetahs shed virus persistently, intermittently, or rarely over 30-46 days. Fecal RT-nPCR results were used to calculate the probability of correctly identifying a cheetah known to shed virus given multiple hypothetical fecal collection schedules. The most efficient hypothetical fecal sample collection schedule was evaluation of five individual consecutive fecal samples, resulting in a 90% probability of identifying a known shedder. Demographic and management risk factors were not significantly associated (P < or = 0.05) with fecal viral shedding. Because some cheetahs shed virus intermittently to rarely, fecal sampling schedules meant to identify all known shedders would be impractical with current tests and eradication of virus from the population unreasonable. Managing the captive population as endemically infected with FCoV may be a more feasible approach.","output":"Detection of feline coronavirus in cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) feces by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction in cheetahs with variable frequency of viral shedding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the health perception, depression, anxiety and stress levels in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting. Material and Methods: In this study, which was planned as a cross-sectional analytical study, individuals were reached through social media using the snow-ball sampling method. Health Perception Scale (HPS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was applied. The study was completed with 440 people. Result: As the level of education increased, health perception scores also increased (p=0.049). There was a significant relationship between regular nutrition, exercise and self-devotion and perception of health (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, p=0.001).

Methods: COVID-19 survivors were recruited for high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax, lung function and serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests 3 months after discharge. The relationship between the clinical characteristics and the pulmonary function or CT scores were investigated. Findings: Fifty-five recovered patients participated in this study. SARS-CoV-2 infection related symptoms were detected in 35 of them and different degrees of radiological abnormalities were detected in 39 patients. Urea nitrogen concentration at admission was associated with the presence of CT abnormalities (P = 0.046, OR 7.149, 95% CI 1.038 to 49.216). Lung function abnormalities were detected in 14 patients and the measurement of D-dimer levels at admission may be useful for prediction of impaired diffusion defect (P = 0.031, OR 1.066, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.129). Of all the subjects, 47 of 55 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum, among which the generation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in infection rehabilitation phase.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Between March 2009 and December 2017, 313 ISR lesions in patients undergoing an OCT guided PCI in five hospitals were retrospectively enrolled. Neoatherosclerosis was defined as a lipid neointima or calcified neointima. We examined the association between neoatherosclerosis and the clinical driven (CD-TLR) rates. In 313 ISR lesions, 64 lesions (20.4%) had bare metal stents and 241 lesions (77.0%) had drug eluting stents (DES). Among them, 47.0% of lesions (147 lesions) had neoatherosclerosis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that eGFR (odds ratio (OR), 0.986; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.974-0.998; P=0.023), the time from the PCI to the ISR (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22; P&lt;0.001) and DES-ISR (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.18-5.43; P=0.019 ) were independent predictors with neoatherosclerosis.

However, the underlying biological mechanisms of how prenatal PM2.5 exposure affects the lungs are incompletely understood, which explains the lack of an ideal in vitro lung development model. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been successfully employed for in vitro developmental toxicity evaluations due to their unique ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body. In this study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of diesel fine PM (dPM2.5) exposure during hPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) differentiation and three-dimensional (3D) multicellular alveolar organoid (AO) development. We found that dPM2.5 (50 and 100 g/mL) treatment disturbed the AEC differentiation, accompanied by upregulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases and inflammation. Exposure to dPM2.5 also promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during AEC and AO development via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, while dPM2.5 had no effect on surfactant protein C expression in hPSC-derived AECs. Notably, we provided evidence, for the first time, that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor to mediate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into target cells, and the cofactor transmembrane protease serine 2 were significantly upregulated in both hPSC-AECs and AOs treated with dPM2.5.

AIM To evaluate the effect of revexepride, a novel prokinetic 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 (5-HT4 ) receptor agonist, compared with placebo, in patients with GERD who have a partial response to PPIs. METHODS A phase 2b, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted, in which patients were randomised to one of three revexepride treatment groups (0.1, 0.5 and 2.0 mg three times daily) or placebo (1:1:1:1 ratio). Daily e-diary data captured patients' symptoms over an 8-week treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome was the weekly percentage of regurgitation-free days in the second half of the study (weeks 5-8). RESULTS In total, 480 patients were randomised and 477 received treatment (mean age 47.9 years; 61% women). The mean percentage of regurgitation-free days increased from baseline (range, 15.0-18.8%) to week 8 (62.3-70.5%) in all four study arms; however, there were no statistically significant differences in this change between placebo and the three treatment arms. No dose-dependent relationship in treatment effect was observed for any of the study endpoints. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was revexepride dose-dependent.

By August 04, 2020, there were globally 695,848 deaths (Johns Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). A total of 5765 of them come from Turkey (Johns Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). As a result, various governments and their respective populations have taken strong measures to control the spread of the pandemic. In this study, a model that is by construction able to describe both government actions and individual reactions in addition to the well-known exponential spread is presented. Moreover, the influence of the weather is included. This approach demonstrates a quantitative method to track these dynamic influences. This makes it possible to numerically estimate the influence that various private or state measures that were put into effect to contain the pandemic had at time t. This might serve governments across the world by allowing them to plan their actions based on quantitative data to minimize the social and economic consequences of their containment strategies. METHODS: A compartmental model based on SEIR that includes the risk perception of the population by an additional differential equation and uses an implicit time-dependent transmission rate is constructed. Within this model, the transmission rate depends on temperature, population, and government actions, which in turn depend on time. The model was tested using different scenarios, with the different dynamic influences being mathematically switched on and off. In addition, the real data of infected coronavirus cases in Turkey were compared with the results of the model. RESULTS: The mathematical study of the influence of the different parameters is presented through different scenarios. Remarkably, the last scenario is also an example of a theoretical mitigation strategy that shows its maximum in August 2020. In addition, the results of the model are compared with the real data from Turkey using conventional fitting that shows good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Although most countries activated their pandemic plans, significant disruptions in health-care systems occurred. The framework of this model seems to be valid for a numerical analysis of dynamic processes that occur during the COVID-19 outbreak due to weather and human reactions. As a result, the effects of the measures introduced could be better planned in advance by use of this model.","output":"A Theoretical Model to Investigate the Influence of Temperature, Reactions of the Population and the Government on the COVID-19 Outbreak in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the Irish experience of the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic (\\"Influenza-18\\"), we demonstrate how pandemic mortality statistics can be sensitive to the demographic composition of a country.

In Spain, the arrival of the first pandemic wave occurred in mid-March 2020 and lasted for 3 months, being abated with home confinement and strict lockdown. After relaxing measures during summer, a second wave began in mid-September and extended until Christmas 2020. METHODS: We compared the main features of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two pandemic waves. We examined the information collected with rapid diagnostic tests and PCR at one university clinic in Madrid, epicenter of the pandemic in Spain. RESULTS: A total of 1569 individuals (968 during the 1(st) wave and 601 during the 2(nd) wave) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies using finger prick capillary blood. In addition, during the second wave, 346 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens using either oral swab or saliva. The overall seroprevalence of first-time tested persons was 12.6% during the 1(st) wave and 7.7% during the 2(nd) wave (p < 0.01). Seroconversions and seroreversions were noticed within 6 months at low rates, both below 5%. Positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen during the 2(nd) wave was recognized in 3.5% of tested individuals, being two cases considered as reinfections. Severe clinical symptoms occurred in a greater proportion during the first wave compared to the second wave (27.8% vs 10.6%, respectively; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Madrid at the end of year 2020 was around 20%. Seroreversions within six months occurred in 4%. Seroconversions and reinfections during the second wave were clinically less severe than during the 1(st) wave. Hypothetically, promotion of wider face masking, outdoor activities, and gathering restrictions during the 2nd wave most likely contributed to reduced exposures to large size inoculum.","output":"Main Differences Between the First and Second Waves of COVID-19 in Madrid, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is conducted to investigate whether restrictions applied during COVID-19 process caused positive gains in individuals' lives or not.

Current models of care are unsustainable and fail to address the many unmet needs of survivors of cancer. Numerous trials have investigated alternate models of care, including models led by primary-care providers, care shared between oncology specialists and primary-care providers, and care led by oncology nurses. These alternate models appear to be at least as effective as specialist-led care and are applicable to many survivors of cancer. Choosing the most appropriate care model for each patient depends on patient-level factors (such as risk of longer-term effects, late effects, individual desire, and capacity to self-manage), local services, and health-care policy. Wider implementation of alternative models requires appropriate support for non-oncologist care providers and endorsement of these models by cancer teams with their patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven some changes in practice that are more patient-centred and should continue. Improved models should shift from a predominant focus on detection of cancer recurrence and seek to improve the quality of life, functional outcomes, experience, and survival of survivors of cancer, reduce the risk of recurrence and new cancers, improve the management of comorbidities, and reduce costs to patients and payers. This Series paper focuses primarily on high-income countries, where most data have been derived. However, future research should consider the applicability of these models in a wider range of health-care settings and for a wider range of cancers.","output":"Improved models of care for cancer survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) surveillance in China is organized through a nationwide network of about 3200 hospitals and health facilities.

Consistently with evidence already available for other viruses, we initially hypothesized the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 presence on PM, and we performed a first experiment specifically aimed at confirming or excluding this research hyphotesys. METHODS: We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period. Filters were properly stored and underwent RNA extraction and amplification according to WHO protocols in two parallel blind analyses performed by two different authorized laboratories. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (E, N, and RdRP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on particulate matter. RESULTS: The first test showed positive results for gene E in 15 out of 16 samples, simultaneously displaying positivity also for RdRP gene in 4 samples. The second blind test got 5 additional positive results for at least one of the three marker genes. Overall, we tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 20 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers. Control tests to exclude false positivities were successfully accomplished. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on PM, thus suggesting a possible use as indicator of epidemic recurrence.","output":"SARS-Cov-2RNA found on particulate matter of Bergamo in Northern Italy: First evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, policy aimed at stimulating generational renewal in agriculture is reported to pay meagre regard to the mental health and wellbeing of an older farmer, overlooking their identity and social circles, which are inextricably intertwined with their occupation and farm. This paper, in probing this contentious issue, casts its net across what could be deemed as disparate literatures, namely connected to transferring the family farm and social gerontology, in order to determine what steps could be taken to reassure older farmers that their sense of purpose and legitimate social connectedness within the farming community will not be jeopardised upon handing over the farm business to the next generation. A number of practical farmer-sensitive actions that can be taken at both policy and societal level are subsequently set forth in this paper to help ease the fear and anxiety associated with stepping aside and retirement from farming amongst older farmers. A particular focus is placed on social and emotional wellbeing benefits of being a member of a social group reflecting farmer-relevant values and aspirations in later life. The potential of the multi-actor EIP-AGRI initiative and the long-established livestock mart sector in facilitating the successful rollout of a social organisation designed to fit the specific needs and interests of the older generation of the farming community is then outlined. In performing this, the paper begins a broad international conversation on the potential of transforming farming into an age-friendly sector of society, in line with the World Health Organizations (WHO) age-friendly environments concept.","output":"Farmers Dont Retire: Re-Evaluating How We Engage with and Understand the Older Farmers Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Global COVID-19 deaths reached at least 400,000 fatalities. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that elicit immunomodulatory effects and had shown in vitro antiviral effects against SRAS-CoV-2. This drug divided opinion worldwide in the medical community but also in the press, the general public and in public health policies. The aim of this systematic review and this meta-analysis was to bring a new overview on this controversial drug and to assess whether hydroxychloroquine could reduce COVID-19 mortality risk in hospitalized patients. Methods and Findings: Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and grey literature were searched until 10 June 2020. Only studies of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) compared with a comparative standard care group and with full-text articles in English were included. Studies reporting effect sizes as Odds Ratios, Hazard Ratio and Relative Risk for mortality risk and the number of deaths per groups were included. This meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020190801). Independent extraction has been performed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. The initial search leaded to 112 articles, from which 16 articles met our inclusion criteria. 15 studies were retained for association between hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 survival including 15,081 patients (8,072 patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 7,009 patients in the standard care arm with respectively, 1,578 deaths and 1,423 deaths). 6 studies were retained for hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality risk (pooled Relative Risk RR=0.82 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.62-1.07, I2=82, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=15)) within hospitalized patients, nor in association with azithromycin (pooled Relative Risk RR=1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.92, I2=75%, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=6)), nor in the numerous subgroup analysis by study design, median age population, published studies (vs unpublished articles), level of bias risk. However, stratified analysis by continents, we found a significant decreased risk of mortality associated with hydroxychlroquine alone but not with azithromycin among European (RR= 0.62 (95%CI: 0.41-0.93, n=7)) and Asian studies (RR=0.36 (95%CI:0.18-0.73, n=1)), with heterogeneity detected across continent (Pheterogeneity between=0.003). These finding should be interpreted with caution since several included studies had a low quality of evidence with a small sample size, a lack of adjustment on potential confounders or selection and intervention biases. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin to reduce COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients. It raises the question of the hydroxychloroquine use outside of clinical trial. Additional results from larger randomised controlled trials are needed","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and mortality risk of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of human comparative studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed elective colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes. Focused research is essential so patient groups can be prioritized based on risk factors in future delays or pandemics.","output":"Delay to elective colorectal cancer surgery and implications for survival: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discovery involves extremely costly and time consuming procedures and can be significantly benefited by computational approaches, such as virtual screening (VS) Structure-based VS relies on scoring functions which aim to evaluate the binding of a candidate compound (ligand) on a protein target Over the last few years, the advancement of the deep learning field has led to the development of novel scoring functions based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have achieved state-of-the-art results In this paper, we present an integrated end-to-end VS pipeline for application on real-world drug discovery scenarios It combines multiple conformations of the ligand with a new CNN scoring function based on the ResNet architecture, called ResNetVS, which incorporates also the docking output score in its evaluation After experiments on the DUD-E dataset, it has shown notable performance, especially in early enrichment, where it overcomes current benchmarks The proposed pipeline is finally applied on the emerging case of COVID-19 pandemic, in a struggle to discover inhibitors for the viral spike protein-ACE2 interaction ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Deep learning-assisted pipeline for Virtual Screening of ligand compound databases: Application on inhibiting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has become a situation of increased concern due to health threats and increased uncertainty. The risk of infection with the respiratory system coronavirus attracts increased attention to respiratory sensations.

The survey was conducted online in May 2020. There were 582 participants (496 women&86 men) between the ages of 18 and 64.ResultsThe severity of dysfunctional breathing significantly correlated with the height of personal anxiety (r=0.488,p=0.000). Women are more likely than men to have dysfunctional breathing (18.19.6vs11.6 7.9;p=0.000) and have more expressed personal anxiety(2610.5vs19.8 9.7;p=0.000). The age of respondents has an inverse correlation with personal anxiety (r=-0.147,p= 0.000), but not with dysfunctional breathing. Respondents who consider coronavirus to be a very dangerous trend to have dysfunctional breathing more than those who believe that the danger of coronavirus is exaggerated(18.110vs15.9 8.9;p=0.052).ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of dysfunctional breathing increases in a wide range of the population, especially among women. Since one of the dysfunctional breathing symptoms is a feeling of difficulty inhaling, anxious people may interpret this as shortness of breath in COVID-19, which may motivate them to seek medical help, thereby artificially increasing the burden on the health system during the COVID-19 pandemic.Conflict of interestNo significant relationships.","output":"Prevalence of dysfunctional breathing associated with anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovation has been a major growing driver of sustainability.

We found that visuotactile feedback, either based on ultrasound or real interpersonal touch, boosts the illusion of being affectively touched and embodied in a virtual body compared to conditions only based on visual feedback. However, real interpersonal touch led to the strongest behavioral and emotional responses compared to the other conditions. Moreover, arousal and the desire to withdraw the caressed hand was highest when being touched by a female avatar compared to a virtual feather.

The birds fasted for18-24 hours prior to the procedure. Induction was followed by 4 distinct progressive responses of the birds to the anesthetic effect, including onset of initial effects at 2.0  1.7 minutes (x?  SD), sternal recumbency with the head still elevated at 2.2  1.6 minutes, lowering and placing the beak tip to the ground at 3.6  3.4 minutes, and lateral positioning of the neck and head at 4.2  3.4 minutes. A general state of sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia were noted 10.0  2.8 minutes postinjection. However, according to an established scoring system for the assessment of anesthetic depth in avian patients, a surgical plane of anesthesia was not achieved. Muscle relaxation determined by the same scoring system lasted for 31.4  17.1 minutes. The penguins' mean respiratory rate did not demonstrate significant change and spontaneous ventilation was present throughout the procedure. Relative peripheral arterial oxygen saturation decreased significantly from 92.83  5.77% at 10 minutes to 90.91  5.77% at 40 minutes following induction. The birds' heart rate also decreased significantly from 112.55  23.97 beats/min at 10 minutes to 101.65  25.42 beats/min at 40 minutes.

Behavioral differences can affect the performance of directional algorithms in hearing aids, as was shown in previous work by using head movement trajectories of normal-hearing (NH) listeners in acoustic simulations for noise-suppression performance predictions. However, the movement behavior of hearing-impaired (HI) listeners with or without hearing aids may differ, and hearing-aid users might adapt their self-motion to improve the performance of directional algorithms. This work investigates the influence of hearing impairment on self-motion, and the interaction of hearing aids with self-motion. In order to do this, the self-motion of three HI participant groups---aided with an adaptive differential microphone (ADM), aided without ADM, and unaidedwas measured and compared to previously measured self-motion data from younger and older NH participants. Self-motion was measured in virtual audiovisual environments (VEs) in the laboratory, and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and SNR improvement of the ADM resulting from the head movements of the participants were estimated using acoustic simulations. HI participants did almost all of the movement with their head and less with their eyes compared to NH participants, which led to a 0.3 dB increase in estimated SNR and to differences in estimated SNR improvement of the ADM. However, the self-motion of the HI participants aided with ADM was similar to that of other HI participants, indicating that the ADM did not cause listeners to adapt their self-motion.","output":"Self-motion with Hearing Impairment and (Directional) Hearing Aids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent reports have surfaced from the United States Food and Drug Administration hearings in December 2020 regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and study participants who developed facial and/or lip swelling after receiving the newly developed drug. Despite an incidence rate of 0.02% in the vaccine arm of the Moderna mRNA-1273 trial, concerns have been expressed about the association of adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections and the COVID-19 vaccines. The International Society for Dermatologic and Aesthetic Surgery (ISDS) understands these concerns and has designed the following study. METHODS: A global survey was designed to capture the incidence of adverse events related to: (1) previous soft tissue filler injections, (2) soft tissue filler injections during positive testing for COVID-19, and (3) soft tissue filler injections during and after receiving any of the COVID-19 vaccines globally available. RESULTS: The information of 106 survey participants from 18 different countries was analyzed. 80.2% (n=85) never experienced any adverse reaction following their soft tissue filler injection whereas 15.1% (n=16) experienced swelling and 4.7% (n=5) experienced pain that lasted longer than two days. Of those who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (n=78), 94.9% reported not to have experienced any adverse reaction related to their previous soft tissue filler injection, whereas 5.1% (n=4) reported to have perceived pain that lasted longer than two days. CONCLUSION: The data collected does not support the concern for an increased risk of developing adverse reactions following soft tissue filler injections associated with the COVID-19 vaccines compared to that risk associated with other previously described triggers or the default risk following soft tissue filler injections.

BACKGROUND: Concern exists that mild coronavirus disease 2019 may cause myocardial and vascular disease. METHODS: Participants were recruited from COVIDsortium, a 3-hospital prospective study of 731 health care workers who underwent first-wave weekly symptom, polymerase chain reaction, and serology assessment over 4 months, with seroconversion in 21.5% (n = 157). At 6 months post-infection, 74 seropositive and 75 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched seronegative control subjects were recruited for cardiovascular phenotyping (comprehensive phantom-calibrated cardiovascular magnetic resonance and blood biomarkers). Analysis was blinded, using objective artificial intelligence analytics where available. RESULTS: A total of 149 subjects (mean age 37 years, range 18 to 63 years, 58% women) were recruited. Seropositive infections had been mild with case definition, noncase definition, and asymptomatic disease in 45 (61%), 18 (24%), and 11 (15%), respectively, with 1 person hospitalized (for 2 days). Between seropositive and seronegative groups, there were no differences in cardiac structure (left ventricular volumes, mass, atrial area), function (ejection fraction, global longitudinal shortening, aortic distensibility), tissue characterization (T1, T2, extracellular volume fraction mapping, late gadolinium enhancement) or biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). With abnormal defined by the 75 seronegatives (2 SDs from mean, e.g., ejection fraction <54%, septal T1 >1,072 ms, septal T2 >52.4 ms), individuals had abnormalities including reduced ejection fraction (n = 2, minimum 50%), T1 elevation (n = 6), T2 elevation (n = 9), late gadolinium enhancement (n = 13, median 1%, max 5% of myocardium), biomarker elevation (borderline troponin elevation in 4; all N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide normal).

International air travel facilitates the spread of dengue across and within borders. To date, no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers. METHODS: Since 2006, Taiwan has operated a program of infrared thermometerCbased non-contact active surveillance at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature 38C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection. RESULTS: In 2011, of the 3,719 febrile passengers from dengue-endemic countries, 74 (2.0%) had laboratory-confirmed dengue infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that those who were aged 60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6C29.6) and had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5C4.1), skin rashes (aOR, 11.0; 95% CI, 3.4C35.1), or a tympanic temperature 39C (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7C4.9) were significantly more likely to have dengue (all p values < 0.05). Compared with travelers who stayed in dengue-endemic countries for 7 days, those who traveled 8C14, 15C21, 22C28, and 29 days were also more likely to be infected (aORs of 10.2, 14.9, 39.0 and 12.0, respectively).

These indirect effects of the pandemic have resulted in people presenting later and with more severe stages of disease, even if their diagnoses are not directly related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We studied these indirect effects of COVID-19 on the imaging workup and outcomes for pediatric patients at our center who had acute appendicitis during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of cases in children 18 years who were evaluated for acute appendicitis during the same period, March 1 to May 31, in both 2019 and 2020. We compared demographic and clinical data as well as surgical and pathological findings, and we graded imaging findings according to severity. Differences in patient outcomes were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Pearson chi-square test. RESULTS: The total number of pediatric patients evaluated with imaging for acute appendicitis dropped by 43% between 2019 and 2020 (298 vs. 169), but the total number of children treated remained similar (59 vs. 51). There was proportionate use of US and CT in each timeframe but a higher percentage of positive imaging findings in 2020 (50/169, 29.6% vs. 56/298, 18.7% in 2019, P=0.04). There were more imaging examinations with features of complicated appendicitis among positive cases (9/51, 18% vs. 5/59, 8% in 2019, P=0.08) and more pathologically proven perforated cases during the pandemic (14/51, 27% vs. 6/59, 10% in 2019, P=0.11), although these results did not reach statistical significance. There were no changes in surgical management, vital signs, laboratory values, length of stay or complication rates. CONCLUSION: There was a large drop in the number of pediatric patients imaged for acute appendicitis during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic despite similar numbers of patients treated. The utilization trends of US vs. CT remained stable between time periods.

PARTICIPANTS: 448 GPs who completed both the 11th wave (2018-2019) of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) Survey and the MABEL COVID-19 Special Online Survey (May 2020). OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of all consultations delivered via telephone (audio) or video (audiovisual); proportion of telehealth consultations delivered via video. RESULTS: 46.1% of GP services were provided using telehealth in early May 2020, with 6.4% of all telehealth consultations delivered via video. Higher proportions of telehealth consultations were observed in GPs in larger practices compared with solo GPs: between +0.21 (95% CI +0.07 to +0.35) and +0.28 (95% CI +0.13 to +0.44). Greater proportions of telehealth consultations were delivered through video for GPs with appropriate infrastructure and for GPs with more complex patients: +0.10 (95% CI +0.04 to +0.16) and +0.04 (95% CI +0.00 to +0.08), respectively. Lower proportions of telehealth consultations were delivered via video for GPs over 55 years old compared with GPs under 35 years old: between -0.08 (95% CI -0.02 to -0.15) and -0.15 (95% CI -0.07 to -0.22), and for GPs in postcodes with a higher proportion of patients over 65 years old: -0.005 (95% CI -0.001 to -0.008) for each percentage point increase in the population over 65 years old.

Aim The purpose of this report is to develop a model to determine whether it is possible to early identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thromboembolic complications (TCs). Methods We analyzed electronic health record data of 108 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the adult ICU of the Erasmus University Medical Center between February 27 and May 20, 2020. By training a decision tree classifier on 66% of the available data, a model for the prediction of TCs was developed. Results The median (interquartile range) age was 62 (53-70) years and 73% were male. Forty-three patients (40%) developed a TC during their ICU stay. Mortality was higher for patients in the TCs group compared to the control group (26% vs. 8%, P=0.03). Lactate dehydrogenase, standardized bicarbonate, albumin, and leukocytes were identified by the Decision Tree classifier as the most powerful predictors for TCs 2 days before the onset of the TC, with a sensitivity of 73% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 on the test dataset. Conclusions Clinically relevant TCs frequently occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients. These can successfully be predicted using a decision tree model. Although this model could be of special importance to aid clinical decision making, its generalizability and clinical impact should be determined in a larger population. Relevance for patients Recently, severe TCs were observed in COVID-19 patients with progressive respiratory failure warranting ICU treatment.

Moreover, the rapid development of information communication technology and the internet of things lay the foundation for the application of sensor networks and cloud computing on medical care. Most elderly often suffer from chronic diseases due to weaker immunity causing a higher infection risk. The problem of infection controlling is an essential issue for residences living in aged care facilities. In the past, for infection control, medical personnel use the manual method of tracking, investigating, and interviewing patients to obtain patient contact list. This method cannot identify residents who have a high risk of infection, distinguish the distance between patients and other residents, and evaluate the risk of infection. To isolate all the residents who contact patients is the only solution that does not only cause repulsion of other residents but also waste medical resources. This study proposes a visual infection control positioning system for aged care facilities using the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology and IoT technology. It can calculate the distance between users and reduce the positioning error.

In order to study packaging, we added the G(N)/G(C) glycoprotein precursor (p110) to a polymerase I-driven minigenome rescue system to generate VLPs that are released into the supernatant. These particles can infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be detected. To determine the role of UUK virus glycoproteins in RNP packaging, we performed an alanine scan of the glycoprotein G(N) cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1 to 81). First, we discovered three regions in the tail (amino acids 21 to 25, 46 to 50, and 71 to 81) which are important for minigenome transfer by VLPs. Further mutational analysis identified four amino acids that were important for RNP packaging. These amino acids are essential for the binding of nucleoproteins and RNPs to the glycoprotein without affecting the morphology of the particles. No segment-specific interactions between the RNA and the cytoplasmic tail could be observed. We propose that VLP systems are useful tools for analyzing protein-protein interactions important for packaging of viral genome segments, assembly, and budding of other members of the Bunyaviridae family.","output":"The glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail of Uukuniemi virus (Bunyaviridae) interacts with ribonucleoproteins and is critical for genome packaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to determine the adherence to biological treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic at Hospital Universitario La Paz, in Madrid.

However, methodological limitations have made many of these studies difficult. Recently, molecular based methods have demonstrated that DNA from prey species can be used to identify zooplankton gut contents, and further, quantitative gut content estimates by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeted to the 18S rRNA gene have been used to estimate feeding rates in appendicularians and copepods. However, while standard single primer based qPCR assays were quantitative for the filter feeding appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, feeding rates were consistently underestimated in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. In this study, we test the hypothesis that prey DNA is rapidly digested after ingestion by copepods and describe a qPCR-based assay, differential length amplification qPCR (dla-qPCR), to account for DNA digestion. The assay utilizes multiple primer sets that amplify different sized fragments of the prey 18S rRNA gene and, based on the differential amplification of these fragments, the degree of digestion is estimated and corrected for. Application of this approach to C. finmarchicus fed Rhodomonas marina significantly improved quantitative feeding estimates compared to standard qPCR.

The disease is caused by a betacoronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus plays a key role in the viral entry into the host cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies having the RBD as a target have the ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding, therefore, prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, represent a promising pharmacological strategy. Bamlanivimab is the first anti-spike neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which got an emergency use authorization from the FDA for COVID-19 treatment. Albeit, bamlanivimab is primarily a neutralizing mAb, some of its effector function related activity was also emphasized. The effector function of antibody therapeutics is greatly affected by their N-linked carbohydrates at the conserved Fc region, possibly influenced by the manufacturing process. Various capillary gel electrophoresis methods are widely accepted in the biopharmaceutical industry for the characterization of therapeutic antibodies. In this paper we introduce a capillary gel electrophoresis based workflow for 1) size heterogeneity analysis to determine the presence/absence of the non-glycosylated heavy chain (NGHC) fragment (SDS-CGE); 2) capillary gel isoelectric focusing for possible N-glycosylation mediated charge heterogeneity determination, e.g., for excess sialylation and finally, 3) capillary gel electrophoresis for N-glycosylation profiling and sequencing. Our results have shown the presence of negligible amount of non-glycosylated heavy chain (NGHC) while 25% acidic charge variants were detected. Comprehensive N-glycosylation characterization revealed the occurrence of approximately 8.2% core-afucosylated complex and 17% galactosylated N-linked oligosaccharides, suggesting the possible existence of antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector function in addition to the generally considered neutralizing effect of this particular therapeutic antibody molecule.","output":"Introduction of a Capillary Gel Electrophoresis-Based Workflow for Biotherapeutics Characterization: Size, Charge, and N-Glycosylation Variant Analysis of Bamlanivimab, an Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Product"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Following the COVID-19 lockdown, uptake of slitlamp-enabled live teleophthalmology increased. Its use contributed to a reduction of referrals escalated to secondary care during-lockdown (avoided: 64% pre-lockdown vs 86% during-lockdown). BACKGROUND: Live teleophthalmology using video conferencing allows real-time, three-way consultation between secondary care, community providers and patients, improving interpretation of slit lamp findings and potentially reducing referrals to secondary care. NHS Forth Valley implemented live teleophthalmology in March 2019. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created urgency to deliver ophthalmic care while minimising the risk of contracting or spreading the disease. We aim to compare the uptake and two outcomes (number of avoided secondary care referrals; pattern of presenting conditions) of live teleophthalmology consultations in NHS Forth Valley before and during the COVID-19 national lockdown. METHODS: An NHS secure video conferencing platform connected the video slit lamps of optometrists, or an iPad mounted on a slit lamp and viewing through the eyepieces, to a secondary care ophthalmologist via a virtual live clinic/waiting area. Data about avoiding a secondary care referral were extracted from a post-consultation ophthalmologist survey for 14 months of data. Pre- and during-lockdown intervals were before/after 23 March 2020, when routine eyecare appointments were suspended. Numbers of avoided referrals to secondary care and patterns of presenting conditions were compared for pre- and during-lockdown periods. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic markedly increased use of live teleophthalmology in NHS Forth Valley. Surveys were completed for 164 of 250 (66%) teleophthalmology consultations over the study period. Data from 154 surveys were analysed, 78 and 76 for the pre- and during-lockdown periods, respectively. Significantly more during-lockdown (86%) than pre-lockdown (64%; difference 21%, 95% CI 8-34%, p = 0.001) surveys indicated that referrals to secondary care were avoided. CONCLUSION: Survey data from ophthalmologists suggest significantly fewer escalations to secondary care due to teleophthalmology use.","output":"Live teleophthalmology avoids escalation of referrals to secondary care during COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to break the chain of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, most countries are taking the help of mobile apps The existing apps lack the necessary features to address the major issues of detection and alert of social distancing, detection and prevention of large gatherings, easy generation of travel permit during lock down, etc The existing apps do not provide any solution for alerting user of the users social distance violation Though many of these apps are being used for contact tracing, they do not say which places the user has visited recently which is a crucial parameter in contact tracing and preventing community spread Smartphones empowered with the latest technology like Google geo-location and low energy Bluetooth (BLE) with such an app can complement a countrys general Covid-19 control strategiescomprising testing, contact tracing, seclusion and social distancing In this work, we develop a Covid-19 tracker and social distancing app named as COVTrac, an Android app that uses various capabilities of the smartphone to address these issues with the existing mobile app along with a number of other concerns such as privacy, accurate contact tracing and prevention of socio-physical interactions ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"COVTrac: Covid-19 Tracker and Social Distancing App"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the effect of face masks on preventing airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is well studied, no study has evaluated their effect on blood pressure (BP).

Our study at a major NHS Trust examined the clinical characteristics, attributes and outcomes of PE in COVID-19, which have infrequently been explored in literature.MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients with PE diagnosed on CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) over 2 months in 1st and 2nd waves (April 2020 and January 2021). Data collected from electronic health and imaging records included patient demographics, D-dimers, oxygen requirements, clinical outcomes, thromboprophylaxis/treatment and PE attributes on CTPA.ResultsWe identified 76 COVID-19 patients with PE (mean age 62.2 years, 69.7% male, 40.8% Caucasian). Patients experienced prolonged periods of COVID-19 symptoms prior to PE diagnosis - 19.6 day symptoms in 1st wave (n = 16, 21.9%) compared to 15.2 days in 2nd wave (n = 57, 78.1%). Average D-dimer was highly elevated (mean = 11576 ng/mL). 43 (56.5%) patients had high oxygen requirements - 21 (27.6%) required 10 litres/min via mask, 13 (17.1%) required non-invasive ventilation and 9 (11.8%) were intubated and ventilated. 22 patients (28.9%) were admitted to intensive care and 11 patients (14.5%) died. On admission, 48 patients (63.2%) were started on treatment dose enoxaparin (high PE suspicion) and 12 (15.8%) had intermediate (prophylactic) dose enoxaparin. PEs were largely treated with 3C6 months of rivaroxaban (n = 43, 56.6%) or apixaban (n = 7, 9.2%). 65.5% (n = 49) of patients had bilateral PEs;largest sizes being segmental (n = 32, 42.1%), subsegmental (n = 17, 22.4%), lobar (n = 16, 21.1%), main pulmonary artery (n= 5, 6.6%) and saddle (n = 5, 6.6%). 15 patients (19.7%) had evidence of right heart strain on CTPA.ConclusionsOur study suggests that PE in COVID-19 is more common in males and in those with COVID symptoms greater than 2 weeks, high oxygen requirements and highly elevated D-dimers. There should be a low threshold for investigating such patients for PE. Moreover, we found COVID-19 patients with PE have high likelihood of having a bilateral pulmonary distribution with right heart strain.","output":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary embolism in 1st and 2nd waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected peoples behavioral patterns and schedules because of stay-at-home orders and a reduction of social interactions.

In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. LiquidCliquid phase separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","output":"Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 phase separates into RNA-rich polymerase-containing condensates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its emergence into the human population at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Our epitope analysis using DiscoTope suggests possible changes in B cell epitopes in the S1 region of the spike protein across variants, in particular the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages, which may influence immunodominance. Additionally, we show that high-affinity MHC-I-binding peptides and glycosylation sites on the spike protein appear consistent between variants with the exception of an extra glycosylation site in the P.1 variant.

Our methodology utilizes latent factors to impact gene expression values for each cell to help account for zero-inflation, increased cell-to-cell variability, and overdispersion that are unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data. Condition-dependent parameters determine which latent factors are activated in a gene, which allows for not only the calculation of gene-gene co-expression within each group but also the calculation of the co-expression differences between groups.

Four structural genes, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S), play a key role in controlling entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. The evolution of these genes may determine infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, but thus far, little is known about them. Methods: We analyzed 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the GenBank database to determine the evolutionary patterns of the four structural genes by employing various molecular evolution algorithms. Results: Phylogenetic analyses showed that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based upon protein sequence. Although intragenic recombination was not detected among different alleles, purifying selection has affected the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles, our result revealed that codon 614 of the S glycoprotein has been subjected to a strong positive selection pressure, and a consistent D614G mutation was identified. Additionally, another potentially positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein was also identified with a consistent L5F mutation. The allele containing the D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 transmission, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. Nevertheless, L5F allele expansion was found to be relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at subdomain 2 (SD2) of the C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling showed that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of a salt bridge between S protein monomers and increase their flexibility, consequently promoting receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment, and ultimately entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein, the L5F mutation may facilitate protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. Conclusions: This is the first reported evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. This finding contributes to a broader understanding of the adaptive mechanisms of this virus, and provide insight for the development of novel therapeutic approaches, as well as the creation of effective vaccines, through targeting mutation sites.","output":"Molecular Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Structural Genes: Evidence of Positive Selection in the Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak triggered by religious activities occurred in Daegu, Korea in February 2020. This outbreak spread rapidly to the community through high-risk groups. This study describes the characteristics of COVID-19 cases based on S religious group membership and summarizes the Daegu municipal government's processes and responses to control the outbreak. METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases were obtained through basic and in-depth epidemiological surveys. General characteristics, the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the case-fatality rate, and the time-to-event within each group were presented after stratifying confirmed cases according to S religious group membership. RESULTS: Overall, 7,008 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Daegu from February 18, 2020 to June 30, 2020, and 61.5% (n= 4,309) were S religious group members. Compared with non-members, members had a higher proportion of female (p< 0.001) and younger age (p< 0.001), as well as lower disease prevalence. At the time of the investigation, 38.4% of cases in members were asymptomatic versus 23.7% of cases in non-members (p< 0.001). The case-fatality rate of non-members aged &#8805; 60 years was significantly higher than that of members (p< 0.001). Compared with non-members, members had longer intervals from symptom onset to diagnosis (p< 0.001) and from diagnosis to admission (p< 0.001), and a shorter interval from admission to discharge (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological features of S religious group members, including the proportion of asymptomatic cases, case-fatality rate, and time-to-event, differed from non-members.

We set out to test whether decision aids can support self-isolation. DESIGN: We conducted a pre-registered online experiment with a nationally representative sample (n = 500). Three stages tested: (i) whether decision trees help people to decide whether they need to self-isolate; (ii) whether an online planning tool increases people's confidence in their ability to self-isolate; and (iii) whether infographics help people to absorb advice on managing a household in which someone must self-isolate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Accuracy of matching symptom patterns to a response scale for the need to self-isolate; (ii) self-reported confidence in coping with self-isolation; (iii) objective tests of recall and comprehension. RESULTS: Decision trees improved decisions about when self-isolation was necessary, although participants systematically underestimated the need to self-isolate with less common COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. sore throat, fatigue). The online planning tool increased confidence about coping with self-isolation only among the adults aged under 40. Infographics improved recall and comprehension of how to manage self-isolation.

To address this need, we propose a four step pipeline which: (i) enhances the quality of multiple timeseries clinical data through an automated data curation workflow, (ii) deploys Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) for the detection of features with increased connectivity based on dynamic association analysis across multiple points, (iii) utilizes Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) and trajectory analysis for the early identification of COVID-19 patients with common clinical profiles, and (iv) trains robust multiple additive regression trees (MART) for ICU admission and mortality classification based on the extracted homogeneous clusters, to identify risk factors and biomarkers for disease progression. The contribution of the extracted clusters and the dynamically associated clinical data improved the classification performance for ICU admission to sensitivity 0.83 and specificity 0.83, and for mortality to sensitivity 0.74 and specificity 0.76. Additional information was included to enhance the performance of the classifiers yielding an increase by 4% in sensitivity and specificity for mortality.

The findings showed that universities swiftly shifted to e-classes during the lockdown but that they were not adequately primed for an appropriate assessment in an online environment. The findings further showed that instructors were skeptical about the efficiency of remote assessment of their students. In addition, faculty members believed there was still a long way to go with regards to (1) the unavailability of reliable software to preclude academic dishonesty;(2) some faculty being unable to assess their students in VLE as it was their first experience;and (3) formative assessment not having been given enough attention.

The expression of IARS2 was measured by real time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction and western blot analysis. Cell counting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and colony formation assay were conducted to assess the effect of IARS2 on melanoma cell proliferation.

Finally, immunohistochemistry was employed to validate the expression of IARS2 protein in melanoma tissues. In this study it was found that IARS2 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, IARS2 protein also exhibited elevated expression in the tumour tissues obtained from melanoma patients. After suppression of the mRNA expression of IARS2, the proliferation and colony formation ability of the A375 cells were significantly inhibited, while the proportion of apoptotic A375 cells increased significantly, as indicated by an enhanced phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase 3/7 activity after IARS2 knockdown.

Similarly, nearly a third of the supplement users were hospitalized compared to 11% in the non-users. The Charlson Co-Morbidity Index was 3.03 (SD) in users vs 1.02 (SD) in non-users. Conclusion 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were taking vitamin D. They tended to be older, more likely to be African American and have significant co-morbidities. Hospitalization and mortality were higher among those taking Vitamin D in this cohort. Vitamin D is widely used to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 but without evidence of efficacy. Disclosures Sally L.

Immune dysregulation and hypoxemia are two important pathophysiological problems in patients with COVID-19 that affect peripheral blood count parameters. We hypothesized that assessment of the neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR) and red blood cell distribution width index (RDW-SD) could predict death in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Methods. Seventy patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19 acute respiratory failure were included in the study. RDW-SD and NLR on the day of ICU admission and peak values during the entire hospitalization were assessed. The primary endpoint was death before ICU discharge. Results. Patients who died had higher NLR on admission (20.3, IQR 15.3C30.2 vs. 11.0, IQR 6.8C16.9; p = 0.003) and higher RDW-SD (48.1 fL; IQR 43.1C50.5 vs. 43.9 fL; IQR 40.9C47.3, p = 0.01) than patients discharged from the ICU. NLR and RDW-SD values on ICU admission accurately predicted death in 76% (AUC = 0.76; 95%CI 0.65C0.86; p = 0.001; cut-off > 14.38) and 72% of cases (AUC = 0.72; 95%CI 0.60C0.82; p = 0.003; cut-off > 44.7 fL), respectively. Multivariable analysis confirmed that NLR > 14.38 on the day of ICU admission was associated with a 12-fold increased risk of death (logOR 12.43; 95%CI 1.61C96.29, p = 0.02), independent of other blood counts, clinical and demographic parameters.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the emerging industrial parks and prospects of cluster cities. The aim of this article is to explore the different urban planning measures employed during the pandemic and to propose sound planning methods for the development of sustainable industrial-oriented urban centers. In Ethiopia, industrial-oriented urbanization started in the 1920s with the advent of the railway line. Currently, more than 25 industrial park-based cluster cities have flourished adjacent to cities. A number of initiatives have been undertaken by major stakeholders in these cluster cities to combat COVID-19. Their efforts, however, were made difficult because urban planners were not proactive and did not have foresight in the selection of sites that can mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or other similar pandemics. The researchers believe the problem could have been addressed if the planners used a science-based, human-focused, computer-aided decision-making approach, i.e., space syntax. Therefore, this article recommends that planners become proactive and work in collaboration with different stakeholders for the creation of resilient and livable industrial parks-oriented urban centers.","output":"Pandemic-Resilient Urban Centers: A New Way of Thinking for Industrial-Oriented Urbanization in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSpecialist palliative care services have a key role in a whole system response to COVID-19.

Improving medication self-management is important; however, most medication management frameworks focus on adherence and limit the integration of the core components of self-management. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to identify what is reported in the literature on medication management frameworks or models within the context of self-management. Methods Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library) and grey literature (healthcare and government organization websites) were searched for articles that described a framework or model developed or adapted for medication management, included components of self-management and was published from January 2000 to January 2020. During the screening of titles and abstracts, 5668 articles were reviewed, 5242 were excluded and 426 were then assessed at the full-text level. Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Results About half of the frameworks were newly developed (n=20), while the other half were adapted from, or applied, a previous model or framework (n=19). The majority of frameworks focused on medication adherence and most of the self-management domains were categorized as medical management, followed by emotional and role management. Conclusion Medication self-management is a complex process and often impacts multiple areas of an individual's life. It is important for future frameworks to incorporate a comprehensive, holistic conceptualization of self-management that is inclusive of the three self-management domains - medical, emotional and role management.","output":"Medication Management Frameworks in the Context of Self-Management: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pediatric oncology clinical research landscape, particularly in Central and South America, Africa, and Asia, which bear the highest burden of global childhood cancer cases, is less characterized in the literature. Review of how existing pediatric cancer clinical trial groups internationally have been formed and how their research goals have been pursued is critical for building global collaborative research and data-sharing efforts, in line with the WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer. METHODS: A narrative literature review of collaborative groups performing pediatric cancer clinical research in each continent was conducted. An inventory of research groups was assembled and reviewed by current pediatric cancer regional and continental leaders. Each group was narratively described with identification of common structural and research themes among consortia. RESULTS: There is wide variability in the structure, history, and goals of pediatric cancer clinical trial collaborative groups internationally. Several continental regions have longstanding endogenously-formed clinical trial groups that have developed and published numerous adapted treatment regimens to improve outcomes, whereas other regions have consortia focused on developing foundational database registry infrastructure supported by large multinational organizations or twinning relationships. CONCLUSION: There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to increasing collaboration between international pediatric cancer clinical trial groups, as this requires a nuanced understanding of local stakeholders and resources necessary to form partnerships. Needs assessments, performed either by local consortia or in conjunction with international partners, have generated productive clinical trial infrastructure.

Our secondary objective was to determine the predictors of metabolic syndrome and individual metabolic control variables among the study participants to guide future management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive, case-matched cross-sectional study for four months from 15th June 2019 to 15th October 2019 at Block 6 Diabetes Reference Clinic in Gaborone, Botswana. We compared the proportions of metabolic syndrome and individual metabolic control variables based on gender and HIV status by means of bivariate analysis (Chi-squared test or Fishers exact test) to determine factors associated with metabolic control. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, 86% of the study participants were found to have metabolic syndrome by International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria with 79.8% among HIV-infected and 89.1% among HIV-negative participants (p-value = 0.018). Older age was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome (p-value = 0.008). Female gender was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome as compared to male gender (P-value < 0.001), and with a statistically significant higher proportion of low HDL-C compared to males (P-value < 0.001). Female participants were significantly more likely to be obese as compared to males (P-value < 0.001). High triglycerides were more common in HIV-infected compared to HIV-negative participants (P-value = 0.004). HIV-negative participants were more likely to be obese as compared to HIV-infected participants (P-value = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Metabolic syndrome is an appreciable problem in this tertiary clinic in Botswana for both HIV-infected and HIV-negative participants.

COVID-19 infected case records and meteorological data in four cities (Wuhan, Beijing, Urumqi and Dalian) in China were collected. Then, the best-fitting model of COVID-19 infected cases was selected from four statistic models (Gaussian, logistic, lognormal distribution and allometric models), and the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 infected cases was analyzed using multiple stepwise regression and Pearson correlation. The results showed that the lognormal distribution model was well adapted to describing the change of COVID-19 infected cases compared with other models (R2 > 0.78; p-values < 0.001). Under the condition of implementing community-based pandemic prevention and control, relationship between COVID-19 infected cases and meteorological factors differed among the four cities. Temperature and relative humidity were mainly the driving factors on COVID-19 transmission, but their relations obviously varied with season and geographical location. In summer, the increase in relative humidity and the decrease in maximum temperature facilitate COVID-19 transmission in arid inland cities, while at this point the decrease in relative humidity is good for the spread of COVID-19 in coastal cities. For the humid cities, the reduction of relative humidity and the lowest temperature in the winter promote COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Influence of Meteorological Factors on the COVID-19 Transmission with Season and Geographic Location"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent researches reported that several circular RNAs (circRNAs) were associated with the glioblastoma (GBM) progression, while the regulatory role of circPITX1 remains unknown in GBM.

The proliferation capability of cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony-forming assays. The matrigel angiogenesis assay was used to assess tube formation in GBM cells. Flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle distribution of GBM cells. The migration and invasion assays were assessed by transwell assay. The Western blot assay was employed to quantify the protein expression level in GBM tissues and cells. The targets of circPITX1 and miR-584-5p were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. A xenograft experiment in nude mice was used to assess the functional role of circPITX1 in vivo. CircPITX1 was obviously overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells when compared with negative groups. The functional experiment implied that knockdown of circPITX1 suppressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo along with induced cell cycle arrest of GBM cells. Furthermore, miR-584-5p was a target gene of circPITX1, and knockdown of miR-584-5p could abolish circPITX1 silencing-induced effects on GBM cells. KPNB1 was a target gene of miR-584-5p, and functional experiments revealed that overexpression of miR-584-5p repressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle process in GBM cells by targeting KPNB1.

AIMS This multidisciplinary review critically evaluates how the management of reflux-like symptoms could better reflect their multifactorial pathophysiology. METHODS A panel of experts (from general practice, gastroenterology and gastropsychology) attended a series of workshops to review current management and propose a framework for the provision of more individualised care. RESULTS It was agreed that the perceptual (as well as the physiological) causes of reflux-like symptoms should be considered at the start of management, not as a last resort when all else has failed. A short course of PPI is a pragmatic approach to address reflux-like symptoms, but equally important is counselling about the gut-brain axis and provision of symptom-specific behavioural interventions for those who show signs of somatisation, hypervigilance or co-existing disorders of gut-brain interaction. Other low-harm interventions such as lifestyle and dietary advice, should also be better integrated into care at an early stage. Multidisciplinary care management programmes (including dietary, weight loss, exercise and behavioural intervention) should be developed to promote greater self-management and take advantage of the general shift toward the use of remotely accessed health care resources.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate; nurses perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample.

The Cys-PANi@FAU-50 composite displayed an open mesoporous structure richly decorated with nitrogen/oxygen-containing functional groups, which consequently boosted the diffusion, adsorption and reduction of Cr(VI) oxyanions. The Cr(VI) adsorption behavior was satisfactorily tailored via pseudo-second-order law and Langmuir model with a maximum uptake capacity of 384.6 mg/g. Based on the advanced statistical physics theory, the monolayer model with two distinct receptor sites provided a reliable microscopic and macroscopic prediction of the Cr(VI) adsorption process. Stereographically, the Cr(VI) ions were adsorbed through horizontal multi-anchorage and vertical multi-molecular mechanisms on the amine and hydroxyl groups of Cys-PANi@FAU-50, respectively. The thermodynamic functions evidenced that the Cr(VI) adsorption was an endothermic spontaneous process. XPS analysis proved that Cr(VI) ions were electrostatically adsorbed, and subsequently reduced to Cr(III), which were in turn immobilized by chelation with imine/sulfonate groups and electrostatic interactions with carboxylate groups.

Understanding susceptibility to infection and the role of immune memory is important for identifying at-risk populations and could have implications for vaccine deployment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate subsequent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) among individuals who are antibody-positive compared with those who are antibody-negative, using real-world data. DESIGN: This was an observational descriptive cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: The study utilized a national sample to create cohorts from a de-identified dataset composed of commercial laboratory test results, open and closed medical and pharmacy claims, electronic health records, hospital billing (chargemaster) data, and payer enrollment files from the United States. Patients were indexed as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first SARS-CoV-2 antibody test recorded in the database. Patients with more than 1 antibody test on the index date where results were discordant were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: Primary endpoints were index antibody test results and post-index diagnostic NAAT results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, as measured in 30-day intervals (0C30, 31C60, 61C90, >90 days). Additional measures included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of the index antibody test, such as recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence of COVID-19 (diagnoses or NAAT+) and recorded comorbidities. RESULTS: We included 3,257,478 unique patients with an index antibody test. Of these, 2,876,773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, 378,606 (11.6%) had a positive index antibody result, and 2,099 (0.1%) had an inconclusive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test were somewhat older at index than those with a positive result (mean of 48 versus 44 years). A fraction (18.4%) of individuals who were initially seropositive converted to seronegative over the follow up period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (CI) of positive NAAT results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index versus those with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (2.73 C 2.97) at 0C30 days, 0.67 (0.6 C 0.74) at 31C60 days, 0.29 (0.24 C 0.35) at 61C90 days), and 0.10 (0.05 C 0.19) at >90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who display positive antibody tests are initially more likely to have a positive NAAT, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but over time become markedly less likely to have a positive NAAT. This result suggests seropositivity using commercially available assays is associated with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown and may wane over time; this parameter will need to be addressed in a study with extended duration of follow up.","output":"Real-world data suggest antibody positivity to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a decreased risk of future infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced several European governments to impose severe lockdown measures. The reduction of physical activity during the lockdown could have been deleterious. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational, retrospective study was to investigate the effect of the lockdown strategy on the physical activity burden and subsequent reassessment in a group of patients with heart failure who were followed by means of remote monitoring. METHODS: We analyzed remote monitoring transmissions during the 3-month period immediately preceding the lockdown, 69 days of lockdown, and 3-month period after the first lockdown in a cohort of patients with heart failure from a general hospital in Lombardy, Italy. We compared variation of daily physical activity measured by cardiac implantable electrical devices with clinical variables collected in a hospital database. RESULTS: We enrolled 41 patients with heart failure that sent 176 transmissions. Physical activity decreased during the lockdown period (mean 3.4, SD 1.9 vs mean 2.9, SD 1.8 hours/day; P<.001) but no significant difference was found when comparing the period preceding and following the lockdown (C0.0007 hours/day; P=.99). We found a significant correlation between physical activity reduction during and after the lockdown (R(2)=0.45, P<.001). The only significant predictor of exercise variation in the postlockdown period was the lockdown to prelockdown physical activity ratio. CONCLUSIONS: An excessive reduction of exercise in patients with heart failure decreased the tolerance to exercise, especially in patients with more comorbidities. Remote monitoring demonstrated exercise reduction, suggesting its potential utility to encourage patients to maintain their usual physical activity levels.","output":"Physical Activity in Patients With Heart Failure During and After COVID-19 Lockdown: Single-Center Observational Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection is initiated in the ocular, nasal, or oral cavity, sensory neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG) become infected. Following a burst of viral transcription in TG neurons, lytic cycle viral genes are suppressed and latency is established. The latency-associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene abundantly expressed during latency, and LAT expression is important for the latency-reactivation cycle. Reactivation from latency is required for virus transmission and recurrent disease, including encephalitis. The Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway is differentially expressed in TG during the bovine herpesvirus 1 latency-reactivation cycle. Hence, we hypothesized HSV-1 regulates the Wnt/-catenin pathway and promotes maintenance of latency because this pathway enhances neuronal survival and axonal repair. New studies revealed -catenin was expressed in significantly more TG neurons during latency compared to TG from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant virus. When TG explants were incubated with media containing dexamethasone to stimulate reactivation, significantly fewer -catenin+ TG neurons were detected. Conversely, TG explants from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant increased the number of -catenin+ TG neurons in the presence of DEX relative to samples not treated with DEX. Impairing Wnt signaling with small molecule antagonists reduced virus shedding during explant-induced reactivation. These studies suggested -catenin was differentially expressed during the latency-reactivation cycle, in part due to LAT expression.","output":"Herpes simplex virus 1 regulates -catenin expression in TG neurons during the latency-reactivation cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effect of the COVID-19 outbreak has led policymakers around the world to attempt transmission control. However, lockdown and shutdown interventions have caused new social problems and designating policy resumption for infection control when reopening society remains a crucial issue. We investigated the effects of different resumption strategies on COVID-19 transmission using a modeling study setting. METHODS: We employed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks under five reopening strategies based on China's business resumption progress. The effect of each strategy was evaluated using the peak values of the epidemic curves vis--vis confirmed active cases and cumulative cases. Two-sample t-test was performed in order to affirm that the pick values in different scenarios are different. RESULTS: We found that a hierarchy-based reopen strategy performed best when current epidemic prevention measures were maintained save for lockdown, reducing the peak number of active cases and cumulative cases by 50 and 44%, respectively. However, the modeled effect of each strategy decreased when the current intervention was lifted somewhat. Additional attention should be given to regions with significant numbers of migrants, as the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening is intrinsically high. CONCLUSIONS: Business resumption strategies have the potential to eliminate COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening without special control measures. The proposed resumption strategies focused mainly on decreasing the number of imported exposure cases, guaranteeing medical support for epidemic control, or decreasing active cases.","output":"Effect of different resumption strategies to flatten the potential COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopens: a modeling study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH(3) cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I(h) amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I(h) activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K(+) current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.","output":"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adoption of protective health behaviors is extremely important to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the influencing factors on adopting preventive behaviors during COVID-19 using health belief model (HBM) among the urban population in Maragheh, a city from North West of Iran.

METHODS Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Oxygen flow was gradually increased from 1 to 5 L/min, with the HPS sitting at 45. The leakage jet plume was revealed by laser light-sheet and images captured by high-definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. The experiments were conducted at a double-door, negative pressure isolation room with a dimension of 4.1  5.1  2.6 m, pressure of -7.4 Pa and 16 air exchanges/h (ACH) (room A). Results were compared with experiments repeated in a smaller isolation room with a dimension of 2.7  4.2  2.4 m, pressure of -5 Pa and 12 ACH (room B). RESULTS Room A: an exhalation jet spread almost horizontally outward from the nostrils of the HPS to 0.66 m and 1 m towards the end of bed when oxygen flow was increased from 1 to 5 L/min respectively. Room B: there was interaction between the downward ceiling ventilation current and the exhaled air from the HPS, leading to deflection of exhaled smoke towards the head of the HPS at an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min. As oxygen flow was increased gradually to 5 L/min, more room contamination with smoke was noted.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival rates and trends of skull base chondrosarcomas (SBC). METHODS Data from SBC patients between 1975 and 2017 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The age-adjusted incidence rates (AAR) were calculated for the overall cases and based on gender, age, race, and histology. Furthermore, the relative survival rates for one, three, and five years, and the rates stratified to the aforementioned selected variables were computed. Besides, we conducted a joint point regression analysis to calculate the annual percent change (APC) and its associated standard error (SE) for AAR and mortality. RESULTS The AAR rate of SBC was 0.019 per 100,000. Higher AAR rates were observed in patients who were in the 65-74-year-age-group, females, Caucasians, and had none mesenchymal subtype. The relative one-year, three-year and five-year-survival rates were 99.58 %, 93.67 %, and 89.10 %, respectively. Lower survival rates were noted in patients who were males, African Americans, and had a mesenchymal subtype. The trend analysis has shown a significant yearly increase (P < 0.001) in AAR of SBC (APC  SE = 0.0005 %0.0001), along with a significant yearly decline in mortality rates (APC  SE= -0.0202 %0.0029).

OBJECTIVES: We created a Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) to support counties and municipalities by integrating baseline data on relevant community vulnerabilities with dynamic data on local infection rates and interventions. The PVI visually synthesizes county-level vulnerability indicators, enabling their comparison in regional, state, and nationwide contexts. METHODS: We describe the data streams used and how these are combined to calculate the PVI, detail the supporting epidemiological modeling and machine-learning forecasts, and outline the deployment of an interactive web Dashboard. Finally, we describe the practical application of the PVI for real-world decision-making. RESULTS: Considering an outlook horizon from 1 to 28 days, the overall PVI scores are significantly associated with key vulnerability-related outcome metrics of cumulative deaths, population adjusted cumulative deaths, and the proportion of deaths from cases. The modeling results indicate the most significant predictors of case counts are population size, proportion of black residents, and mean PM(2.5). The machine learning forecast results were strongly predictive of observed cases and deaths up to 14 days ahead.

We present the first case report of a calcific pancreatitis associated with not only PHPT but a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 52 years old woman suffering from mellitus diabetes consulting the emergency rooms for acute pancreatitis with hyperlipasemia and hypercalcemia whom final imaging discovered a pituitary gland adenoma, a left surrenal adenoma, and a parathyroid adenoma, and for the pancreas it reveiled an acute mild pancreatitis with a background of calcifications, no gallstones, no bone or renal abnormalities; and the parathyroidectomy was performed following the minimally invasive selective technique. DISCUSSION Calcemia levels testing routinely performed help discover hyperparathyroidism. The associations of chronic pancreatic inflammation to hyperparathyroidism needs to be studied, even if hypercalcemia is prooven to be a risk factor of pancreatitis; the mechanism behind this association is brievely described. parathyroidectomy is the definitive cure for hyperparathyroidism, the technique advances has shown effective localization of the responsible adenoma and the intraoperative testing of parathormon levels after resection decreasing is a very reliable extemporaneous sign for the success of the procedure. CONCLUSION The endocrine system is synchronized; meaning the injury of one gland should start the search for others. In our case, the first main lead should not have been the acute pancreatitis but her diabetes. In the future we suggest that diabetes primary explorations may need a pancreatic imaging and endocrine explorations even though it could get pricier for the healthcare system, but giving the complications that we could prevent; it is to be considered.","output":"Calcific pancreatitis uncovering a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: A case report in compliance with the scare guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Guanidine DNA quadruplex (G4-DNA) structures convey a distinctive layer of epigenetic information that is critical for regulating key biological activities and processes as transcription, replication, and repair in living cells.

Here we present a novel engineering platform to display multiple protein therapeutics simultaneously on the EV surface. As proof-of-concept, we screened multiple endogenous display strategies for decorating the EV surface with cytokine binding domains derived from tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL6ST), which can act as decoys for the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL6, respectively. Combining synthetic biology and systematic screening of loading moieties, resulted in a three-component system which increased the display and decoy activity of TNFR1 and IL6ST, respectively. Further, this system allowed for combinatorial functionalization of two different receptors on the same EV surface. These cytokine decoy EVs significantly ameliorated disease phenotypes in three different inflammatory mouse models for systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and intestinal inflammation.

Generalization of current data shows that all sporadic amyloidoses can be regarded as a secondary event occurring against the background of diseases provoking a cellular stress response. Various factors causing the stress response provoke protein overproduction, a local increase in the concentration or modifications, which contributes to amyloidogenesis.

The virus infects human cells by binding of the virus spike to the cell receptor ACE2. Some studies suggest that dogs, cats and other animal species could be infected by SARS-CoV-2, while very limited data are available on lagomorphs. There are several occasions where rabbits and other lagomorphs are in close contact with humans. To investigate the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spikes and ACE2 of lagomorphs, predictive computer-based models were used in this study. The structure of ACE2 of lagomorphs was obtained on the basis of the amino acid sequences computationally. The interaction with the model of SARS-CoV-2 spikes was studied and described in depth on the basis of the complex human ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 published before. The interaction among SARS-CoV-2 spikes and ACE2 of other companion or laboratory animals is also described for comparative purposes. The results predict that ACE2 of lagomorphs are likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 spikes and suggest that further studies would be justified to confirm these results and to evaluate the risks to humans being in close contact with lagomorphs, such as veterinarians, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, butchers or pet owners. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic COVID-19. The virus infects human cells by binding of the virus spike to the cell receptor ACE2. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spikes in complex with human ACE2 has recently been solved, and the main amino acid residues involved in the virusCreceptor complex have been detected. To investigate the affinity of ACE2 of lagomorphs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, ACE2 sequences from rabbits and American pikas were compared with human ACE2 and with ACE2 from mammals with different susceptibility to the virus. Models of the complex formed by SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 from lagomorphs and from other mammals were created for comparative studies. ACE2 of lagomorphs showed fewer substitutions than human ACE2 in residues involved in the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike complex, similar to cats. Analysis of the binding interface of the simulated complexes ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike showed high affinity of the ACE2 of lagomorphs to the viral spike protein. These findings suggest that the spike of SARS-CoV-2 could bind the ACE2 receptor of lagomorphs, and future studies should investigate the role of lagomorphs in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. Furthermore, the risks to humans coming into close contacts with these animals should be evaluated.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Exhibits High Predicted Binding Affinity to ACE2 from Lagomorphs (Rabbits and Pikas)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) common syndrome characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thus providing evidence for clinical differentiation.

TCM common syndrome characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed by the method of latent structure and system clustering combined with frequency and constituent ratio, which were conducted by Lantern 5.0 and SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: Forty-two literatures about treatment plans, and 212 syndromes records were enrolled. Latent structure model was established based on 53 symptoms with frequency over 10, and 14 latent variables and 7 syndromes were concluded by comprehensive clustering, including syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency, syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung and syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen. Factor analysis was conducted for 53 symptoms, which were reported more than 10 times, and 14 common factors were obtained. Symptoms with load coefficient over 0.3 were clustered and 6 syndromes were obtained, including syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung, and syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung. The literatures included 25 syndromes, and the syndromes with constituent ratio over 5% were internal block and outward desertion (14.62%), syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung (13.68%), syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung (12.74%), syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung (10.85%), spleen and syndrome of cold dampness closing lung (8.50%), syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency (8.50%), syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung (8.02%) and syndrome of dampness repressing defensive Qi of lung (5.66%). Eighty-seven symptoms whose cumulative frequency was 2 838 were referred, including greasy fur (5.25%), fever (4.83%), red tongue (4.37%), rapid pulse (3.74%) and fatigue (3.46%). According to the results above, the common syndromes and their symptoms of COVID-19 were: (1) syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung: fever, cough, throat-drying, headache, all of the body distressed and constipation, etc.; (2) syndrome of cold dampness closing lung: aversion to cold, all of the body distressed, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention and loose stool, etc.; (3) syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung: cough, sticky phlegm, anorexia, thirst without desire to drink and constipation, etc.; (4) syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung: fever, cough, yellow phlegm, wheezing, suffocation and purple lips, etc.; (5) internal block and outward desertion: coma, feel fidgety, suffocation, sweating and feel cold and purple lips, etc.; (6) syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency: dry cough, sweating, fatigue, thirsty, feverish feeling in palms and soles and loose stool, etc.; (7) syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen: cough, wheezing, sweating, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and loose stool, et al.

Digital transformation is occurring in hospital practice and it is essential to implement effective, evidence-based strategies for these medications in an electronic medical record (EMR). OBJECTIVE: To systematically appraise the literature to determine which EMR interventions have improved the safety and quality of therapeutic anticoagulation in an inpatient hospital setting. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the International Pharmaceutical Database were searched for suitable publications. Articles that met eligibility criteria up to September 2018 were included. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018104899). The web-based software platform Covidence? was used for screening and data extraction. Studies were grouped according to the type of intervention and the outcomes measured. Where relevant, a bias assessment was performed. RESULTS: We found 2624 candidate articles and 27 met inclusion criteria. They included 3 randomised controlled trials, 4 cohort studies and 20 pre/post observational studies. There were four major interventions; computerised physician order entry (CPOE) (n = 4 studies), clinical decision support system (CDSS) methods (n = 21), dashboard utilisation (n = 1) and EMR implementation in general (n = 1). Seven outcomes were used to summarise the study results. Most research focused on prescribing or documentation compliance (n = 18). The remaining study outcome measures were: medication errors (n = 9), adverse drug events (n = 5), patient outcomes (morbidity/mortality/length of hospital stay/re-hospitalisation) (n = 5), quality use of anticoagulant (n = 4), end-user acceptance (n = 4), cost effectiveness (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Despite the research cited, limited benefits have been demonstrated to date. It appears healthcare organisations are yet to determine optimal, evidence-based-methods to improve EMR utilisation. Further evaluation, collaboration and work are necessary to measure and leverage the potential benefits of digital health systems. Most research evaluating therapeutic anticoagulation management within an EMR focused on prescribing or documentation compliance, with less focus on clinical impact to the patient or cost effectiveness. Evidence suggests that CPOE in conjunction with CDSS is needed to effectively manage therapeutic anticoagulation.

The small size of FAST proteins is incompatible with the paradigmatic membrane fusion pathway proposed for enveloped viral fusion proteins. Understanding how these diminutive viral fusogens mediate the complex process of membrane fusion is therefore of considerable interest, from both the pathogenesis and mechanism-of-action perspectives. Using chimeric ARV/NBV p10 constructs, the 36C40-residue ectodomain was identified as the major determinant of the differing fusion efficiencies of these homologous p10 proteins. Extensive mutagenic analysis determined the ectodomain comprises two distinct, essential functional motifs. Syncytiogenesis assays, thiol-specific surface biotinylation, and liposome lipid mixing assays identified an 25-residue, N-terminal motif that dictates formation of a cystine loop fusion peptide in both ARV and NBV p10. Surface immunofluorescence staining, FRET analysis and cholesterol depletion/repletion studies determined the cystine loop motif is connected through a two-residue linker to a 13-residue membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER). The MPER constitutes a second, independent motif governing reversible, cholesterol-dependent assembly of p10 multimers in the plasma membrane. Results further indicate that: (1) ARV and NBV homomultimers segregate to distinct, cholesterol-dependent microdomains in the plasma membrane; (2) p10 homomultimerization and cholesterol-dependent microdomain localization are co-dependent; and (3) the four juxtamembrane MPER residues present in the multimerization motif dictate species-specific microdomain association and homomultimerization. The p10 ectodomain therefore constitutes a remarkably compact, multifunctional fusion module that directs syncytiogenic efficiency and species-specific assembly of p10 homomultimers into cholesterol-dependent fusion platforms in the plasma membrane.","output":"A Compact, Multifunctional Fusion Module Directs Cholesterol-Dependent Homomultimerization and Syncytiogenic Efficiency of Reovirus p10 FAST Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-world data are crucial to continuously improve the management of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).

Most patients received a tidal volume < 8 mL/kg PBW; only on the first day was the tidal volume higher in obese patients. PEEP and driving pressure were higher, and compliance of the respiratory system was lower in obese patients on all four days. Adjunctive therapies for refractory hypoxemia were used equally in the three BMI groups. Adjusted mortality rates were not different between BMI categories. The findings of this study suggest that lung-protective ventilation with a lower tidal volume and prone positioning is similarly feasible in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients with ARDS related to COVID-19.

Chronic inflammation associated with lung-cancer infections is known to precede tumor development, and it has a strong effect on the response(s) to therapy. In fact, both viral and bacterial infections can activate inflammatory cells and inflammatory signaling pathways. In this review, an overview of critical findings of recent studies investigating associations between each of viral and bacterial pathogens and lung carcinoma is provided, with particular emphasis on how infectious organisms can interfere with oncogenic processes and all the way through immunity.

As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is a significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.","output":"An aberration detection-based approach for sentinel syndromic surveillance of COVID-19 and other novel influenza-like illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The study examined the role of diabetes nurse practitioners (DiNPs) and their contribution to the quality of care of individuals with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we examined the benefits and barriers of using telemedicine for managing diabetes. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative research using content analysis of interviews. METHODS: Participants were invited through the National DiNPs' Forum. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 licensed DiNPs (age range, 37-58 years) who were involved in the clinical care of individuals with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and content analysis was then used for extracting themes and their related categories. FINDINGS: Content analysis revealed five themes: (a) Benefits and barriers of remote diabetes treatment; (b) Teamwork and its implications to DiNPs; (c) Technological challenges, resourcefulness, and creativity; (d) Changed perception of DiNP roles; and (e) Cultural diversity and improving communication skills. The benefits of telemedicine included improved control, efficiency, convenience and satisfaction, while the disadvantages of this method included the inability to provide optimal practical guidance on technical aspects of physical assessments and care. Sectors with limited digital literacy and language barriers had difficulties using telemedicine. Teamwork was reported as a facilitator to managing treatment. Telemedicine provided an opportunity for DiNPs to become more efficient and focused and to clearly define their role in the organization. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed new challenges. Along with the need to adapt the therapeutic approach to remote care, DiNPs improved their professional status, acquired new skills, and were satisfied with their personal and professional growth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Telemedicine should become an integral part of diabetes management to enable access to populations who cannot come to the clinic.

Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language.

Delirium affected >50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms.

Thus, this study will explore the factors affecting the uptake of healthy behaviour changes and the use of digital technology among women and their healthcare providers (HCPs) to support healthy behaviour changes in women with GDM. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be modelled according to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour and Behaviour Change Wheel techniques, and use the DoTTI framework to identify needs, solutions and testing of a preliminary mobile app, respectively. In phase 1 (design and development), a focus group discussion (FGDs) of 5C8 individuals will be conducted with an estimated 60 women with GDM and 40 HCPs (doctors, dietitians and nurses). Synthesised data from the FGDs will then be combined with content from an expert committee to inform the development of the mobile app. In phase 2 (testing of early iterations), a preview of the mobile app will undergo alpha testing among the team members and the app developers, and beta testing among 30 women with GDM or with a history of GDM, and 15 HCPs using semi-structured interviews. The outcome will enable us to optimise an intervention using the mobile app as a diabetes prevention intervention which will then be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.

Cross-sectional data from chronic tinnitus inpatients were analyzed. Data collection included hair sampling, pure tone audiometry, tinnitus pitch and loudness matching, and psychometric questionnaires. Elastic net regressions with n-fold cross-validation were performed for cortisol (N = 91) and BDNF (N = 87). For hair-cortisol (R(2) = 0.10), the strongest effects were sampling in autumn and body-mass index (BMI) (positive), followed by tinnitus loudness (positive) and smoking (negative). For hair-BDNF (R(2) = 0.28), the strongest effects were hearing aid use, shift work (positive), and tinnitus loudness (negative), followed by smoking, tinnitus-related distress (Tinnitus Questionnaire), number of experienced traumatic events (negative), and physical health-related quality of life (Short Form-12 Health Survey) (positive). These findings suggest that in chronic tinnitus patients, higher perceived tinnitus loudness is associated with higher hair-cortisol and lower hair-BDNF, and higher tinnitus-related distress with lower hair-BDNF. Regarding hair-BDNF, traumatic experiences appear to have additional stress-related effects, whereas hearing aid use and high physical health-related quality of life appear beneficial.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of burnout among Portuguese radiographers. Methods This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study. Burnout levels were estimated using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, composed of 22 questions. Specific questions were developed to characterize the socio-demographic situation and the impact of the pandemic on the radiographers. Data were descriptively analyzed and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for correlation analysis. Results The study sample comprised 386 radiographers, 68.7% of whom where female and 31.3% male. The mean sample age was 36.3(9.1) years. A total of 43.5% and 45.5% of subjects had a high level of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, respectively, and 59.8% experienced low personal accomplishment.

While vaccination is a powerful tool to control pandemic spread, medication to relieve COVID-19-associated symptoms and alleviate disease progression especially in high-risk patients is still lacking. In this study, we explore the suitability of the rapid accelerated fibrosarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway as a druggable target in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find that SARS-CoV-2 transiently activates Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in the very early infection phase and that ERK1/2 knockdown limits virus replication in cell culture models. We demonstrate that ATR-002, a specific inhibitor of the upstream MEK1/2 kinases which is currently evaluated in clinical trials as an anti-influenza drug, displays strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in cell lines as well as in primary airCliquid-interphase epithelial cell (ALI) cultures, with a safe and selective treatment window. We also observe that ATR-002 treatment impairs the SARS-CoV-2-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thus might prevent COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation, a key player in COVID-19 progression.

Upon viral RNA recognition, RIG-I recruits the mitochondrial adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, which leads to a signaling cascade that coordinates the induction of type I interferons (IFNs), as well as a large variety of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. The RIG-I activation is tightly regulated via various posttranslational modifications for the prevention of aberrant innate immune signaling. By contrast, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, such as sequestrating viral structures from RIG-I detections and targeting receptor or signaling molecules for degradation. These virusChost interactions have broadened our understanding of viral pathogenesis and provided insights into the function of the RIG-I pathway.

Median scores at admission and before the start of the ventilation (pre-ventilation) are resulted, in Group B, 10 [IR 8-10] and 11 [IR 10-14](p<0.0001) and, in Group C, 10 [IR 8-11] and 12 [IR 11-13](p<0.0001). In Group A the CXR scores at admission were lower than in Group C (p=0.0257), and the highest scores were lower than the pre-ventilation ones of Groups B (p=0.0018) and C (p=0.0001). The CXR scores correlated negatively with Pa02/Fi02 and positively with SAPS. Conclusion: CXR scoring system could be an added value in the evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia severity. With lowpressure ventilation, the CXR scores were lower than with positive-pressure and invasive ventilation. Furthermore, CXR scores showed negative correlation with Pa02/Fi02 and positive with SAPS. Implications for practice: This new CXR scoring system could be a useful diagnostic tool to quantify the COVID-19 pneumonia severity and to guide to choice of the correct ventilation support. ? 2021 by Eurasian Journal of Medicine and Oncology.","output":"Chest x-ray scoring system in covid-19 pneumonia: An added value in the evaluation of the disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of middle school students learning attitudes and risk perception toward COVID-19 on their poor academic performance since the COVID-19 pandemic began This study limited the sample to middle school students who responded that their academic performance was an A or B grade during the last academic year in 2019 For this study, 268 respondents were selected and logistic regression was employed Self-motivated studying time and positive attitudes toward online learning predicted consistent academic performance since the COVID-19 pandemic began Middle school students preference toward an in-person classroom format was related to poor academic performance since the COVID-19 pandemic began A risk perception toward COVID-19 was related to poor academic performance since the COVID-19 pandemic began It is imperative to provide educational programs which help students develop self-motivated studying habits to maintain their academic performance during COVID-19 Policymakers in schools should consider providing in-person options for students who are more academically successful in such an environment","output":"Effects of Learning Attitudes and COVID-19 Risk Perception on Poor Academic Performance among Middle School Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) captured worldwide attention as the virus spread from initial detection as a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China in December 2019 to the declaration of a pandemic by the WHO only 3 months later This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac surgery services in the greater Los Angeles area Discussion includes public health response to the pandemic, how local hospitals reacted to the expected surge in patients with COVID, the establishment of telemedicine services, and the projected future impact on California healthcare as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Los Angeles's perspective of COVID-19 effect and impact on cardiac surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to spread around the world.

Ground ambulances are often affiliated with those facilities because rapid relocation of patients is most desirable. To date, no pooled data on the accessibility, technical specifications and operational procedures for such transport capacities are available. During 2009, the European Network for HIDs conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitals responsible for HID patients in Europe including an assessment of (a) legal aspects; (b) technical and infrastructure aspects; and (c) operational procedures for ground ambulances used for HID transport. Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated and feedback rates ranged from 78% to 100% (n = 37 to n = 48 centres). Only 46.8% (22/47) of all centres have both national and local guidelines regulating HID patient transport.

Here, we used an 18S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing approach to explore the structure, interspecies interaction, and assembly processes of the microeukaryotic community in lake ecosystems of the Inner Mongolia Plateau. As a direct result of climate change, salinity has become the key determinant of the lacustrine microeukaryotic community in this region. The microeukaryotic community in this ecosystem can be divided into three groups: salt (Lake Daihai), brackish (Lake Dalinuoer) and freshwater lakes. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that salinity shapes the interspecies interactions of the microeukaryotic community. This causes interspecies interactions to change from antagonistic to cooperative with an increase in salinity. Phylogenetic-based ?-nearest taxon distance analyses revealed that stochastic processes mainly dominated the microeukaryotic community assembly in lake ecosystems of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, and salinity stress drove the assembly processes of the microeukaryotic community from stochastic to deterministic.

Other factors such as stress, poor husbandry and nutrition can also contribute to an animal's susceptibility to disease. Molecular biomarkers of production disease could be of immense value by improving diagnosis and risk analysis to determine best practice with an impact on increased economic output and animal welfare. In addition to the use of multiplex PCR or microarrays to detect individual or mixed pathogens during infection, these technologies can also be used to monitor the host response to infection via gene expression. The patterns of gene expression associated with cellular damage or initiation of the early immune response may indicate the type of pathology and, by extension the types of pathogen involved. Molecular methods can therefore be used to monitor both the presence of a pathogen and the host response to it during production disease.

Implementing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) programs is critical to decrease infectious agents' transmission in healthcare settings. The aim of this study is to assess if the monitoring of Contact Precautions could decrease the incidence of Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MRDOs) infections. This pilot study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Rome. A checklist of 16 items was developed to assess the compliance to Contact Precautions in 11 hospital wards in which MRDOs were detected between November and December 2020. It was administered on-site both interviewing healthcare professionals and through direct observation. A paired t-test with  = 5% was used to compare the number of alert organisms in the first quarter of 2020 respect to the first quarter of 2021 before and after implementing the surveillance checklist. A total of 30 checklists were analyzed. The rate of compliance to Contact Precautions was high for the proper use of personal protective equipment (100%), the intensified room cleaning (100%) and the presence of isolation mark (100%), while it was low for the active screening of contacts (53%). Mean MDROs infections rate decreased from 4.94 to 4.37 for every 1000 hospitalization day, with an average decrease of 0.57. However, the paired t-test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean number of MDROs infections before and after the implementation of the checklist (p > 0.05). Despite the good adherence to IPC program, the low infection rate decrease, is probably due to the impact of COVID-19 on the HAIs surveillance and prevention practices. Even if the check-list administration could be a useful tool to reduce MDROs infections, it should be associated to other prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to achieve a successful outcome. KEY MESSAGES: Preventing Healthcare-Associated Infections represents a priority public health challenge in order to improve patient safety and health system economic sustainability.

The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical outcomes of performing DSNB in patients who have already undergone surgery for the primary penile cancer. METHODS Ninety-two patients with unilateral or bilateral impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) who had already undergone primary resection of the penile tumour (stage  T1G2) were included in this study. All patients underwent a preoperative USS of the groin(s) with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Provided that the FNAC was clear, DSNB was performed. Radical inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed if the histological analysis of the SLN confirmed the presence of micrometastatic disease. RESULTS DSNB was undertaken in 165 groins with a nonvisualisation rate of 4.8 % (8/165 groins). The SLN was positive for micrometastatic disease in nine groins (5.5 %) from a total of eight patients (8.7 %). One patient developed regional recurrence in a prepubic LN after excision of bilateral negative SLN (1.1 %). The three-year disease-specific survival for patients with negative and positive SLN was 98.8 and 87.5 %, respectively (p = 0.042). Using DSNB, occult LN metastases in penile cancer can be detected with a sensitivity of 88.9 % and specificity of 100 %.

The continuous time Markov Chain (CTMC) through stochastic model approach has been utilized for predicting the impending states with the use of random variables. The proposed study is devoted to investigate a model consist of three exclusive compartments. The first class includes white nose based transmission rate (termed as susceptible individuals), the second one pertains to the infected population having the same perturbation occurrence and the last one isolated (quarantined) individuals. We discuss the models extinction as well as the stationary distribution in order to derive the the sufficient criterion for the persistence and disease extinction. Lastly, the numerical simulation is executed for supporting the theoretical findings.","output":"STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION AND EXTINCTION OF STOCHASTIC CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) EPIDEMIC MODEL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analysis, prevention, and removal of microplastics (MPs) pollution in water is identified as one major problem the world is currently facing. MPs can be directly released to water or formed by the degradation of bigger plastics. Nowadays, it is estimated that annually between 4 and 12 million tonnes of plastic go into the seas and oceans-with a forecast for them to outweigh the amount of fish in 2050. Based on the existing studies, the characterization of MPs in waters is still one of the remaining challenges because they can be easily confused with organic or other types of matter. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to establish pathways for the chemical identification of the MP nature. In this perspective, the recent techniques and instrumentation for MP characterization (Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies and microscopies, pyrolysis and thermal desorption gas chromatography, imaging techniques, etc.) are discussed including considerations to the multidimensionality of the problem. This perspective also summarizes and provides updated data on the sources and occurrence, transport and fate of MPs in aquatic ecosystems, as well as influencing conditions and factors affecting dispersal.

In chronic cases, it induces malnutrition that severely stunts growth. Bile acid diarrhea (BAD), caused by malabsorption of bile acid (BA), is a rare form of chronic diarrhea seldom observed in pediatric patients. Here, we present a clinical report on a novel case of chronic BAD, with severe stunting in an infant, induced by a homozygous mutation of SLC10A2. METHODS: We performed DNA extraction, whole\\\\exome sequencing analysis, and mutation analysis of SLC10A2 to obtain genetic data on the patient. We subsequently analyzed the patient's clinical and genetic data. RESULTS: The patient's clinical manifestations were chronic diarrhea with increased BAs in the feces and extreme stunting, which was diagnosed as BAD. A homozygous mutation of SLC10A2 at the c.313T>C (rs201206937) site was detected. CONCLUSION: Our report reveals the youngest case illustrating the characteristics of BAD induced by genetic variant at 313T>C, and the second case entailing a clear association between a SLC10A2 genetic mutation and the onset of BAD. Our findings expand the mutant spectrum of the SLC10A2 gene and contribute to the refinement of the genotypeCphenotype mapping of severe stunting induced by pediatric BAD.

Methods A retrospective cohort of 115 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province between Jan 18, 2020, and Feb 28, 2020 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory indicators and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Known adverse prognostic factors were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effects on outcomes. Results Among 115 patients, 73 patients (63.5%) received corticosteroid. The levels of age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and albumin were similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%) and statistically significant differences were observed (p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of either mortality or ICU admission, although not statistically significant.

As disease protection during the first six months of life is provided via placental transfer of maternal antibodies, a maternal GBS vaccine may provide an effective strategy to reduce infectious death and disability. An efficacy study may be difficult because of the large sample size required and alternative approaches such as serocorrelates of protection based on natural antibody concentration are being considered. Such studies would need to be undertaken in high burden settings such as Uganda. We therefore aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a GBS sero-epidemiology study in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: This is a prospective cohort and nested case-control study, conducted across two-centres with two entry points. A) consecutive women and their infants at birth, with collection of maternal swab, cord and maternal blood, and follow up by telephone until the infant is 3 months old; B) any infant under 3 months of age, presenting with signs of sepsis to any of the paediatric units, with collection of blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs. Any infants identified as having GBS disease (defined as GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) will be recruited and followed up for two years to assess their neurodevelopment. A nested qualitative study will investigate stakeholder (pregnant women and their families, healthcare workers and community leaders) opinions of sampling for such a study and understanding and potential uptake of vaccines in pregnancy. Discussion: The primary aim is to determine anti-GBS antibody concentration in infants with GBS disease compared to healthy controls.

The overlapped genes were also COVID-19 immune-related genes in LUAD. TCMSP platform was used to identify active ingredients of the prescription, potential targets were identified by the UniProt database, and the cross genes with COVID-19 immune-related genes in LUAD were used to construct a Chinese Medicine-Logy-immune target network. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on the target genes of each prescription. Finally, the key active components were selected for molecular docking simulation with ACE2. RESULTS: We obtained 15 overlapping immunization target genes from FPQXZ, HSYFZ, HSZFZ, and QFPDT, 16 overlapping immunization target genes from QYLFZ, SDYFZ, SRYFZ, and YDBFZ, and 17 overlapping immunization target genes from QYLXZ.

Antivenom administration is the cornerstone of therapy, meticulous patient selection is needed because of the possible side effects of the antivenom including anaphylaxis. Peripheral perfusion index (PPI) is a simple, non-invasive test that is widely used for the detection of peripheral hypoperfusion. We aimed to investigate the value of using PPI to predict the need for antivenom administration for scorpion envenomation. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. We consecutively enrolled patients with scorpion envenomation on the extremities who are over 18 years old without pregnancy and a peripheral arterial disease between March 1, 2021, to October 31, 2021. Demographics included age, sex, sting zone, the time between sting and the ED admission, and vital parameters, we blindly measured PPI both on affected and contralateral extremities before any therapeutic intervention. We compared PPI levels, vital parameters, and the outcome including discharge from the ED, admission to ward or ICU, and death between patients who received antivenom and those who did not. RESULTS: Twenty-nine male (58.0%) and 21 (42.0%) female patients with scorpion envenomation were enrolled in the study. The median age was 46.5 [IQR 33.3]. Thirty-eight (76.0%) patients had Class I, 12 (24.0%) patients had Class II and III envenomation. The median duration of the ED admission after the sting was 90 [IQR 120] minutes. Antivenom was administered in 13 (26.0%) patients. PPI was significantly lower both on the affected and the contralateral extremities (p = 0.043 and p = 0.045, respectively) in patients who required antivenom. With a cut-off value of 2.4, PPI can predict the need for antivenom with a sensitivity of 61.54%, a specificity of 86.5%, a positive likelihood ratio of 4.55, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.44, a positive predictive value of 61.54%, a negative predictive value of 86.49%, and an accuracy of 80% (AUC 0.691, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PPI can better reflect the ongoing systemic inflammation and the need for antivenom compared to other vital parameters. Therefore, we suggest this noninvasive and objective test may have a significant role in detecting patients who need antivenom in the early phase of scorpion envenomation. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of PPI in scorpion envenomation.","output":"Low peripheral perfusion index values may indicate the need for antivenom in the early phase of scorpion envenomation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, since its beginning in December 2019, has altered every aspect of human life.

In this paper, we wish to identify the magnitude of its impact on college students in Vietnam. As far as were concerned, college students belong to the most affected groups in the population, especially in big cities that have been hitting hard by the virus. We conducted an online survey from 31 May 2021 to 9 June 2021, asking students from four representative regions in Vietnam to describe how the pandemic has changed their lifestyle and studying environment, as well as their awareness, compliance, and psychological state. The collected answers were processed to eliminate unreliable ones then prepared for sentiment analysis. To analyze the relationship among the variables, we performed a variety of statistical tests, including ShapiroCWilk, Mc Nemar, MannCWhitneyCWilcoxon, KruskalCWallis, and Pearsons Chi-square tests. Among 1875 students who participated, many did not embrace online education. A total of 64.53% of them refused to think that online education would be the upcoming trend. During the pandemic, nearly one quarter of students were in a negative mood. About the same number showed signs of depression. We also observed that there were increasing patterns in sleeping time, body weight, and sedentary lifestyle. However, they maintained a positive attitude toward health protection and compliance with government regulations (65.81%).

RESULTS: The pandemic did not alter most participants' decisions to undergo prenatal genetic testing. Yet, it did impact how participants viewed the risks and benefits of testing and timing of testing. There was heightened anxiety among those who underwent testing, stemming from the risk of viral exposure and the fear of being alone if pregnancy loss or fetal abnormality was identified at the time of an ultrasound-based procedure.

Previous research in Ghana shows that MSM face intersectional stigma across ecological levels (family, peers, healthcare settings, and community level) and the criminalization of same-gender sexual behaviors in the country. To protect their wellbeing from exposure to stigma, many MSM avoid interactions with healthcare systems and services, which inadvertently inhibits their opportunities for early detection and treatment of HIV. Consequently, MSM in Ghana carry a disproportionate burden of HIV prevalence (18%) compared to the general population (2%), highlighting the need for culturally relevant processes in HIV/STI prevention, and care communication to optimize sexual health and wellness among MSM in Ghana. To this effect, we collaborated with community partners to use the Assessment, Decision, Adaptation, Production, Topical Experts, Training, Testing (ADAPT-ITT) model to modify a theory-driven smartphone-based peer support intervention to enhance its focus on intersectional stigma reduction, and improve HIV health-seeking behaviors among MSM, including HIV testing and linkage to care.

New York University Medical Center and affiliations, including New York City Health and Hospitals/Bellevue, developed a plan to offset the increased needs for KRT. We established acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) capability, as usual dialysis modalities were overwhelmed by COVID-19 AKI. Methods Observational study of patients requiring KRT admitted to Bellevue Hospital during the COVID surge. Bellevue Hospital is one of the largest public hospitals in the United States, providing medical care to an underserved population. There were substantial staff, supplies, and equipment shortages. Adult patients admitted with AKI who required KRT were considered for PD. We rapidly established an acute PD program. A surgery team placed catheters at the bedside in the intensive care unit; a nephrology team delivered treatment. We provided an alternative to hemodialysis and continuous venovenous hemofiltration for treating patients in the intensive-care unit, demonstrating efficacy with outcomes comparable to standard care. Results From April 8, 2020 to May 8, 2020, 39 catheters were placed into ten women and 29 men. By June 10, 39% of the patients started on PD recovered kidney function (average ages 56 years for men and 59.5 years for women); men and women who expired were an average 71.8 and 66.2 years old. No episodes of peritonitis were observed; there were nine incidents of minor leaking. Some patients were treated while ventilated in the prone position. Conclusions Demand compelled us to utilize acute PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experience is one of the largest recently reported in the United States of which we are aware. Acute PD provided lifesaving care to acutely ill patients when expanding current resources was impossible.

However, the molecular causes behind FF remain largely unknown. Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to identify and quantify proteins across samples; however, no study so far has used it to dissect the proteomic signature of sperm with FF after ICSI. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether sperm samples from patients suffering repetitive FF after ICSI display alterations in their protein content. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventeen infertile men were included: 5 patients presented FF in 3 consecutive ICSI cycles, while 12 patients had a fertilization rate >75% (controls). Individual sperm samples were subjected to 2D-LC-MS/MS. Both conventional and novel statistical approaches were used to identify differentially abundant proteins. Additionally, analysis of mitochondrial and proteasomal abundance and activity were performed, using western blot, FACS analysis of JC-1 staining and AMC-peptide fluorometric assay. RESULTS Four proteins presented lower abundance (FMR1NB, FAM209B, RAB2B, PSMA1) in the FF group compared to controls, while five mitochondrial proteins presented higher abundance in FF (DLAT, ATP5H, SLC25A3, SLC25A6, FH) (p<0.05). The altered abundance of mitochondrial DLAT and proteasomal PSMA1 was corroborated by Western-Blot. Of relevance, novel stable-protein pair analysis identified 73 correlations comprising 28 proteins within controls, while different mitochondrial proteins (i.e. PDHA2, PHB2, ATP5F1D) lost >50% of these correlations in specific FF samples pointing out specific mitochondrial deregulations.

We aim ascertaining whether respiratory system static compliance (Crs), driving pressure (DP), and tidal volume normalized for ideal body weight (VT/kg IBW) at the 1st day of controlled mechanical ventilation are associated with intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: Observational multicenter cohort study. All consecutive COVID-19 adult patients admitted to 25 ICUs belonging to the COVID-19 VENETO ICU network (February 28thCApril 28th, 2020), who received controlled mechanical ventilation, were screened. Only patients fulfilling ARDS criteria and with complete records of Crs, DP and VT/kg IBW within the 1st day of controlled mechanical ventilation were included. Crs, DP and VT/kg IBW were collected in sedated, paralyzed and supine patients. RESULTS: A total of 704 COVID-19 patients were screened and 241 enrolled. Seventy-one patients (29%) died in ICU. The logistic regression analysis showed that: (1) Crs was not linearly associated with ICU mortality (p value for nonlinearity = 0.01), with a greater risk of death for values < 48 ml/cmH(2)O; (2) the association between DP and ICU mortality was linear (p value for nonlinearity = 0.68), and increasing DP from 10 to 14 cmH(2)O caused significant higher odds of in-ICU death (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.06C1.99); (3) VT/kg IBW was not associated with a significant increase of the risk of death (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55C1.52). Multivariable analysis confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Crs < 48 ml/cmH(2)O was associated with ICU mortality, while DP was linearly associated with mortality. DP should be kept as low as possible, even in the case of relatively preserved Crs, irrespective of VT/kg IBW, to reduce the risk of death.

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims Brachial plexus (BP) blocks continue to be described with reference to anatomical landmarks (Interscalene and Supraclavicular), even after the introduction of ultrasound which enables us to directly identify the roots, trunks and divisions of the BP.

Methods Twenty-one male patients in the age group 20-40 years, undergoing elective forearm bony procedures received an ultrasound-guided truncal injection BP block. MELAV50 was determined using the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method. Initial volume of local anaesthetic (LA; 50:50 mixture of bupivacaine 0.5% and lignocaine 2% with 5 g/ml epinephrine) injected was 6 ml in each trunk, which was varied by 1 ml/trunk for each consecutive patient according to the response of the previous patient.

The program automatically calculates and graphically displays property distance (PD) scores based on physico-chemical property (PCP) similarities from an unaligned list of FASTA files. Such PD-graphs show the interrelatedness of the sequences, whereby clusters can reveal deeper connectivities.

PD-graphs separate the tick- from the mosquito-borne FV, clusters viruses that infect bats, camels, seabirds and humans separately and the clusters correlate with disease phenotype. The PD method segregates the -CoV spike proteins of SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS sequences from other human pathogenic CoV, with clustering consistent with cellular receptor usage.

Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Suspected cases were identified clinically and/or epidemiologically. Samples from suspected cases and their contacts were tested in the National Influenza Centre following World Health Organization protocols. Two real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect and confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Seven cases of COVID-19, including two deaths, were confirmed in Sudan between 27 February and 30 March 2020. Suspected cases were identified and tested. As of 30 March, no local transmission was yet reported in the country. Fifty-nine percent of the suspected cases were international travellers coming from areas with current COVID-19 epidemics. Cough and fever were the major symptoms, presented by 65% and 60% of the suspected cases, respectively. By early April, an additional seven cases were confirmed through limited contact tracing that identified the first locally acquired infections in recent contact with imported cases. CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality rate of COVID-19 cases in Sudan might be due to limitations in test and trace and case management services.

Even when made available to patients, its long-term effectiveness for increasing screening rates is often limited. Introduction: We hypothesized that a stakeholder-based implementation program could increase teleophthalmology use and sustain improvements in diabetic eye screening. Materials and Methods: We used the NIATx Model to test a stakeholder-based teleophthalmology implementation program, I-SITE at one primary care clinic (Main) and compared teleophthalmology use and diabetic eye screening rates with those of other primary care clinics (Outreach) within a U.S. multipayer health system where teleophthalmology was underutilized. Results: Teleophthalmology use increased post-I-SITE implementation (odds ratio [OR] = 5.73 [p < 0.001]), and was greater at the Main than at the Outreach clinics (OR = 10.0 vs. 1.69, p < 0.001).

The estimated mean annual cost to treat a patient on b/tsDMARDs fell by 47%, from 13.1 thousand euros (EUR) in 2010 to 6.9 thousand EUR in 2019. The mean annual cost to treat b/tsDMARDs na?ve patients was reduced by 75% (13.0 thousand EUR in 2010 and 3.2 thousand EUR in 2019). CONCLUSIONS: In the period 2010C2019, b/tsDMARD treatment costs for Norwegian RA patients were significantly reduced, whereas DAS28 remission rates increased. Our data may indicate that the health authorities intention to reduce treatment costs by implementing a tender system has been successful.

The DASS-21 scale was used to assess levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation between these indicators and oral health-related quality of life, of which 43.9% were classified as having poor oral health. Logistic regression analysis showed that the MEFC who were of older age (OR = 0.965, p = 0.039), with hypertension (OR = 0.567, p = 0.004), with gastroenteropathy (OR = 0.263, p = 0.007), had received an outpatient service in the past year (OR = 0.669, p = 0.048), were depressed (OR = 0.338, p = 0.012), and anxious (OR = 0.414, p = 0.026) were less likely to report good oral health status.

Neurofilament light (NfL) in plasma is a validated biomarker for neuronal damage. We assessed the trajectory of NfL levels in intensive care unit (ICU) patients diagnosed with COVID\\\\19, and studied its relationship to clinical outcomes and markers of hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms. METHOD: As part of the Art\\\\Deco study and Amsterdam UMC COVID\\\\biobank, longitudinal samples and clinical data were collected weekly from a cohort of 31 prospectively admitted ICU patients with a minimum of 7 days of ventilation. The meansd age was 6311 years. Admission duration ranged from 14\\\\35 days and 156 samples were collected. We evaluated the NfL trajectory over time, and whether this trajectory differed by 90\\\\day mortality outcome. Due to the non\\\\linear trajectory of NfL, we applied linear mixed models including cubic splines for the time variable. Secondly, we tested whether baseline or peak NfL levels predicted mortality (n=7/31), delirium incidence after detubation (n=18/22), and duration of delirium (66 days). Third, we assessed if disease severity (day 7 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score) and baseline hypoxemia (pAO2 before intubation), inflammation (IL1\\\\b, IL\\\\6, IL\\\\8, TNF\\\\), and coagulopathy (d\\\\dimer, presence of pulmonary embolism) were predictive of the NfL trajectory. For the latter models, we included an interaction term for the pathophysiological markers in the linear mixed models. All models were adjusted for age. RESULT: NfL increased during ICU admission (p<001), and persisted longer in the non\\\\survivors (p<0.05;Figure 1). Baseline or maximum NfL was not predictive of mortality or delirium incidence. However, maximum NfL correlated to the duration of delirium (r=0.5;p=0.02). From the pathophysiological markers, SOFA scores (p<0.05) and baseline TNF\\\\ (p<0.05) were related to a stronger increase of NfL over time. CONCLUSION: NfL levels increased over time and plateaued after 2\\\\3 weeks in most COVID\\\\19 patients at the ICU. Peak levels of NfL were predictive of delirium persistence. Repeated NfL levels may provide a future method for monitoring neurological outcomes in sedated ICU patients. Disease severity and specific inflammatory components appear important predictors of the NfL trajectory reflecting axonal damage in severe COVID\\\\19 patients.","output":"Plasma NfL trajectory during ICU\\\\treatment of COVID\\\\19 patients: A prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among all major organs, the brain is one of the most susceptible to the inexorable effects of aging. Throughout the last decades, several studies in human cohorts and animal models have revealed a plethora of age-related changes in the brain, including reduced neurogenesis, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell senescence. As the main immune effectors and first responders of the nervous tissue, microglia are at the center of these events. These cells experience irrevocable changes as a result from cumulative exposure to environmental triggers, such as stress, infection and metabolic dysregulation. The age-related immunosenescent phenotype acquired by microglia is characterized by profound modifications in their transcriptomic profile, secretome, morphology and phagocytic activity, which compromise both their housekeeping and defensive functions. As a result, aged microglia are no longer capable of establishing effective immune responses and sustaining normal synaptic activity, directly contributing to age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This review discusses how lifestyle and environmental factors drive microglia dysfunction at the molecular and functional level, also highlighting possible interventions to reverse aging-associated damage to the nervous and immune systems.","output":"The old guard: age-related changes in microglia and their consequences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in over 88 million cases worldwide of COVID-19 as of January 2021.

Unlike clinical practice guidelines, a SCAMP is a flexible algorithm that undergoes iterative updates based on periodic data collection and review. We recently implemented a SCAMP for the closed treatment of pediatric torus fractures. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of SCAMP implementation on resource utilization, practice variability, cost of care, and outcomes. METHODS This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 273 patients with pediatric torus fractures. The pre-SCAMP cohort included 116 subjects from 2008 to 2010. The SCAMP cohort included 157 subjects from 2011 to 2013. The pre-SCAMP cohort was treated according to the judgment of attending fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. The SCAMP cohort was treated with a standardized algorithm including radiographs and splint application at initial presentation, with a single follow-up at 3 weeks. Patient demographics were analyzed to verify comparability between cohorts. Follow-up data including clinic visits, x-rays and practice variability was recorded. Costing analysis was conducted using time-derived activity-based costing methodology. Outcomes were compared using Poisson regression analysis. Incident rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence limits were estimated. RESULTS No differences in clinical results were observed between the pre-SCAMP and SCAMP cohorts, and all patients demonstrated return to baseline activity at final follow-up. Patient demographics were comparable across cohorts. The SCAMP cohort had a 48% reduction in clinic visits [IRR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.60; P<0.001], 60% reduction in x-rays (IRR, 0.40; CI, 0.33-0.47; P<0.001), and a 23% reduction in x-rays per clinic visit (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91; P<0.001). Furthermore, SCAMP implementation resulted in a 49% reduction in the overall cost of care. CONCLUSIONS SCAMPs provide a novel alternative to CPGs to implement cost effective changes in Orthopaedic practice.

METHODS: Thirty SpragueCDawley rats were randomly assigned to the blank control group (N), the pneumonia group (P), and the Yinlai decoction group (PT). The rat pneumonia model was established using LPS inhalation (0.5 mg/mL, 5 mL, 30 min/day, 3 days). Yinlai decoction was administered intragastrically (2 mL/100 g, 3 days). Lung tissue pathology, organ indexes, serum inflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and intestinal flora changes were measured. RESULTS: Lung tissue inflammation was prevented by Yinlai decoction. IL-6 levels showed a higher tendency to be higher, and IL-12 and TNF- were significantly higher in the PT group than in the P group. The structure of the intestinal flora in the P differed from that in the N. The relative abundance of 10 out of 12 microflora was significantly higher in the P group than in the N and PT groups. In the PT group, the structure and the distribution of microbial groups were like those of the N group. CONCLUSIONS: Yinlai decoction inhibited LPS-induced lung and systemic inflammation in rats and may help the intestinal flora restore equilibrium by inhibiting the colonization of pathogenic bacteria and adjusting the ratio between probiotics and pathogenic bacteria.

This prompted a literature review on prevalence of FADS and MPFD. METHODS: Fetal ultrasound examination, motor assessment, genetic testing, postmortem examination, and placenta histology are presented (2009C2019). Literature was reviewed for the association between congenital anomalies and MPFD. RESULTS: All six fetuses developed normally during the first trimester. Thereafter, growth restriction, persistent flexed position, abnormal motility, and contractures in 4/6, consistent with FADS occurred. All placentas showed histologically confirmed MPFD. Genetic analyses in the five available cases showed homozygosity for two variants of unknown significance in two genes, VARS1 (OMIM*192150) and ABCF1 (OMIM*603429).

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients under long-term home noninvasive ventilation (LTHNIV) for chronic respiratory failure (CRF) were negatively affected by the 56-day confinement (March-April 2020). METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey exploring mood disturbances (HAD), symptom scores related to NIV (S3-NIV), and perception of health-care providers during confinement was sent to all patients under LTHNIV followed up by our center. Symptom scores and data obtained by ventilator software were compared between confinement and the 56 days prior to confinement. RESULTS: Of a total of 100 eligible patients, 66 were included (median age: 66 years [IQR: 53-74]): 35 (53%) with restrictive lung disorders, 20 (30%) with OHS or SRBD, and 11 (17%) with COPD or overlap syndrome. Prevalence of anxiety (n = 7; 11%) and depressive (n = 2; 3%) disorders was remarkably low.

By 2020, COVID-19 cases had steadily declined in India, whereas the fight continued in the US. The people of India and the USA perhaps perceived threats very differently, influenced by their knowledge, available healthcare facilities, and social security. We conducted an online survey study to compare COVID-related perceptions between Indian participants (IND-P) and US-based participants (US-P). Methods: COVID-related perceptions such as stress, knowledge, and preventive behaviors were measured with specific questionnaires, and normalized scores were computed. T-tests were used to compare the perception scores, while the Kruskal-Wallis-H (KWH) tests were used to compare socioeconomic distributions between participants from two countries. Generalized linear model (GLM) adjusted for sociodemographic confounders estimated the association between the country of residence and COVID-perception. Results: The IND-P (N = 242) were younger and male-dominated compared with the US-P (N = 531) (age: KWH = 97.37, p < 0.0001, gender: KWH = 140.38, p < 0.0001). Positive attitudes toward preventive guidelines were associated with higher perceived risk and stress (r = 0.35, p < 0.001, and r = 0.21, p < 0.001, respectively) but not with the knowledge (r = ?0.05, p = 0.14).

METHODS: On 7 May 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown, an online questionnaire was distributed through social media and made available for 10 days. Data were collected from parents of children aged 4 to 17 years. The Bangla version of the parent-rated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to determine the behavioural and emotional disturbances of the children and adolescents. The Bangla version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the depression status of parents. RESULTS: There were 512 participants. 21.5% of children and adolescents had emotional and behavioural problems. More boys than girls had abnormal peer relationship problems (21.1% vs 15.4%, p = 0.03). Of the parents, 16.2% had moderate depression, 5.5% moderately severe depression, and 2.9% severe depression. 8.2% and 2.9% of parents reported that it was very difficult and extremely difficult, respectively, to do work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people; the proportion was higher in mothers than fathers (2 = 11.4, df = 3, p = 0.01). The PHQ-9 total score of parents mildly correlated with the SDQ score of children and adolescents (r = 0.51, p = 0.01).

The study was prematurely terminated after the enrollment of 50 participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 25 were assigned to bromhexine hydrochloride treatment (8 mg 3 times per day), and 25 were controls. The composite primary endpoint was a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 or signs of clinical infection within 28 days and at week 8. Secondary endpoints included time from the first contact with a person with COVID-19 to the appearance of respiratory infection symptoms; the number of days before a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test; the number of asymptomatic participants with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test; the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases; and adverse events. RESULTS: The rate of the combined primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the active treatment group (2/25 [8%]) and control group (7/25 [28%]); P=0.07. A fewer number of participants developed symptomatic COVID-19 in the treatment group compared to controls (0/25 vs. 5/25; P=0.02). CONCLUSION: Although the study was underpowered, it showed that Bromhexine hydrochloride prophylaxis was associated with a reduced rate of symptomatic COVID-19. The prophylactic treatment was not associated with a lower combined primary endpoint rate, a positive swab PCR test, or COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04405999).","output":"Bromhexine Hydrochloride Prophylaxis of COVID-19 for Medical Personnel: A Randomized Open-Label Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Ensuring the quality of clinical placements has long been a challenge in nursing education. This is partly due to a growing aging population requiring health services, and an increased need for nursing workforce. Both in Norway and internationally, there is a rise in the use of student-dense models, wherein several students are placed together on the same ward at the same time where the supervision of the students is the collective responsibility of the nurses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore factors that promote or inhibit learning in a student-dense ward when used as a model for clinical placement in hospitals. We examined how clinical placement is experienced in a student-dense ward, as well as how learning is facilitated. METHODS: A qualitative case study design was used to capture the learning environment on the student-dense ward in a comprehensive way. We used focus group interviews, in-depth interviews, and observations with students and employees at a major hospital in Norway. RESULTS: Our findings showed that the orientation days and the teaching activities in student-dense wards, the feedback students receive, the clinical facilitator's role and the student community were factors that had particular importance for good learning environments in this placement model. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the quality of clinical placements, more attention should be paid to these factors in the planning, organization, and facilitation of new and existing student-dense wards. It is paramount to provide students with thorough written feedback and to secure the clinical facilitators with enough time to conduct student supervision when organizing clinical placement as student-dense wards.","output":"The Learning Environment of Student Nurses During Clinical Placement: A Qualitative Case Study of a Student-Dense Ward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analysed issues concerning the establishment of compulsory vaccination against COVID-19, as well as the role of misinformation as a disincentive-especially when published by health professionals-and citizen acceptance of measures in this regard. Data from different surveys revealed a high degree of hesitation rather than outright opposition to vaccines. The most frequent complaint related to the COVID-19 vaccination was the fear of side effects. Within the Spanish and European legislative framework, both compulsory vaccination and government regulation of FN (Fake News) appear to be feasible options, counting on sufficient legal support, which could be reinforced by additional amendment. However, following current trends of good governance, policymakers must have public legitimation. Rather than compulsory COVID-19 vaccination, an approach based on education and truthful information, persuading the population of the benefits of a vaccine on a voluntary basis, is recommended. Disagreements between health professionals are positive, but they should be resolved following good practice and the procedures of the code of ethics. Furthermore, citizens do not support the involvement of government authorities in the direct control of news.

Accordingly, the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development could provide sustainable development processes for the employment of vulnerable workers. The contribution starts with the definition of the coordinates of a sustainable development process for vulnerable workers, anchoring it to the principles of decent work and inclusivity. Subsequently, positive variables involved in the sustainable development processes and their relationship with decent work and inclusivity are discussed. Moreover, positive healthy organizations are introduced as work environments capable to take care of the wellbeing, also, of vulnerable workers.

This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway. METHODS The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario. RESULTS The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery. CONCLUSION Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate.

Feelings of isolation and estrangement from faculty and peers are common, and the potential impact on learning and on the development of social skills needed for patient care is of concern to health educators. The goal of our research project was, therefore, to perform a review of the neuroscience and pedagogical literature to assess the current state of knowledge on the impact of isolation and distance on brain morphology, neurophysiology, and learning. METHODOLOGY Our group chose to divide literature search activities into two broad categories and to work in pairs focusing either on the neuroscience or the pedagogical literature. Our approach was loosely based on Arksey and O'Malley, and while not a formal scoping review, did use a methodology that was rapid, broad, and aimed at identifying the different types of existing evidence related to our research question. Using various scientific databases the group performed searches using keywords such as \\"immediacy,\\" \\"face to face,\\" \\"social isolation,\\" and \\"brain volume.\\" After screening by title 431 abstracts were reviewed by the team, and 76 articles were chosen for full-text review. Please click the following link to see our final reference list: Reference List. RESULTS From the Neuroscience Literature: Both social isolation and loneliness cause brain atrophy, primarily in the medial temporal region. Gene expression decreases and remains low in the hippocampus during periods of prolonged isolation, reflecting decreased ability to consolidate new long-term memories. Significantly more neural coupling takes place between partners during F2F than during back to back or computer mediated dialogue, and natural verbal communication, increased eye contact, and observation of non-verbal facial expressions enhance neural coupling. From the Pedagogical Literature: Interaction, collaboration, and sharing thoughts and feelings F2F all contribute to a sense of community. Students report F2F interactions feel more real, create a feeling of connectedness, and facilitate the formation of relationships. Increased social presence in the classroom can predict actual and perceived cognitive learning. Immediacy that is verbal (e.g. posing questions, discussing personal experience, and informal conversations) and non-verbal (e.g. hand movements, facial expressions, and eye contact) both increase with F2F interactions. Both actual and perceived cognitive learning increase with immediacy. CONCLUSIONS With multiple studies showing brain changes with isolation, a student appreciation for immediacy, and the potential impact on cognitive and affective learning of F2F instruction, the evidence presented in this review suggests that caution, and further research, are warranted as educators consider continuation of online course delivery begun during the current pandemic.","output":"The Impact of Distance and Social Isolation on Brain Morphology, Neural Coupling, Social Connectedness, and Immediacy: Implications for Online Learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of e-health services has for many years gradually increased in Norway as in most European countries.

The goal of the study was to identify water-quality impairments in order to set the priorities for post-hurricane relief and to guide future decisions on disaster preparation and relief administration. Field investigations were carried out on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands as soon as the disaster area became accessible after the back-to-back hurricane strikes by Irma and Maria in 2017. Water samples were collected from individual household rain cisterns, the coastal ocean, and street-surface runoffs for microbial concentration. The microbial community structure and the occurrence of potential human pathogens were investigated in samples using next generation sequencing. Loop mediated isothermal amplification was employed to detect fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis. The results showed both fecal indicator bacteria and Legionella genetic markers were prevalent but were low in concentration in the water samples. Among the 22 cistern samples, 86% were positive for Legionella and 82% for Escherichia-Shigella. Enterococcus faecalis was detected in over 68% of the rain cisterns and in 60% of the coastal waters (n = 20). Microbial community composition in coastal water samples was significantly different from cistern water and runoff water. Although identification at bacterial genus level is not direct evidence of human pathogens, our results suggest cistern water quality needs more organized attention for protection of human health, and that preparation and prevention measures should be taken before natural disasters strike.","output":"Assessing the water quality impacts of two Category-5 hurricanes on St. Thomas, Virgin Islands."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the imposition of the Movement Control Order (MCO) or lockdown due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are drastic changes in the movement and activity among Malaysians: increased psychological distress due to perception of COVID-19 as a health threat, increased time spent with families, and decreased time away from home could either intensify relationship problems or draw families closer to each other.

Methods: In this cohort study, we collected the first pandemic data of hospitalized patients in Wuhan from February 20 to March 31, 2020. All patients completed a 3-month follow-up after discharge. We carefully analyzed the detailed symptomatic characteristics of severe COVID-19 at illness onset and three months after discharge, compared it with non-severe patients, and used multiple logistic regression to determine potential symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19. Results: A total of 932 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 52 severe cases and 880 non-severe cases. Fever (60%), cough (50.8%), and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms, followed by anorexia (21.8%) and dyspnea (19.2%). The median duration of fever was seven days, which was characterized by persistent low fever. The median duration of cough was 17 days, characterized by dry cough without sputum. Most dyspnea occurred on the fourth day after symptom onset, with a median duration of 16 days. The incidences of taste loss and olfactory disturbance were only 6.2% and 3.1%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age over 65 years old (OR 6.52, 95% CI 3.27-13.02, P <0.0001), male sex (3.71, 1.90-7.26, P = 0.0001), fever lasting for more than five days (1.90, 1.00-3.62, P =0.0498), anorexia at onset (2.61, 1.26-5.40, P =0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (14.19,7.01-28.71, P <0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19.

Even though intensive efforts, no effective treatments or a vaccine are available. Molecular characterization of the transcriptional response in Covid-19 patients could be helpful to identify therapeutic targets. In this study, RNAseq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from Covid-19 patients and healthy controls was analyzed from a functional point of view using probabilistic graphical models. Two networks were built: one based on genes differentially expressed between healthy and infected individuals and another one based on the 2,000 most variable genes in terms of expression in order to make a functional characterization. In the network based on differentially expressed genes, two inflammatory response nodes with different tendencies were identified, one related to cytokines and chemokines, and another one related to bacterial infections. In addition, differences in metabolism, which were studied in depth using Flux Balance Analysis, were identified. SARS-CoV2-infection caused alterations in glutamate, methionine and cysteine, and tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism. In the network based on 2,000 most variable genes, also two inflammatory nodes with different tendencies between healthy individuals and patients were identified. Similar to the other network, one was related to cytokines and chemokines. However, the other one, lower in Covid-19 patients, was related to allergic processes and self-regulation of the immune response. Also, we identified a decrease in T cell node activity and an increase in cell division node activity.

During its initial surge in 2020, Taiwans government rapidly established diverse public actions, which helped maintain the medical supply without travel restrictions. However, whether the fear of being infected with COVID-19 interfered with health-seeking behavior (HSB) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate whether acute complicated appendicitis (ACA) rates in adults were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective analysis of acute appendicitis in adults was performed between January 1 and June 30, 2020 (COVID-19 period). The control period was collected from the first two quarters for the preceding 3 years. Outcome measures were ACA and length of hospital stays. Results: A total of 145 patients with acute appendicitis presented to our institution during the COVID-19 era. Compared to a 3-year control cohort of 320 patients, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a higher rate of symptom duration until their presentation to the emergency room within >48 h (17.2% vs 9.1%, P = 0.011), a higher incidence of ACA (29.7% vs 19.4%, P = 0.014), and a longer length of hospital stays (5.0 days vs 4.0 days, P = 0.043) were observed. In the adjusted regression analysis, the COVID-19 period was significantly associated with a higher rate of ACA (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87;95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23C2.52;P = 0.008) and longer length of hospital stay (OR= 2.10;95% CI: 0.92 to 3.31;P < 0.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with increased ACA rates in one community with a normal medical supply.

This study sought to characterize the demand for and provision of neurosurgical acute care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional observational analysis compared nonambulatory neurosurgical consult encounters during the peri-surge period (March 9 to May 31, 2020) with those during an analogous period in 2019. Outcomes included consult volume, distribution of problem types, disease severity, and rate of acute operative intervention. RESULTS: A total of 1494 neurosurgical consults were analyzed. Amidst the pandemic surge, 583 consults were seen, which was 6.4 standard deviations below the mean among analogous 2016-2019 periods (mean 873; standard deviation 45, P = 0.001).

We investigated antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but healthy individuals further compared with pre-pandemic controls in a high infectious disease burden setting. Methods: IgG antibodies against Spike and Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) were determined by ELISA in a Health Care cohort (HC;n=304), COVID-19 cases (n=163) and Pre-Pandemic Controls (PPC;n=114). Neutralizing antibody assays and T cell ELISpot assays were also conducted. Findings: IgG anti Spike proteins and RBD were present in all three groups albeit at varying levels. The highest rate of positivity was observed in COVID-19 cases (87.7% to Spike;53.9% to RBD);followed by HC (35% to Spike;21.3% to RBD) and PPC (12.2% to Spike;10.50% to RBD). Antibody positivity in HC rose from 4.5% in October 2020 to 61% in January 2021. Levels of IgG antibodies to Spike and RBD strongly correlated in COVID-19 and HC but not in PPC. IgG to RBD was associated with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Spike reactive T cells were identified in COVID-19 patients (6/18), HC (2/7) and but only one PPC (1/6). Interpretation: IgG to Spike and RBD in pre-pandemic sera is likely associated with cross-protection induced by other pathogens. The increasing percentage of IgG antibody positivity in HCC over the pandemic period may be due to expansion of cross-reactive B cells as observed in PPC, due either to exposure or asymptomatic subclinical infection with SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing activity of RBD IgG antibodies and reactive T cells to Spike in PPC suggests the presence of memory B and T cells to cross-reactive epitopes that can expand quickly, jumpstarting protection against SARS-CoV-2.

In Brazil, there are challenging boundaries for professionals in the protection network in general and for health professionals in particular. Moreover, among other factors, there is the challenge of referral, due to weaknesses in decision making, given the nature of sexual violence and how it is managed by healthcare services. This study aims to propose a Meta-Analytic framework to support the referral of young victims of sexual violence, considering levels of severity, independent of factors such as how protection systems are structured and managed and the local laws in force. We propose a Meta-Analytic approach, developed using the fundamentals of Delphi and DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, and Response Model of Intervention), from the perspective of Value-Focused Thinking. The Delphi method was structured in two stages: the first stage aimed to identify and classify typical cases of sexual violence; the second stage used the DPSIR model, with the aim of identifying the decision criteria for typical cases that occur in a given municipality. The main outcomes are: (i) the application of the modified Delphi participatory method within the context of local social policies; (ii) the construction of a value tree based on Value-Focused Thinking; and (iii) the identification and systematization of criteria that most interfere with the evaluation of cases of sexual violence, which can be used for multi-criteria decision making.","output":"A Meta-Analytic Framework for Developing Protocols to Attend Child and Adolescent Victims of Sexual Violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological, developmental, and educational consequences of the prolonged shutdown and digital shift to e-learning methods are being felt in every family throughout India. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of social media platforms such as Twitter has increased as people turn to it to express their thoughts, anxieties, and concerns. As a result, I conducted sentiment analysis on two sets of data related to the reopening of schools in India and the reopening of colleges/universities in India. The tweets were retrieved from the social media site Twitter using 9 keywords relating to the reopening of schools and colleges/universities. The Tweepy module in Python was used for the extraction process. A total of 2,494 tweets over the course of 16 days, from December 8th, 2021 to December 23 rd, 2021 were gathered. Later a total of 1,510 tweets were evaluated once all of the pre-processing steps were done. The sentimental analysis was carried out using 2 unsupervised Lexicon-based models-the Vader Lexicon and the SentiWordNet Lexicon method. In this study, the outcomes of both techniques are highlighted. The main aim of this research is to gauge the sentiments of the public reactions expressed towards the reopening of schools and colleges/universities. These findings may be a beneficial aspect to consider while the policy-making process. The results of this study suggest that by using both approaches there was a higher number of positive tweets which may indicate that citizens in India are in the favor of schools and colleges reopening.

We analyzed big data to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers have any significant effect on the risk of COVID-19. Population-based cohort study was conducted based on the prescription data from nationwide health insurance records. METHODS: We investigated the 1,374,381 residents aged  40 years living in Daegu, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, between February and March 2020. Prescriptions of antihypertensive medication during the year before the outbreak were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service registry. Medications were categorized by types and stratified by the medication possession ratios (MPRs) of antihypertensive medications after controlling for the potential confounders. The risk of COVID-19 was estimated using a difference in difference analysis. RESULTS: Females, older individuals, low-income earners, and recently hospitalized patients had a higher risk of infection. Patients with higher MPRs of antihypertensive medications had a consistently lower risk of COVID-19 than those with lower MPRs of antihypertensive medications and non-users. Among patients who showed complete compliance, there was a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 for those prescribed angiotensin II receptor blockers (relative risk [RR], 0.751; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.587C0.960) or calcium channel blockers (RR, 0.768; 95% CI, 0.601C0.980). CONCLUSION: Renin-angiotensin system blockers or other antihypertensive medications do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Patients should not stop antihypertensive medications, including renin-angiotensin system blockers, because of concerns of COVID-19.","output":"Compliance of Antihypertensive Medication and Risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019: a Cohort Study Using Big Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has created havoc all across the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India since its beginning on 30th January 2020.

The figure resulting from the vulnerability assessment corresponds that the factors involved in the three-section exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity had a significant impact on deciding the vulnerability of the population. The result identified the states and UTs which are more vulnerable and need more attention from the government and policymakers.

Commercial smartphone applications (apps) that promote self-monitoring for weight loss are widely available. Evidence is lacking regarding what support is required to enhance user engagement with and effectiveness of those technologies. Pragmatically comparing these apps effectiveness, including rural men's desired forms of support when using them, can lead to greater weight loss intervention impact and reach. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile technology application applied differently across two groups for weight loss. METHODS: In a two-armed, pragmatic pilot feasibility study, 80 overweight and obese men aged 40-69 were randomized using a 1:1 ratio to either an enhanced Mobile Technology Plus (MT+) intervention or a basic Mobile Technology (MT) intervention. The MT+ group had an enhanced smartphone app for self-monitoring (text messaging, discussion group, Wi-Fi scale) whereas the MT group received a basic app that allowed self-monitoring logging only. Assessments were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. App logs were analyzed to track engagement and adherence to self-monitoring. Acceptability was assessed via focus groups. Analysis included descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 men recruited, forty were allocated to each arm. All were included in the primary analysis. Recruitment ended after 10 months with a 97.5 and 92.5% (3 month, 6 month) retention rate. Over 90% of men reported via survey and focus groups that Lose-It app and smart scale (MT+) was an acceptable way to self-monitor weight, dietary intake and physical activity. Adherence to daily app self-monitoring of at least 800 dietary calories or more (reported respectively as MT+, MT) was positive with 73.4, 51.6% tracking at least 5 days a week. Adherence to tracking activity via recorded steps four or more days weekly was positive, 87.8, 64.6%. Men also adhered to self-weighing at least once weekly, 64, 46.3%. At 6 months, an observed mean weight loss was 7.03 kg (95% CI: 3.67, 10.39) for MT+ group and 4.14 kg (95% CI: 2.22, 6.06) for MT group, with 42.9 and 34.2% meeting &#8805;5% weight loss, respectively. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This National Institutes of Health-funded pilot study using mobile technologies to support behavior change for weight loss was found to be feasible and acceptable among midlife and older rural men. The interventions demonstrated successful reductions in weight, noting differing adherence to lifestyle behaviors of eating, monitoring and activity between groups, with men in the MT+ having more favorable results. These findings will be used to inform the design of a larger scale, clinical trial.

A better understanding on how to measure the true age of an individual or biological aging is an essential step that may lead to the definition of putative markers capable of predicting healthy aging. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the INStitute for Prevention healthy aging and medicine Rejuvenative (INSPIRE) Platform initiative is to build a program for Geroscience and healthy aging research going from animal models to humans and the health care system. The specific aim of the INSPIRE human translational cohort (INSPIRE-T cohort) is to gather clinical, digital and imaging data, and perform relevant and extensive biobanking to allow basic and translational research on humans. METHODS: The INSPIRE-T cohort consists in a population study comprising 1000 individuals in Toulouse and surrounding areas (France) of different ages (20 years or over  no upper limit for age) and functional capacity levels (from robustness to frailty, and even dependency) with follow-up over 10 years. Diversified data are collected annually in research facilities or at home according to standardized procedures. Between two annual visits, IC domains are monitored every 4-month by using the ICOPE Monitor app developed in collaboration with WHO. Once IC decline is confirmed, participants will have a clinical assessment and blood sampling to investigate markers of aging at the time IC declines are detected. Biospecimens include blood, urine, saliva, and dental plaque that are collected from all subjects at baseline and then, annually. Nasopharyngeal swabs and cutaneous surface samples are collected in a large subgroup of subjects every two years. Feces, hair bulb and skin biopsy are collected optionally at the baseline visit and will be performed again during the longitudinal follow up. EXPECTED RESULTS: Recruitment started on October 2019 and is expected to last for two years. Bio-resources collected and explored in the INSPIRE-T cohort will be available for academic and industry partners aiming to identify robust (set of) markers of aging, age-related diseases and IC evolution that could be pharmacologically or non-pharmacologically targetable. The INSPIRE-T will also aim to develop an integrative approach to explore the use of innovative technologies and a new, function and person-centered health care pathway that will promote a healthy aging.

At present, less than 20% of post-consumer plastic waste in developed countries is recycled, predominately for energy recovery or repurposing as lower-value materials by mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling offers an opportunity to revert plastics back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin materials without altering the properties of the material or the economic value of the polymer. For plastic waste that is either cost prohibitive or infeasible to mechanically or chemically recycle, the nascent field of chemical upcycling promises to use chemical or engineering approaches to place plastic waste at the beginning of a new value chain. Here state-of-the-art methods are highlighted for upcycling plastic waste into value-added performance materials, fine chemicals and specialty polymers. By identifying common conceptual approaches, we critically discuss how the advantages and challenges of each approach contribute to the goal of realizing a sustainable plastics economy.","output":"Critical advances and future opportunities in upcycling commodity polymers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3-Deazauridine (3DU) is a nucleoside analogue that was investigated for its antineoplastic activity in cancer patients. 3DU after its phosphorylation in cells to its 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of CTP synthetase. Inhibition of this enzyme results in a reduction in cellular CTP and inhibition of RNA synthesis. This action of 3DU can also inhibit RNA synthesis since the viral RNA polymerase requires CTP for replication of RNA. 3DU was reported to inhibit the in vitro replication of the RNA influenza virus at concentrations in the range of 40 M (1) and should also have the potential to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. In a pilot clinical study, we treated a patient with acute lymphoid leukemia with 3DU at doses ranging from 120 to 360 mg/kg using a continuous intravenous infusion ranging from 40 to 72 hr. (2). The objective of the study was to determine if 3DU could enhance the antileukemic action of the inhibitor of DNA methylation, decitabine, and overcome the problem of drug resistance to this deoxycytidine analogue. Partial responses were observed indicating that pharmacological action of 3DU could accomplish this objective. There were minimal signs of toxicity in this clinical study on 3DU which exhibited plasma concentrations of this analogue in the range that inhibit RNA virus replication. This observation suggests that it would be safe to use 3DU in patients with COVID-19. 3DU has a rapid onset of action with a significant sign of antineoplastic action observable after a 4 h in vitro treatment of human leukemic cells. This pharmacological property rapid action of 3DU may be very important in patients with advanced COVID-19 to inhibit the virus is during its rapid replication phase and prevent progression of the disease to acute lung inflammation. It would be interesting to test this hypothesis in advanced COVID-19 patients at high risk for disease progression. For an initial pilot study I recommend a 36 h infusion of 3DU at a total dose of 120 mg/kg. It is possible that therapy with 3DU may have the potential to rescue patients with advance COVID-19.","output":"Anticancer agent 3-deazauridine has the potential to be effective against COVID-19 due to its inhibition of replication of RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite routine screening of patients for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and signs at hospital entrances, patients may slip between the cracks and be incidentally discovered to have lung findings that could indicate COVID-19 infection on imaging obtained for other reasons.

As the prevalence rate of posttraumatic stress disorder in pandemic survivors exceeds that of the general and special populations, the virus may predispose to this disorder by directly interfering with the stress-processing pathways. The SARS-CoV-2 interactome has identified several antigens that may disrupt the blood-brain-barrier by inducing premature senescence in many cell types, including the cerebral endothelial cells. This enables the stress molecules, including angiotensin II, endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, to aberrantly activate the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex, increasing the vulnerability to stress related disorders. This is supported by observing the beneficial effects of angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in both posttraumatic stress disorder and SARS-CoV-2 critical illness. In this narrative review, we take a closer look at the virus-host dialog and its impact on the renin-angiotensin system, mitochondrial fitness, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We discuss the role of furin cleaving site, the fibrinolytic system, and Sigma-1 receptor in the pathogenesis of psychological trauma. In other words, learning from the virus, clarify the molecular underpinnings of stress related disorders, and design better therapies for these conditions.
