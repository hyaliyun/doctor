OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients during the course of the pandemic in a well-integrated health system. METHODS: The study used data from the electronic health medical records to assess trends in clinical profile and outcomes of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in our 5-hospital health system from March 2020-May 2021 (n = 6865). Integration of the health system began in February 2020 and was fully actualized by March 30, 2020. RESULTS: Mortality decreased from 15% during first peak (March-May 2020; the rate includes 19% in March-April and 10% in May 2020) to 6% in summer-fall 2020, increased to 13% during the second peak (November 2020-January 2021), and dropped to 7% during the decline period (February-May 2021) (p<0.01). Resource utilization followed a similar pattern including a decrease in ICU use from 35% (first peak) to 16% (decline period), mechanical ventilation from 16% (first peak, including 45% in March 2020) to 9C11% in subsequent periods (p<0.01). Independent predictors of inpatient mortality across multiple study periods included older age, male sex, higher multi-morbidity scores, morbid obesity, and indicators of severe illness on admission such as oxygen saturation 90% and high qSOFA score (all p<0.05). However, admission during the first peak remained independently associated with increased mortality even after adjustment for patient-related factors: odds ratio = 1.8 (1.4C2.4) (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a fully integrated health system allowed us to dynamically respond to the everchanging COVID-19 landscape. In this context, despite the increasing patient acuity, our mortality and resource utilization rates have improved during the pandemic.","output":"Outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the course of the pandemic in a fully integrated health system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The study aims to analyze the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on house prices Design/methodology/approach: The authors start by discussing the possibility that house price indexes may not fully incorporate the effects of the pandemic as of yet Against the background of the pandemic, the authors then analyze economic and behavioral effects affecting house prices The authors also discuss how the linkages between tourism and house prices have been affected The authors further present evidence of an emerging shift in preferences from urban locations to more peripheral ones Findings: The authors report variance in the evolution of house prices across countries at the onset of the pandemic, with locations depending heavily on tourism showing slower price appreciation while appreciation has firmed in other places The authors argue that the resilience of house prices is not only because of the low-interest rate environment and government efforts to support firms and households, but also behavioral factors In some locations, the price of condominiums has declined relative to the price of detached houses This could indicate that wealthier households are seeking more space and larger units as a result of the crisis There is also evidence of a downward pressure on rents, leading to increased priceCrent ratios in the USA Originality/value: By considering both economic and behavioral factors, this paper provides for a better understanding of the resilience and realignment of house prices at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"The resilience and realignment of house prices in the era of Covid-19*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite severe economic damage, full-service restaurants and bars have been closed in hopes of suppressing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.

Nevertheless, further classification had rarely been attempted. This study proposes a novel approach, using continuous Mandarin speech instead of a single vowel, to classify four common voice disorders (i.e. functional dysphonia, neoplasm, phonotrauma, and vocal palsy). Methods: In the proposed framework, acoustic signals are transformed into mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and a bi-directional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) is adopted to model the sequential features. The experiments were conducted on a large-scale database, wherein 1,045 continuous speech were collected by the speech clinic of a hospital from 2012 to 2019. Results: Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant accuracy and unweighted average recall improvements of 78.12-89.27% and 50.92-80.68%, respectively, compared with systems that use a single vowel. Conclusions: The results are consistent with other machine learning algorithms, including gated recurrent units, random forest, deep neural networks, and LSTM. The sensitivities for each disorder were also analyzed, and the model capabilities were visualized via principal component analysis.

Blood samples for complement factors were obtained before and 48 h after administration of C1-inh. Six patients did not survive and their data were not included. Of 34 patients included, median age was 6.5 months, median body weight was 6050 g, and 16 (47%) were female. According to the MannCWhitney U test, there were no differences between the two groups concerning demographic and intraoperative data, postoperative chemical data. C1q concentration was only significant lower in patients with C1-inh non-treated group than in patients with C1-inh treated group. But, the consumption of C1q, C3, C4, CH(50), and C1-inh in patients with C1-inhibitor non-treated group was observed early postoperatively. There is a significant difference in the values before and after C1-inh treatment between the two groups. The lower value in the C1-inh-treated group is explained by the activation of the classical pathway through the replenishment of complements by C1-inh treatment.

This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by exploring the view of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions. Design, setting and participantsOnline survey between 29th May and 22nd June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, disability, and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing one patient to treat, or tossing a coin to decide. ResultsSeven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents prioritized patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72-93%), longer life expectancy (78-83%), required shorter duration of treatment (88-94%), were younger (71-79%), or had a lesser degree of frailty (60-69% all p< .001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A majority (58-86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children. ConclusionMembers of the UK general public potentially support a broadly utilitarian approach to ICU triage in the face of overwhelming need. Survey respondents endorsed the relevance of patient factors currently included in triage guidance, but also factors not currently included. They supported the permissibility of reallocating treatment in a pandemic.

With the economy at a standstill, the Palestinian governing authority has limited financial resources to (re)build key sanitation, hygiene, waste treatment and water supply infrastructure. These (infrastructural) inadequacies, while already a public health concern before the onset of the pandemic, now renders Gaza particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses and diseases. Additionally, the limited movement of goods because of the siege has led to an acute shortage of medical supplies and equipment that are essential for combating a pandemic. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 outbreak is also unique in that it presents Gaza with a crisis that has little to do with the hostilities that define the politics of Israel-Palestine. Yet, the potential of a widespread outbreak also lays bare to the development challenges that Gaza faces as a result of the conflict. This, I conclude, provides an opportunity for the donor community to, under pretext of combating the pandemic, remedy some of the consequences of the conflict and siege without having to contend with the (political) stigma of doing so.","output":"The pandemic under siege: A view from the Gaza Strip"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computational thinking is an essential skill in the modern global workforce.

COVID-19 waste could comprise of both municipal waste as well as bio-medical waste depending on the source of its generation. Such waste could be potentially infected with the virus. If not managed and treated scientifically, the risk of secondary transmission of the virus increases. The existing waste management systems are not designed to handle such surge of waste and therefore, safe handling and disposal of such waste is viewed as one of the biggest challenges. There could be multiple sources of COVID-19 waste, which includes hospitals, COVID-19 wards, testing centers, laboratories, home quarantine, temporary medical establishments, ambulances, graveyards and commercial establishments. Guidelines and procedures for management of the COVID-19 waste have been prescribed by WHO and by governments by countries across the globe. Selection of appropriate technology to treat and dispose potentially infectious COVID-19 waste is critical but depends on economic, environmental and social factors of a country or region. Looking at the quantum of waste that would be generated from the used PPEs, it is quite apparent that the existing waste management systems are going to be overburdened. The pandemic is also going to adversely impact the waste recycling sector, including the informal sector. To minimize the risk of transmission of the virus through sewage, proper treatment followed by disinfection is necessary. An ideal waste management policy during this pandemic should safely tackle the waste generated such that there are no chances of transmission due to the waste, ensure that the waste causes least possible damage to the environment, and strive to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) and other international obligations.","output":"Chapter 14 - Management of COVID-19 waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polysaccharide-encapsulated fungi are the chief source of diseases in immunocompromised hosts such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus or neutropenia patients.

T-type channels have been implicated in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including epilepsy, autism, and mood regulation, but the brain structures involved remain incompletely understood. The medial habenula (MHb) is an epithalamic structure implicated in anxiety-like and withdrawal behavior. Previous studies have shown that MHb neurons fire tonic APs at a frequency of a2-10 Hz or display depolarized low amplitude membrane oscillations. Here, we report in C57BL/6J mice that a subpopulation of MHb neurons are capable of firing transient, high frequency AP bursts mediated by T-type channels. Burst firing was observed following rebounding from hyperpolarizing current injections or during depolarization from hyperpolarized membrane potentials in a20% of MHb neurons. It was rarely observed at baseline but could be evoked in MHb neurons displaying different initial activity states. Further, we show that T-type channel mRNA, in particular Cav3.1, is expressed in the MHb in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons. Pharmacological Cav3 antagonism blocked both burst firing and evoked Ca2+ currents in MHb neurons. Additionally, we observed high frequency AP doublet firing at sustained depolarized membrane potentials that was independent of T-type channels. Thus, there is a greater diversity of AP firing patterns in MHb neurons than previously identified, including T-type channel-mediated burst firing, which may uniquely contribute to behaviors with relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.Significance statement Previous studies have reported that medial habenula neurons solely fire tonic action potentials at a2-10 Hz or display depolarized low amplitude membrane oscillations. In contrast, we found that a subpopulation of medial habenula neurons fire high frequency action potential bursts that share the characteristics of T-type Ca2+ channel-mediated low threshold spikes and were blocked by pharmacological antagonism of T-type Ca2+ channels. T-type Ca2+ channel mRNA, especially Cav3.1, is expressed in the medial habenula in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons.

However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration.

In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a 'global view' of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance. &copy;2021 Tsinghua University Press. ? 2021 Tsinghua University Press.

A convenience sample of 207 participants were recruited, 89% of whom were females and 94% were single. The measures included questionnaires on the level of exposure and the perceived impact of COVID-19, a physical activity measure, GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PSQI. The results indicated that approximately 43% of participants exhibited moderate anxiety, and 50% were at risk of depression. Overall, 63.93% of students exposed to strict quarantine for at least 14 days (n = 39) exhibited a high risk of developing depression ((2)(1) = 6.49, p < 0.05, ? = 0.18). A higher risk of depression was also found in students whose loved ones lost their jobs ((2)(1) = 4.24, p < 0.05, ? = 0.14). Moreover, there was also a strong association between depression and anxiety ( = 0.33, p < 0.01), sleep quality ( = 0.32, p < 0.01), and the perceived negative impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic status ( = 0.26, p < 0.05), explaining 66.67% of depression variance.

METHODS: Histopathologic findings in postmortem lung tissue from eight patients who died from COVID\\\\19 pneumonia were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect virus. RESULTS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in all cases with a spectrum of acute phase and/or organizing phase. IHC with monoclonal antibodies against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral nucleoprotein and spike protein detected virus in areas of acute but not organizing DAD, with intracellular viral antigen and RNA expression seen predominantly in patients with duration of illness less than 10 days. Major vascular findings included thrombi in medium and large caliber vessels, platelet microthrombi detected by CD61 IHC, and fibrin microthrombi. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral RNA by NGS early in the disease course and expression of viral antigen by IHC exclusively in the acute but not in the organizing phase of DAD, suggests that the virus may play a major role in initiating the acute lung injury of DAD, but when DAD progresses to the organizing phase, the virus may have been cleared from the lung by the patients immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of a major change during the disease course of COVID\\\\19 pneumonia that may have therapeutic implications.

They conducted meta-analysis where appropriate and provide recommendations based on compilation from real-time/interim therapeutic guidelines. They then advise on how to navigate and advance the evidence in the current context of uncertainty and urgency and provide expert opinion on suggested framework. EXPERT OPINION Current evidence does not support a clear role for pharmacotherapy in COVID-19. While promising signals have been found through limited number of RCTs, these must be interpreted with caution. Without proper protection from bias and confounding we risk exposing patients to treatments where the potential for benefit is at best unclear, yet the potential for harm from adverse effects is high leading to a trade-off dilemma in decision making. Advancing the evidence requires a coordinated effort to design and conduct robust trials and to systematically synthesize and critically evaluate findings. Therapies should be reserved for use in clinical trials, emergency or compassionate access until we gain more confidence in the balance of benefit and harm.","output":"The trade-off dilemma in pharmacotherapy of COVID-19: systematic review, meta-analysis, and implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a review on the state-of-the-art of the access control systems based on face recognition.

Data showed that E2 was more strongly to interact with the main protease of the coronavirus, while T had the lowest affinity for CSP. The binding energy of the CSP to ACE2 was increased in the presence of steroids;the greatest increase was observed by DEX and E2. The binding free energy of the CSP to ACE2 was the highest in the presence of E2 and DEX. Together, the interaction between CSP and ACE2 can be disrupted by E2 and to a greater extent by DEX, in part explaining the lower incidence of COVID-19 infection in women than men.

To prepare for future crises, we must be able to describe what went wrong, and why, and map out ways to build agility and resilience. How can this be done effectively, given the highly complex and diverse network of actors across governments, care providers and supply chains, and the extreme uncertainty and dynamism in the procurement system and supplier markets? The purpose of this study was to capture learning from practitioners in real time in a way that could frame and inform capacity building across healthcare systems with varying procurement and supply management maturity.Design/methodology/approachThis exploratory study involved interviews with 58 senior public procurement practitioners in central and regional governments, NGOs and leaders of professional organizations from 23 countries, very early in the COVID crisis. Following the first, inductive phase of analysis leading to five descriptive dimensions, the awareness-motivation-capability (A-M-C) framework was applied in a further round of coding, to understand immediate challenges faced by procurement practitioners, how the complex, multi-level procurement system that shaped their motivations to respond and critical capabilities required to face these challenges.FindingsDevelopments across 23 countries and practitioners' learning about procurement and supply in the pandemic crisis can be captured in five overarching themes: governance and organization, knowledge and skills, information systems, regulation and supply base issues. Together these themes cover the strengths and gaps in procurement and supply capability encountered by procurement leaders and front-line personnel. They highlight the various facets of structure, resource and process which constitute organizational capability. However, to account better for the highly dynamic situation characterized by both unprecedented rivalry and cooperation, analysts must also pay attention to actors' emerging awareness of the situation and their rapidly changing motivations.Originality/valueThe application of the A-M-C framework is unique in the healthcare supply chain and disaster management literature.

Different from previous studies, this research builds upon the consecrated theory of inventory pooling, extending it to pandemic circumstances where the intractability of kurtosis and skewness in inventory models are critical issues for making sure that medicines have high availability at a low cost. These effects on the total cost of inventory are explored and compared to a supply system with no consolidation. A continuous-review model is assumed with allocation rules for centralization and regular transshipment given different skewness and kurtosis structures for the demand, describing them by the copula method. This method models a multivariate demand considering that the marginal distributions of the demand can be specified by the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape, which offers advantages to model demands considering virtually any marginal statistical distribution. Numerical simulations and an illustrative example show that distributions of demands with more negative skewness and high kurtosis favor to a greater extent obtaining lower total costs with regular supply transshipment systems.

Although there have been studies targeting LEO safety through enhanced training or expanded equipment provisions, there has been little attempt to leverage personal technology in the field to provide real-time notification of LEO stress. This study tests the acceptability of implementing of a brief, smart watch intervention to alleviate stress among LEOs. METHODS We assigned smart watches to 22 patrol LEOs across two police departments: one suburban department and one large, urban department. At baseline, we measured participants' resting heart rates (RHR), activated their watches, and educated them on brief wellness interventions in the field. LEOs were instructed to wear the watch during the entirety of their shift for 30 calendar days. When LEO's heart rate or stress continuum reached the predetermined threshold for more than 10 min, the watch notified LEOs, in real time, of two stress reduction interventions: [1] a 1-min, guided breathing exercise; and [2] A Calm app, which provided a mix of guided meditations and mindfulness exercises for LEOs needing a longer decompression period. After the study period, participants were invited for semi-structured interviews to elucidate intervention components. Qualitative data were analyzed using an immersion-crystallization approach. RESULTS LEOs reported three particularly useful intervention components: 1) a vibration notification when hearts rates remained high, although receipt of a notification was highly variable; 2) visualization of their heart rate and stress continuum in real time; and, 3) breathing exercises. The most frequently reported type of call for service when the watch vibrated was when a weapon was involved or when a LEO was in pursuit of a murder suspect/hostage. LEOs also recollected that their watch vibrated while reading dispatch notes or while on their way to work.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have rapidly adapted how they deliver patient care. PPE Portraits are a form of adaptation, whereby health workers affix a postcard size portrait of themselves to the front of their personal protective equipment (PPE) to foster human connection during COVID-19. METHODS: We used the expanded framework for reporting adaptations and modifications to evidence-based interventions (FRAME) method to better understand the reasoning behind and results of each adaptation. We hypothesized that using the FRAME in conjunction with design-thinking would lead to emerging best practices and that we would find adaptation similarities across sites. Throughout multiple implementations across 25 institutions, we piloted, tracked, and analyzed adaptations using FRAME and design thinking. For each adaptation, we assessed the stage of implementation, whether the change was planned, decision makers involved, level of delivery impacted, fidelity to original intervention, and the goal and reasoning for adaptation. We added three crucial components to the FRAME: original purpose of the adaptation, unintended consequences, and alternative adaptations. RESULTS: When implementing PPE Portraits across settings, from a local assisted living centers memory unit to a pediatric emergency department, several requests for adaptations arose during early development stages before implementation. Adaptations primarily related to (1) provider convenience and comfort, (2) patient populations, and (3) scale. Providers preferred smaller portraits and rounded (rather than square) laminated edges that could potentially injure a patient. Affixing the portrait with a magnet was rejected given the potential choking hazard the magnetic strip presented for children. Other adaptations, related to ease of dissemination, included slowing the process down during early development and providing buttons, which could be produced easily at scale. CONCLUSIONS: The FRAME was used to curate the reasoning for each adaptation and to inform future dissemination. We look forward to utilizing FRAME including our additions and design thinking, to build out a range of PPE Portrait best practices with accompanying costs and benefits.

Chinas carbon emissions are the highest in the world, and the construction industry is the largest contributor. Due to significant differences between provinces in pressure, potential, and motivation to reduce emissions, the one-size-fits-allemission reduction policy has failed to achieve the desired results. This paper empirically investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of carbon emissions in Chinas construction industry and their decoupling relationship with economic growth relying on GIS tools and decoupling model in an attempt to provide a basis for the formulation of differentiated construction emission reduction policies and plans in China. The study shows that, firstly, the changes in carbon emissions and carbon intensity in the provincial construction industry are becoming increasingly complex, with a variety of types emerging, such as declining, inverted U-shaped, growing, U-shaped, and smooth fluctuating patterns. Secondly, the coefficient of variation is higher than 0.65 for a long time, indicating high spatial heterogeneity. However, spatial agglomeration and correlation are low, with only a few cluster-like agglomerations formed in the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, Bohai Bay, Northeast China, and Loess and YunnanCGuizhou Plateau regions. Thirdly, most provinces have not reached peak carbon emissions from the construction industry, with 25% having reached peak and being in the plateau stage, respectively. Fourthly, the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions from the construction industry and economic growth, as well as their changes, is increasingly diversified, and most provinces are in a strong and weak decoupling state. Moreover, a growing number of provinces that have achieved decoupling are moving backward to re-coupling, due to the impact of economic transformation and the outbreaks of COVID-19, with the degraded regions increasingly concentrated in the northeast and northwest. Fifthly, we classify Chinas 30 provinces into Leader, Intermediate, and Laggard policy zones and further propose differentiated response strategies.

In terms of owner characteristics, owners who scored higher on cognitive measures were more likely to have their dogs complete the program.

Methods: A retrospective study of malaria cases and IRS reports was carried out. Malaria cases per each health centre from 2015-2020 were collected from DHIS in Buhera rural district. Results: The study shows that the overall IRS acceptance rate in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 was 100%, 58.5%, 66.6%, 52.8% and 83.3%, respectively. The absolute rooms sprayed in 2017 are 2.55% above those sprayed in 2016 but are 8.46% below those sprayed in 2015. The coverage failed to reach impact levels in most of the wards due but not lack of resources, limited to inadequate community sensitization, and competing programmes which were running concurrently with IRS. Also, the study revealed that malaria confirmed cases increased tremendously in 2020 as compared to the previous years, particularly from 2015-2019 because of delayed IRS coverage, COVID-19 restrictions, heavy rains, differed and inconsistent social and behaviour change communication, lack of community engagement, delayed procurement of equipment and lack of funding among others. Conclusions: The study revealed that moving from malaria prevention to elimination is possible in low malaria incidence areas in Buhera rural district. However, new challenges including cyclones and COVID-19, disrupts of movements of medical equipment, delayed IRS activities, social and behaviour change communication and IEC campaigns and mandatory national lockdowns. It is therefore imperative to integrate mobile phones into malaria control strategies during COVID-19 pandemic to strengthen awareness campaigns while maintaining COVID-19 regulations.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Malaria Elimination: Juxtaposing Indoor Residual Spraying and Mobile Phones in Buhera Rural District, Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined associations of watching television, electronic games, computer uses with school stress, and satisfaction among adolescents. Nationally representative data from 38 European and North American countries that participated in the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey were analysed. School stress and school satisfaction were each assessed using a 4-point self-reported item and then dichotomised. Participants reported discretional time spent on different screen-based activities. Of the 191,786 participants (age 13.6 [1.6] years; 51% girls), 35% reported high levels of school stress, while 30% reported high satisfaction with their school. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression modelling showed that adolescents reporting watching television > 4 h/day ( 1 h/day as reference) had 31% higher odds of school stress (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.27C1.35) and 36% less odds of school satisfaction (OR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.62C0.67). Prolonged electronic gaming (> 4 h/day) increased the odds of school stress by 26% (OR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22C1.30) and decreased the odds of school satisfaction by 37% (OR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61C0.65). Adolescents with prolonged computer use had 46% higher odds of school stress (OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.42C1.50) and 39% lower odds of school satisfaction (OR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.59C0.63). Association estimates were more evident among younger adolescents than their older counterparts with no apparent gender differences. Conclusion: Prolonged screen use, irrespective of type, was positively associated with school stress and inversely associated with school satisfaction with high computer use showing the highest adverse associations.

This study examines the efficacy of a novel, case-based virtual surgery clerkship curriculum to determine its impact on student experience during quarantine. Study Design: Sixteen third-year medical students enrolled in the General Surgery clerkship between April through June 2020 during COVID-19 distancing at a quaternary medical center (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) participated in this study. Course surveys, including a 10-question curriculum-based multiple-choice assessment, were administered before and after the clerkship. Analyses include student self-perception of readiness to see a surgical consult independently, students' interest in pursuing a General Surgery residency, and improvement of surgical knowledge. Results and Conclusion: On a 5-point Likert scale, students felt significantly more assured in their ability to independently assess a surgical consult by the end of the course. Five (31%) students reported an influence of the curriculum on their personal interest in a career in General Surgery. Mean scores on the curriculum-based knowledge assessment increased. These findings highlight that a virtual platform can be a reliable alternative adjunct that delivers surgical content and positively impacts student experience.

Most childhood deaths in hospital often occur within the first 24 h of admission. Many of these deaths are from preventable causes. This study aims to describe the patterns of mortality in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: This was a five-year chart review of deaths in pediatric patients aged 7 days to 13 years presenting to the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Tertiary Hospital (TASTH) from January 2012 to December 2016. Data were collected using a pretested, structured checklist, and analyzed using the SPSS Version 20. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression was carried out to estimate any measures of association between variables of interest and the primary outcome of death. RESULTS: The proportion of pediatric emergency department (PED) deaths was 4.1% (499 patients) out of 12,240 PED presentations. This translates to a mortality rate of 8.2 deaths per 1000 patients per year. The three top causes of deaths were pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF) and sepsis. Thirty two percent of the deaths occurred within 24 h of presentation with 6.5% of the deaths being neonates and the most common co-morbid illness was malnutrition (41.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed that shortness of breath [AOR=2.45, 95% CI (1.22-4.91)], late onset of signs and symptoms [AOR=3.22, 95% CI (1.34-7.73)], fever [AOR=3.17, 95% CI (1.28-7.86)], and diarrhea [AOR=3.36, 95% CI (1.69-6.67)] had significant association with early mortality. CONCLUSION: The incidence of pediatric emergency mortality was high in our study. A delay in presentation of more than 48 hours, diarrheal diseases and shortness of breath were significantly associated with early pediatric mortality. Early identification and intervention are required to reduce pediatric emergency mortality.","output":"Prevalence and associated factors of pediatric emergency mortality at Tikur Anbessa specialized tertiary hospital: a 5 year retrospective case review study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Albumin is commonly used as a carrier platform for drugs to extend their circulatory half-lives and influence their uptake into tissues that have altered permeability to the plasma protein. The albumin-binding domain (ABD) protein, which binds in vivo to serum albumin with high affinity, has proven to be a versatile scaffold for engineering biopharmaceuticals with a range of binding capabilities. In this study, the ABD protein equipped with a mal-DOTA chelator (denoted ABY-028) was radiolabeled with gallium-68 (68Ga). This novel radiotracer was then used together with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to examine variations in the uptake of the ABD-albumin conjugate with variations in endothelial permeability. RESULTS ABY-028, produced by peptide synthesis in excellent purity and stored at - 20 C, was stable for 24 months (end of study). [68Ga]ABY-028 could be obtained with labeling yields of > 80% and approximately 95% radiochemical purity. [68Ga]ABY-028 distributed in vivo with the plasma pool, with highest radioactivity in the heart ventricles and major vessels of the body, a gradual transport over time from the circulatory system into tissues and elimination via the kidneys. Early [68Ga]ABY-028 uptake differed in xenografts with different vascular properties: mean standard uptake values (SUVmean) were initially 5 times larger in FaDu than in A431 xenografts, but the difference decreased to 3 after 1 h. Cutaneously administered, vasoactive nitroglycerin increased radioactivity in the A431 xenografts. Heterogeneity in the levels and rates of increases of radioactivity uptake was observed in sub-regions of individual MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors and in FaDu xenografts. Higher uptake early after tracer administration could be observed in lower metabolic regions. Fluctuations in the increased permeability for the tracer across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) direct after experimentally induced stroke were monitored by PET and the increased uptake was confirmed by ex vivo phosphorimaging. CONCLUSIONS [68Ga]ABY-028 is a promising new tracer for visualization of changes in albumin uptake due to disease- and pharmacologically altered vascular permeability and their potential effects on the passive uptake of targeting therapeutics based on the ABD protein technology.","output":"[68Ga]ABY-028: an albumin-binding domain (ABD) protein-based imaging tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of altered vascular permeability and predictions of albumin-drug conjugate transport."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of chronic infection in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. After colonization, P. aeruginosa often undergoes a phenotypic conversion to mucoidy, characterized by overproduction of the alginate exopolysaccharide. This conversion is correlated with poorer patient prognoses. The majority of genes required for alginate synthesis, including the alginate lyase, algL, are located in a single operon. Previous investigations of AlgL have resulted in several divergent hypotheses regarding the protein's role in alginate production. To address these discrepancies, we determined the structure of AlgL and, using multiple sequence alignments, identified key active site residues involved in alginate binding and catalysis. In vitro enzymatic analysis of active site mutants highlights R249 and Y256 as key residues required for alginate lyase activity. In a genetically engineered P. aeruginosa strain where alginate biosynthesis is under arabinose control, we found that AlgL is required for cell viability and maintaining membrane integrity during alginate production. We demonstrate that AlgL functions as a homeostasis enzyme to clear the periplasmic space of accumulated polymer. Constitutive expression of the AlgU/T sigma factor mitigates the effects of an algL deletion during alginate production, suggesting that an AlgU/T-regulated protein or proteins can compensate for an algL deletion. Together, our study demonstrates the role of AlgL in alginate biosynthesis, explains the discrepancies observed previously across other P. aeruginosa algL genetic backgrounds, and clarifies the existing divergent data regarding the function of AlgL as an alginate degrading enzyme.","output":"The Pseudomonas aeruginosa homeostasis enzyme AlgL clears the periplasmic space of accumulated alginate during polymer biosynthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This pandemic has greatly affected healthcare delivery and those providing care to vulnerable, immunocompromised patients undergoing cancer treatment, who are at a higher risk for poorer outcomes related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on oncology healthcare professionals (OHCPs). METHODS An exploratory study design was employed using semistructured interviews. A thematic analysis was completed using Atlas.ti software. RESULTS Of 30 OHCP participants, most were female (90%), registered nurses (70%), and bachelor's prepared (66%). The following themes emerged: (1) pandemic-related restrictions and stress on personal lives impacted the ability of OHCPs to rejuvenate and reenergize for work; (2) fear of exposure and transmission and concern for high-risk status for contracting COVID-19; (3) limited resources and inconsistent communication about organizational policies caused additional stress, affecting OHCP trust and confidence in the system; (4) concern for the mental health of fellow OCHPs; (5) adaptation and resilience were required amidst shifting workloads, workflow, and new restrictions; and (6) importance of self-care to reduce personal/professional stressors.

We provide an explanation for this income effect based on the stringency of government response to the pandemic and the unequal distribution of agency among social classes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper makes use of data from the Six-Country Survey on Covid-19 to establish the existence of an income effect on health utilisation, and from the Oxford Covid-19 Government response tracker to show that this income effect is associated with the stringency of governmental response to the pandemic. Data from the 2011/12 Health and Healthcare round of the International Social Survey Programme is used to show that this income effect cannot be explained by pre-existing patterns. An explanation for the link between government stringency and the income effect is advanced on a theoretical basis. Findings: The authors find in Britain, the US, and C with greater uncertainty C in Japan that individuals who experience potential Covid-19 symptoms are less likely to seek medical treatment if they have a lower income. The authors also show that governments in these countries adopted a less stringent response to the pandemic than the countries in our sample which do not exhibit an income effect C China, Italy and South Korea. The authors argue that laissez-faire policies place the burden of action upon the individual, activating underlying differences in agency between the social classes, and making (high) low-income individuals (more) less likely to seek medical attention. Research limitations/implications: Since there was not a direct measure of agency in the data, it could not be empirically verified that agency mediates the effect of government stringency on health utilisation. Further research could make use of datasets which incorporate such a measure, if they become available. It could also extend the geographical scope of the findings, to see if the income effect manifests in other countries which adopted a laissez-faire response to the pandemic. Practical implications: Governments should intervene more stringently during pandemics to minimise inequality in health outcomes. Originality/value: This paper establishes an association between the stringency of government response to the Covid-19 pandemic and income inequality in health utilisation. This contributes to scholarly and policy debates around health inequality in the area of social epidemiology, and the sociology of inequality more generally. It is also of relevance to the general public, in the context of a deadly pandemic.","output":"Hands-off?

The translational intermediate associated with a ribosome paused at this position is detected, and, using in vitro translation and quantitative heelprinting, the rates of synthesis, the ribosomal pause time, the proportion of ribosomes paused at the slippery site, and the fraction of paused ribosomes that frameshift are estimated. About 10% of ribosomes pause at the slippery site in vitro, and some 60% of these continue in the -1 frame. Ribosomes that continue in the -1 frame pause about 10 times longer than it takes to complete a peptide bond in vitro. Altering the rate of translational initiation alters the rate of frameshifting in vivo. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments can best be interpreted to mean that there are three methods by which ribosomes pass the frameshift site, only one of which results in frameshifting.","output":"Kinetics of ribosomal pausing during programmed -1 translational frameshifting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Australia, Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing communities.

The study was qualitative in nature guided by the descriptive research design. Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).","output":"Social Work Practice: Accounting for Double Injustices Experienced by Women Under the Confluence of Covid-19 Pandemic and Climate Change Impacts in Nyanga, Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As with other countries globally, Rwanda has faced a recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) against a backdrop of an HIV epidemic. At present, there is no successful cure or vaccine for both COVID-19 and HIV. People with underlying conditions, including HIV, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations. This underscores the need to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of people living with HIV (PLWH) to protect this population against COVID-19. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020 among 376 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) levels. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (<65%) and high (&#8805;65%) KAP scores. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All decisions on statistical tests were concluded at 5% level of significance. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score, while more than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score, and the majority (90%) having a high practice score. There was no association between gender, age, place of residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score. Employment status and duration on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.004 and p = 0.013, respectively). Gender and duration on ART were significantly associated with practice scores (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.57) between knowledge and attitude scores, and knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.55). There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between attitude scores and practice scores. Health education programs tailored for PLWH and aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practice should be prioritized in the Rwandan COVID-19 response.","output":"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Towards COVID-19 Among People Living with HIV/AIDS in Kigali, Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 1987 we conducted a sero-epidemiological survey in the Murcia Region (South-East Spain) to discover the prevalence and spread of PRCV-infection among breeding pigs and farms and determine the association between herd size and geographical zone with PRCV-infection.

Depression is the most prevalent cause of disability while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best validated behavioral depression treatment. CBT, when combined with mindfulness meditation (CBT-M), has strong evidence for increased efficacy. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated online CBT-M efficacy, comparisons with in-office delivery are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to assess whether online group CBT-M (with standard psychiatric care) is non-inferior in efficacy and more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M at post-intervention and 6-months follow-up in major depressive disorder. The study will also assess whether digitally recorded data (ie, online workbooks completed, Fitbit step count, and online text messages) predict depression symptom reduction in online participants. METHODS: This single-center, two-arm, noninferiority RCT employs assessor-blinded and self-report outcomes and economic evaluation. The research site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto), a research-based psychiatry institution where participants will be identified from service wait lists and through contacts with other Toronto clinics. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) aged 18-60 years, any ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) of mild severity (score 14) with no upper severity limit; (3) Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-confirmed, psychiatric major depressive disorder diagnosis; (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed by staff psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) receipt of weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) observation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) criteria for severe alcohol or substance use disorder (in past 3 months), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia (or other primary psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder; (3) clinically significant suicidal ideation (imminent intent or attempted suicide in the past 6 months); and (4) treatment-resistant depression. All participants receive standard psychiatric care, experimental participants receive online group CBT-M, and controls receive standard care in-office group CBT-M. The online group program (in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc) combines smartphone and computer-accessed workbooks with mental health phone counselling (16 hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates software interactions (eg, secure text messaging and Fitbit-tracked walking). The primary outcome is BDI-II, and secondary outcomes are anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (ie, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), quality of life (European Quality of Life Five Dimension), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory). RESULTS: Based on prior studies with the BDI-II and 80% power to reject an inferiority hypothesis with a 1-sided type I error rate of 5%, a sample of 78 per group is adequate to detect small-to-medium-effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses online CBT-M efficacy and noninferiority in relation to in-person CBT, and the cost-effectiveness of both interventions.

Search terms included \\"vaping, electronic nicotine delivery systems, electronic cigarettes, lung diseases, respiratory diseases, and pulmonary.\\" Original research articles in English that used human subjects between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2020 and reported pulmonary outcomes were included. RESULTS Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 14 (31.1%) randomized experimental, 7 (15.6%) nonrandomized experimental, 6 (13.3%) cohort, and 18 (40.0%) cross-sectional studies. Sixteen (35.6%) studies were conducted in the United States; the rest were conducted across 11 other countries. The total number of subjects was 1,465,292 and ages ranged from 12 to 99 years across studies. Eligible studies demonstrated an association between EC use and pulmonary symptoms, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis and exacerbations. The degree of this association varied based on the use of additional tobacco products. EC use resulted in worse outcomes than nonsmoking, but resulted in improved outcomes when compared with CC use or dual use of CC and EC. CONCLUSION Evidence indicates that EC use, especially dual use, leads to negative pulmonary effects and adverse outcomes. Education on the potential risks and publishing of EC ingredients on labels could help improve public health safety communication and reduce EC use.","output":"Pulmonary Health Effects of Electronic Cigarettes: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visualization recommendation or automatic visualization generation can significantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective data visualizations, especially for those users without a background in data visualizations. However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","output":"KG4Vis: A Knowledge Graph-Based Approach for Visualization Recommendation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with corresponding neurological symptoms the presence of carotid bifurcation macrothrombus should always be considered.

Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. METHODS: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the Parenting During the Pandemic survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5C8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic- linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. FINDINGS: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. INTERPRETATIONS: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent- child relationship disruptions.

The multifactorial aspect of the infection has generated interest in understanding the clinical history of COVID-19, particularly the classification of severity and early prediction on prognosis. Metabolomics is a powerful tool for identifying metabolite signatures when profiling parasitic, metabolic, and microbial diseases. This study undertook a metabolomic approach to identify potential metabolic signatures to discriminate severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19. The secondary aim was to determine whether the clinical and laboratory data from the severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients were compatible with the metabolomic findings. Metabolomic analysis of samples revealed that 43 metabolites from 9 classes indicated COVID-19 severity: 29 metabolites for non-severe and 14 metabolites for severe disease. The metabolites from porphyrin and purine pathways were significantly elevated in the severe disease group, suggesting that they could be potential prognostic biomarkers. Elevated levels of the cholesteryl ester CE (18:3) in non-severe patients matched the significantly different blood cholesterol components (total cholesterol and HDL, both p < 0.001) that were detected. Pathway analysis identified 8 metabolomic pathways associated with the 43 discriminating metabolites. Metabolomic pathway analysis revealed that COVID-19 affected glycerophospholipid and porphyrin metabolism but significantly affected the glycerophospholipid and linoleic acid metabolism pathways (p = 0.025 and p = 0.035, respectively).

Thus, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may mitigate the course of COVID-19. The aim of the study was to estimate the impact of ADT on mortality from COVID-19 in men with prevalent prostate cancer by comparing all-cause mortality in the spring of 2020 to the same time period in previous years. Materials & Methods: All men with prevalent prostate cancer in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) on March 1 each year in 2015-2020 were followed until June 30 the same year. Exposure to ADT was ascertained from filled prescriptions for bicalutamide, Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonists and antagonists (GnRH), and from The Patient Registry data on orchidectomy. The mortality rates by calendar day for each exposure group and calendar time period were calculated and plotted with locally weighted smoothing. Using Poisson regression, the rate of death was compared between 2020 and the average in previous years. Results: 9,822 men with Pca died in March-June in the years 2015-2020, of whom 5,034 men were on ADT. There was an excess mortality in 2020 vs previous years in men on GnRH, bicalutamide and men not on ADT (Figure). The crude relative mortality rate ratio in men on ADT in 2020 vs 2015-2019 was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.95). After multivariable adjustment this ratio was attenuated to 0.96 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.06).

Here we present a temporal analysis of key immune mediators, cytokine and chemokines in blood of hospitalised COVID-19 patients from serial sampling and follow up over four weeks.Methods A total of 71 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing You'an hospital in China with either mild (53 patients) or severe disease (18 patients) were enrolled with 18 healthy volunteers. We measured 34 immune mediators, cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood every 4-7 days over one month per patient using a bio-plex multiplex immunoassay.Results We found that the chemokine RANTES(CCL5) was significantly elevated, from an early stage of the infection, in patients with mild but not severe disease. We also found that early production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly associated with disease severity, and a combination of CCL5, IL-1Ra and IL-10 at week 1 may predict patient outcomes. The majority of cytokines that are known to be associated with the cytokine storm in virus infections such as IL-6 and IFN-gamma were only significantly elevated in the late stage of severe COVID-19 illness. TNF- alpha and GM-CSF showed no significant differences between severe and mild cases.Conclusion Together our data suggest early intervention to increase expression of CCL5 may prevent patients from developing severe illness.

The MAC-RF is an eight-item, self-report scale that has been developed to assess clinically relevant domains of fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. The MAC-RF is based on a comprehensive theoretical model conceptualizing fears during the pandemics as resulting from an interaction of bodily, interpersonal, cognitive, and behavioral experiences. The MAC-RF was administered to a sample of 623 Italian adults from the community aged between 18 and 76 years old (M= 35.67, SD= 12.93), along with a measure of current clinical symptoms. Item response theory analyses demonstrated that each item of the MAC-RF provided sufficient information about the underlying construct of fear. The statistical fit of the scale was satisfactory. MAC-RF total scores correlated significantly and positively with total scores on the measure of psychopathology and with the clinical symptom domain scores. A ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis showed that the MAC-RF total score was sufficiently able to identify cases with high levels of current psychopathology, with an area under the curve of.76.

However, soon it became clear that long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover, it is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed to describe the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the instantaneous reproductive ratio. We then introduce and use entropy-based metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal evolution of a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of the outbreak is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process for a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical interpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for calibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model. Applying the model to the Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19 data-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the instantaneous reproductive ratio.","output":"The dynamics of entropy in the COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acknowledging the need to address fallout from the COVID-19 crisis that it says has exacerbated ?decades-long inequalities? for struggling Californians, the administration of California Gov Gavin Newsom this month released a proposed fiscal 2022 state budget that includes significant investments in mental health care","output":"California governor: COVID-19's effects demand major MH response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses how the Norwegian government has handled the corona pandemic.

Little prior research studied how organizations support engagement specifically in hospitals. OBJECTIVE: We explored what constitutes hospital capacity for engagement. METHODS: We conducted descriptive qualitative interviews and complied with criteria for rigour and reporting in qualitative research. We interviewed patient/family advisors, engagement managers, clinicians and executives at hospitals with high engagement activity, asking them to describe essential resources or processes. We used content analysis and constant comparison to identify themes and corresponding quotes and interpreted findings by mapping themes to two existing frameworks of PE capacity not specific to hospitals. RESULTS: We interviewed 40 patient/family advisors, patient engagement managers, clinicians and corporate executives from nine hospitals (two < 100 beds, four 100 + beds, three teaching). Four over-arching themes about capacity considered essential included resources, training, organizational commitment and staff support. Views were similar across participant and hospital groups. Resources included funding and people dedicated to PE and technology to enable communication and collaboration. Training encompassed initial orientation and project-specific training for patient/family advisors and orientation for new staff and training for existing staff on how to engage with patient/family advisors. Organizational commitment included endorsement from the CEO and Board, commitment from staff and continuous evaluation and improvement. Staff support included words and actions that conveyed value for the role and input of patient/family advisors. The blended, non-hospital-specific framework captured all themes. Hospitals of all types varied in the availability of funding dedicated to PE. In particular, reimbursement of expenses and compensation for time and contributions were not provided to patient/family advisors. In addition to skilled engagement managers, the role of clinician or staff champions was viewed as essential. CONCLUSION: The findings build on prior research that largely focused on PE in individual clinical care or research or in primary care planning and improvement. The findings closely aligned with existing frameworks of organizational capacity for PE not specific to hospital settings, which suggests that hospitals could use the blended framework to plan, evaluate and improve their PE programs. Further research is needed to yield greater insight into how to promote and enable compensation for patient/family advisors and the role of clinician or staff champions in supporting PE.","output":"Organizational capacity for patient and family engagement in hospital planning and improvement: interviews with patient/family advisors, managers and clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Members of the rab/YPT1/SEC4 gene family of small molecular weight GTPases play key roles in the regulation of vesicular traffic between compartments of the exocytic pathway. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that a dominant negative rab1a mutant, rab1a(N124I), defective for guanine nucleotide binding in vitro, leads to the accumulation of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) in numerous pre-cis-Golgi vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters containing rab1 and beta-COP, a subunit of the coatomer complex. Similar to previous observations (Balch et al. 1994. Cell. 76:841-852), VSV-G was concentrated nearly 5-10-fold in vesicular carriers that accumulate in the presence of the rab1a(N124I) mutant. VSV-G containing vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters were also found to accumulate in the presence of a rab1a effector domain peptide mimetic that inhibits endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, as well as in the absence of Ca2+.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed in children with AA who underwent surgery between March 9 and April 13 from 2015 to 2020; patients were divided into six groups according to the year of surgery. We analyzed demographic variables, time from onset of symptoms, mean hospital stay, cumulative incidence, and incidence rate of complicated appendicitis. RESULTS A total of 168 patients were included with no differences in the number of patients, gender, and age between groups. Patients in 2020 (COVID-19 group) presented longer symptom progression time (46.8 hours; p = 0.046), higher rate of complicated appendicitis (48.4%; p = 0.004), longer mean hospital stay (4.9 days; p < 0.001), increased cumulative incidence (8.27 cases per 100,000 children per 0.1 years; p < 0.001), and increased incidence rate of complicated appendicitis (83 cases per 100,000 children; p < 0.001) when compared with other groups.

This basis lies in the new historical (human) situation of the early 21st century. This situation requires the development of modern theoretical models in the humanities and social sciences and a new propaedeuticmodel for their study. This new model must reject the traditions of rememberingand reproducinga certain amount of information by students and provoke their active participation in the educational process. In addition, views on the secondaryand / or even the deathof humanitarian and social knowledge are asserted. That is why this study, especially at the university, is somehow isolated within the educational space. The second problematic area deals with the question of the essence, content and heuristic-propaedeutic possibilities of the reflexive synoptic paradigmatic approach. The position that the paradigmatic approach overcomes the extremes of the other two main approaches in the reflective methodology of scientific knowledge: philosophical-methodological historicism and contextualism is defended by uniting them in a new synopticphilosophical-contextualapproach. This view does not allow to present the theory and history of humanitarian and social knowledge as the chronologyof its existence, nor only as a linear cumulative process of accumulation of ideas or a set of separate contextualanalytical texts, but as a reconstructionwhich presents a theoretical model of the dialectical becomingof the history and theory of humanitarian and social-scientific thought. This model is the means by which the methodological activity and heuristics of the synopticparadigmatic approach are verified, finding expression not only in the elaboration of the general explanatory scheme, but also in revealing the content of the separate theories, which gives huge opportunities for realization not of reproducing, but of mental, creativeresearch and educational process. ? 2021 South-West University Publishing House, Faculty of Philology.

METHODS: Levels of inactive vitamin K-dependent dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP; marker of vitamin K status) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D; vitamin D status) were measured in plasma samples from participants with confirmed acute COVID-19 and were age and sex matched to healthy controls. Unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using cumulative logistic regression. RESULTS: 150 subjects were included, 100 COVID-19+ and 50 controls. Median agewas 55 (IQR: 48, 63), 50% were females. 34% had mild COVID-19 disease, 51% moderate disease, and 15% severe. Dp-ucMGP levels were higher (i.e. worse K status) in COVID-19+ vs controls (776.5 ng/mL vs 549.8 ng/mL, p <0.0001) with similar 25(OH)D between groups (25.8 vs 21.9 ng/mL, p=0.09). Participants who were vitamin D deficient (<20ng/mL) had the worse vitamin K status (dp-ucMGP >780ng/mL) and experienced the most severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Four subjects had pre-existing chronic inflammatory conditions that could have potentially affected the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response. Seven of eight subjects responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides with differences within CD4 + T helper (Th) and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL).

BACKGROUND: There is no evidence regarding the direct effect of virtual patient visits in the ICU. DESIGN: The STROBE statement guided this study. This investigator-initiated, prospective and single-centre study included COVID-19 patients and their relatives in an adult ICU between July and December 2020. We implemented daily sVPVs between all patients and their relatives. The study's primary outcome was the daily anxiety levels of patients and relatives immediately before and after sVPVs. The secondary outcomes were as follows: 1) hospital anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) levels during admission to and after discharge from the ICU and 2) satisfaction levels regarding the ICU and sVPVs of patients' relatives. RESULTS: A total number of 301 daily sVPVs were conducted between 50 patients and their relatives. There was a significant difference between daily anxiety levels before and after sVPVs in both patients (2.97 vs. 1.49) and their relatives (5.70 vs. 3.53; p > .05). Whereas the anxiety levels of patients with basic face or high flow nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation decreased statistically significantly more than those with IMV after a sVPV (p < .001), there was not a significant difference in decreased anxiety levels of patients' relatives according to the type of respiratory support provided to the patient (p > .05). HADS-A levels of relatives decreased statistically significantly after discharge/death. There was no statistically significant difference in HADS-A and HADS-D levels after discharge/death between the relatives of patients who died or did not die (p > .05).

Many techniques to treat this problem have been described, with little supporting evidence. The authors review their experience with laparoscopic removal of eroded gastric bands. METHODS The prospectively collected bariatric surgery database of the authors' practice was queried for the period January 2000 until February 2011, and the medical records for all patients with the diagnosis of band erosion were reviewed. Symptoms, time to erosion, interval between diagnosis and treatment, and complications of treatment were reviewed. All patients had undergone laparoscopy, cut-down onto the band, unclasping or division of the band near the buckle, removal of the band, and primary closure of the gastrotomy with omental patch reinforcement. RESULTS During the study period, 2,097 LAGB operations were performed and 53 (2.53%) of these resulted in intragastric erosion. All the bands placed were LapBands (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA). Erosions occurred with 14 of the 10-cm bands, 11 of the Vanguard bands, 14 of the AP Small bands, and 14 of the AP Large bands. Three patients elected to have their revisional surgery elsewhere and thus were lost to follow-up evaluation. One patient declined to have her band removed. The remaining 49 patients were included in the analysis. The mean time from band placement to the diagnosis of erosion was 31.5 months, and the mean time from diagnosis to band removal was 32 days. The mean hospital stay was 4 days. The complications included one postoperative leak, four superficial wound infections, and one pleural effusion. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrates the safety of laparoscopic removal of eroded gastric bands with primary closure and omental patch repair. The time from diagnosis of erosion to treatment can be short, in contrast to endoscopic removal, in which the requirement for further erosion of the band to free the buckle often necessitates delayed treatment.","output":"Laparoscopic management of gastric band erosions: a 10-year series of 49 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Covid-19 pandemic has already had a definite impact on the daily life of many people worldwide.

However, about 30% of the population report not wanting to be vaccinated. In order to increase the willingness of the population to get vaccinated, data on the acceptance of vaccination and its influencing factors are necessary. Little is known about why individuals refuse the COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons leading to rejecting vaccination, based on posts from three social media sites. METHODS: The German-language versions of Instagram, Twitter and YouTube were searched regarding negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Data was extracted until a saturation effect could be observed. The data included posts created from January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021. This time frame roughly covers the period from the first reports of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 up to the general availability of vaccines against COVID-19 in Germany. We used an interpretive thematic approach to analyze the data and to inductively generate codes, subcategories and categories. RESULTS: Based on 333 posts written by 323 contributing users, we identified six main categories of reasons for refusing a COVID-19 vaccination: Low perceived benefit of vaccination, low perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, health concerns, lack of information, systemic mistrust and spiritual or religious reasons. The analysis reveals a lack of information among users and the spread of misinformation with regard to COVID-19 and vaccination. Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination.

The study was carried out in in two health areas of hospital care in the Madrid region: the central area of the Madrid capital (Hospitales de Madrid del Grupo HM Hospitales (CH-HM), n = 1931) and the metropolitan area of Madrid (Hospital Universitario Prncipe de Asturias (MH-HUPA) n = 1558). By using a regression model, we observed how the different patient variables had unequal importance. Among all the analyzed variables, basal oxygen saturation was found to have the highest relative importance with a value of 20.3%, followed by age (17.7%), lymphocyte/leukocyte ratio (14.4%), CRP value (12.5%), comorbidities (12.5%), and leukocyte count (8.9%). Three levels of risk of ICU/death were established: low-risk level (<5%), medium-risk level (5C20%), and high-risk level (>20%). At the high-risk level, 13% needed ICU admission, 29% died, and 37% had an ICUCdeath outcome. This predictive model allowed us to individualize the risk for worse outcome for hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19.","output":"A Predictive Model and Risk Factors for Case Fatality of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the Wuhan province of China. Rapid global spread led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 has become a vitally important tool in controlling the spread of the virus. Lateral flow devices (LFDs) offer the potential advantage of speed and on-site testing. The sensitivity of these devices compared to the gold standard RT-PCR has been questioned. We compared the performance of the Innova lateral flow kit, recommended by the UK government, with our rapid in-house RT-PCR protocol using stored positive patient samples. The LFD device was found to be 6,000-10,000 times less sensitive than RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the LFD detected 46.2% of the positives detected by RT-PCR. 50% of the LFD results were observed to be weak positives, only visible after careful examination by experienced laboratory staff. At lower viral loads, such as 10,000-100,000 RNA copies/ml, the LFD detected 22.2% of positives. In addition, two strong positives (3 and 1.5 million RNA copies/ml) were not detected by the LFD. The argument for use of LFD kits, despite their lack of sensitivity, is that they detect infectious virus and hence contagious individuals. At present, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting this claim. The LFD used in the UK fails to identify individuals with considerable viral loads and has been subject to a class I recall by the US FDA but is still approved and recommended for use by the UK government. We believe that using LFD testing for assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection risk is a strategy which has risks that outweigh any benefits.","output":"Comparing lateral flow testing with a rapid RT-PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay is a versatile technique, which can be used for several applications.

This article analyses the indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution in Portugal, by comparison of data from a period of movement restriction of the citizens by the government - COVID lockdown period (March-May 2020) with data from baseline conditions (mean of the mirrored periods from the five previous years (March-May from 2015 to 2019)). Air quality data - in particular NO2 and PM10 hourly concentration - from more than 20 monitoring stations spread over mainland Portugal was used to perform this evaluation. The mean reduction observed on pollutant concentrations was higher for NO2 (41%) than for PM10 (18%). For NO2, mean reductions were more significant in traffic (reaching values higher than 60% in some monitoring stations) and background urban sites than in rural stations. The reduction of NO2 concentration observed in traffic sites were compared to the estimation of traffic contribution by the incremental method, suggesting that this latter approach is not consistent (lower in same sites and higher in others) and alerting to the careful use of this approach in future works.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on air quality levels in Portugal: A way to assess traffic contribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to determine if treatment with senicapoc, improves the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in patients with COVID\\\\19 and severe respiratory insufficiency.

Part of the coronavirus challenges is the various spiritual undertones attributed to it in many quarters. Hence, this study seeks to understand the various spiritual undertones attributed to the coronavirus incidence in southwest Nigeria. Methodology: This paper examined the coronavirus pandemic and spirituality sociologically in southwest Nigeria, using secondary and primary data. Secondary data includes a review of literature, social media comments, official records, and newspaper reports. Primary data entails using google form (questionnaire) circulated via social media with 221 responses retrieved and analyzed using the frequency distribution tables and bar charts. Also, a one-sample t-test was used for further statistical analysis. Results: Findings show that rather than attributing coronavirus incidence to spirituality alone, most of the respondents also see it as a public health concern, and precautionary measures should adhere. They see the government ban on social gathering, which affected the religious houses as the right thing to do and not solely targeted as religious houses. However, most believe that religious houses provide 'essential' emotional and spiritual support to the people. Respondents also believe they can get their healing from their place of worship even if infected with the coronavirus. Conclusion: Based on the findings it was recommended that religious organizations should source valid data so that policy-makers can make informed decisions. Also, there is a need to have an accurate record of the number of infected persons and death rates to know the right time to ease lockdown and lift the social gathering measures. There should also be a place for easy and free testing for people. This will help the government ascertain the number of infected persons, reduce the associated fear with the pandemic, and lessen the people's economic, social, and religious effects.","output":"Coronavirus pandemic and spirituality in southwest Nigeria: A sociological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This article explores the workplace stresses faced by home working (HW) employees in the COVID-19 outbreak; what strategies human resource manager (HRM) may deal with the present circumstances.

Dislocation is a severe and frequent complication in this group, and dual mobility cups (DMC) were developed to reduce the risk of dislocation after THA. The DUALITY trial investigates whether the use of DMC in FNF patients treated with a THA reduces the risk of dislocation. Patients and methods  The trial is a national, multicenter, register-based, randomized controlled trial (rRCT). Patients  65 years with a non-pathological, displaced FNF (Type Garden 3C4/AO 31-B2 or B3) who are suitable for a THA according to local guidelines are assessed for eligibility using the web-based registration platform of the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR). 1,600 patients will be randomized 1:1 to either insertion of a DMC (intervention group) or a standard cup (control group). The study is pragmatic in that the choice of implant brands, surgical approach, and peri- and postoperative protocols follow the local routines of each participating unit. All outcome variables will be retrieved after linkage of the study cohort obtained from the SFR with the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and the National Patient Register. Outcomes  The primary outcome is the occurrence of any dislocation of the index joint treated with closed or open reduction within 1 year after surgery, expressed as a relative risk when comparing groups, and a risk reduction of at least 45% is considered clinically relevant. Secondary outcomes are the relative risk of any reoperation of the index joint, periprosthetic joint infection, and mortality within 90 days and 1 year. Patient-reported outcomes and health economics are evaluated. Start of trial and estimated duration  The DUALITY trial started recruiting patients in January 2020 and will continue for approximately 5 years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient flows, patient pathways and use of hospital resources during the pandemic were simulated using a discrete event simulation model and patient-level data from a large French comprehensive cancer centre's discharge database, considering two scenarios of delays: massive return of patients from November 2020 (early-return) or March 2021 (late-return). Expected additional cancer deaths at 5 years and mortality rate were estimated using individual hazard ratios based on literature. RESULTS: The number of patients requiring hospital care during the simulation period was 13,000. In both scenarios, 6C8% of patients were estimated to present a delay of >2 months. The overall additional cancer deaths at 5 years were estimated at 88 in early-return and 145 in late-return scenario, with increased additional deaths estimated for sarcomas, gynaecological, liver, head and neck, breast cancer and acute leukaemia. This represents a relative additional cancer mortality rate at 5 years of 4.4 and 6.8% for patients expected in year 2020, 0.5 and 1.3% in 2021 and 0.5 and 0.5% in 2022 for each scenario, respectively.

Despite the growing use of electronic health records (EHRs) by medical practitioners and wearable digital gadgets by individuals, 80% of health and medical data remain unused, adding little value to the work of researchers and medical practitioners. Legislative constraints related to health data sharing, centralized siloed design of traditional data management systems, and most importantly, lack of incentivization models are thought to be the underpinning bottlenecks for sharing health data. With the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) and the development of technologies like blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), it is now possible to create a new paradigm of data sharing by changing the incentivization model from current authoritative or altruistic form to a shared economic model where financial incentivization will be the main driver for data sharing.

Data inaccuracies provide false information to the media, undermine global response and hinder the preventive measures taken by authorities. METHODS: Daily new cases and deaths from all the countries of the European Union were analyzed and the conformance to Benford's distribution was estimated. Two statistical tests and two measures of deviation were calculated to determine whether the reported statistics comply with the expected distribution. Four country-level developmental indexes were included, the GDP per capita, health expenditures, the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Index and the full vaccination rate. Regression analysis was implemented to examine whether the deviation from Benford's distribution is affected by the aforementioned indexes. RESULTS: The findings indicate that Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania and Romania were in line with Benford's distribution. Regarding daily cases, Denmark, Ireland and Greece, showed the greatest deviation from Benford's distribution. Furthermore, it was found that the vaccination rate is positively associated with deviation from Benford's distribution.

In an effort to contain the disease, the National Health Service has adopted a digital first approach in UK general practice resulting in a significant shift away from face-to-face consultations. Consequently, more consultations are being completed without obtaining objective recording of vital signs and face-to-face examination. Some regions have formed hot hubs to facilitate the review of suspected COVID-19 cases and keep their practice site 'clean' including the use of doorstep observations in avoiding the risk of face-to-face examination. To support the safe, effective and efficient remote assessment of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19, we established a doorstep assessment service to compliment telephone and video consultations. This allows physiological parameters such as temperature, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation to be obtained to guide further triage. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate and optimise the doorstep assessment and measure the improvements made. The introduction of a doorstep assessment service increased the proportion of assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 in routine care over weeks. At the same time we were able to dramatically reduce face-to-face assessment over a 6-week period by optimising through a range of measures including the introduction of a digital stethoscope. The majority of patients were managed by their own general practitioner following assessment supporting continuity of care. There were no adverse events during the period of observation; no staff absences related to COVID-19.

Here, approximately 14 months into the pandemic, we report survey results to understand how the delivery of cancer care has changed in SSA. Methods: We created a global consortium of cancer specialist from Africa and North America to collect data related to COVID-19 and cancer care in SSA. This abstract represents the results of a survey to consortium members, and other colleagues, from 8 cancer centers in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe. The survey was completed in February 2021. Results: All sites report relatively low rates of confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection (range, 0-83 cases) with a wide range in the case fatality rate (0-50%). With a median duration of 2.3 months (IQR.9-4.2 months), all sites report a temporary lock down with no (12.5%), minimal (12.5%), moderate (50%) and severe (25%) impact on patient care. Examples of this impact include intra-city travel restrictions (25%), inter-city travel restrictions (62.5%), and excessive patient travel costs (75%). Most sites report changes in radiation therapy (RT) delivery strategies including transition to hypofractionation (50%), selection of single fraction RT for metastasis palliation (62.5%), deferral of RT for low-risk adjuvant situations (37.5%), or no change (25%). Changes in chemotherapy delivery strategies include transition to oral options (37.5%), use of hormone therapy over chemotherapy (37.5%), deferral of palliative chemotherapy (50%), and delivery of RT without concurrent chemotherapy (12.5%), or no change (50%). A total 3 sites (37.5%) reported the existence of breast or cervical cancer screening programs prior to the pandemic. Only one site reported return to pre-pandemic levels of cancer screening. HPV vaccination programs were active at 2 sites prior to the pandemic with only partial recovery at one site. Conclusions: The pandemic has challenged cancer patients despite relatively low rates of reported infection and death.

In addition, the background and availability of faculty members who are able to lead courses on psychodynamic psychotherapy within a given program are varied and may change from year to year depending on faculty departure or hiring. The goals of this project were threefold: 1) research and highlight which psychodynamic topics are most important for child and adolescent psychiatry residents in training;2) create a curriculum that can be taught over time even as faculty availability within an institution shifts;and 3) teach the course to residents and gather data on the outcomes in order to maintain a dynamic approach consistent with developments in the field. Methods: In collaboration with a mentor from the AACAP Psychodynamic Faculty Training and Mentorship Initiative (PFTMI), Laura Prager, MD, Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, we developed an 8-week psychodynamic therapy course of 60-minute classes. Each week was divided roughly into three 20-minute segments: a didactic lecture on the topic for the week, review of the readings for the week, and an interactive activity. In order to select the weekly topics, a literature review of select historical and contemporary readings was conducted in order to elicit which topics were most prevalent. The residents were surveyed before and after each class to assess their level of familiarity with the concepts presented and the likelihood of their using psychodynamic psychotherapy with patients. Results: Preclass assessment revealed that the residents were unfamiliar with psychodynamic topics and did not feel they would use these techniques with patients. Participation and engagement were high. Postclass assessment revealed increased confidence in understanding concepts and an increased likelihood that residents would employ psychodynamic therapy techniques in their treatment of children and adolescents. Conclusions: The strengths of the course included active engagement, strong attendance, and high satisfaction. The challenges were related to the COVID-19 pandemic that required changing the interactive activity to an online format, and unforeseen shifts in the department's academic schedule that precluded offering this course a second time.

However, a minority suffers from critical disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To identify individuals at risk of critical COVID-19, the relevance of a seroreactivity against seasonal human coronaviruses was analyzed. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center non-interventional study comprising 296 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from four tertiary care referral centers in Germany and France. The ICU group comprised more males, whereas the outpatient group contained a higher percentage of females. For each patient, the serum or plasma sample obtained closest after symptom onset was examined by immunoblot regarding IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1. RESULTS: Median age was 60 years (range 18-96). Patients with critical disease (n=106) had significantly lower levels of anti-HCoV OC43 nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific antibodies compared to other COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.007). In multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, sex and BMI), OC43 negative inpatients had an increased risk of critical disease (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.68 [95% CI 1.09 - 7.05]), higher than the risk by increased age or BMI, and lower than the risk by male sex. A risk stratification based on sex and OC43 serostatus was derived from this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prior infections with seasonal human coronaviruses can protect against a severe course of COVID-19. Therefore, anti-OC43 antibodies should be measured for COVID-19 inpatients and considered as part of the risk assessment for each patient. Hence, we expect individuals tested negative for anti-OC43 antibodies to particularly benefit from vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, especially with other risk factors prevailing.","output":"Lack of antibodies against seasonal coronavirus OC43 nucleocapsid protein identifies patients at risk of critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of health crisis, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, the potential benefit of botanical drugs and supplements emerges as a focus of attention, although controversial efficacy claims are rightly a concern.

Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","output":"Molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 structural genes: evidence of positive selection in spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent fourth industrial revolution and the era of post-COVID-19 have ushered in a series of technologies including a 5G network and online systems, such as cloud computing technology.

Our study investigates the associations between s-Klotho and several established inflammatory biomarkers, with the aim of examining whether s-Klotho levels are representative of inflammatory states. METHODS: A total of 11,128 eligible participants from NHANES 2007C2016 were included in our study. Levels of four inflammatory biomarkers, uric acid (UA), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and mean platelet volume (MPV), were examined for their relationship with s-Klotho levels. Sub-analyses sorted the total population by gender and into four quartiles. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the strengths of associations. RESULTS: All four inflammatory biomarkers were significantly associated with s-Klotho levels. UA, CRP, and WBC count showed an inverse association, while MPV showed a direct one. Of the four markers, UA was most strongly correlated with s-Klotho levels ( coefficient: ?28.89 in unadjusted model, p<.001), and this relationship was stronger in women than in men ( coefficient of UA in men: ?22.01, p<.001; in women: ?31.54, p<.001). In addition, all four biomarkers manifested stronger associations with s-Klotho in higher quartiles, and the highest absolute values of  coefficients appeared in Q4 vs. Q1. CONCLUSION: s-Klotho is significantly associated with well-recognized inflammatory biomarkers. A decrease in s-Klotho levels implies a general inflammatory status; therefore, s-Klotho serves as a potential biomarker that is inversely correlated with inflammatory conditions. Further applications in clinical practice will provide us with a better understanding of its role. KEY MESSAGES: Soluble -Klotho (s-Klotho) levels are significantly associated with the inflammatory markers uric acid, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and mean platelet volume. S-Klotho is involved in inflammatory processes and plays a protective role.

To investigate the outbreak, we analysed surveillance and other data available at the district health department, including data on cases living in care facilities and public health measures applied. Furthermore, we compared the number of tests performed in Tirschenreuth and in Germany as a whole. We interviewed the first 110 cases in order to investigate potential exposures at the beginning of the outbreak. We found that returning ski-travellers from Austria and Italy and early undetected community transmission likely initiated the outbreak which was then accelerated by Bavarian beer festivities. Testing of mainly acute cases in the district of Tirschenreuth resulted in a higher rate of positive tests compared to the whole of Germany. Despite adjustment for age, the CFR continued to exceed the German mean which was due to spread to vulnerable populations.

Low-income students are identified by whether they ever received the federal Pell Grant. We find that low-income college students were 8% more likely than general students at the same college to experience challenges while attending online classes during spring 2020 mostly due to higher childcare responsibilities, greater lack of internet, or greater probability of being sick or stressed.

Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have been used to improve these domains. However, there is no consensus on how to measure lifestyle and its intermediate outcomes aside from measuring each behavior separately. We aimed to describe (1) the most frequent lifestyle domains addressed by DHIs, (2) the most frequent outcomes used to measure lifestyle changes, and (3) the most frequent DHI delivery methods. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-ScR) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for publications since 2010. We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials using DHI to promote health, behavioral, or lifestyle change. Results: Overall, 954 records were identified, and 72 systematic reviews were included. Of those, 35 conducted meta-analyses, 58 addressed diet/nutrition, and 60 focused on PA. Only one systematic review evaluated all six lifestyle domains simultaneously; 1 systematic review evaluated five lifestyle domains; 5 systematic reviews evaluated 4 lifestyle domains; 14 systematic reviews evaluated 3 lifestyle domains; and the remaining 52 systematic reviews evaluated only one or two domains. The most frequently evaluated domains were diet/nutrition and PA. The most frequent DHI delivery methods were smartphone apps and websites. Discussion: The concept of lifestyle is still unclear and fragmented, making it hard to evaluate the complex interconnections of unhealthy behaviors, and their impact on health. Clarifying this concept, refining its operationalization, and defining the reporting guidelines should be considered as the current research priorities. DHIs have the potential to improve lifestyle at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of preventionbut most of them are targeting clinical populations. Although important advances have been made to evaluate DHIs, some of their characteristics, such as the rate at which they become obsolete, will require innovative research designs to evaluate long-term outcomes in health.","output":"What Are We Measuring When We Evaluate Digital Interventions for Improving Lifestyle?

We report measurements of aerosol and droplet concentrations generated when playing woodwind and brass instruments and comparisons with breathing, speaking, and singing. These measurements were conducted in a room with zero number concentration aerosol background in the 0.5-20 m diameter size range, allowing clear attribution of detected particles to specific activities. A total of 13 instruments were examined across 9 participants. Respirable particle number concentrations and size distributions for playing instruments are consistent with those from the participant when breathing, based on measurements with multiple participants playing the flute and piccolo as well as measurements across the entire cohort. Due to substantial interparticipant variability, we do not provide a comparative assessment of the aerosol generated by playing different instruments, instead considering only the variation in aerosol yield across all instruments studied. Both particle number and mass concentrations from playing instruments are lower than those from speaking and singing at high volume, and no large droplets &gt;20 m diameter are detected. Combined, these observations suggest that playing instruments generates less aerosol than speaking or singing at high volumes. Moreover, there is no difference between the aerosol concentrations generated by professional and amateur performers while breathing, speaking, or singing, suggesting conclusions for professional singers may also apply to amateurs.

A laparoscopic palliative subtotal gastrectomy with a subtotal colectomy was performed. All anastomoses were performed intracorporeally and colectomy and subtotal gastrectomy specimens were successfully delivered via trans-anal route without any difficulty. Despite major abdominal organ resections, the patients required quite less analgesics in the postoperative period.

SARS-CoV mainly infects tissues of non-lymphatic origin, and the cytokine profile of those cells can determine the course of disease. Here, we investigated the cytokine response of two human non-lymphatic cell lines, Caco-2 and HEK 293, which are fully permissive for SARS-CoV. RESULTS: A comparison with established cytokine-inducing viruses revealed that SARS-CoV only weakly triggered a cytokine response. In particular, SARS-CoV did not activate significant transcription of the interferons IFN-, IFN-, IFN-1, IFN-2/3, as well as of the interferon-induced antiviral genes ISG56 and MxA, the chemokine RANTES and the interleukine IL-6. Interestingly, however, SARS-CoV strongly induced the chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 in the colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2, but not in the embryonic kidney cell line 293. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV suppresses the antiviral cytokine system of non-immune cells to a large extent, thus buying time for dissemination in the host. However, synthesis of IP-10 and IL-8, which are established markers for acute-stage SARS, escapes the virus-induced silencing at least in some cell types. Therefore, the progressive infiltration of immune cells into the infected lungs observed in SARS patients could be due to the production of these chemokines by the infected tissue cells.","output":"Inhibition of cytokine gene expression and induction of chemokine genes in non-lymphatic cells infected with SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with IBD are considered immunosuppressed, but do not seem more vulnerable for COVID-19. Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD. We collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed. In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders. Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon.

The key idea is to infer counterfactual strain specific placebo case counts by using surveillance data that provide the proportions of the different strains. This blending of clinical trial and observational data allows estimation of strain\\\\specific time varying vaccine efficacy, or sieve effects, including for strains that emerge after placebo vaccination. The key requirements are that the surveillance strain distribution accurately reflects the strain distribution for a placebo group throughout follow\\\\up after placebo group vaccination, and that at least one strain is present before and after placebo vaccination. For illustration, we develop a Poisson approach for an idealized design under a rare disease assumption and then use a proportional hazards model to address staggered entry, staggered crossover, and smoothly varying strain specific vaccine efficacy.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative survey was conducted of 429 US/US territory\\\\based IM PDs from August to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hazard pay provision and PD beliefs about hazard pay were tested for association with factors related to the pandemic surge and program characteristics. RESULTS: Response rate was 61.5% (264/429); 19.5% of PDs reported hazard pay provision. PD belief about hazard pay was equivocal: 33.2% agreed, 43.1% disagreed, and 23.7% were uncertain. Hazard pay occurred more commonly in the Middle\\\\Atlantic Census Division (including New York City) and with earlier surges and greater resident participation in COVID\\\\19 patient care.

The most devasting influenza A virus (IAV) in IV, pandemic H1N1 in 1918, which caused at least 40 million deaths from about 500 million cases of infection, was the first recorded emergence of IAVs in humans. Usually, a novel human-adapted virus replaces the preexisting human-adapted virus. Interestingly, two IAV subtypes, A/H3N2/1968 and A/H1N1/2009 variants, and two lineages of influenza B viruses (IBV) in IV, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage-like viruses, remain seasonally detectable in humans. Both influenza C viruses (ICVs) in IV and four human CoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in CoV and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in CoV, usually cause mild respiratory infections. Much attention has been given to CoVs since the global epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2002C2004 and MERS-CoV from 2012 to present. SARS-CoV-2, which is causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in 890,392 deaths from about 27 million cases of infection as of 8 September 2020, has provoked worldwide investigations of CoVs. With the aim of developing efficient strategies for controlling virus outbreaks and recurrences of seasonal virus variants, here we overview the structures, diversities, host ranges and host receptors of all IVs and CoVs and critically review current knowledge of receptor binding specificity of spike glycoproteins, which mediates infection, of IVs and of zoonotic, pandemic and seasonal CoVs.","output":"Host Receptors of Influenza Viruses and CoronavirusesMolecular Mechanisms of Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurologic events have been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, a model-based evaluation of the spatial distribution of these events is lacking. PURPOSE: Our aim was to quantitatively evaluate whether a network diffusion model can explain the spread of small neurologic events. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LitCovid data bases were searched from January 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-five case series and case studies reported 317 small neurologic events in 123 unique patients with COVID-19. DATA ANALYSIS: Neurologic events were localized to gray or white matter regions of the Illinois Institute of Technology (gray-matter and white matter) Human Brain Atlas using radiologic images and descriptions. The total proportion of events was calculated for each region. A network diffusion model was implemented, and any brain regions showing a significant association (P < .05, family-wise error-corrected) between predicted and measured events were considered epicenters. DATA SYNTHESIS: Within gray matter, neurologic events were widely distributed, with the largest number of events (a10%) observed in the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices, respectively. Network diffusion modeling showed a significant association between predicted and measured gray matter events when the spread of pathology was seeded from the bilateral cerebellum (r = 0.51, P < .001, corrected) and putamen (r = 0.4, P = .02, corrected). In white matter, most events (a26%) were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. LIMITATIONS: The risk of bias was not considered because all studies were either case series or case studies.

Limited information about T. gondii infection in bats is available in China. The objective of the present study was to determine prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii infection in bats in Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, China. METHODS: During May 2005 to August 2013, bats were sampled from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, China, and liver tissues were collected for the detection of T. gondii by a nested PCR targeting the B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5-and 3-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and Apico) using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A total of 626 bats representing 10 species were examined for T. gondii infection, 38 (6.1%) were tested positive with by PCR, 8 positive DNA samples were completely genotyped, of which 3 samples (2 from Cynopterus sphinx, and 1 from Murina leucogaster) represented ToxoDB#10, and 5 samples (2 from Murina leucogaster, 2 from Myotis chinensis, and 1 from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) belonged to ToxoDB#9 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/).

Here, we review: (1) common barriers to healthcare access (shortage/cost of services; physician awareness; stigma); (2) barriers encountered primarily during childhood (limited screening/diagnosis; unclear referral pathways), transition to adulthood (insufficient healthcare transition services; suboptimal physician awareness of healthcare needs) and adulthood (shortage of services/limited insurance; communication difficulties with physicians; limited awareness of healthcare needs of aging adults); and (3) advances in research/program development for better healthcare access. A robust understanding of barriers to accessing healthcare across the lifespan of autistic individuals is critical to ensuring the best use of healthcare resources to improve social, physical, and mental health outcomes. Stakeholders must strengthen healthcare service provision by coming together to: better understand healthcare needs of underserved populations; strengthen medical training on care of autistic individuals; increase public awareness of ASD; promote research into/uptake of tools for ASD screening, diagnosis, and treatment; understand specific healthcare needs of autistic individuals in lower resource countries; and conduct longitudinal studies to understand the lifetime health, social, and economic impacts of ASD and enable the evaluation of novel approaches to increasing healthcare access. IMPACT: Despite the growing body of evidence, our understanding of barriers to healthcare encountered by individuals with ASD remains limited, particularly beyond childhood and in lower resource countries. We describe current and emerging barriers to healthcare access encountered by individuals with ASD across the lifespan.

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) may mediate this inflammatory cascade after RT. Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat hypertension and has good blood-brain barrier penetration. By blocking RAS activation, ramipril reduces neuro-inflammation and preclinical data show that ramipril administration during RT can prevent RICD. METHODS: WF-1801 is an ongoing feasibility study that will enroll a total of 75 patients. Patients  18 with newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed GBM who will receive chemoradiation are eligible. All participants take ramipril daily during RT and for 4 months thereafter. Ramipril is titrated from 1.25mg to 5mg daily over 3 weeks. A cognitive battery that includes the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA) is administered at baseline, end of RT, and 1-month and 4-months post-RT. The co-primary endpoints are retention rate (with retention defined as compliance with > 75% of drug therapy doses) and neurocognitive function at 1-month post-RT. To estimate the effect of ramipril on cognitive function, performance on the cognitive battery will be compared to a historical control (cognitive data from the control arm of RTOG 0825). ApoE genotyping is being performed as a correlative study. RESULTS: 31 of a planned 75 participants have been enrolled over 14 months. 20 of 31 (64.5%) are male. 21 (67.7%) are between the age of 40-64. 20 (95.6%) are white and 29 (93.6%) are not Hispanic or Latino. CONCLUSION: Despite a pause in accrual due to COVID-19, we are easily meeting planned accrual goals.

RESULTS: We found that anxiety had a direct effect on people's concerns about safety (?=-.12, 95% CI -.20 to -.05) and hygiene in hospitals (?=.16, 95% CI .08 to .23). Risk-taking behaviors and personality traits were not associated with concerns about safety and hygiene in hospitals or anticipated behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that distinct interventions and information campaigns are not necessary for individuals with different personality traits or different levels of risk-taking behavior. However, we recommend that health care workers should carefully address anxiety when interacting with patients.","output":"Antecedents of Individuals' Concerns Regarding Hospital Hygiene and Surgery Postponement During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional, Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns and other preventive measures taken to curb the spread of diseases such as COVID-19 have restricted the use of face-to-face cognitive assessment.

Our aim was to evaluate the suitability of online, examiner-mediated administration of an open-access battery of executive function tests (the Free Research Executive Evaluation battery, or FREE) that can be adapted considering various characteristics of diverse populations and therefore used worldwide. A total of 96 9C15-year olds (42 girls) were tested, half of whom online through video calls mediated by an examiner. Their performance was compared to that of the other 48 individuals tested face-to-face, who were matched against the online-tested participants for age, pubertal status, sex, and parental schooling. The battery consists of two tests of the following executive domains: Updating (2-Back and Number Memory tests), Inhibition (Stroop Victoria and Stroop Happy-Sad), and Switching (Color Shape and Category Switch). Answers were vocal and self-paced, and the examiner recorded accuracy and time taken to complete in-person and online tasks. Only free software is needed for the assessment. Executive measures obtained from the tasks did not differ statistically between online and in-person tested participants and effects sizes of group effects were small, thus showing that the FREE test battery holds promise for online cognitive assessment, pending confirmation in different samples and further validation studies.","output":"Feasibility of Remote Performance Assessment Using the Free Research Executive Evaluation Test Battery in Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy is the European country that was hit first and hardest by the COVID-19 epidemic.

These changes, collectively termed immune senescence, encompass alterations in both the innate and adaptive immune systems, in the microenvironments where immune cells develop or reside, and in soluble factors that guide immune homeostasis and function. While age-related changes in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow, and, in particular, the thymus, which involutes in the first third of life) have been long appreciated, changes affecting aging secondary lymphoid organs, and, in particular, aging lymph nodes (LNs) have been less well characterized. Over the last 20 years, LN stromal cells have emerged as key players in maintaining LN morphology and immune homeostasis, as well as in coordinating immune responses to pathogens. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the contributions of LN stromal cells to immune senescence.

While most individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, approximately 5% develop severe forms of COVID-19 characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure (MOF) that usually require intensive-care support and often yield a poor prognosis. SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is far from being completely understood, and the lack of effective treatments leads to a sense of urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies based on pathophysiological assumptions. The exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection, a condition known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm, is emerging as the mechanism leading to ARDS and MOF in COVID-19, thus endorsing the hypothesis that properly timed anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies could improve patients' clinical outcomes and prognosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of perioperative subclinical vitamin K deficiency among neurosurgical patients using PIVKA-II and investigate the existence of any correlation to standard coagulation assays. Also, the antitumor effects of vitamin K were reviewed. Thirty-five patients undergoing brain tumor resection were included. Blood samples were drawn preoperatively, at the end of surgery and in the morning after surgery. In addition to PIVKA-II, factor II and the Owren and Quick prothrombin times were analyzed. Seventeen of 35 patients had elevated PIVKA-II levels before surgery, which continued to be above normal range postoperatively. Median PIVKA-II and Owren prothrombin time (PT-INR) were increased on the morning day 1 postoperatively compared to before surgery, whereas Quick end-stage prothrombin time (EPT) decreased and factor II was unaffected. Postoperative complications were connected to high PIVKA-II increases. Positive correlations between PIVKA-II and factor II and body mass index (BMI) were found. In conclusion, PIVKA-II was increased in many patients preoperatively and then increased by the morning following surgery. Standard coagulation assays were largely non-pathological. Correlations were demonstrated between PIVKA-II and factor II and BMI.

Careful physical examination, appropriate use of diagnostic tools, and accurate interpretation and correlation of test results are important for piecing together the puzzle of a patient with altered mental status that emergency physicians commonly face. In certain cases, such as this one, rapid diagnosis and management is crucial for improving patient morbidity and mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old male with altered mental status and respiratory failure presented to the emergency department after being found unconscious on his porch. Vital signs were notable for temperature 105.5 F, blood pressure 202/102 millimeters of mercury, pulse 126 beats per minute, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Physical examination revealed an obese male lying in bed awake in severe distress with labored breathing and unable to converse. His physical examination was significant for dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and bilateral lower extremity 1+ pitting edema. He also appeared to have Kussmaul respirations with severe tachypnea, but his breath sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally. On further examination, the patient appeared to have intravenous (IV) injection markings along his arms suggesting the possibility of IV drug use. DISCUSSION: With limited history, the only context clues initially available to assist in the diagnosis were abnormal vital signs and physical examination. The patient was tachycardic, hyperthermic, hypertensive, hypoxic, and tachypneic with altered mental status; he eventually required endotracheal intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. The complexity of his condition prompted a large list for the differential diagnoses. Toxidromes, endocrine abnormalities, infectious process, cardiac and/or renal etiologies, and neurological pathology such as a cerebrovascular accident were considered.

The RNA secondary structure is a functional characteristic of RNA viruses, and together with the accumulated high-throughput sequencing data could provide general insights towards understanding virus biology. Here, we profiled the RNA secondary structure of > 7000 complete viral genomes from 11 different species focusing on viral hemorrhagic fevers, including DENV serotypes, EBOV, and YFV. RESULTS: In our work we demonstrated that the secondary structure and presence of protein-binding domains in the genomes can be used as intrinsic signature to further classify the viruses. With our predictive approach, we achieved high prediction scores of the secondary structure (AUC up to 0.85 with experimental data), and computed consensus secondary structure profiles using hundreds of in silico models. We observed that viruses show different structural patterns, where e.g., DENV-2 and Ebola virus tend to be less structured than the other viruses. Furthermore, we observed virus-specific correlations between secondary structure and the number of interaction sites with human proteins, reaching a correlation of 0.89 in the case of Zika virus. We also identified that helicases-encoding regions are more structured in several flaviviruses, while the regions encoding for the contact proteins exhibit virus-specific clusters in terms of RNA structure and potential protein-RNA interactions. We also used structural data to study the geographical distribution of DENV, finding a significant difference between DENV-3 from Asia and South-America, where the structure is also driving the clustering more than sequence identity, which could imply different evolutionary routes of this subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Our massive computational analysis provided novel results regarding the secondary structure and the interaction with human proteins, not only for DENV serotypes, but also for other flaviviruses and viral hemorrhagic fevers-associated viruses. We showed how the RNA secondary structure can be used to categorise viruses, and even to further classify them based on the interaction with proteins. We envision that these approaches can be used to further classify and characterise these complex viruses.

We considered 28,389,098 Medicare and dual-eligible recipients from one year before February 29, 2020 through September 30, 2020, with mortality followed through November 30(th), 2020. Probable and confirmed Covid-19 diagnoses, presumably mostly symptomatic, were determined from ICD-10 codes. We developed a Risk Stratification Index (RSI) mortality model which was applied prospectively to establish baseline mortality risk. Excess deaths attributable to Covid-19 were estimated by comparing actual-to-expected deaths based on historical (2017C2019) comparisons and in closely matched concurrent (2020) cohorts with and without Covid-19. Overall, 677,100 (2.4%) beneficiaries had confirmed Covid-19 and 2,917,604 (10.3%) had probable Covid-19. A total of 472,329 confirmed cases were community living and 204,771 were in LTC. Mortality following a probable or confirmed diagnosis in the community increased from an expected incidence of about 4.0% to actual incidence of 7.5%. In long-term care facilities, the corresponding increase was from 20.3% to 24.6%. The absolute increase was therefore similar at 3C4% in the community and in LTC residents. The percentage increase was far greater in the community (89.5%) than among patients in chronic care facilities (21.1%) who had higher baseline risk of mortality. The LTC population without probable or confirmed Covid-19 diagnoses experienced 38,932 excess deaths (34.8%) compared to historical estimates. Limitations in access to Covid-19 testing and disease under-reporting in LTC patients probably were important factors, although social isolation and disruption in usual care presumably also contributed. Remarkably, there were 31,360 (5.4%) fewer deaths than expected in community dwellers without probable or confirmed Covid-19 diagnoses.

Flavonoids exist in many diets as well as in traditional medicine, and their modern subset, indole-chalcones, are effective in fighting various diseases. Hence, these flavonoids and structurally similar indole chalcones derivatives were studied in silico for their pharmacokinetic properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties against their proteins, namely, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (rdrp), main protease (Mpro) and Spike (S) protein via homology modelling and docking. Interactions were studied with respect to biology and function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins for activity. Functional/structural roles of amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, the effect of flavonoid and indole chalcone interactions which may cause disease suppression are discussed. The results reveal that out of 23 natural flavonoids and 25 synthetic indole chalcones, 30 compounds are capable of Mpro deactivation as well as potentially lowering the efficiency of Mpro function. Cyanidin may inhibit RNA polymerase function and, Quercetin is found to block interaction sites on the viral spike. These results suggest flavonoids and their modern pharmaceutical cousins, indole chalcones are capable of fighting SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of these 30 compounds needs to be studied further for complete understanding and confirmation of their inhibitory potential.","output":"In silico pharmacokinetic and molecular docking studies of natural flavonoids and synthetic indole chalcones against essential proteins of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discuss the impact of a Covid-19Clike shock on a simple model economy, described by the previously developed Mark-0 Agent-Based Model.

We find that both policies are effective if strong enough. We highlight the potential danger of terminating these policies too early, although inflation is substantially increased by lax access to credit. Finally, we consider the impact of a second lockdown.

The rate of first attempt success in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) is typically less than 90%. The bougie, a semirigid introducer that can be placed into the trachea to facilitate a Seldinger-like technique of tracheal intubation and is typically reserved for difficult or failed intubations, might improve first attempt success. Evidence supporting its use, however, is from a single academic ED with frequent bougie use. Validation of these findings is needed before widespread implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The BOugie or stylet in patients Undergoing Intubation Emergently trial is a prospective, multicentre, non-blinded randomised trial being conducted in six EDs and six ICUs in the USA. The trial plans to enrol 1106 critically ill adults undergoing orotracheal intubation. Eligible patients are randomised 1:1 for the use of a bougie or use of an endotracheal tube with stylet for the first intubation attempt. The primary outcome is successful intubation on the first attempt. The secondary outcome is severe hypoxaemia, defined as an oxygen saturation less than 80% between induction until 2 min after completion of intubation. Enrolment began on 29 April 2019 and is expected to be completed in 2021.

A diversity of treatment options as well as a rising population require novel diagnostic tools. The main goal of the research was to develop a novel complex colorectal cancer decision support system based on artificial intelligence. The developed system can classify eight classes of tissue and can identify the malignant areas. In order to allow the easiest and most intuitive interaction with clinicians, the corresponding application was also built. ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and ranks third worldwide in diagnosed malignant pathologies (1.36 million new cases annually). An increase in the diversity of treatment options as well as a rising population require novel diagnostic tools. Current diagnostics involve critical human thinking, but the decisional process loses accuracy due to the increased number of modulatory factors involved. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis system analyses each colonoscopy and provides predictions that will help the clinician to make the right decisions. Artificial intelligence is included in the system both offline and online image processing tools. Aiming to improve the diagnostic process of colon cancer patients, an application was built that allows the easiest and most intuitive interaction between medical staff and the proposed diagnosis system. The developed tool uses two networks. The first, a convolutional neural network, is capable of classifying eight classes of tissue with a sensitivity of 98.13% and an F1 score of 98.14%, while the second network, based on semantic segmentation, can identify the malignant areas with a Jaccard index of 75.18%.

A series of interventions were examined: administration of antiviral drugs by two approaches [targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) and school-age targeted antiviral prophylaxis (STAP)], school closure, restraint, and combinations of these four interventions. METHODS: In order to generate a more realistic situation, we constructed an individual-based model (IBM) for the transmission of influenza in which each individual was assigned personal information on the basis of the National Census and Employment Status Survey of Sapporo city. In addition, data on high-risk casual contact groups commuting in crowded trains and buses were obtained from a census on transportation modes and introduced into the model. Observational data from previous pandemics were used for the epidemiological parameters. RESULTS: Both TAP and STAP interventions were highly effective in suppressing the spread of infection during the early period of an outbreak, but STAP was inferior to TAP in terms of the ripple effect of the administration of antiviral drugs. School closure and restraint were able to bring about a delay in the peak of infection. The combination of TAP, school closure, and restraint interventions were highly effective in decreasing the total number of patients and shortening the epidemic period.

ABSTRACT: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the treatment of choice for BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although TKIs have substantially improved prognosis of CML patients, their use is not free of adverse effects. Dasatinib is a second generation TKI frequently associated with pleural effusion in up to 33% of patients.

One patient (case 1) is alive and is in remission at 17 months from large B-cell EBL diagnosis while unfortunately the other patient (case 2) died of progressive disease and COVID-19 pneumonia 16 months from large B-cell EBL diagnosis. These cases raise concern about a possible association between large B-cell EBL and dasatinib, and the different clinical outcome of the two cases poses a challenge in treatment decision.

In these particular circumstances, we show that adequate healthcare resources and risk assessments are essential in the management of COVID-19 patients referred to emergency surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The case here presented was treated in 2019 for squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus. In April 2020, she presented a deterioration of her clinical picture consisting of dysphagia, abdominal pain, hyposthenia and ataxia. A Head CT scan was performed, which showed the presence of a solitary cerebellar metastasis. Her associated SARS-CoV-2 positivity status represented the principal clinical concern throughout her hospitalisation. DISCUSSION: The patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy procedure with metastasis asportation. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pre- and post-operative phases, but she was not admitted to the intensive care unit because she did not present any respiratory complications. Her vital parameters and inflammation indexes fell within the reference ranges, and she was kept in isolation for 16 days in our neurosurgical unit following strict COVID-19 measures. She was asymptomatic and not treated for any of the specific and non-specific symptoms of COVID-19.

Stresses are treated as global performance (objective) function, the global von Mises stress is measured by the p-norm stress aggregation approach, and the friction behavior is governed by the Coulomb friction law regularized in analogy with the perfect elasto-plastic theory.

The adjoint sensitivity analysis method is adopted to derive the sensitivity numbers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a series of comparison studies including elastic-rigid and elastic-elastic contact problems. The influence of varying friction coefficient on the optimized results and the stress distributions are investigated in comparison with the maximum stiffness design. The effect of different parameters including p-norm, volume fraction and mesh density on the optimized results are discussed. The optimized results, for elastic-rigid contact, indicate that the maximum stress can be reduced compared with elastic-elastic contact. The optimized stress decreases as the friction coefficient increases because the friction behavior resists the tangential deformation at the contact interface. The results also show that the proposed approach can achieve a reasonable design that effectively controls the stress level and reduces the stress concentration effect at the critical stress areas.","output":"Stress-based topology optimization of continuum structures for the elastic contact problems with friction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension (HTN) is one of the main cardiovascular risk factors and is considered a major public health problem.

However, the overall community prevalence of infections has not been properly assessed, as standard surveillance is typically acquired passively among individuals seeking clinical care. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in which participants provided daily diaries and weekly nasopharyngeal specimens that were tested for respiratory viruses. These data were used to analyze healthcare seeking behavior, compared with cross-sectional ED data and NYC surveillance reports, and used to evaluate biases of medically attended ILI as signal for population respiratory disease and infection. RESULTS: The likelihood of seeking medical attention was virus-dependent: higher for influenza and metapneumovirus (19%-20%), lower for coronavirus and RSV (4%), and 71% of individuals with self-reported ILI did not seek care and half of medically attended symptomatic manifestations did not meet the criteria for ILI. Only 5% of cohort respiratory virus infections and 21% of influenza infections were medically attended and classifiable as ILI. We estimated 1 ILI event per person/year but multiple respiratory infections per year. CONCLUSION: Standard, healthcare-based respiratory surveillance has multiple limitations. Specifically, ILI is an incomplete metric for quantifying respiratory disease, viral respiratory infection, and influenza infection. The prevalence of respiratory viruses, as reported by standard, healthcare-based surveillance, is skewed toward viruses producing more severe symptoms.

MiR-26a was reported to be highly expressed in ADSCs under induction and Forkhead box C2 (FOXC2), as a key substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) could inhibit white adipocyte differentiation, which was mediated by miR-26a. However, the relationship between miR-26a and CDK5/FOXC2 during ADSCs differentiation remains unknown. We want to verify the regulated mechanism of miR-26a/CDK5/FOXC2 axis participating in the adipogenic differentiation of ADSCS. METHODS: ADSCs were isolated and verified by flow cytometry. Oil Red O staining was performed to assess the capacity for adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. The proliferation ability of ADSCs was verified by MTT assay. The expression of miR-26a, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ?3 (PPAR?3), CDK5, and FOXC2 were tested by qRT-PCR and Western blot, and the relationship between miR-26a and CDK5 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. RESULTS: MiR-26a and PPAR?3 were upregulated and CDK5 and FOXC2 were downregulated during adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Knockdown of miR-26a or overexpression of CDK5 could inhibit adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs induced by insulin. MiR-26a could directly target CDK5 and the effect of miR-26a inhibitor on adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs could be blocked by si-CDK5.

COVID-19-associated liver injury is correlated with various liver diseases following a severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that can progress during the treatment of COVID-19 patients with or without pre-existing liver disease. SARS-CoV-2 can induce liver injury in a number of ways including direct cytopathic effect of the virus on cholangiocytes/hepatocytes, immune-mediated damage, hypoxia, and sepsis. Indeed, immediate cytopathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 via its potential target, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor, which is highly expressed in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, renders the liver as an extra-respiratory organ with increased susceptibility to pathological outcomes. But, underlying COVID-19-linked liver disease pathogenesis with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) is incompletely understood. Hence, we collated COVID-19-associated liver injuries with increased LFTs at the nexus of pre-existing liver diseases and COVID-19, and defining a plausible pathophysiological triad of COVID-19, hepatocellular damage, and liver disease.

Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to experience severe or critical COVID-19 illness and myocardial injury is a key extra-pulmonary manifestation. These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown. Understanding the natural history and appropriate management of COVID-19 patients presenting with ST elevation is essential to inform patient management decisions and protect healthcare workers. METHODS: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, North American COVID-19 ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NACMI). This registry will enroll confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI) with new ST-segment elevation or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG with clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. We will compare demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of these patients with a historical control group of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium using propensity matching. The primary clinical outcome will be in- hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, recurrent MI, and repeat unplanned revascularization in COVID-19 confirmed or PUI. Secondary outcomes will include the following: reporting of etiologies of ST Elevation; cardiovascular mortality due to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and /or shock; individual components of the primary outcome; composite primary outcome at one year; as well as ECG and angiographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: The multicenter NACMI registry will collect data regarding ST elevation on ECG in COVID-19 patients to determine the etiology and associated clinical outcomes.

On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is highly expressed in tumor-associated endothelial cells, where it affects tumor-promoting angiogenesis. Therefore, VEGFR-2 is considered one of the most promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Furthermore, some FDA-approved benzimidazole anthelmintics have already shown potential anticancer activities. Therefore, repurposing them against VEGFR-2 can provide a rapid and effective alternative that can be implicated safely for cancer treatment. Hence, 13 benzimidazole anthelmintic drugs were subjected to molecular docking against the VEGFR-2 receptor. Among the tested compounds, fenbendazole (FBZ, 1), mebendazole (MBZ, 2), and albendazole (ABZ, 3) were proposed as potential VEGFR-2 antagonists. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out at 200 ns, giving more information on their thermodynamic and dynamic properties. Besides, the anticancer activity of the aforementioned drugs was tested in vitro against three different cancer cell lines, including liver cancer (HUH7), lung cancer (A549), and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines. The results depicted potential cytotoxic activity especially against both HUH7 and A549 cell lines. Furthermore, to improve the aqueous solubility of MBZ, it was formulated in the form of mixed micelles (MMs) which showed an enhanced drug release with better promising cytotoxicity results compared to the crude MBZ. Finally, an in vitro quantification for VEGFR-2 concentration in treated HUH7 cells has been conducted based on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results disclosed that FBZ, MBZ, and ABZ significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the concentration of VEGFR-2, while the lowest inhibition was achieved in MBZ-loaded MMs, which was even much better than the reference drug sorafenib. Collectively, the investigated benzimidazole anthelmintics could be encountered as lead compounds for further structural modifications and thus better anticancer activity, and that was accomplished through studying their structureCactivity relationships.","output":"In Silico and In Vitro Studies for Benzimidazole Anthelmintics Repurposing as VEGFR-2 Antagonists: Novel Mebendazole-Loaded Mixed Micelles with Enhanced Dissolution and Anticancer Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States Department of Agriculture Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides food and financial assistance to food insecure individuals and families In the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, SNAP benefits evolved Policy changes and federal legislation expanded SNAP eligibility, raised benefit levels, and introduced program waivers that enabled online ordering to reduce participants exposure to community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 Although rapid expansion of SNAP benefits in the online space represents significant progress for federal food assistance, changes also introduced unforeseen partiality in how benefits and services were accessed and utilized, as illustrated by two populations and regions in the early months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: low-income older adults in rural Alabama, and low-income Hispanic adults in urban California Opportunities exist to build on the recent progress in SNAP, while also ensuring continued inclusiveness of eligible persons Efforts should be informed by evidence that supports equitable access to federal food assistance","output":"Examining Equitable Online Federal Food Assistance During the SARS-CoV-2: A Case Study in Two Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease emerged at the end of 2019 On 30 January 2020, the WHO classified it as a pandemic To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with four widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than one symptom (66 3%) The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66 2%, n=641), while anxiety the least (7 1%, n=69) After adjustment for confounders, it is found that dental practitioners with pre-existing physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (OR, 1 972;95%CI, 1 1283 448;p=0 017), and perceived stress (OR, 2 397 95%CI, 1 2834 478;p=0 006) Additionally, feelings of fear, helplessness, or terror resulting from the possibility of being contracted were significantly associated with the prevalence of all the four psychological symptoms observed (p&lt;0 05) In the present study, we revealed the psychological depression, stress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffered by dental care providers during COVID-19, which indicates the importance of psychological support at times of major epidemic outbreaks Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2000031538 Registry: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry","output":"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Dental Care Providers on the Frontlines in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic disease may be at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, yet no association has been established between chronic illness and COVID-19 risk perception, engagement with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), or vaccine acceptance.

COVID-19 inflammation is mediated by IL-1, a disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, lung inflammation, thrombosis, stroke, renal failure and headache, to name a few. Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options. However, until now, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than the vaccine that can solve this serious health problem. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations that the population is waiting for. mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies. The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein. In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus. mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulate the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at the moment, the London government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements. The virus variant had already infected 1/4 of the total cases and in December 2020, it reached 2/3 of those infected in the UK. It has been noted that the spreading rate of the British variant could be greater than 70% of cases compared to the normal SARS-CoV-2 virus, with an R index growth of 0.4. Recent studies suggest that coronavirus-19 variation occurs at the level N501Y of the spike protein and involves 23 separate mutations on the spike, 17 of which are linked to the virus proteins, thus giving specific characteristics to the virus. In general, coronaviruses undergo many mutations that are often not decisive for their biological behavior and does not significantly alter the structure and the components of the virus. This phenomenon also occurs in SARS-CoV-2. It is highly probable that the variants recently described in the UK will not hinder vaccine-induced immunity. In fact, the variant will not break the vaccine although it may have some chance of making it a little less effective. Therefore, it is pertinent to think that the vaccine will work against the SARS-CoV-2 variant as well. In today's pandemic, the D614G mutation of the amino acid of corronavirus-19, which emerged in Europe in February 2020 is the most frequent form and causes high viral growth. The previously infrequent D614G mutation is now globally dominant. This variant, which is being tested by many international laboratories, is rapidly spreading across the countries and a series of vaccinated subjects are testing to see if their antibodies can neutralize the new variant of SARS-CoV-2. This variant has a very high viral growth and is less detectable with the RT-PCR technique in the laboratory. It has been reported that the British variant that increases viral load does not cause more severe effects in the respiratory tract and lung disease, therefore, it is certain that the variant is growing rapidly and must be kept under control; for this reason, laboratory data is expected impatiently. The study on the many variants that coronavirus-19 presents is very interesting and complete and clearer data on this topic will be ready in the near future. In addition, it is still unclear whether the different variants discovered in many countries, including Africa, share the same spike protein mutation and therefore, this is another study to elaborate on. In order to be certain and to not have unexpected surprises, we need to reduce the spread and the transmission speed of viral variants that could appear around the world, creating new pandemics. For this reason, the scientific community is on the alert since laboratory tests on serum antibodies from COVID-19 survivors have been reported to be less effective in attacking the variant. In light of the above, the scientific community must be on the alert as larger variants of the spike protein could escape vaccine-induced antibodies, which for now are of great help to the community and can save millions of lives. Deepening the study of spike protein mutations will help to better understand how to combat coronavirus-19 and its variants.","output":"The British variant of the new coronavirus-19 (Sars-Cov-2) should not create a vaccine problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epigenetic approaches using the histone deacetylase 2 and 3 inhibitor-MI192 have been reported to accelerate stem cells to form mineralised tissues.

Responses were compared between surgeons from different regions and years of practice. RESULTS A total of 385 surgeons answered the questionnaire. There was a significant difference noted in the use of microfracture among surgeons by region (P < 0.001). There was no association between the number of years in practice and the self-reported proportion of microfracture cases performed (P = 0.37). Fifty-eight subjects (15%) indicated that they do not perform microfracture at all. Regarding indication for surgery, 56% of surgeons would limit their indication of microfracture to lesions measuring 2 cm2 or less. Half of the surgeons reported no upper age or body mass index limit. Regarding surgical technique, 90% of surgeons would recommend a formal debridement of the calcified layer and 91% believe it is important to create stable vertical walls.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis investigated factors associated with non-use of social media or video communications to connect with friends and family among older adults during the pandemic's first wave. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to members of a national retired educators' organization based in Ontario, Canada between May 6-19, 2020. Respondents (N=4,879) were asked about their use of social networking websites or apps to communicate with friends and family, their internet connection and smartphone access, loneliness, and sociodemographic characteristics. Factors associated with non-use were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. A thematic analysis was performed of open-ended survey responses that described experiences with technology and virtual connection. RESULTS: Overall, 15.4% of respondents did not use social networking websites or apps. After adjustment, male gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-1.92), advanced age (OR: 1.88, 95% CI 1.38-2.55), living alone (OR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.39-2.02), poorer health (OR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.71), and lower social support (OR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.20-1.71) increased the odds of non-use.

It also assessed various measures taken by ophthalmologists and the possible role of AIOS in mitigating the economic crisis. METHODS: An online questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among its registered members from July to August 2020. The prevalidated questionnaire contained 25 items related to the impact of COVID-19 on patient volume, the extent of financial distress faced by the ophthalmologists, and various proactive measures taken by them. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 1,026 respondents, more than 90% ophthalmologists faced a 25% or more reduction in outpatient and surgical volume. Nearly 59% reported that they can suffer from serious financial distress in near future due to COVID-19 pandemic-related losses. Those who are young (P < 0.0005), salaried (P < 0.0005), and practicing in private sector (P < 0.0005) and Tier 1 cities (P < 0.0005) are reported to be more vulnerable to become financially unstable. The major concerns were revenue losses (70%), preexisting debts (39%), and increased operating costs (27%). The majority (90%) believed that AIOS can help in alleviating the distress. There was also hesitancy regarding the adoption of teleophthalmology and home-based care. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has significantly affected the financial sustainability of ophthalmologists practicing in India.

The aim of this study is to screen and evaluate secreted peptides from the fungus Rhizopus arrhizus var. delemar for their immunomodulatory activity. By using mass spectrometry and immuno-informatics analysis, we identified three secreted peptides CesT (S16), Colicin (S17), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase/ligand (CAMK/CAMKL; S27). Culturing peripheral blood-derived monocytic macrophages (PBMMs) in the presence of S16 or S17 caused cell clumping, while culturing them with S27 resulted in the formation of spindle-shaped cells. S27-treated PBMMs showed cell cycle arrest at G0 phase and exhibited alternatively activated macrophage phenotype with pronounced reduction in scavenger receptors CD163 and CD206. Homology prediction indicated that IL-4/IL-13 is the immunomodulatory target of S27. Confirming this prediction, S27 initiated macrophage activation through phosphorylation of STAT-6; STAT-6 inhibition reversed the activity of S27 and reduced the formation of spindle-shaped PBMMs. Lastly, S27 treatment of PBMMs was associated with altered expression of key iron regulatory genes including hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin receptor 1, and ferritin in a pattern consistent with increased cellular iron release; a condition known to enhance Rhizopus infection. Collectively, R. arrhizus var. delemar secretes peptides with immunomodulatory activities that support fungal pathogenesis. Targeting the IL-4/IL-13R/STAT-6 axis is a potential therapeutic approach to enhance the PBMM-mediated fungal phagocytosis.

Since the late 1990s, live vaccines based on genogroup 1 virus have been used in Japan, and a significant amount of the vaccine has been used even after new genogroups invaded in 2013. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a conventional PED live vaccine on a newly prevalent genogroup 2 field strain in experimental and field situations. METHODS: Two pregnant sows were administered twice the live vaccine before farrowing. A pregnant sow was served as a negative control. All newborn piglets were challenged with the genogroup 2 virus, and clinical signs were monitored for 7 days post challenge. PEDV-specific immune responses in serum and milk of the sows were assayed by virus neutralization assay. The efficacy of PED live vaccine in vaccinated or non-vaccinated farms was evaluated by comparing the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of PED. RESULTS: The challenged piglets exhibited watery diarrhea with or without vaccination. However, the clinical score of piglets born from vaccinated sows significantly improved after the 4th day of the challenge. The survival rate of piglets in the vaccinated group at the end of the experimental period was 80%, whereas in the control group was 0%. Neutralizing antibody titers in serum and milk of control sow was negative throughout the experimental period, whereas high titers were observed in the vaccinated sows. The vaccinated farms significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of PED, compared to farms not vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional PED live vaccine induced the lactogenic immunity to vaccinated sows and showed partial protection against the genogroup 2 virus both under the experimental and field conditions.

The chemical structure and properties of BBT-CMPs such as surface areas, pore size, surface morphologies, and thermal stability using different measurements were discussed in detail. Among the studied BBT-CMPs, we revealed that TPE-BBT-CMP displayed high degradation temperature, up to 340 C, with high char yield and regular, aggregated sphere based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Furthermore, the Py-BBT-CMP as organic electrode showed an outstanding specific capacitance of 228 F g-1 and superior capacitance stability of 93.2% (over 2000 cycles).

An ultrasound-guided nerve block can be used to track and block the nerves properly. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the ultrasound-guided type-II pectoral nerve block with the blind (conventional) intercostal nerve block (ICNB) for pain control after breast tissue reconstruction surgery in transgender patients. METHODS: In the present single-blind randomized clinical trial, 47 patients were randomly divided into two groups: (A) Ultrasound-guided type-II pectoral nerve block (n = 23) and (B) blind intercostal nerve block (n = 24). After nerve block in both groups, pain intensity at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery, upper limb paresthesia, frequency of nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, hematoma, and the length of hospital stay were assessed. RESULTS: Patients who received the ultrasound-guided type-II pectoral nerve block had a greater reduction in pain intensity (24 h after surgery), opioid use (24 h after surgery), nausea, vomiting, and hospital stay than those who received ICNB, whereas the recovery time did not differ between the study groups.

To represent the biology of transmission between humans and tsetse, we previously developed a mechanistic transmission model, fitted to data between 2000 and 2013 which suggested that transmission was interrupted by 2015. The present study outlines refinements to the model to: (1) Assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved despite low-level case reporting; (2) quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction; and (3) predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under different strategies. METHOD: Our previous gHAT transmission model for Mandoul was updated using human case data (2000C2019) and a series of model refinements. These include how diagnostic specificity is incorporated into the model and improvements to the fitting method (increased variance in observed case reporting and how underreporting and improvements to passive screening are captured). A side-by-side comparison of fitting to case data was performed between the models. RESULTS: We estimated that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (95% credible interval (CI) 99.9C100%, Specificity = 99.9%), the high screening and low infection levels mean that some recently reported cases with no parasitological confirmation might be false positives. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse reduction estimated through model fitting (95% CI 96.1C99.6%, Reduction = 99.1%) is comparable to the reduction previously measured by the decline in tsetse catches from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul to ensure the endgame can be carefully monitored. More specific measurement of cases, would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control, provided there is a strong passive surveillance system in place.

There are over 1 million cases around the world with this disease and it continues to raise. Studies on COVID-19 patients have reported high rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among them and patients with CVD had higher mortality rate. Objectives: Since there were controversies between different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to study cardiovascular disease burden among COVID-19 patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Study Selection: Studies reported cardiovascular disease among hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients with mortality or ICU admission (primary outcomes) were included into meta-analysis. In addition, all of studies which reported any cardiovascular implication were included for descriptive meta-analysis. Cohort studies, case-control, cross-sectional, case-cohort and case series studies included into the study. Finally, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria for primary outcome and 59 studies for descriptive outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two investigators have independently evaluated quality of publications and extracted data from included papers. In case of disagreement a supervisor solved the issue and made the final decision. Quality assessment of studies was done using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool. Heterogeneity was assessed using I-squared test and in case of high heterogeneity (>%50) random effect model was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was calculated for Cardiac Troponin I. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs. Results: Sixteen papers including 3473 patients entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and fifty-nine papers including 9509 patients for descriptive outcomes. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 15.94, 95% CI 2.31-110.14), hypertension (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.92-2.74), heart Failure (OR: 11.73, 95% CI 5.17-26.60), other cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.17-3.24) and overall CVDs (OR: 3.37, 95% CI 2.06-5.52) were significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Arrhythmia (OR: 22.17, 95%CI 4.47-110.04), acute cardiac injury (OR: 19.83, 95%CI 7.85-50.13), coronary heart disease (OR: 4.19, 95%CI 1.27-13.80), cardiovascular disease (OR: 4.17, 95%CI 2.52-6.88) and hypertension (OR: 2.69, 95%CI 1.55-4.67) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our findings showed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission.

Cardiovascular complications with myocarditis and embolism due to COVID-19 have been reported. SARS-CoV-2 genome detection in the heart muscle has not been demonstrated so far, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) of 104 patients (mean age: 57.90  16.37 years; left ventricular ejection fraction: 33.7  14.6%, sex: n = 79 male/25 female) with suspected myocarditis or unexplained heart failure were analysed. EMB analysis included histology, immunohistochemistry, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in the IKDT Berlin, Germany. Among 104 EMBs investigated, five were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by reverse real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We describe patients of different history of symptoms and time duration. Additionally, we investigated histopathological changes in myocardial tissue showing that the inflammatory process in EMBs seemed to permeate vascular wall leading to small arterial obliteration and damage. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that established the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes detection in EMBs.

It is necessary to understand the importance of the requirement for sustainable purchases to happen. Thus, this study aims to examine the main difficulties in adopting SPP at a public university in Brazil. To that end, research on the topic was carried out based on critical theory using qualitative methodology through a case study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three groups selected intentionally: requesters, purchasers and suppliers. Aspects related to the understanding of sustainability, SPP and the relationship between ethics and sustainability were analysed. The study revealed that the interviewees understand that ethics is directly related to the practice of sustainability, but it is a difficult issue because of its historical roots and changes in paradigms. Due to the complexity of the SPP theme, one of the main implementation difficulties mentioned by the interviewees was the lack of training. For suppliers, the understanding of sustainability was already consolidated, but it required agreement between being sustainable and economically viable for the company. Thus, this work sought to expose how those involved in SPP understood, refuted or validated sustainability issues in government procurement. Previous studies revealed the difficulties and conceptions of buyers, but we did not find research that investigated requesters and suppliers.

We secondarily aimed to determine whether time interval between pessary changes is associated with adverse outcomes and to identify factors associated with adverse pessary outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of women undergoing pessary care after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Time between the most recent visit before the pandemic and first visit after the pandemic began was recorded. Pessary care data were collected from the latter visit, including vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, and erosion. Patient-reported symptoms and demographics were also recorded. The relationship between time interval between pessary visits and adverse outcomes as well as between adverse outcomes and demographic data was assessed. RESULTS: We identified 104 women undergoing pessary care, of which 35.6% were Hispanic and 32.7% were Black and 26.2%  10.5% lived in poverty. The median time to in-person visit was 4.5 months (interquartile range, 3.7C5.3 months). Seven women (8.7%) had vaginal bleeding, 15 (14.6%) had vaginal discharge, and 7 (6.8%) had erosions. There was no significant association between time interval between pessary visits and adverse outcomes or between adverse outcomes and patient characteristics (all P > 0.05).

Participants were purposively selected from two private Podiatry practices based on their signs and symptoms, age, gender, and doctors clearance to participate in any form of physical activity. Dependent variables included isometric muscle strength of the hip, knee and ankle, range of motion of the ankle in plantarflexion and dorsiflexion and an assessment of balance, which were measured pre- and post-intervention. The researcher developed a scientifically based exercise intervention program to target the entire kinetic chain, and to develop a standard isometric protocol for patients with DPN. The intervention program consisted of a combination of ankle, hip, and knee specific rehabilitation. The intervention took place 3 times a week for 45 min per session. RESULTS: The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the differences in dependent variables from pre- to post-intervention. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Notable increases were observed in range of motion in ankle plantarflexion and in balance time in the intervention group, post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the changes noted were insignificant, the trends indicated an improvement in the intervention group over the 10-week intervention period.

Our objective was to evaluate the propensity of a population of Italian women to receive the vaccine and its psychological impact. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was performed on pregnant women attending Ospedale Cristo Re Universit Roma TorVergata. A multi-section questionnaire was sent to each included woman on the first day of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Part-A was finalized to acquire maternal characteristics and to test the women's perception of vaccinations in pregnancy and their fear-induced by vaccines. Part-B included the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) a validated test for scoring trait anxiety (basal anxiety, STAI-T) and state anxiety (STAI-S). An abnormal value of STAI was considered when &#8805;40. Comparisons of maternal variables were performed according to their vaccine attitude. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 161 women (80.5% of the population considered). A positive attitude toward the vaccine was present in 136 (84.5%) women (positive) while the remaining 25.5% considered the vaccine not useful (negative). Among the former group 52.9% were favorable to obtain the vaccine during pregnancy despite the current national limitations, a percentage significantly higher (p = .02) than in the negative groups. Women with a negative attitude to the vaccine had a lower educational (p = .002) and employment level (p = .016) when compared to the positive group. In all the women a significant increase of STAI-S from STAI-T values was evidenced (p < .0001). The incidence of abnormal STAI T values (basal anxiety) was similar between the 2 groups (p = .81), while there was a significant increase of STAI-S values in the negative group (negative 88.0%; vs positive 63.4%; p = .018).

The blockade of SIV by IFITMs is isolate specific, raising the question of which parameters impact sensitivity to IFITM. We show that the virion context in which SIV-Env is presented and the efficiency of virion incorporation determine Env susceptibility to inhibition by IFITMs. Thus, determinants other than the nature of the envelope protein can impact the IFITM sensitivity of viral entry. IMPORTANCE The host cell-encoded IFITM proteins can block viral entry and are an important component of the innate defenses against viral infection. However, the determinants controlling whether a virus is susceptible to blockade by IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Our study shows that the amount of envelope proteins incorporated into virions as well as the nature of the virion particle itself can impact the sensitivity of viral entry to IFITMs. These results show for the first time that determinants other than the viral envelope protein can impact sensitivity to IFITM and have implications for the interpretation of previously published data on inhibition of viruses by IFITM proteins. Moreover, our findings might help to define the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.","output":"Virion Background and Efficiency of Virion Incorporation Determine Susceptibility of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Env-Driven Viral Entry to Inhibition by IFITM Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diffusion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide prompted the World Health Organization to declare the status of pandemic.

The relationships among the stakeholders are multifaceted and dynamic, requiring continual interpersonal connections, networks, and co-evolution. It is pivotal to have an evidence-informed theory to explain the phenomenon, uniting the multifaceted stakeholders efforts. PURPOSE: To describe the development of an evidence-informed theory, the Convergent Care Theory, assembling healthcare stakeholders to work together and achieve optimal health outcomes. METHODS: The Convergent Care Theory was developed using a theory synthesis approach based on empirical research and literature reviews published by the theory-proposing author. The empirical evidence was categorized into: patients and families, healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, and patients and healthcare providers self-care. RESULTS: The Convergent Care Theory includes four concepts: all-inclusive organizational care, healthcare professional collaborative care, person-centered precision care, and patientsand healthcare providers self-care. Achieving convergent care is a process requiring all stakeholders to work together. Six major facilitators emerged from the research evidence: competence, compassion, accountability, trusting, sharing, and engaging. CONCLUSION: This article introduced the development process of the evidence-informed Convergent Care Theory. Healthcare systems are complex, with multiple stakeholders needs to meet. The Convergent Care Theory strives to unite healthcare stakeholders, bond resources, and join forces to achieve optimal healthcare outcomes.

Overall, the registries received between 27% and 80% of the maximum score of 94. The results from our analysis were used to define a set of features of an interim ideal registry. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the widely divergent quality of the primary registries compliance with the ISCTR. Even with this limited assessment, it is clear that some of the registries have much work to do, although even a few improvements would significantly improve them.","output":"A comparative analysis of important public clinical trial registries, and a proposal for an interim ideal one"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a worldwide epidemic in the digital age, cyberbullying is a pertinent but understudied concernespecially from the perspective of language. Elucidating the linguistic features of cyberbullying is critical both to preventing it and to cultivating ethical and responsible digital citizens. In this study, a mixed-method approach integrating lexical feature analysis, sentiment polarity analysis, and semantic network analysis was adopted to develop a deeper understanding of cyberbullying language. Five cyberbullying cases on Chinese social media were analyzed to uncover explicit and implicit linguistic features. Results indicated that cyberbullying comments had significantly different linguistic profiles than non-bullying comments and that explicit and implicit bullying were distinct. The content of cases further suggested that cyberbullying language varied in the use of words, types of cyberbullying, and sentiment polarity. These findings offer useful insight for designing automatic cyberbullying detection tools for Chinese social networking platforms. Implications also offer guidance for regulating cyberbullying and fostering ethical and responsible digital citizens.","output":"To Be Ethical and Responsible Digital Citizens or Not: A Linguistic Analysis of Cyberbullying on Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown an attenuated immune response in hemodialysis patients after vaccination. The present study examines the humoral response after mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in a large population of hemodialysis patients from different outpatient dialysis centers. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid protein (chemiluminescence immunoassays, Roche diagnostics) three to six weeks after the second mRNA vaccine dose in 179 maintenance hemodialysis and 70 non-dialysis patients (control cohort). Differences in Anti-SARS CoV-2 spike protein titers were statistically analysed with respect to patient-relevant factors, including age, gender, previous COVID-19 infection, systemic immunosuppressive therapy and time on dialysis. RESULTS: We found a favorable, but profoundly lower SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody response in comparison to a non-dialysis cohort (median 253.5 vs. 1756 U/ml, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis previous COVID-19 infection (p < 0.001) and female gender were associated with a significantly higher vaccine response (p 0.006) in hemodialysis patients, while there was a significant inverse correlation with increasing patient age and systemic immunosuppression (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant correlation between the antibody titer and time on dialysis. Immune response in hemodialysis patients with a previous COVID-19 infection led to substantially higher antibody titers that were equal to those of vaccinated non-dialysis individuals with previous infection. CONCLUSION: We strongly argue in favor of regular antibody testing after COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients. Further studies should elucidate the utility of booster vaccinations to foster a stronger and persistent antibody response.","output":"Antibody response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in hemodialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inquisitive probing questions come naturally to humans in a variety of settings, but is a challenging task for automatic systems. One natural type of question to ask tries to fill a gap in knowledge during text comprehension, like reading a news article: we might ask about background information, deeper reasons behind things occurring, or more. Despite recent progress with data-driven approaches, generating such questions is beyond the range of models trained on existing datasets. We introduce INQUISITIVE, a dataset of ~19K questions that are elicited while a person is reading through a document. Compared to existing datasets, INQUISITIVE questions target more towards high-level (semantic and discourse) comprehension of text. We show that readers engage in a series of pragmatic strategies to seek information.

White-tailed deer, the predominant cervid in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experimentally infected fawns can transmit the virus. To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in deer, 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from 151 free-living and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through January of 2021 were assayed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ninety-four of the 283 (33.2%) deer samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as assessed by RT-PCR. Notably, following the November 2020 peak of human cases in Iowa, and coinciding with the onset of winter and the peak deer hunting season, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 80 of 97 (82.5%) RPLN samples collected over a 7-wk period. Whole genome sequencing of all 94 positive RPLN samples identified 12 SARS-CoV-2 lineages, with B.1.2 (n = 51; 54.5%) and B.1.311 (n = 19; 20%) accounting for 75% of all samples. The geographic distribution and nesting of clusters of deer and human lineages strongly suggest multiple human-to-deer transmission events followed by subsequent deer-to-deer spread.

SOURCES We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to November 2019. We included studies that reported on the incidence of new-onset perioperative AF during hospitalization for non-cardiac surgery and/or AF recurrence in such patients following discharge. Reviewers screened articles and abstracted data independently and in duplicate. We assessed study quality by appraising methodology for collecting AF history, incident AF during hospitalization, and AF recurrence after discharge. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS From 39,233 citations screened, 346 studies that enrolled a total of 5,829,758 patients met eligibility criteria. Only 27 studies used prospective, continuous inpatient electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring to detect incident AF. Overall, the incidence of postoperative AF during hospitalization ranged from 0.004 to 50.3%, with a median [interquartile range] of 8.7 [3.8-15.0]%. Atrial fibrillation incidence varied with type of surgery. Prospective studies using continuous ECG monitoring reported significantly higher incidences of AF than those that did not (13.9% vs 1.9%, respectively; P < 0.001). A total of 13 studies (25,726 patients) with follow-up up to 5.4 years reported on AF recurrence following hospital discharge; only one study used a prospective systematic monitoring protocol. Recurrence rates ranged from 0 to 37.3%. CONCLUSIONS Rates of AF incidence first detected following non-cardiac surgery and long-term AF recurrence vary markedly. Differences in the intensity of ECG monitoring and type of surgery may account for this variation.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate 30-day all-cause mortality comparing TRA with transfemoral access for percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies published from inception until January 7, 2020, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science Core Collection. Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for abstracting data. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, major bleeding, stroke, and access site complications. RESULTS A total of 14 studies representing 11 707 patients (5802 patients with TRA; 5905 patients with transfemoral access) were included in this systematic review. All-cause mortality (N=8 studies) was significantly reduced in the TRA group with an overall risk ratio (RR) of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56-0.92) in the pooled analysis. Major bleeding (N=12 studies; RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.80]) and access site complications (N=9 studies; RR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.30-0.53]) were significantly higher in the transfemoral access group. There was no statistical difference in reinfarction (N=10 studies; RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75-1.25]) or stroke (N=8 studies; RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.87-2.50]).

However, the effectiveness of mobile health application among Asians with prediabetes remains largely unexamined. We aimed to assess whether a smartphone app-based lifestyle intervention program would lead to weight loss, normoglycemia and improved metabolic indices in a multiethnic Asian population with prediabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicentre prediabetes RCT is part of the Diabetes Lifestyle Intervention using Technology Empowerment (D'LITE) trial. Adults (n = 148) with prediabetes and BMI  23 kg/m(2) were randomly allocated either to the intervention group (n = 72) empowered by self-monitoring features of the Nutritionist Buddy Diabetes app with in-app dietitian coaching for 6 months, or the control group (n = 76) receiving standard diet counseling at baseline. Primary outcome was defined as change in body weight at 6 months, while secondary outcomes included glycemic control and other metabolic indices analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Model analysis with intention-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Intervention group achieved a significantly greater weight loss of 4.2 vs. 1.3 kg [mean difference of ?3.1 kg (95% CI ?4.5 to ?1.7), p < 0.001], and a 4.3-fold increased likelihood of achieving  5% weight loss, as compared to the control group at 6 months. The likelihood of achieving normoglycemia (defined as HbA(1c) < 5.7%) was 2.1 times higher in intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.018).

Although the proportion of affected patients remains to be determined, physicians are increasingly being confronted with patients reporting respiratory symptoms and impairment beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In face of limited evidence, the Swiss Society for Pulmonology established a working group to address this area of unmet need and formulated diagnostic and treatment recommendations for the care of patients with pulmonary long COVID (LC). METHOD: The Swiss COVID Lung Study group and Swiss Society for Pulmonology (SSP) formulated 13 questions addressing the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary LC. A survey within the SSP special interest groups involved in care of LC patients was conducted in Switzerland. A CORE process/Delphi-like process was used to formulate recommendations. Forty experienced pulmonologists replied to the first survey and 22 completed the second follow-up survey. Agreement of &#8805;70% consensus led to formulation of a recommendation. RESULTS: The participants in the survey reached consensus and formulated a strong recommendation for regarding the following points. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 should have a pulmonary assessment including pulmonary function tests. Symptomatic subjects affected by COVID-19, including those with mild disease, should benefit from a pulmonary follow-up. Persistent respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 should be investigated by a pulmonary follow-up including plethysmography, diffusion capacity measurement, and blood gases analysis. Individuals having suffered from COVID-19 and who present with persistent respiratory symptoms should be offered a rehabilitation. Additional questions were given moderateor weak recommendations for. The panel did not reach sufficient consensus for pharmacological therapy (e.g., therapy specifically targeting lung fibrosis) to formulate recommendations for LC drug treatment.

The production and operations of Chinese enterprises have also faced tremendous challenges. To understand the economic impact of COVID-19 on enterprises and the key affecting factors, this study adds to the literature by investigating the business recovery process of enterprises from the micro perspective. Specific attention is paid to the initial stage of business recovery. A questionnaire survey of 750 enterprises explored the impact during the pandemic period from July to September 2020. An accelerated failure time model in survival analysis was adopted to analyze the data. The results show that the manufacturing industry is mainly faced by affecting factors such as enterprise ownership, employees panic and order cancellation on initial enterprise recovery. As for the non-manufacturing industry, more factors, including clients distribution, employees panic, raw material shortage, cash flow shortage and order cancellation, are found to be significant. Acceleration factors that estimate the effects of those covariates on acceleration/deceleration of the recovery time are presented. For instance, the acceleration factor of employees panic is 1.319 for non-manufacturing, which implies that, compared with enterprises where employees are less panicked, enterprises with employees obviously panicked will recover 1.319 times slower at any quantile of probability of recovery time.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of ACEI/ARB and household transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a modified cohort study of household contacts of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 4 and May 17, 2020 in a large Northeast US health system. Household members were identified by geocoding and full address matching with exclusion of addresses with >10 matched residents or known congregate living functions. Medication use, clinical conditions and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) data on cohort entry. Cohort members were followed for at least one month after exposure to determine who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mixed effects logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to assess adjusted associations between medication use and testing positive. RESULTS: 1,499 of the 9,101 household contacts were taking an ACEI or an ARB. Probability of COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period was slightly higher among ACEI/ARB users in unadjusted analyses. However, ACEI/ARB users were older and more likely to have clinical comorbidities so that use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in mixed effect models (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.81) or propensity score analyses (predicted probability 18.6% in ACEI/ARB users vs. 24.5% in non-users, p = 0.03). These associations were similar within age and comorbidity subgroups, including patients with documented hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, as well as when including other medications in the models. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study of household transmission, use of ACEIs or ARBs was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19.

Does it have an impact on cancer care today? MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PRIO (\\"Prevention and Integrative Oncology\\") Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020. Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires. The survey is ongoing. We present the first data. RESULTS: A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life. A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted. Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients. Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves. CONCLUSION: There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management. After only a few weeks, human resources are limited.

This leads to aberrant hyperactivation of the immune system generating damage to the infected organs. An impairment in testicular function through uncontrolled immune responses alerts more attention to male infertility. Meanwhile, the recent clinical data indicate that the infection of the human testis with SARS-CoV-2 may impair male germ cell development, leading to germ cell loss and higher immune cell infiltration.

To this end, many approaches have been proposed to predict partner-selecting, i.e., specificity-determining positions in evolutionarily close complexes. These approaches can be grouped into sequence-based machine learning and structure-based energy-driven methods. In this work, we assessed these methods ability to map the specificity-determining positions of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer progression and immune-related diseases. For this, we used three sequence-based predictors C SDPred, Multi-RELIEF, and Sequence Harmony C and a structure-based approach by utilizing HADDOCK and extensive molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we show that (i) sequence-based methods overpredict the number of specificity-determining positions for Axl complexes and that (ii) combining sequence-based approaches with HADDOCK provides the most coherent set of predictions. Our work lays out a critical study on the comparative performance specificity-determining position predictors.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify if PP interventions have an impact on organisational performance of healthcare personnel, and if so, how this impact can be achieved. We developed a logic model to explain the impact of PP interventions on organisational performance. METHODS: We searched Web of Science, Medline, Psychinfo, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL (from inception until March 2019) and references of included articles to identify studies that evaluated the impact of a PP intervention for health personnel. Study quality was assessed using the SQUIRE checklist for quality improvement studies. Data were extracted about study details, setting, participants, intervention, method of evaluation and results. Outcomes, mechanisms and contexts were coded in nVivo. Data synthesis was guided by Lewis theory of the impact of PP interventions on organisational performance and Kneale et al.s method for logic model development. Collected data were integrated into a logic model explaining initial inputs, processes, and intermediate outcomes of PP interventions that lead to improved organisational performance in healthcare settings. RESULTS: We retrieved 4638 articles and identified five through references of included articles of which 29 studies (31 articles) met our inclusion criteria. Most articles were of low quality (n = 19) and outcome measures varied widely. We identified 54 different outcomes of PP interventions, including improved well-being and improved interaction and support. Forty-nine mechanisms were identified including recognising and reframing negative interpretations. Twenty four contextual factors were identified of which seven acted as barriers. Managerial support was a facilitator mentioned in eight studies. All identified outcomes, mechanisms and contextual factors were integrated into a logic model explaining how interventions using PP can impact organisational performance in healthcare. CONCLUSION: Few identified outcomes were statistically significant, however, trends in both quantitative and qualitative outcomes show that PP interventions can increase well-being and interaction and support and thus improve organisational performance in healthcare. The developed logic model can be used in the implementation and evaluation of interventions using PP for health personnel.","output":"Outcomes, mechanisms and contextual factors of positive psychology interventions for health workers: a systematic review of global evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this letter, the authors wonder about the need to apply some of the precautions that have been repeatedly suggested during the recent COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic not only to suspected or documented cases of infection but also to all the new cases entering the hospital. In this regard, orotracheal intubation has been universally recognized as a maneuver with a high risk of viral transmission. On the other hand, rapid sequence induction, which represents the gold standard for limiting the risk of transmission for health care professionals, implies side effects that can be potentially harmful for patients with impaired hemodynamics. In this regard, the authors report a particular type of rapid induction that they are performing in a systematic way during the recent pandemic in cardiac surgery patients. This is performed after the patient reaches a deep analgesic plan, thanks to the unique characteristics of the opioid remifentanil. This type of induction, already tested in vasculopathic patients who underwent carotid surgery, is characterized by great hemodynamic stability and is very advantageous, in the writer's experience, when rapid sequence induction has to be systematically applied to cardiovascular patients, especially if you only want to protect operators.","output":"Systematic Application of Rapid Sequence Intubation With Remifentanil During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on 17 patients with influenza A H1N1v-associated Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between June 11th 2009 and August 10th 2010 (f/m: 8/9; age: median 39 (IQR 29C54) years; SAPS II: 35 (29C48)). Body mass index was 26 (24C35), 24% were overweight and 29% obese. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1 (0C2) and all but one patient had comorbid conditions. The median time between onset of the first symptom and admission to the ICU was 5 days (range 0C14). None of the patients had received vaccination against H1N1v. Nine patients received oseltamivir, only two of them within 48 hours of symptom onset. All patients developed severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)-Ratio 60 (55C92); lung injury score 3.8 (3.3C4.0)), were mechanically ventilated and on vasopressor support. Fourteen patients received corticosteroids, 7 patients underwent hemofiltration, and 10 patients needed extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO; 8 patients veno-venous, 2 patients veno-arterial), three patients Interventional Lung Assist (ILA) and two patients pump driven extracorporeal low-flow CO(2)-elimination (ECCO(2)CR). Seven of 17 patients (41%) died in the ICU (4 patients due to bleeding, 3 patients due to multi-organ failure), while all other patients survived the hospital (59%). ECMO mortality was 50%.

Many viruses can significantly alter host chromatin1, but such roles of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture and epigenome landscapes in human cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing remarkable restructuring of host chromatin architecture. High-resolution Hi-C 3.0 uncovered widespread A compartmental weakening and A-B mixing, together with a global reduction of intra-TAD chromatin contacts. The cohesin complex, a central organizer of the 3D genome, was significantly depleted from intra-TAD regions, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts cohesin loop extrusion. Calibrated ChIP-Seq verified chromatin restructuring by SARS-CoV-2 that is particularly manifested by a pervasive reduction of euchromatin modifications. Built on the rewired 3D genome/epigenome maps, a modified activity-by-contact model2 highlights the transcriptional weakening of antiviral interferon response genes or virus sensors (e.g., DDX58) incurred by SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6) high in severe infections were uniquely regulated by augmented H3K4me3 at their promoters. These findings illustrate how SARS-CoV-2 rewires host chromatin architecture to confer immunological gene deregulation, laying a foundation to characterize the long-term epigenomic impacts of this virus.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Restructures the Host Chromatin Architecture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China Eastern Airlines launched a Wild Your Weekends' programme offering buyers an unlimited number of free trips during weekends, which is unprecedented in the Chinese airline market and also rare around the world.

The addresses of this document are physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, and other professionals involved in patient positioning in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A consensus pathway was followed using the Nominal Focus Group and the Delphi Technique, integrating a phase of focused group discussion online and with a pre-coded guide to an individual phase. A multidisciplinary advisory board composed by nine experts on the topic contributed to both the phases of the process, to reach a consensus on four clinical questions positioning and mobilization of the critically ill patient. RESULTS: The topics addressed by the clinical questions were the risks associated with obligatory positioning and therapeutic positions, the effective interventions in preventing pressure injuries, the appropriate instruments for screening for pressure injuries in the ICU, and the cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions relating to ICU positioning. A total of 27 statements addressing these clinical questions were produced by the panel. Among the statements, nine provided guidance on how to manage safely some specific patients positions, including the prone position; five suggested specific screening tools and patients factors to consider when assessing the individual risk of developing pressure injuries; five gave indications on mobilization and repositioning; and eight focused on the use of devices, such as positioners and preventive dressings.

Here, we track the geotemporal spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a mutation (D839Y) in a potential host-interacting region involving the Spike fusion peptide, which is a target motif of anti-viral drugs that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The Spike Y839 variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February and massively disseminated in Portugal during the early epidemic, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal where it represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, by 30 April. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15.5% (1275/8251) and 6.0% (1500/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively], we estimate that, between 14 March and 9 April (covering the epidemic exponential phase) the relative frequency of the Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%-18.2%, CI 95%) every three days, being potentially associated with 24.8% (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%; 3177-4542 cases, CI 95%) of all COVID-19 cases in Portugal during this period.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study, we analyzed 2382 children with complete data on early life feeding and blood pressure. Infant feeding was documented from hospital records in the first few days of life and reported by mothers throughout infancy. Blood pressure was measured at 3 years of age. Analyses controlled for birth weight, gestational age, socioeconomic status, maternal body mass index, and other potential confounders. We found that nearly all children (2333/2382; 97.9%) were ever breastfed, of whom 98 (4.2%) only briefly received breast milk during their birth hospitalization (early limited breastfeeding). At 3 years of age, blood pressure was higher in children who were never breastfed (mean systolic/diastolic 103/60 mm Hg) compared with those who were ever breastfed (99/58 mm Hg), including those who received only early limited breastfeeding (99/57 mm Hg). These differences in systolic blood pressure persisted in adjusted models (ever breastfed: ?3.47 mm Hg, 95% CI, ?6.14 to ?0.80; early limited breastfeeding: ?4.24 mm Hg, 95% CI, ?7.45 to ?1.04). Among breastfed children, there was no significant dose\\\\response association according to the duration or exclusivity of breastfeeding. Associations were not mediated by child body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Although the benefits of sustained and exclusive breastfeeding are indisputable, this study indicates any breastfeeding, regardless of duration or exclusivity, is associated with lower blood pressure at 3 years of age.

An optimal amount of calcium carbonate in the eggshell is essential for the embryo's development, yet how the ratio of calcium carbonate to organic matter varies between species has not been investigated. Calcium is a limiting resource for most birds, so its investment in their eggs should be optimized for a bird's life history. We measured the relative calcium carbonate content of eggshells in 222 bird species and tested hypotheses for how this trait has evolved with the life-history strategies of these species and other traits of their respective egg physiologies. We found that (i) eggshell calcium carbonate content was positively correlated with species having thinner eggshells and smaller than expected eggs relative to incubating parental mass, (ii) species with small mean clutch sizes had lower calcium carbonate content in their eggshells, and (iii) for species with larger clutch sizes, eggshell calcium carbonate content was negatively correlated with their mean lifespan. The pattern of lower eggshell calcium carbonate in longer lived, larger clutched birds suggests that calcium provision to the eggshell has long-term costs for the individual.","output":"How much calcium to shell out?

To understand this association, recent population data is required which is representative of all the states and union territories of the country. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the patterns of physical activity in India, stratified by zones, body mass index (BMI), urban, rural areas, and gender. METHOD: We present the analysis of physical activity status from the data collected during the phase 1 of a pan-India study. This (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata 2017) was a multicenter pan-India cluster sampled trial with dual objectives. A survey to identify all individuals at a high risk for diabetes, using a validated instrument called the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS), was followed by a two-armed randomized yoga-based lifestyle intervention for the primary prevention of diabetes. The physical activity was scored as per IDRS (vigorous exercise or strenuous at work = 0, moderate exercise at home/work = 10, mild exercise at home/work = 20, no exercise = 30). This was done in a selected cluster using a mobile application. A weighted prevalence was calculated based on the nonresponse rate and design weight. RESULTS: We analyzed the data from 2,33,805 individuals; the mean age was 41.4 years (SD 13.4). Of these, 50.6% were females and 49.4% were males; 45.8% were from rural areas and 54% from urban areas. The BMI was 24.7  4.6 kg/m(2). Briefly, 20% were physically inactive and 57% of the people were either inactive or mildly active. 21.2% of females were found physically inactive, whereas 19.2% of males were inactive. Individuals living in urban localities were proportionately more inactive (21.7% vs. 18.8%) or mildly active (38.9% vs. 34.8%) than the rural people. Individuals from the central (29.6%) and south zones (28.6%) of the country were also relatively inactive, in contrast to those from the northwest zone (14.2%). The known diabetics were found to be physically inactive (28.3% vs. 19.8%) when compared with those unaware of their diabetic status. CONCLUSION: 20% and 37% of the population in India are not active or mildly active, respectively, and thus 57% of the surveyed population do not meet the physical activity regimen recommended by the World Health Organization. This puts a large Indian population at risk of developing various NCDs, which are being increasingly reported to be vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. India needs to adopt the four strategic objectives recommended by the World Health Organization for reducing the prevalence of physical inactivity.","output":"Physical Activity Patterns in India Stratified by Zones, Age, Region, BMI and Implications for COVID-19: A Nationwide Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus surfaced in late 2019. It turned out to be a life-threatening disease and is causing chaos all around the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic in March 2020. To handle COVID-19 related problems, research in many areas of science was introduced. Machine learning (ML), being one of the most successful stories in recent times is widely used to solve a variety of problems in our everyday life. Here, an overview of machine learning that tackles the pandemic is discussed in the beginning. Various datasets related to COVID-19 are also explored. Diagnosis of this viral disease using CT-Scans, X-ray images, sound analysis and blood tests using machine learning are presented in-depth. Drug and vaccine development using machine learning for COVID-19 are also discussed. Pandemic management and control were also examined. The main objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of machine learning applications that fight the deadly virus. This paper helps the researchers to understand and analyse the data trends related to COVID-19 and also prepare for a future outbreak which might happen due to new strains of COVID-19.

Since its identification in November 2021, Omicron, a highly transmissible variant, has become the dominant variant in most countries. Omicrons highly mutated spike protein, the main target of vaccine development, significantly compromises the immune protection from current vaccination. We develop an mRNA vaccine (SOmicron-6P) based on an Omicron-specific sequence. In mice, SOmicron-6P shows superior neutralizing antibodies inducing abilities to a clinically approved inactivated virus vaccine, a clinically approved protein subunit vaccine, and an mRNA vaccine (SWT-2P) with the same sequence of BNT162b2 RNA. Significantly, SOmicron-6P induces a 14.427.7-fold and a 28.350.3-fold increase of neutralizing activity against the pseudovirus of Omicron and authentic Omicron compared to SWT-2P, respectively. In addition, two doses SOmicron-6P significantly protects Syrian hamsters against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and elicits high titers of nAbs in a dose-dependent manner in macaques.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a user embracement protocol (SPIKES protocol) for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) immediately before intra-articular injection (IAI) relative to procedure tolerance and its effectiveness in the immediate, short and medium terms. METHODS This was a randomized controlled trial. Patients received IAIs with triamcinolone hexacetonide (40 mg) preceded or not by the SPIKES protocol. The outcomes measured were: visual analogue scale for pain at rest, pain on movement and joint swelling; morning stiffness; Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index Functional Questionnaire (WOMAC); pain catastrophizing scale; McGill pain questionnaire; SF-36 questionnaire on quality of life; Trace State Anxiety Inventory (IDATE); and a Timed Up and Go functional test. RESULTS One hundred patients were randomized in the user embracement group (n = 50) or the control group (n = 50); 89% were women and 60% white, mean age was 67.1 (7.3) years, and mean disease time was 6.3 (6.2) years. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for any variables at pre-procedure time, nor did the groups differ in their tolerance to the procedure or during the 12 weeks of follow up for any evaluated variables.

In particular, the canonical inverse Lyndon factorization [Formula: see text], introduced in [5], maintains the main properties of the Lyndon factorization since it can be computed in linear time and it is uniquely determined. In this paper we investigate new properties of this factorization with the purpose of exploring its use in string queries. As a main result, we prove an upper bound on the length of the longest common extension (or longest common prefix) for two factors of a word w. This bound is at most the maximum length of two consecutive factors of [Formula: see text]. A tool used in the proof is a property that we state for factors with nonempty borders in [Formula: see text]: a nonempty border of a factor [Formula: see text] cannot be a prefix of the next factor [Formula: see text]. Another interesting result relates sorting of global suffixes, i.e., suffixes of a word w, and sorting of local suffixes, i.e., suffixes of the factors in [Formula: see text]. Finally, given a word w and a factor x of w, we prove that their Lyndon factorizations share factors, except for the first and last term of the Lyndon factorization of x. This property suggests that, given two words sharing a common overlap, their Lyndon factorizations could be used to capture the common overlap of these two words.","output":"Lyndon Words versus Inverse Lyndon Words: Queries on Suffixes and Bordered Words"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the postural balance of type 2 diabetics with vertigo, dizziness, and/or unsteadiness.

Longitudinal associations between resilience and mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the association between resilience and trajectories of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Participants were 6,008 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet-panel representative of the US adult population. Baseline data were collected between March 10 and March 31, 2020, with nine follow-up waves conducted between April 1 and August 4. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and mental distress, stratified by resilience level (low, normal, or high). RESULTS In contrast to the high resilience group, participants in the low and normal resilience groups experienced increases in mental distress in the early months of the pandemic (low: OR=2.94, 95% CI=1.93-4.46; normal: OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.55-2.35). Men, middle-aged and older adults, Black adults, and adults with a graduate degree were more likely to report high resilience, whereas adults living below the poverty line were less likely to report high resilience. LIMITATIONS These associations should not be interpreted as causal, and resilience was measured at only one time-point. CONCLUSIONS Trajectories of mental distress varied markedly by resilience level during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with low-resilience adults reporting the largest increases in mental distress during this crisis.

Over the past few years there has been increasing evidence that different components of the TJs can be hijacked by viruses in order to complete their infectious cycle. Viruses from at least nine different families of DNA and RNA viruses have been reported to use TJ proteins in their benefit. For example, TJ proteins such as JAM-A or some members of the claudin family of proteins are used by members of the Reoviridae family and hepatitis C virus as receptors or co-receptors during their entry into their host cells. Reovirus, in addition, takes advantage of the TJ protein Junction Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A) to achieve its hematogenous dissemination. Some other viruses are capable of regulating the expression or the localization of TJ proteins to induce cell transformation or to improve the efficiency of their exit process. This review encompasses the importance of TJs for viral entry, replication, dissemination, and egress, and makes a clear statement of the importance of studying these proteins to gain a better understanding of the replication strategies used by viruses that infect epithelial and/or endothelial cells.","output":"Tight Junctions Go Viral!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Doing evaluation is one of the important things that has been done by the educators.

We describe the use of simulation to evaluate a rapidly scalable hub-and-spoke model for EHR deployment and monitoring using asynchronous training. METHODS: We adapted existing commercial EHR products to serve as the point of entry from a simulated hospital and a separate system for tele-ICU support and monitoring of the interfaced data. To train our users we created a modular video-based curriculum to facilitate asynchronous training. Effectiveness of the curriculum was assessed through completion of common ICU documentation tasks in a high-fidelity simulation. Additional endpoints include assessment of EHR navigation, user satisfaction (Net Promoter), system usability (System Usability Scale-SUS), and cognitive load (NASA-TLX). RESULTS: A total of 5 participants achieved a 100% task completion on all domains except ventilator data (91%). Systems demonstrated high degrees of satisfaction (Net Promoter = 65.2), acceptable usability (SUS = 66.5), and acceptable cognitive load (NASA-TLX = 41.5); with higher levels of cognitive load correlating with the number of screens employed.

The six-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) was used to measure the extent of older adults social networks. The primary mode of communication shifted from more traditional means to internet-based communications (p < .0005 in a Fishers exact test).

We synthesised the evidence from the published literature on the impact of the pandemic on suicide and self-harm in LMIC. This review is nested within a living systematic review that continuously identifies published evidence (all languages) through a comprehensive automated search of multiple databases (PubMed; Scopus; medRxiv, PsyArXiv; SocArXiv; bioRxiv; the WHO COVID-19 database; and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset by Semantic Scholar (up to 11/2020), including data from Microsoft Academic, Elsevier, arXiv and PubMed Central.)

A total of 22 studies from LMIC were identified representing data from 12 countries. There was an absence of data from Africa. The reviewed studies mostly report on the early months of COVID-19 and were generally methodologically poor. Few studies directly assessed the impact of the pandemic. The most robust evidence, from time-series studies, indicate either a reduction or no change in suicide and self-harm behaviour.

PURPOSE This study uses an interactionist perspective to assess how resources such as perceived adaptivity and organizational support for innovation serve as contextual boundary conditions of role overload in mitigating emotional exhaustion among health care workers. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from rural health care workers (n = 310). A moderated moderation analysis was performed to address the aims of the study. RESULTS The results indicate that role overload has a significant positive effect on emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, a statistically significant three-way interaction effect of perceived adaptivity, organizational support for innovation, and role overload on emotional exhaustion was observed. Organizational support for innovation was found to mitigate the negative impact of role overload on emotional exhaustion for employees with high perceived adaptivity, but not for those with low perceived adaptivity levels. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study suggest that in high-stress work environments, integrating and appropriately matching personal and organizational resources could serve as a buffer against the effects of work stressors on emotional exhaustion.

Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The TDM of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in HSI straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the MACD trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the VPM to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the HSI prior to the activation of the TDM. The VPM is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IFCTHEN semantic fuzzy rules. These qualities provide added credence to the computed HSI volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of the eFSM, when benchmarked to several established modeling techniques, as well as the observed trading returns of the proposed straddle trading system, are encouraging.","output":"Financial volatility trading using a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network and option straddle-based approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus genome replication is associated with virus-induced cytosolic double-membrane vesicles, which may provide a tailored micro-environment for viral RNA synthesis in the infected cell However, it is unclear how newly synthesized genomes and mRNAs can travel from these sealed replication compartments to the cytosol to ensure their translation and the assembly of progeny virions Here, we used cellular electron cryo-microscopy to visualize a molecular pore complex that spans both membranes of the double-membrane vesicle and would allow export of RNA to the cytosol A hexameric assembly of a large viral transmembrane protein was found to form the core of the crown-shaped complex This coronavirus-specific structure likely plays a critical role in coronavirus replication and thus constitutes a potential drug target","output":"A molecular pore spans the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the SARS CoV2 virus, commonly referred to as the COVID-19 pandemic, has impacted the social, economic, political, and cultural lives of citizens around the world The sudden outbreak of the pandemic has exposed the legal preparedness, or lack thereof, of governments to reduce and contain its drastic impact Strong legislative measures play a crucial role in any epidemic or pandemic situation In this situation, the Indian Government has requested all state governments to invoke the Epidemic Disease Act (EDA) of 1897 to address the COVID-19 emergency The Central Government has also used the powers provided in the Disaster Management Act (DMA) of 2005 As the country is facing its first major health emergency since independence, the existing legislative measures to deal with a COVID-19 like situation are lacking and require certain amendments to address such situations in the future This paper aims to present the current constitutional and legislative response to health emergencies in India and attempts to identify gray areas in the statutory provisions Based on the analysis, this paper suggests several recommendations for amending current legislation and suggests the promulgation of comprehensive public health law This paper is largely based on primary sources such as the EDA and the DMA, regulations, guidelines, rules issued by the public authorities and court cases related to health and health emergencies along with secondary resources such as newspaper articles and published papers","output":"COVID-19 and the legislative response in India: The need for a comprehensive health care law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our fights against covid-19 and obesity, our best weapon is research","output":"A pair of pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report examines the social policy response of the Government of Armenia to the Covid-19 crisis.

DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Laboratory analyses were performed in the United Kingdom at Imperial College, London and university facilities in London. Research clinics for finger prick sampling were run in two affiliated NHS trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Sensitivity analyses were performed on sera stored from 320 previous participants in the React 2 programme with confirmed previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Specificity analyses were performed on 1000 prepandemic serum samples. 100 new participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection attended study clinics for finger prick testing. INTERVENTIONS: Laboratory sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed for seven LFIAs on a minimum of 200 serum samples from participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 500 prepandemic serum samples, respectively. Three LFIAs were found to have a laboratory sensitivity superior to the finger prick sensitivity of the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence studies (84%). These LFIAs were then further evaluated through finger prick testing on participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection: two LFIAs (Surescreen, Panbio) were evaluated in clinics in June-July 2020 and the third LFIA (AbC-19) in September 2020. A spike protein enzyme linked immunoassay and hybrid double antigen binding assay were used as laboratory reference standards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy of LFIAs in detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared with two reference standards. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of seven new LFIAs that were analysed using sera varied from 69% to 100%, and from 98.6% to 100%, respectively (compared with the two reference standards). Sensitivity on finger prick testing was 77% (95% confidence interval 61.4% to 88.2%) for Panbio, 86% (72.7% to 94.8%) for Surescreen, and 69% (53.8% to 81.3%) for AbC-19 compared with the reference standards.

Overall, for internet access, there was a splitting between never (42.1%) and every day (41.0%), while only 2.7% answered at least 1/month and 14.2% at least 1/week. In the total population, the most used devices for internet access were smartphones (59.0%), and WhatsApp represented the most used app (57.3%). Internet users were younger compared to non-internet users (63 vs. 78 years old, respectively) and with a higher educational level. Age and educational level were associated with non-use of internet (age-per 10-year increase odds ratio (OR) = 3.07, 95% CI: 2.54?3.71, secondary school OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.12?0.26, university OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02?0.10).

Growing evidence has shown that the active ingredients from TCM have antibacterial, antiproliferative, antioxidant, and apoptosis-inducing features. However, poor solubility and low bioavailability limit clinical application of active compounds from TCM. Nanoformulations (NFs) are novel and advanced drug-delivery systems. They show promise for improving the solubility and bioavailability of drugs. In particular, smart responsive NFs can respond to the special external and internal stimuli in targeted sites to release loaded drugs, which enables them to control the release of drug within target tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated that smart responsive NFs can achieve targeted release of active compounds from TCM at disease sites to increase their concentrations in diseased tissues and reduce the number of adverse effects. Here, we review internal stimulusCresponsive NFs (based on pH and redox status) and external stimulusCresponsive NFs (based on light and magnetic fields) and focus on their application for active compounds from TCM against tumors and infectious diseases, to further boost the development of TCM in modern medicine.","output":"Smart Responsive Nanoformulation for Targeted Delivery of Active Compounds From Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV?2 pandemic has significant transformed society, but one issue was already visible: The idea of collaboration has changed.

Given the complex and mixed accounts of the results, questions have been raised on how large-scale digitalization programs are governed to reach health policy goals of quality improvement and equal access along with necessary digital transformations. In this qualitative systematic review, we investigate the following question: How is governance implemented and considered in the studies included in the qualitative review? OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to arrive at informed and recognizable conceptualizations and considerations of models of governance connected to eHealth, as presented and discussed in the scientific literature. In turn, we hope our results will help inform the discussion of how to govern such processes to obtain collectively negotiated objectives. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review is a method for integrating or comparing with the findings from qualitative studies. It looks for themes or constructs that lie in or across individual qualitative studies. This type of review produces a narrative synthesis with thematic analysis and includes interpretive conceptual models. The goal is an interpretation and broadens the understanding of a particular phenomenon. We searched the PubMed database using predefined search terms and selected papers published in 2010. We specified the criteria for selection and quality assessment. RESULTS: The search returned 220 papers. We selected 44 abstracts for full-text reading, and 11 papers were included for full-text synthesis. On the basis of the 11 papers, we constructed four governance models to categorize and conceptualize the findings. The models are political governance, normally depicting top-down processes; medical governance, which normally depicts bottom-up processes; the internet and global model, emphasizing international business strategies coupled with the internet; self-governance, which builds upon the development of the internet and Internet of Things, which has paved the way for personal governance and communication of ones own health data. CONCLUSIONS: Collective negotiations between the nation-state and global policy actors, medical and self-governance actors, and global business and industry actors are essential.

For example, CORT could alter the rate of contacts among hosts, pathogens and vectors through its widespread effects on host metabolism and activity levels. CORT could also affect the intensity and duration of pathogen shedding and risk of host mortality during infection. We experimentally manipulated songbird CORT, asking how CORT affected behavioural and physiological responses to a standardized West Nile virus (WNV) challenge. Although all birds became infected after exposure to the virus, only birds with elevated CORT had viral loads at or above the infectious threshold. Moreover, though the rate of mortality was faster in birds with elevated CORT compared with controls, most hosts with elevated CORT survived past the day of peak infectiousness. CORT concentrations just prior to inoculation with WNV and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations following viral exposure were predictive of individual duration of infectiousness and the ability to maintain physical performance during infection (i.e. tolerance), revealing putative biomarkers of competence. Collectively, our results suggest that glucocorticoid stress hormones could directly and indirectly mediate the spread of pathogens.","output":"Stress hormones predict a host superspreader phenotype in the West Nile virus system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The profession of nurses involves exposure to harmful agents.

This study compared the results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and a Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs a Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in thymine and adenine homopolymeric regions than the R9, at the expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions. The LSK had a larger yield than the RBK, and provided longer reads than the RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99 vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome. The results from this study suggest that the LSK preparation library provided longer DNA fragments which contributed to a better assembly of the SARS-CoV-2, despite an impaired detection of variants in a R10 flow cell.

METHODS: Upper respiratory samples of HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. A case-control study was conducted to explore the possible risk factors that lead to SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. RESULTS: Of 703 HCWs screened between March 20 and May 20, 2020, 50 (7.1%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 among physicians, nurses, cleaning personnel, and the other occupations were 6.3%, 8.0%, 9.1%, and 2.6%, respectively. The infection rate was 8.3% among HCWs who worked in COVID-19 units and 3.4% among those who did not work in COVID-19 units (RR = 2.449, CI = 1.062C5.649, p = .027). The presence of a SARS-CoV-2 positive person in the household (p = .016), inappropriate use of personnel protective equipment (PPE) while caring for patients with COVID-19 infection (p = .003), staying in the same personnel break room as an HCW without a medical mask for more than 15 minutes (p = .000), consuming food within one meter of an HCW (p = .003), and failure to keep a safe social distance from an HCW (p = .003) were statistically significant risk factors for infection. CONCLUSION: HCWs have a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to COVID-19 patients. Transmission may also occur in non-medical areas of the hospital while speaking or eating.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic reduction in the number of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and a larger time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact have been reported. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that there would also have been a reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease during the Italian lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD: s A multicenter, observational survey was conducted to collect data on hospital admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations throughout two-months (March 15th to May 15th); the years 2020 (COVID-19 Italian lockdown), 2019 and 2018 were compared. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 432.1, 432.9, 747.81 of each hospital database. The statistical significance of the difference between the event rate of one year versus the others was evaluated using Poisson Means test, assuming a constant population. RESULTS: During the 2020 lockdown, the total number of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 92 compared with 116 in 2019 and 95 in 2018. This difference was not significant.

Virol. 71:800-806, 1997). We speculate that the neurotropism of HuCV will lead to persistence within the central nervous system, as was observed for murine coronaviruses. As a first step in the verification of our hypothesis, we have characterized the susceptibility of various human neural cell lines to infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen, infectious virus progeny, and viral RNA were monitored during both acute and persistent infections. The astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG, U-373 MG, and GL-15, as well as neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, neuroglioma H4, oligodendrocytic MO3.13, and the CHME-5 immortalized fetal microglial cell lines, were all susceptible to an acute infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen and RNA and release of infectious virions were observed during persistent HuCV-OC43 infections ( approximately 130 days of culture) of U-87 MG, U-373 MG, MO3.13, and H4 cell lines. Nucleotide sequences of RNA encoding the putatively hypervariable viral S1 gene fragment obtained after 130 days of culture were compared to that of initial virus input. Point mutations leading to amino acid changes were observed in all persistently infected cell lines. Moreover, an in-frame deletion was also observed in persistently infected H4 cells. Some point mutations were observed in some molecular clones but not all, suggesting evolution of the viral population and the emergence of viral quasispecies during persistent infection of H4, U-87 MG, and MO3.13 cell lines. These results are consistent with the potential persistence of HuCV-OC43 in cells of the human nervous system, accompanied by the production of infectious virions and molecular variation of viral genomic RNA.","output":"Acute and persistent infection of human neural cell lines by human coronavirus OC43."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research and development in Collaborative Indoor Positioning Systems (CIPSs) is growing steadily due to their potential to improve on the performance of their non-collaborative counterparts.

Rolling circle amplification using DNA from harderian and parotid glands identified a novel 5.1-kb polyomavirus genome closely related to human Washington University (WU) and Karolinska Institute (KI) and vole polyomaviruses but notably divergent from Rattus norvegicus PyV1 (RnorPyV1; also designated RatPyV1). Further screening showed RatPyV2 inclusion body infection in the lung epithelium and variably in other respiratory, reproductive, and glandular tissues of 12/12 (100%) rats. IMPORTANCE Although P-PIT was developed to detect diseases associated with known human polyomaviruses, the identification of a new polyomavirus in rats suggests that it may have utility as a broad-based screen for new, as well as known polyomaviruses. Our findings suggest that RatPyV2 may be a commensal infection of laboratory rats that can lead to disseminated disease in T cell immune-deficient rats. Infection of the X-SCID rats with RatPyV2 and Pneumocystis carinii is a potential model for coinfection pathogenesis and treatment options during transplant preclinical studies.","output":"Identification and Characterization of Novel Rat Polyomavirus 2 in a Colony of X-SCID Rats by P-PIT assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV,-2 has continued to progress, and increasing information is becoming available about the incidence of digestive symptoms as well as abnormal liver-associated enzymes in patients who are infected. These are postulated to be related to the virus's use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently there is no firm evidence to suggest that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus. As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.","output":"Gastrointestinal and Liver Manifestations of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Continuity of Critical Care: Establishing a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Recovery Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many scholars and policy makers are urging the United States to expand voting-by-mail programs to safeguard the electoral process.

We collect data from 1996 to 2018 on all three US states that implemented universal vote-by-mail in a staggered fashion across counties, allowing us to use a difference-in-differences design at the county level to estimate causal effects. We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either partys share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either partys vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates.

Less than one year after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU) as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ. Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty. METHODS: Current knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). RESULTS: Based on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts. CONCLUSION: Allergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","output":"Practical handling of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines: A position paper from German and Austrian Allergy Societies AeDA, DGAKI, GPA and ?GAI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleocapsid protein N from SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most highly expressed proteins by the virus and plays a number of important roles in the transcription and assembly of the virion within the infected host cell.

The epidemic has put a number of countries under complete lockdown and the deadly situation is still prevailing around the globe. Vaccines have been long known as the most effective means of preventing viral infections. However, the lack of vaccines against COVID-19 has further worsened the situation. In this time of health crisis, it is the duty of scientific research community to provide alternative, effective and affordable strategies to vaccinate human bodies against viral infections-COVID-19 based on focused experimental approaches. Growing evidence suggests that certain natural foods and lifestyle changes have potential to optimize immune functions against viral infections including improving defense function, resistance towards invading pathogens, while maintaining self-tolerance. Boosting immune system gives an edge in fending off viruses and staying healthy. This review presents the six smart steps to add to your to-do list which let the inner work of immunity take place against viral infections-COVID-19 by dissolving the powers of disease and illness. Many of these factors are associated in their functions to improve or properly maintain the immune function such as promoting anti-inflammatory functions, inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators, modulating cell-mediated immunity, altering the antigen-presenting cellular functions as well as promoting communication between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, a scientific illustration of boosting the immune system by proper sleep, moderate exercise, avoiding stress, utilizing vitamins enriched foods, intake of more water and use of fruits and vegetables will hopefully help the community to deal with the coronavirus by vaccinating the human systems naturally.","output":"Natural Immune Boosters as First-Line Armours to Combat Viral Infection-COVID19: Myth or Science?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemothorax (HT) and pulmonary hematoma represent rare complications of anticoagulant therapy.

Flavivirus infections are often indistinct from and confused with other febrile illnesses. Here we review the specificity of published primers, and describe a new universal primer pair that can detect a wide range of flaviviruses, including viruses from each of the recognised subgroups. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 257 published full-length Flavivirus genomes revealed conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers, Flav100F and Flav200R were designed from these regions and used to generate an 800 base pair cDNA product. The region amplified encoded part of the methyltransferase and most of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (NS5) coding sequence. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful using standard conditions with RNA from over 60 different flavivirus strains representing about 50 species. The cDNA from each virus isolate was sequenced then used in phylogenetic analyses and database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA.

To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligenceCbased approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learningCbased techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. RESULTS: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligenceCenabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude.

Previous studies suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiome affects disease development. We therefore studied the effect of the nasopharyngeal microbiome on viral load and mucosal cytokine responses, two important factors influencing the pathophysiology of RSV disease. To determine the relation between (i) the microbiome of the upper respiratory tract, (ii) viral load, and (iii) host mucosal inflammation during an RSV infection, nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles of RSV infected infants (< 6 months) with different levels of disease severity and age-matched healthy controls were determined by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. The viral load was measured using qPCR. Nasopharyngeal CCL5, CXCL10, MMP9, IL6, and CXCL8 levels were determined with ELISA. RESULTS: Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients associates significantly to total nasopharyngeal microbiota composition. Healthy infants (n = 21) and RSV patients (n = 54) display very distinct microbial patterns, primarily characterized by a loss in commensals like Veillonella and overrepresentation of opportunistic organisms like Haemophilus and Achromobacter in RSV-infected individuals. Furthermore, nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles are significantly different based on CXCL8 levels. CXCL8 is a chemokine that was previously found to be indicative for disease severity and for which we find Haemophilus abundance as the strongest predictor for CXCL8 levels. CONCLUSIONS: The nasopharyngeal microbiota in young infants with RSV infection is marked by an overrepresentation of the genus Haemophilus. We present that this bacterium is associated with viral load and mucosal CXCL8 responses, both which are involved in RSV disease pathogenesis.

The relative magnitude and duration of infection- and vaccine-derived protection, alone and together, can guide public health planning and epidemic forecasting. To examine the impact of primary COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates, statewide testing, surveillance, and COVID-19 immunization data from California and New York (which account for 18% of the U.S. population) were analyzed. Four cohorts of adults aged 18 years were considered: persons who were 1) unvaccinated with no previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 4) vaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Age-adjusted hazard rates of incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in both states were compared among cohorts, and in California, hospitalizations during May 30-November 20, 2021, were also compared. During the study period, COVID-19 incidence in both states was highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis compared with that among the other three groups. During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e., accounted for >50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July. By the week beginning October 3, compared with COVID-19 cases rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, case rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 6.2-fold (California) and 4.5-fold (New York) lower; rates were substantially lower among both groups with previous COVID-19 diagnoses, including 29.0-fold (California) and 14.7-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, and 32.5-fold (California) and 19.8-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These results demonstrate that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection and related hospitalization. Importantly, infection-derived protection was higher after the Delta variant became predominant, a time when vaccine-induced immunity for many persons declined because of immune evasion and immunologic waning (2,5,6). Similar cohort data accounting for booster doses needs to be assessed, as new variants, including Omicron, circulate.

To assess the prevalence of taste disorders, authors included only cross-sectional studies, while case reports were included to assess oral mucosal lesions. No language restrictions were applied during the search and articles published until June 6th, 2020, were considered. KEY STUDY FACTOR: : This is a living systematic review (LSR) of human observational studies that assessed the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms of COVID-19, including taste disorders and oral mucosal lesions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: : The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Associations between taste disorders and: gender, COVID-19 positivity, and severity were assessed as secondary outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: : Based on thirty-three cross-sectional studies included in this LSR, the authors reported an overall prevalence of 45% (95% CI: 34% to 55%) for taste disorders in COVID-19 patients. When split into different categories of taste disorders, dysgeusia (altered taste) was prevalent in 38% (95% CI: 22% to 56%) of COVID-19 patients, while the prevalence of hypogeusia (decreased taste sensation) and ageusia (absence of taste sensation) were found to be 35% (95% CI: 21% to 51%) and 24% (95% CI, 15% to 35%), respectively. Taste disorders were found to be more prevalent in females and non-hospitalized (mild to moderate) COVID-19 patients. Reported clinical manifestations of oral mucosal lesions in COVID-19 patients ranged from white/erythematous plaque, ulcers, blisters, petechiae to desquamative gingivitis.

The aim of our study was to identify cellular and molecular processes responsible for these immunological benefits. We used a murine coronavirus (MCoV) A59 mouse model treated with the immune activating bacterial extract Broncho-Vaxom (BV) OM-85. Tissue samples were analysed with qPCR, RNA sequencing, histology, and flow cytometry. After BV OM-85 treatment, interstitial macrophages accumulated in lung tissue leading to a faster response of type I interferon (IFN) signalling after MCoV infection resulting in overall lung tissue protection. Moreover, RNA sequencing showed that lung tissue from mice receiving BV OM-85 resembled an intermediate stage between healthy and viral infected lung tissue at day 4, indicating a faster return to normal tissue homoeostasis. The pharmacologic effect was mimicked by adoptively transferring naive lung macrophages into lungs from recipient mice before virus infection. The beneficial effect of BV OM-85 was abolished when inhibiting initial type I IFN signalling. Overall, our data suggest that BV OM-85 enhances lung macrophages allowing for a faster IFN response towards a viral challenge as part of the oral-induced innate immune system training.","output":"Innate Immune Training with Bacterial Extracts Enhances Lung Macrophage Recruitment to Protect from Betacoronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic requiring the development of interventions for the prevention or treatment to curtail mortality and morbidity.

MAb362 binds to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and competitively blocks ACE2 receptor binding, by overlapping the ACE2 structural binding epitope. Furthermore, MAb362 IgA neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in 293 cells expressing ACE2. When converted to secretory IgA, MAb326 also neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus while the IgG isotype shows no neutralization.

For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multi-center study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the Quadripartite Equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium- sized liver transplant centers from twelve countries across four continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a sickest-first approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - Recipient Outcome, Donor/Graft Safety, Waiting List Mortality and Healthcare Resources for seven countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of Quadripartite Equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems to allow greater global solidarity and transparency in these austere times.","output":"An international multicentre study of protocols for liver transplantation during a pandemic: A case for quadripartite equipoise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few studies explore racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco use and access to cessation services among people with substance use disorders (SUD).

The aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 patients. Cardiac biomarkers subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. RESULTS: Increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38 and 56% of the cases, respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and d-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03, respectively). Both hs-Troponin and NP were higher in patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and d-dimer (B = 0.419, p = 0.001; B = ? 0.212, p = 0.013; and B = 0.179, p = 0.037, respectively) and of NP with age and previous CVD (B = 0.480, p < 0.001; and B = 0.253, p = 0.001, respectively).

We find that for deeper falls in the risk premium following fiscal tensions, the size of fiscal adjustments matters more than their composition.

Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, the overall risk in areas outside the Middle East remains significant as inside Saudi Arabia. Additional pandemics of MERS-CoV are expected, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Here, we used phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target MERS-CoV. A human Fab phage display library was panned against the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S2P), yielding three unique Fabs (S2A3, S2A6, and S2D5). The Fabs had moderate apparent affinities (Half maximal effective concentration (EC(50) = 123C421 nM) for MERS-S2P, showed no cross-reactivity to spike proteins from other CoVs, and were non-aggregating and thermostable (T(m) = 61.5C80.4 C). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K(D) = 0.17C1.2 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity. These apparent affinities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb (K(D) = 8.7 nM). Furthermore, two of the three mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) bound only MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)) and not other CoVs, reflecting their high binding specificity. However, the mAbs lacked MERS-CoV neutralizing activity. Given their high affinity, specificity, and desirable stabilities, we anticipate that these anti-MERS-CoV mAbs would be suitable reagents for developing antibody-based diagnostics in laboratory or hospital settings for point-of-care testing.","output":"Selection and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus through a Human Synthetic Fab Phage Display Library Panning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three techniques were compared for lowering the limit of detection (LOD) of the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) of the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on the post-assay in situ enlargement of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) on a test strip.

While primarily a respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury. The pattern of injury, referred to as acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome (ACovCS), is defined by cardiac troponin leak in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Although the etiology of the injury is unknown, many speculate that a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) may be an important factor. We aim to review recent data concerning markers of cardiac injury in ACovCS and its relation to the CRS. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiac injury was common in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with both cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) being elevated in this population. Biomarkers were correlated with illness severity and increased mortality. Cytokines such as IL-6 were more often elevated in patients with ACovCS. Myocarditis evident on cardiac MR following COVID-19 may be associated with cardiac troponin levels. The impact of dexamethasone and remdesivir, two therapies shown to have clinical benefit in COVID-19, on myocardial injury is unknown.

Older people have appeared to be less exposed to mental health deterioration compared with younger individuals, but most exposed to the risk of severe illness and death from the virus, as well as less equipped to use technologies for coping with lockdown measures. OBJECTIVE: Amongst the old population, we aim at determining how depressive symptoms have changed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and identifying individual risk factors associated with changes in reporting depression. We are particularly interested in exploring the role of pre-existing mental health problems and evaluating gender differences. METHOD: Data come from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, in particular from the first COVID-19 survey administered in summer 2020. Logistic models are estimated and Average Marginal Effects computed to take the degree of individual unobserved heterogeneity into account comparing point estimates across samples. Multiple Imputation (implemented through Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) is used to replace missing data. Statistical power of the effect sizes is estimated by a simulation approach. RESULTS: Pre-existing mental health problems, a diagnosis of affective/emotional disorders, a recent diagnosis of a major illness, and (only for men) job loss during the first wave of the outbreak are the most important risk factors. Statistical differences between genders emerge, with women experiencing higher levels of depression and greater worsening of mental health than men. CONCLUSIONS: To identify people at greater risk of depression deterioration during an outbreak it is very important to consider their pre-existing mental and general health, distinguishing severity level.

This work presents the details of the S3I methodology and, as an example, shows its application to an assemblage of Entelegynae spiders from different families collected at the Pantanos de Villa wetlands (Lima, Peru). The systematic and objective classification of the tensile properties of MAS fibers allowed by the S3I will offer insights into key aspects of the biological evolution of the material, and address questions such as how history and adaptation contributed to shape those properties. In addition, it will surely have far reaching consequences in fields such as Materials Science, and Molecular and Evolutionary Biology, by organizing the range of tensile properties exhibited by spider silk fibers.","output":"Application of the Spider Silk Standardization Initiative (S3I) methodology to the characterization of major ampullate gland silk fibers spun by spiders from Pantanos de Villa wetlands (Lima, Peru)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A recent questionnaire-based study suggested that bruxism and painful temporomandibular disorders (TMD pain) may be more prevalent in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) compared with controls. The presence of both bruxism and TMD pain may negatively influence patients quality of life. The present study is designed to clinically and more objectively investigate the presence of bruxism and TMD pain in patients with PD. The secondary aim of the study is to identify factors associated with bruxism and TMD pain in patients with PD, such as disease severity and dopaminergic medication usage. Furthermore, the presence of tooth wear in patients with PD will be studied as this can be a major consequence of bruxism. Finally, deviations in saliva composition that may contribute to tooth wear will be studied. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre observational outpatient study at the Amsterdam University Medical Centres, location VUmc. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD will be eligible for inclusion. Participants will fill in a set of questionnaires. Subsequently, patients will be examined clinically for, among others, TMD pain, presence and severity of tooth wear, and deviations in saliva composition. Sleep-time registrations will take place for 5 nights with the GrindCare GC4 (ie, a portable, single-channel electromyographic recorder) to assess sleep bruxism and simultaneously by the use of the BruxApp for 5 days to assess awake bruxism. We will partly use data collected during standard clinical care to minimise patient burden. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scientific and ethical aspects of this study protocol have been approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc; NL. 2019.143. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, if relevant presented at conferences, and published as part of a PhD thesis.

This novel coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although primarily causes significant respiratory distress, can have significant deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Severe cases of the virus frequently result in respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, often seen, but not confined to, individuals with pre-existing hypertension and cardiovascular disease, potentially due to the fact that the virus can enter the circulation via the lung alveoli. Here the virus can directly infect vascular tissues, via TMPRSS2 spike glycoprotein priming, thereby facilitating ACE-2-mediated viral entry. Clinical manifestations, such as vasculitis, have been detected in a number of vascular beds (e.g., lungs, heart, and kidneys), with thromboembolism being observed in patients suffering from severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19), suggesting the virus perturbs the vasculature, leading to vascular dysfunction. Activation of endothelial cells via the immune-mediated inflammatory response and viral infection of either endothelial cells or cells involved in endothelial homeostasis, are some of the multifaceted mechanisms potentially involved in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction within COVID-19 patients. In this review, we examine the evidence of vascular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, the potential mechanism(s) of entry into vascular tissue and the contribution of endothelial cell dysfunction and cellular crosstalk in this vascular tropism of SARS-CoV-2.

Electron microscopy revealed that, at a late stage of infection, RDV virions are released, together with small vesicles similar to secreted vesicles (exosomes), from infected cells. The incorporation of lysosomes into the multivesicular compartments raised the possibility that functions of host MVBs are required for the efficient release of RDV virions from infected insect vector cells. An actin-myosin transport system has been shown to mediate the transport of these multivesicular compartments.

We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (na?=a?3). COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils. No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent. These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways. The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin. In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.

Although thrombocytopenia is uncommon in the initial presentation, it may also reflect disease severity due to the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to activate platelets. This occurs directly through the spike protein-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction and indirectly by coagulation and inflammation activation. Dysregulation in both innate and adaptive immune systems is another critical factor that causes thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in COVID-19. Vaccination is the most potent and effective tool to mitigate COVID-19; however, rare side effects, namely vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)/thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) can occur following adenovirus-vectored vaccine administration. VITT/TTS is rare, and thrombocytopenia can be the clue to detect this serious complication. It is important to consider that thrombocytopenia and/or thromboembolism are not events limited to post-vaccination with vectored vaccine, but are also seen rarely after vaccination with other vaccines. Various conditions mimic VITT/TTS, and it is vital to achieving the correct diagnosis at an earlier stage. Antiplatelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody detection by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used for diagnosing VITT/TTS.

Design/methodology/approach The authors undertook a systematic review of the US disaster management agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), examining its programs through a lens of equity to understand how they shape disaster risk. Findings Despite a growing commitment to equity within FEMA, procedural, distributive, and contextual inequities result in interventions that perpetuate and amplify disaster risk for vulnerable and marginalized populations. Some of these inequities could be remediated by shifting toward a more bottom-up approach to disaster management, such as community-based disaster risk reduction approaches. Practical implications Disaster management agencies and other organizations can use the results of this study to better understand how to devise interventions in ways that limit risk creation for vulnerable populations, including through community-based approaches.

Since IFN response represents an early host defense event against viral infection and the fact that treatment with meliacine, a plant antiviral, ameliorate the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2, we wanted to investigate whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response. For this purpose we studied the effect of the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), which is the responsible for meliacine antiviral action, on the HSV-2 inhibition exerted by IFN , IFN- or their combination. RESULTS: We have found that like HSV-1, IFN- synergizes with IFN- to inhibit HSV-2 replication in Vero cells. While treatment with IFN- or IFN- alone has weak antiviral action, HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer. Moreover, the presence of CDM for 2 h before IFN induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treatment period, reduces virus yields in an additive way without affecting IFN antiviral action. CONCLUSION: The results reported here indicated that the presence of CDM did not alter the antiviral activity of IFN-, IFN- or the synergism exerted by their combination. As a result we can envision that the administration of CDM in vivo could not affect the biological activity of IFNs, which are so important mediators of the innate resistance to HSV-2 infection.","output":"The synergistic effect of IFN- and IFN- against HSV-2 replication in Vero cells is not interfered by the plant antiviral 1-cinnamoyl-3, 11-dihydroxymeliacarpin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with spike protein mutations raises concerns that antibodies elicited by natural infection or vaccination and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will become less effective.

Similarly, antibodies elicited by Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 with only a 3-fold decrease in titer, an effect attributable to E484K. Analysis of the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that REGN10933 has lost neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 pseudotyped viruses, and the cocktail is 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer.

These tasks are required at a time when minimizing patient interactions is recommended as a way of avoiding prolonged exposure to COVID-19 by health care personnel who often practice in settings with limited supplies of personal protective equipment. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance for clinicians for reconciling recommended standards of care for infected hospitalized patients with diabetes while also addressing the daily realities of an overwhelmed health care system in many areas of the country. The use of modified protocols for insulin administration, bedside glucose monitoring, and medications such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine that may affect glycemic control are discussed. Continuous glucose monitoring systems have been proposed as an option for reducing time spent with patients, but there are important issues that need to be addressed if these are used in hospitalized patients. On-site and remote glucose management teams have potential to provide guidance in areas where there are shortages of personnel who have expertise in inpatient glycemic management.","output":"A Pragmatic Approach to Inpatient Diabetes Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urgency - rash action in the context of strong emotion - is a facet of impulsivity closely related to many psychological disorders. Deficits in working memory and response inhibition are potential mechanisms underlying urgency, and a previous study showed that cognitive training targeting these domains is efficacious in reducing urgency. However, the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention has not yet been tested in a clinical sample or naturalistic treatment setting. To fill this gap, we conducted a pilot study of cognitive training for individuals reporting high levels of urgency in a partial hospitalization program. We evaluated this intervention in an open trial (n = 20), followed by a randomized controlled trial (n = 46) comparing cognitive training plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual. Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of cognitive training. Participants in the training group showed significant improvement on cognitive tasks, but groups did not differ in urgency. In pooled analyses combining the open trial and RCT, there was a significant reduction in distress intolerance in the training group only. Results indicate the potential benefit of cognitive training for distress intolerance, but do not support the use of cognitive training for urgency in acute clinical settings.

The results show that cleaning agents pose many kinds of health hazards, although corrosion and irritation hazards dominate, in particular for the eyes (54% of all included products). Few products were recognized as inhalation hazards. The nature of the health hazards is reflected in the occupational disease and injury statistics and PIC records for eyes and skin but not for the respiratory tract. Among occupational disease cases attributed to cleaning or disinfection agents, 61% concern skin and 26% the respiratory tract. Among occupational injury cases 64% concern chemical burns. However, only a small part (<0.5%) of all reported diseases and injuries were explicitly attributed to cleaning or disinfection agents. On average, there were 11 cases of disease attributed to cleaning or disinfection agents per million workers and year. For occupational injuries the corresponding number was 8. The data concern a broad range of sectors and occupations, but notable sectors were healthcare, accommodation and food service, and manufacturing. Women were more likely to suffer from disease, men and women equally likely to suffer from injury. PIC cases were evenly distributed between men and women, but the clear risk cases more frequently involved men. Occupational diseases increased many-fold in 2020 while injuries decreased, which could be due to COVID-19 changing use patterns of cleaning and disinfection agents at work. We conclude that cleaning agents pose a variety of risks to a large part of the workforce, although particular attention for preventive efforts may need to be directed to the healthcare, accommodation and food service, and manufacturing sectors.","output":"An Overview of Cleaning Agents' Health Hazards and Occupational Injuries and Diseases Attributed to Them in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination using the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19(AstraZeneca) has been associated with rare vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia(VITT).

What this illustrates is that there is a reciprocal, detrimental interaction between the immune and endocrine system in the context of T2D. Why these two systems would interact at all long remained unclear. Recent findings indicate that transient changes in systemic metabolism are induced by the immune system as a strategy against viral infection. In people with T2D, this system fails, thereby negatively impacting the antiviral immune response. In addition, immune-mediated changes in systemic metabolism upon infection may aggravate glycemic control in T2D.

PURPOSE: Patients with a reported ?-lactam allergy (BLA) are often given alternative perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, increasing risk of surgical site infections (SSIs), acute kidney injury (AKI), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a pharmacist-led BLA clarification interview service in the preoperative setting. METHODS: A pharmacist performed BLA clarification telephone interviews before elective procedures from November 2018 to March 2019. On the basis of allergy history and a decision algorithm, first-line preoperative antibiotics, alternative antibiotics, or allergy testing referral was recommended. The pharmacist intervention (PI) group was compared to a standard of care (SOC) group who underwent surgery from November 2017 to March 2018. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included, with 50 (57%) and 37 (43%) in the SOC and PI groups, respectively. The most common surgeries included orthopedic surgery in 41 patients (47%) and neurosurgery in 17 patients (20%). In the PI group, all BLA labels were updated after interview. Twenty-three patients were referred for allergy testing, 12 of the 23 (52%) completed BLA testing, and penicillin allergies were removed for 9 of the 12 patients. Overall, 28 of the 37 (76%) pharmacy antibiotic recommendations were accepted. Cefazolin use significantly increased from 28% to 65% after the intervention (P = 0.001). SSI occurred in 5 (10%) patients in the SOC group and no patients in the PI group (P = 0.051). All of these SSIs were associated with alternative antibiotics. Incidence of AKI and CDI was similar between the groups. No allergic reactions occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a pharmacy-driven BLA reconciliation significantly increased ?-lactam preoperative use without negative safety outcomes.","output":"Optimizing preoperative antibiotics in patients with ?-lactam allergies: A role for pharmacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes how a traditional in-person general nursing orientation was converted to a hybrid program, incorporating online and modified in-person components during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Associations between MS DMT exposure and COVID-19 hospitalisation were analysed using univariable and multivariable clustered logistic regression, where the models were clustered on the individual patients to control for patients contributing multiple COVID-19 episodes. Propensity score based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach was used to adjust for confounders.Findings: As of 18th January 2021, a total of 476 reported COVID-19 cases had been recorded in MS patients in the Swedish MS registry. Of these, 292 (61.3%) had confirmed COVID-19. The mean (SD) age at infection was 44.0 years (11.6). Of the 292 confirmed infections 68 (23.2%) required hospitalisation. A total of 49 of the 164 confirmed COVID-19 patients on rituximab at baseline (29.9%) required hospitalisation, compared to a rate of 12.7% for all other DMTs combined. Rituximab in confirmed COVID-19 patients was associated with 2.95 times the weighted odds of hospitalisation relative to treatment with any other alternate DMT combined (Odds Ratio 2.95;95% CI 1.48-5.87). The risk of severe COVID-19 increased with duration of rituximab treatment with a yearly Odds Ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 1.04-1.48).Interpretation: Rituximab treatment, known to increase the risk of severe infections in general, also confers such a risk for MS patients with COVID-19, in comparison with other MS DMTs.Funding: This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Brain Foundation.Declaration of Interest: TS has received compensation for serving on scientific advisory boards, honoraria for consultancy and funding for travel from Biogen Inc;speaker honoraria from NovartisLF declared no competing interestsKAM receives postdoctoral research funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare.AG has received research support from Novartis.JH has received honoraria for serving on advisory boards for Biogen, Celgene, Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Novartis and Sandoz and speakers fees from Biogen, Novartis, Merck KGaA, Teva and Sanofi.

METHODS The CiteSpace software was used to visually analyze the relevant research of severe COVID-19 published by CNKI and Web of Science databases from January 30th to April 20th in 2020. The analysis content included the author of the literature, the publishing institutions, and high-frequency keywords. RESULTS There were 389 Chinese literatures and 59 English literatures included. Analysis using CiteSpace software showed that there were four large teams in China currently concerning about the research on severe COVID-19. The co-authoring of each team was relatively close, but the teams were lack of cooperation. The main issuing institutions were affiliated hospitals of colleges and universities, but colleges and enterprises had less participation. The authors of English-language publications mainly had five research teams, some of whom had co-authored relationships. The country with the most enormous volume of English-language publications was China, followed by the United States and Canada. The Chinese keyword co-occurrence, clustering and highlighted words analysis showed that the main research areas of severe COVID-19 included clinical features, traditional Chinese medicine treatment, medical imaging, integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment and so on; nucleic acid detection, clinical features and diagnosis, plague theory and etiology mechanism, traditional Chinese medicine and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment, severe COVID-19 combined with diabetes and prognosis research will become future research trends; keyword cluster analysis showed that severe COVID-19, combined chronic underlying diseases, CT imaging characteristics will also become new trends in the field of research. Co-occurrence analysis of keywords in English literatures showed that the main research areas of severe COVID-19 included the names of novel coronavirus, pandemic diseases, infectious diseases, medical supplies distribution, and indicators related to myocardial damage.

Due to the lack of detailed molecular explanations, previous studies investigating which features of the pseudoknot are important to stimulate frameshifting have presented diverse conclusions. Here we constructed a bimolecular pseudoknot to dissect the interior tertiary base pairs and used single-molecule approaches to assess the structure targeted by ribosomes. We found that the first ribosome target stem was resistant to unwinding when the neighboring loop was confined along the stem; such constrained conformation was dependent on the presence of consecutive adenosines in this loop. Mutations that disrupted the distal base triples abolished all remaining tertiary base pairs. Changes in frameshifting efficiency correlated with the stem unwinding resistance. Our results demonstrate that various tertiary base pairs are coordinated inside a highly efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot and suggest a mechanism by which mechanical resistance of the pseudoknot may persistently act on translocating ribosomes.","output":"Coordination among tertiary base pairs results in an efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report here the first case of a young individual otherwise healthy, who presented with frequent focal seizures with impaired awareness as a possible long-term complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.

The protocol was 60 minutes of walking and jogging between 35% and 60% of relative VO2max. Rectal temperature (Trec), heart rate (HR), temperature and humidity inside and outside of the face mask (Tmicro_in, Tmicro_out, RHmicro_in, RHmicro_out) and perceptual variables (rating of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensation, thirst sensation, fatigue level, and overall breathing discomfort) were monitored throughout all trials. RESULTS Mean Trec and HR increased at 30- and 60-minute time points compared with 0-minute time points, but no difference existed between face mask trials and control trials (P > 0.05). Mean Tmicro_in, RHmicro_in, and humidity difference inside and outside of the face mask (RHmicro) were significantly different between face mask trials (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in perceptual variables between face mask trials and control trials (P > 0.05), except overall breathing discomfort (P < 0.01). Higher RHmicro_in, RPE, and thermal sensation significantly predicted higher overall breathing discomfort (r2 = 0.418; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Face mask use during 60 minutes of low-to-moderate exercise intensity in the heat did not significantly affect Trec or HR. Although face mask use may affect overall breathing discomfort due to the changes in the face mask microenvironment, face mask use itself did not cause an increase in whole body thermal stress. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Face mask use is feasible and safe during exercise in the heat, at low-to-moderate exercise intensities, for physically active, healthy individuals.","output":"Effects of Face Mask Use on Objective and Subjective Measures of Thermoregulation During Exercise in the Heat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physical activity, nutrition and other lifestyle factors play important roles in maintaining musculoskeletal health. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated in late 2019, spread globally to be declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020, and led to widespread behaviour change. The aim of this study was to use two existing cohorts, the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS) and Health and Employment After Fifty Study (HEAF), to understand how wave one of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted lifestyle factors associated with musculoskeletal health in the UK. METHODS: 125 eligible participants, 65 males and 60 females (drawn from the HCS study, median (IQR) age 84.3 (82.4-86.6) years, all Caucasian, and community dwelling) were contacted by telephone and asked to complete a questionnaire administered by a trained researcher. Data collection occurred over the period July 2020 to February 2021. 2469 participants, 1086 men and 1383 women (drawn from the HEAF study, median age 65.7 (62.0-69.3) years, mostly Caucasian and community dwelling) completed an online questionnaire in March 2021. RESULTS: In HCS, 47% respondents reported being less physically active than before the pandemic (and only 5% more so), 27% said they consumed less alcohol compared to pre-pandemic times (and only 3% more so), and 18% reported eating less than before, although quality of diet was generally unchanged over this timeframe surveyed. In HEAF, 44% participants said they were less active than before the pandemic, while 17% reported being more active. The majority of participants reported no changes in alcohol consumption and diet; however, 19% said they drank more than before (32% of which was above recommended levels), 16% said their diet was less healthy, and 19% reported eating more than before. CONCLUSION: We have reported the experience of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among participants of two Caucasian community dwelling UK cohorts, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on lifestyle factors associated with musculoskeletal health. Changed physical activity levels were reported in a high proportion of respondents in both studies; an investigation of reversibility of these changes is required.","output":"Physical Activity and Diet in a Global Pandemic: An Investigation of the Impact of COVID-19 on Factors Relevant for Musculoskeletal Health at Two Different Stages of the Lifecourse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analysis, migration, and childhood exposure of methylsiloxanes (MSs) in 32 silicone infant bottle nipples marketed in China were studied. Thirty types of MSs in two families, which included 11 linear MSs (LMSs, L4-L14) and 19 cyclic MSs (CMSs, D4-D22), were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) associated with standards, retention index, and carbon number rule. In 32 nipples, MSs with molecular weight < 1000 Da and CMSs were predominant. Considering the actual daily use of bottle nipples, the migration tests of MSs from nipples to artificial saliva and reconstituted powdered formula were performed. In particular, the orthogonal test design-QuEChERS-GC/MS was employed to detect MSs in formula. The median migration level of MSs (MW < 1000 Da) in formula was 950.9 ng/mL, which was much higher than that in artificial saliva (98.1 ng/mL). If formula is fed to children aged 3-36 months using bottle nipples according to product instructions, the daily oral exposure to MSs (MW < 1000) for children ranged from 52 to 146 g/kg bw-day, which were two to five orders of magnitude higher than those of other exposure pathways. In sum, oral intake (especially through formula) may be the predominant pathway of exposure of MSs in children. This research enhances our understanding of the oral exposure risks of MSs and provides useful information that could aid the development of risk management strategies.","output":"Identification, migration, and childhood exposure of methylsiloxanes in silicone infant bottle nipples marketed in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The percentage of the population in urban areas has increased by ten points from 2000 (46%) to 2020 (56%);it is expected to reach up to 70% by 2050 This undoubtedly will encourage society to use alternative transports On the other hand, the widespread fear of pandemics seems to be here to stay, and it is causing most people to leave public transport to use private cars, and a few have chosen unipersonal electric vehicles As a consequence, the decision of using private cars negatively affects the air quality, and consequently urban population health This paper aims to demonstrate a sustainable solution for urban mobility based on a hydrogen powered unipersonal electric vehicle, which, as shown, provides great advantages over the conventional battery powered unipersonal electric vehicle To show this, the authors have developed both vehicles in comparable versions, using the same platform, and ensuring that the total weight of the unipersonal electric vehicle was the same in both cases They have been subjected to experimental tests that support the features of the hydrogen-based configuration versus the battery-based one, including higher specific energy, more autonomy, and shorter recharge time","output":"Hydrogen vs. Battery-Based Propulsion Systems in Unipersonal VehiclesDeveloping Solutions to Improve the Sustainability of Urban Mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID-19 constituted one of the greatest ordeals the world has seen in the last decades.

It has to date affected 24,240,000 individuals and killed 2,735,805 people worldwide. The highly infectious virus attacks mainly the lung causing fever, cough and fatigue in symptomatic patients, but also pneumonia in severe cases. However, growing evidence highlights SARS-CoV-2-mediated extra-respiratory manifestations, namely gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic complications. The detection of (i) the virus in the GI system (duodenum, colon, rectum, anal region and feces); (ii) the high expression of additional candidate co-receptors/auxiliary proteins to facilitate the virus entry; (iii) the abundant viral angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor; (iv) the substantial expression of host transmembrane serine protease 2, necessary to induce virus-cell fusion; (v) the viral replication in the intestinal epithelial cells; and (vi) the primarily GI disorders in the absence of respiratory symptoms lead to increased awareness of the risk of disease transmission via the fecal-oral route. The objectives of this review are to provide a brief update of COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevalence, present a critical overview of its GI and liver complications that affect clinical COVID-19 outcomes, clarify associated mechanisms (notably microbiota-related), define whether gut/liver disorders occur more frequently among critically ill patients with COVID-19, determine the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing gut/liver complications and vice versa, and discuss the available strategies for prevention and treatment to improve prognosis of the patients.","output":"Critical appraisal of the mechanisms of gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary infection by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on effective treatment of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) at early stages and substantiates the requirement for antiviral therapy and for decreasing the viral load to prevent the infection progression. The absence of a specific antiviral therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is stated. The authors analyzed results of early randomized studies using lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir in COVID-19 and their potential for the treatment of novel coronavirus infection. Among the drugs blocking the virus entry into cells, the greatest attention was paid to the antimalaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The article addresses in detail ineffectiveness and potential danger of hydroxychloroquine, which demonstrated neither a decrease in the time of clinical recovery nor any improvement of prognosis for patients with COVID-19. The major objective was substantiating a possible use of bromhexine, a mucolytic and anticough drug, which can inhibit transmembrane serin protease 2 required for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells.

Both patients were on long-term warfarin therapy with their most recent international normalized ratio (INR) prior to admission within their patient specific goal as managed by their outpatient Pharmacist. In both instances, the patients denied any changes in diet, lifestyle, or missed doses of medications upon admission interview. During admission, both patients experienced a marked elevation in INR within 24 to 48 hours of the initiation of remdesivir with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia directed therapy. The patients were both eventually stable and were instructed to continue warfarin monitoring and management under the direction of their outpatient Pharmacist upon discharge.

Here we show the unprecedented decrease in global fossil CO2 emissions from January to April 2020 was of 7.8% (938 Mt CO2 with a +6.8% of 2- uncertainty) when compared with the period last year. In addition other emerging estimates of COVID impacts based on monthly energy supply or estimated parameters, this study contributes to another step that constructed the near-real-time daily CO2 emission inventories based on activity from power generation (for 29 countries), industry (for 73 countries), road transportation (for 406 cities), aviation and maritime transportation and commercial and residential sectors emissions (for 206 countries). The estimates distinguished the decline of CO2 due to COVID-19 from the daily, weekly and seasonal variations as well as the holiday events. The COVID-related decreases in CO2 emissions in road transportation (340.4 Mt CO2, -15.5%), power (292.5 Mt CO2, -6.4% compared to 2019), industry (136.2 Mt CO2, -4.4%), aviation (92.8 Mt CO2, -28.9%), residential (43.4 Mt CO2, -2.7%), and international shipping (35.9Mt CO2, -15%). Regionally, decreases in China were the largest and earliest (234.5 Mt CO2,-6.9%), followed by Europe (EU-27 & UK) (138.3 Mt CO2, -12.0%) and the U.S. (162.4 Mt CO2, -9.5%). The declines of CO2 are consistent with regional nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based networks, but the calculated signal of emissions decreases (about 1Gt CO2) will have little impacts (less than 0.13ppm by April 30, 2020) on the overserved global CO2 concertation.

All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients' clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients' medical records and then evaluated for each group.

Readily available, alcohol is often one of the drugs of choice for adolescents. Whereas in the past 30 years, the overall consumption of alcohol is down, the data in the past 10 years have shown more girls are binge drinking and meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). The alarm of early alcohol use is the association with problems with the substances later in life. Historically, men and male adolescents consumed more alcohol than females. Recent studies indicate girls' alcohol use surpasses boys, whereas women now are developing AUD at the same rate as men. The consequences of early use can result in women's increased risk for multiple cancers, having a more severe form of AUD with less alcohol consumption as well as premature death. To further exacerbate this growing concern, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a perfect storm for increased use of alcohol to cope with the stress of living in an uncertain world. Normal daily activities have been halted with the uncertainty of school closures, zoom classroom sessions, and living in mandated social isolation. All nurses need to be screening for how families under their care have been managing stress. The time is opportune to educate and support parents in engaging their children in conversations around substance use. Parents can be supported to increase awareness of their own coping mechanisms and strengthen positive coping. Adolescents need support to strengthen interpersonal skills as well as make informed decisions concerning when and how they engage in alcohol consumption.

With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169C284 944), only 0.07% of the SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0C249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is expected and if high sequence depth is desired.","output":"Single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA) combined with next generation sequencing provides complete bovine coronavirus genome coverage and higher sequence depth compared to sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information on the spatiotemporal variability of respirable suspended particulate pollutant matter concentrations, especially of particles having size of 2.5m and climate are the important factors in relation to emerging COVID-19 cases around the world.

We used a mixed-methods, digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID (1/1/2020-2/29/2020) and COVID (3/1/2020-6/1/2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, \\"r/KidneyStones,\\" which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis. RESULTS: We extracted n=649 posts (250 pre-COVID, 399 COVID); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID, 239 COVID) that described stone-related decision-making prior to intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID, based on sentiment analysis (P<0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (P<0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting ER increased from 5.1 mm to 10.5 mm (P<0.001). The proportion of discussants preferring conservative management with stones &#8805;10 mm increased (12.5% pre-COVID versus 26% during COVID, P=0.002). Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (P<0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm.

We use a sample of South Korean citizens and a vignette-based survey experiment describing applying for a small business COVID-19 relief fund to test the relevance of rule legitimacy for perceived red tape. We find that obtaining a favorable outcome (receiving the fund) reduces perceived red tape, but that neither input nor output legitimacy plays a consistent role. Second, we find that public service motivation moderates the role of both input and output legitimacy on perceived red tape, though in different directions.

Sometimes, the price has exhibited big jumps. Bitcoin prices have also had extreme, unexpected crashes. We test the predictive power of a wide range of determinants on bitcoins price direction under the continuous transfer entropy approach as a feature selection criterion. Accordingly, the statistically significant assets in the sense of permutation test on the nearest neighbour estimation of local transfer entropy are used as features or explanatory variables in a deep learning classification model to predict the price direction of bitcoin. The proposed variable selection do not find significative the explanatory power of NASDAQ and Tesla. Under different scenarios and metrics, the best results are obtained using the significant drivers during the pandemic as validation. In the test, the accuracy increased in the post-pandemic scenario of July 2020 to January 2021 without drivers. In other words, our results indicate that in times of high volatility, Bitcoin seems to self-regulate and does not need additional drivers to improve the accuracy of the price direction.","output":"What Drives Bitcoin?

Although hydroxychloroquine was evaluated for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis, it is not evaluated for COVID-19 PrEP yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine against placebo in healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during an epidemic period.MethodsWe conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. From 350 adult healthcare workers screened, we included 269 participants with no active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection (determined by a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and a negative serology against SARS-CoV-2). Participants allocated in the intervention arm (PrEP) received 400mg of hydroxychloroquine daily the first four consecutive days and subsequently, 400mg weekly during the study period. Participants in the control group followed the same treatment schedule with placebo tablets. Results52.8% of participants were in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 47.2% in the placebo arm. Both groups showed similar proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event (AE) (p=0.548). No serious AE were reported. Almost all AE (96.4%) were mild. Only mild gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly higher in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the placebo arm (28.3% vs 16.9%, p=0.044). Given the national epidemic incidence decay, only one participant in each group was COVID-19 diagnosed. Consequently, our study design deemed underpowered to evaluate any benefit regarding PrEP efficacy.ConclusionsFirst month follow-up analysis displayed that PrEP with hydroxychloroquine at low doses is safe.Trial registration ?

METHOD: In this study, we performed a pooled analysis of miR-1 expression data derived from public databases, such as GEO, ArrayExpress, TCGA, and GTEx. The miRWalk 2.0 database, combined with the mRNA microarray datasets, was used to screen the target genes, and the genes were then subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the DAVID 6.8 database. We then used the STRING 11.0 database and Cytoscape 3.80 software to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for screening hub genes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was further used to validate the expression of hub genes. Finally, potential therapeutic agents for NPC were screened by the Connectivity Map (cMap) database. RESULTS: Pooled analysis showed that miR-1 expression was significantly decreased in NPC (SMD = ?0.57; P < 0.05). The summary receiver operating characteristic curve suggested that miR-1 had a good ability to distinguish cancerous tissues from noncancerous tissues (AUC = 0.78). The results of GO analysis focused on mitotic nuclear division, DNA replication, cell division, cell adhesion, extracellular space, kinesin complex, and extracellular matrix (ECM) structural constituent. The KEGG analysis suggested that the target genes played a role in key signaling pathways, such as cell cycle, focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The PPI network suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) was the hub gene, and the CDK1 protein was subsequently confirmed to be significantly upregulated in NPC tissues by IHC. Finally, potential therapeutic drugs, such as masitinib, were obtained by the cMap database. CONCLUSION: miR-1 may play a vital part in NPC tumorigenesis and progression by regulating focal adhesion kinase to participate in cell mitosis, regulating ECM degradation, and affecting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. miR-1 has the potential to be a therapeutic target for NPC.","output":"Downregulation of MicroRNA-1 and Its Potential Molecular Mechanism in Nasopharyngeal Cancer: An Investigation Combined with In Silico and In-House Immunohistochemistry Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Biotin, a water-soluble B vitamin, has demonstrable anti-inflammatory properties. A biotin-deficient diet induced a colitis-like phenotype in mice, alleviable by biotin substitution. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis showed biotin deficiency and diminished levels of sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter, a protein involved in biotin absorption. Biotin substitution induced remission by reducing activation of NF-B, a transcription factor involved in intestinal permeability and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated for the first time a possible clinical role of biotin status in IBD. Methods: In a comparative, retrospective, cross-sectional study, serum samples of 138 patients with IBD (67 female; 72 Crohns disease (CD), 66 ulcerative colitis (UC)) aged 18C65 years and with a mean age (SD) of 42.5  14.3 years as well as 80 healthy blood donors (40 female; 40.0  10.0 years; range 20C60 years) were analyzed. Inflammation was defined as hsCRP 5 mg/L, and to determine biotin status, serum 3-hydroxyisovaleryl carnitine (3HIVc) levels were measured by LC-MS/MS. Results: A total of 138 patients with IBD (67f; 72CD/66 UC; 42.5  14.3 years) were enrolled: 83/138 had inflammation. Mean serum 3HIVc levels were significantly higher in IBD patients but unaffected by inflammation. Biotin deficiency (95th percentile of controls: >30 nmol/L 3HIVc) was significantly more common in IBD patients versus controls. Conclusion: High serum 3HIVc levels and biotin deficiency were associated with IBD but not inflammatory activity or disease type. Our findings suggest biotin may play a role as cause or effect in IBD pathogenesis. Routine assessment and supplementation of biotin may ameliorate IBD and support intestinal integrity.","output":"Relevance of Biotin Deficiency in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Utility of Serum 3 Hydroxyisovaleryl Carnitine as a Practical Everyday Marker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridium difficile was investigated as a possible cause of enteritis in calves.

However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups.

Objective: To assess both long-term effects and sustainability of financial incentives for general practitioners (GPs) in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus based on quality indicators (QIs) calculated from routine data from electronic medical records. Design/Participants: Randomized controlled trial using routine data from electronic medical records of patients with diabetes mellitus of Swiss GPs. Intervention: During the study period of 24 months, all GPs received bimonthly feedback reports with information on their actual treatment as reflected in QIs. In the intervention group, the reports were combined with financial incentives for quality improvement. The incentive was stopped after 12 months. Measurements: Proportion of patients meeting the process QI of annual HbA1c measurements and the clinical QI of blood pressure levels below 140/85 mmHg. Results: A total of 71 GPs from 43 different practices were included along with 3,854 of their patients with diabetes mellitus. Throughout the study, the proportion of patients with annual HbA1c measurements was stable in the intervention group (78.8C78.9%) and decreased slightly in the control group (81.5C80.2%) [odds ratio (OR): 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04C1.42, p < 0.05]. The proportion of patients achieving blood pressure levels below 140/85 mmHg decreased in the control group (51.2C47.2%) and increased in the intervention group (49.7C51.9%) (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04C1.35, p < 0.05) where it peaked at 54.9% after 18 months and decreased steadily over the last 6 months. Conclusion: After the withdrawal of financial incentives for the GPs after 12 months, some QIs still improved, indicating that 1 year might be too short to observe the full effect of such interventions. The decrease in QI achievement rates after 18 months suggests that the positive effects of time-limited financial incentives eventually wane.","output":"Long-Term Effects of Financial Incentives for General Practitioners on Quality Indicators in the Treatment of Patients With Diabetes Mellitus in Primary CareA Follow-Up Analysis of a Cluster Randomized Parallel Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Uganda has a unique set up comprised of resource-constrained economy, social-economic challenges, politically diverse regional neighborhood and home to long-standing refuge crisis that comes from long and protracted conflicts of the great lakes.

High-sensitivity assays can effectively aid clinical decision-making and intervene in cancer in a localized status before they metastasize and become unmanageable. Meanwhile, it is equally pivotal to prevent overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening cancer by eliminating unnecessary treatment and repeated blood draws. Unfortunately, current clinical screening methodologies can hardly simultaneously attain sufficient sensitivity and specificity, especially under resource-restrained circumstances. To circumvent such limitations, particularly for cancer biomarkers from early-onset and recurrence, we aim to develop a universal plasmonic platform for clinical applications, which macroscopically amplifies multiplexed fluorescence signals in a broad spectral window and readily adapts to current assay setups without sophisticated accessories or expertise at low cost. METHODS: The plasmonic substrate was chemically synthesized in situ at the solidCliquid interface by rationally screening a panel of reducing monosaccharides and tuning the redox reactions at various catalyst densities and precursor concentrations. The redox properties were studied by Benedicts assay and electrochemistry. We systemically characterized the morphologies and optical properties of the engineered plasmonic Ag structures by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy. The structure-fluorescence enhancement correlation was explicitly explained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and a computational model for gap distribution. Next, we established an enhanced fluoroimmunoassay (eFIA) using a model biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa) and validated it in healthy and PCa cohorts. Prognosis was explored in patients subject to surgical and hormonal interventions following recommended PCa guidelines. RESULTS: The monosaccharide-mediated redox reaction yielded a broad category of Ag structures, including sparsely dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, semi-continuous nanoislands, and crackless continuous films. Optimal broad-spectral fluorescence enhancement from green to far-red was observed for the inhomogeneous, irregularly-shaped semi-continuous Ag nanoisland substrate (AgNIS), synthesized from a well-balanced redox reaction at a stable rate mediated by mannose. In addition, different local electric field intensity distributions in response to various incident excitations were observed at the nanoscale, elucidating the need for irregular and inhomogeneous structures. AgNIS enabled a maximized 54.7-fold macroscopically amplified fluorescence and long-lasting photostability. Point-of-care availability was fulfilled using a customized smartphone prototype with well-paired optics. The eFIA effectively detected the PCa marker in cell lines, xenograft tumors, and patient sera. The plasmonic platform rendered a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.0% and a specificity of 94.7% and capably staged high-grade PCa that the clinical gold standard test failed to stratify. Patient prognosis of robotic-assisted surgeries and hormone therapies was non-invasively monitored following efficient medical interventions. The assay time was significantly curtailed on the plasmonic platform upon microwave irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: By investigating the effects of reducing monosaccharides on the seed-mediated chemical synthesis of plasmonic Ag structures, we deduced that potent multiplexed fluorescence enhancement originated from both an adequate reducing power and a steady reduction rate. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous structure with adequate medium gap distances afforded optimal multiwavelength fluorescence enhancement, thus empowering an effective eFIA for PCa. The clinically validated diagnostic and prognostic features, along with the low sample volume, point-of-care feasibility with a smartphone, and microwave-shortened assay time, warrant its potential clinical translation for widespread cancer biomarker analysis.

Additionally, when patients meet the NIH diagnostic criteria, many already have significant morbidity and possibly irreversible organ damage. The goals of this early diagnosis project are 2-fold. First, we provide consensus recommendations regarding implementation of the current NIH diagnostic guidelines into routine transplant care, outside of clinical trials, aiming to enhance early clinical recognition of chronic GVHD. Second, we propose directions for future research efforts to enable discovery of new, early laboratory as well as clinical indicators of chronic GVHD, both globally and for highly morbid organ-specific manifestations. Identification of early features of chronic GVHD that have high positive predictive value for progression to more severe manifestations of the disease could potentially allow for future pre-emptive clinical trials.","output":"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease: IIa.

METHODS A total of 133 consenting patients (98 female, 35 male; mean age, 45.6  11.7 years) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 65 patients, 105 nerves), superior thyroid pole dissection was performed with no attempt to identify the EBSLN; in group 2 (n = 68 patients, 106 nerves), IONM was used to identify the EBSLN during surgery. EBSLN function was evaluated by intraoperative electromyography of the cricothyroid muscle. The EBSLN Voice Impairment Index-5 (VII-5) was conducted preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the prevalence of EBSLN injury. The secondary outcomes were the identification rate of the EBSLN using IONM and changes in postoperative voice performance. RESULTS EBSLN injury was detected in eight (12.3%) patients and nine (8.6%) nerves in group 1 and in one (1.5%) patient and one (0.9%) nerve in group 2 (patients, p = 0.015; nerves, p = 0.010). IONM contributed significantly to visual (p < 0.001) and functional (p < 0.001) nerve identification in group 2. The VII-5 indicated more voice changes in group 1 than 2 at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.012, p = 0.015, and p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION IONM contributes to visual and functional identification of the EBSLN and decreases the rate of EBSLN injury during superior pole dissection. Routine use of IONM to identify the EBSLN will minimize the risk of injury during thyroidectomy.","output":"Contribution of intraoperative neural monitoring to preservation of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve: a randomized prospective clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia is a common cause of hospital admission and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a growing health problem in developed country and worldwide.

NYC Health and Hospitals established rapid medical screening exams (MSE) and each hospital designated areas to perform their MSE. Five of the 11 hospitals created a forward treatment area (FTA) external to the ED to disposition patients before entering who presented with COVID\\\\like symptoms. Three hospitals used paper\\\\based, and 2 used an electronic medical record (EMR)\\\\based MSE. This study evaluated the effectiveness of safely discharging patients home from the FTA while also evaluating the efficiency of using paper\\\\based versus EMR\\\\based MSEs. METHODS: Charts were reviewed using standardized data extraction templates. Patients discharged from the FTA were contacted by phone, and a structured interview captured additional data regarding subsequent clinical courses. Chi\\\\square tests were used to compare proportions of patients hospitalized, as well as proportions of patients with vital signs recorded. Mortality rates were compared with Fisher exact test. A logistic regression model with fixed effects to account for clustering at hospitals was used to compare the odds of being sent to the ED for further evaluation based on vital signs and adjusted for age and sex RESULTS: Across 5 EDs, 3335 patients were evaluated in their FTAs from March 17, 2020, to April 27, 2020. A total of 970 (29.1%) patients were referred for further evaluation into the ED, of which 203 (20.9%) were hospitalized and 19 (2.0%) died. Of 2302 patients discharged from the FTA, 182 (7.9%) returned to the ED within 7 days, resulting in 42 (1.8%) hospitalizations and 7 (0.3%) deaths. Facilities using EMR\\\\MSE discharged more patients from their FTA (81.9% vs 65.3%, P < 0.001) and had similar 7\\\\day return (9.3% vs 7.1%, P = 0.055) and mortality rates (0.49% vs 0.20%, P = 0.251). CONCLUSION: MSEs in an FTA are an effective process to disposition patients safely in a high\\\\volume situation. Differences exist in paper\\\\ versus EMR\\\\based approaches, suggesting EMR\\\\MSEs provide better data, efficiency, and effectiveness. This suggests prioritizing an EMR\\\\based MSE should be considered in future circumstances.","output":"The impact and efficiency of medical screening exams in forward treatment areas at New York City public hospitals during the initial COVID\\\\19 surge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) have a wide range of geographic distribution and have been isolated from humans and various animals.

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19 ). Because of its immunomodulatory action, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients developing COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS: The trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of IVIG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28 days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28 days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of IVIG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IVIG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level.

Since there was no causal therapy for the viral disease, exposure prophylaxis was of particular importance. Ultimately, it was only through the development of vaccines that infantile paralysis could be permanently reduced. In 1960, the SabinCTschumakow oral vaccine was administered in the former German Democratic Republic GDR for the first time in Germany. Within one year, this vaccine succeeded in almost completely eradicating polio in the GDR. The article uses unpublished archival material to trace the systematic vaccination campaign using the example of the then district capital Halle (Saale). There alone, 63,328 children and adolescents were immunized within three days in May 1960. With 78,085 vaccinees recorded in advance, this corresponded to a rate within the polio-vulnerable population group of around 81%.

This pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial aims to increase DVA identification and referral (primary outcomes) threefold and safety planning (secondary outcome) among diverse women attending intervention vs comparison primary care clinics. Additionally, the study plans to improve recording of DVA, ethnicity, and conduct process and economic evaluations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Recruitment of 28 primary care clinics in Melbourne, Australia with high migrant/refugee communities. Eligible clinics need 1 South Asian general practitioner (GP) and one of two common software programmes to enable aggregated routine data extraction by GrHanite. Intervention staff undertake three DVA training sessions from a GP educator and bilingual DVA advocate/educator. Following training, clinic staff and DVA affected women 18+ will be supported for 12 months by the advocate/educator. Comparison clinics are trained in ethnicity and DVA data entry and offer routine DVA care. Data extraction of DV identification, safety planning and referral from routine GP data in both arms. Adjusted regression analysis by intention-to-treat by staff blinded to arm. Economic evaluation will estimate cost-effectiveness and costCutility.

Previously, autoantibodies directed against melanocortin peptides were found in patients with eating disorders; however, it remains unknown whether autoantibodies directed against other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera and whether their levels are influenced by gut-related antigens. METHODS: Healthy women were studied for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoantibodies directed against 14 key appetite-regulating peptides. The concept of molecular mimicry was applied to search in silico whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi contain proteins with amino acid sequences identical to appetite-regulating peptides. In addition, autoantibodies serum levels were studied in germ-free and specific pathogen-free rats. RESULTS: We found these IgG and IgA autoantibodies directed against leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera at levels of 100C900 ng/mL. Numerous cases of sequence homology with these peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species. Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies directed against several appetite-regulating peptides and increased levels of antighrelin IgG were found in germ-free rats compared with specific pathogen-free rats. CONCLUSION: Healthy humans and rats display autoantibodies directed against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides, suggesting that these autoantibodies may have physiologic implications in hunger and satiety pathways. Gut-related antigens including the intestinal microflora may influence production of theses autoantibodies, suggesting a new link between the gut and appetite control.","output":"Autoantibodies against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides: Putative modulation by gut microflora"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Virtual care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) allows providers to monitor COVID-19-positive patients with variable trajectories while reducing the risk of transmission to others and ensuring health care capacity in acute care facilities. The objective of this descriptive analysis was to assess the initial adoption, feasibility and safety of a family medicine-led remote monitoring program, COVIDCare@Home, to manage the care of patients with COVID-19 in the community. METHODS: COVIDCare@Home is a multifaceted, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program developed at an ambulatory academic centre, the Women's College Hospital in Toronto. A descriptive analysis of the first cohort of patients admitted from Apr. 8 to May 11, 2020, was conducted. Lessons from the implementation of the program are described, focusing on measure of adoption (number of visits per patient total, with a physician or with a nurse; length of follow-up), feasibility (received an oximeter or thermometer; consultation with general internal medicine, social work or mental health, pharmacy or acute ambulatory care unit) and safety (hospitalizations, mortality and emergency department visits). RESULTS: The COVIDCare@Home program cared for a first cohort of 97 patients (median age 41 yr, 67% female) with 415 recorded virtual visits. Patients had a median time from positive testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to first appointment of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) days, with a median virtual follow-up time of 8 (IQR 5-10) days. A total of 4 (4%) had an emergency department visit, with no patients requiring hospitalization and no deaths; 16 (16%) of patients required support with mental and social health needs.

Firstly, we selected SCPs with positive amino acid residues on N- and C- terminals under 500 Dalton via RStudio. Secondly, the overlapping targets between the bacteria-responsive targets (TTD and OMIM) and AMPs targets were visualized by VENNY 2.1. Thirdly, the overlapping targets between AFPs targets and fungal-responsive targets were exhibited by VENNY 2.1. Fourthly, the overlapping targets between cancer-related targets (TTD and OMIM) and fungal-responsive targets were displayed by VENNY 2.1. Finally, a molecular docking study (MDS) was carried out to discover the most potent peptides on a hub signaling pathway. A total of 1833 SCPs were identified, and AMPs, AFPs, and ACPs filtration suggested that 197 peptides (30 targets), 81 peptides (6 targets), and 59 peptides (4 targets) were connected, respectively.

Male rats received daily 100 mg/kg of diacerein (DIAG; n = 8) or saline (CG; n = 8) for 30 days. Serum testosterone (T) levels were measured and the seminiferous tubule (ST) area, epithelial area (EA), frequency of damaged ST and number of Sertoli cells (SC) were evaluated. TUNEL method and immunoreactions for detection of pro-IL-1, TNF-, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17-HSD), androgen receptor (AR) and scavenger receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes (CD163), a TM marker, were performed. Testicular AR, 17-HSD and IL-1 levels were detected by Western blot. Data were submitted to Student t test (p  0.05). In DIAG, T and testicular AR, 17-HSD and IL-1 levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The number of TUNEL-positive interstitial cells increased and LC showed weak StAR, 17-HSD and AR immunoexpression in association with reduced IL-1 immunoexpression and number of CD163-positive TM in the interstitial tissue from diacerein-treated rats. Numerous damaged ST were found in DIAG, and reduction in the EA were associated with germ cells death. Moreover, the number of SC reduced and weak AR and TNF- immunoexpression was observed in SC and germ cells, respectively. The cytokines deficiency induced by diacerein impairs TM, LC and spermatogenesis, and points to a role of IL-1 in steroidogenesis under normal conditions.

While not standardized, these practices can be roughly divided into two categories, namely heat inactivation and solvent-detergent treatments. These routine procedures should also apply to samples intended for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) analysis. Assessing the impact of virus-inactivating pre-treatments is therefore of pivotal importance, given the well-known variability introduced by different pre-analytical steps on downstream EVs isolation and analysis. Arguably, shared guidelines on inactivation protocols tailored to best address EVs-specific requirements will be needed among the analytical community, yet deep investigations in this direction have not yet been reported. We here provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 inactivation practices to be adopted prior to serum EVs analysis by comparing solvent/detergent treatment vs. heat inactivation. Our analysis entails the evaluation of EVs recovery and purity along with biochemical, biophysical and biomolecular profiling by means of a set of complementary analytical techniques: Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Western Blotting, Atomic Force Microscopy, miRNA content (digital droplet PCR) and tetraspanin assessment by microarrays. Our data suggest an increase in ultracentrifugation (UC) recovery following heat treatment; however, it is accompanied by a marked enrichment in EVs-associated contaminants. On the other hand, solvent/detergent treatment is promising for small EVs (<150 nm range), yet a depletion of larger vesicular entities was detected.

N = 832 subjects were randomly assigned to view mitigation messaging with either approach or avoidance framing, and either self-protective or altruistic goal-orientation. We observed a significant effect of goal-orientation, such that altruistic (versus self-protective) goal-orientations in messaging lead to stronger intentions to follow mitigation procedures. No significant effect of approach or avoidance framing was found on intentions to follow mitigation procedures. These results suggest an immediate need to address the wording of our public health messages.

We examined the factors that have shaped the priority of global emergency care and highlight potential responses by emergency care advocates. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with key experts in global emergency care practice, public health, health policy and advocacy. We then applied a policy framework based on political ethnography and content analysis to code for underlying themes. RESULTS: We identified problem definition, coalition building, paucity of data and positioning, as the main challenges faced by emergency care advocates. Problem definition remains the key issue, with divergent ideas on what emergency care is, should be and what solutions are to be prioritised. Proponents have struggled to portray the urgency of the issue in a way that commands action from decision-makers. The lack of data further limits their effectiveness. However, there is much reason for optimism given the networks commitment to the issue, the emerging leadership and the existence of policy windows.

A six-state multistate model was built and 17 transitions were analyzed either using a non-parametric approach or a Cox proportional hazard model. Corticosteroids and IL-antagonists (tocilizumab and anakinra) effects were evaluated using G-computation. We included 382 patients in the analysis: 243 patients were admitted to the ICU with non-invasive ventilation, 116 with invasive mechanical ventilation, and 23 with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The predicted 60-day mortality was 25.9% (95% CI: 21.8%C30.0%), 44.7% (95% CI: 48.8%C50.6%), and 59.2% (95% CI: 49.4%C69.0%) for a patient admitted in these three states, respectively.

Ileum gene expression studies were performed through high throughput reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A deep review on the bibliography was done and genes related to intestinal health were selected for barrier function, immune response, oxidation, digestive hormones, nutrient transport, and metabolism. The panel was firstly tested by using a nutritional/Clostridium perfringens model of intestinal barrier failure (induced using commercial reused litter and wheat-based diets without exogenous supplementation of enzymes) and the consistency of results was evaluated by another experiment under a coccidiosis challenge (orally gavaged with a commercial coccidiosis vaccine, 90 vaccine dose). Growth traits and intestinal morphological analysis were performed to check the gut barrier failure occurrence. Results of ileum gene expression showed a higher expression in genes involved in barrier function and nutrient transport in chickens raised in healthy conditions, while genes involved in immune response presented higher expression in C.perfringens-challenged birds. On the other hand, the Eimeria challenge also altered the expression of genes related to barrier function and metabolism, and increased the expression of genes related to immune response and oxidative stress.

The benefit of testing asymptomatic individuals to create a safe environment for patients and healthcare workers must be weighed against potential unintended consequences including delaying necessary treatments due to false positive results and lower quality of care due to strict isolation measures. METHODS: A total of 9 PICOs on the topic of testing asymptomatic individuals was selected by the panel members. Subsequently, a literature search for existing guidelines and systematic reviews was performed on Pubmed, Epistemonikos, and RecMap using relevant filters available in each database. Data about article/recommendation type, setting, target population, intervention, and quality of the evidence were extracted. Credibility of the systematic reviews were evaluated using the AMSTAR-tool, and level of agreement with available recommendation was evaluated with the AGREE II-score. Because the evidence available from systematic reviews was deemed insufficiently updated to formulate relevant recommendations, an additional search targeting relevant guidance documents from major public health institutions and original studies was performed. Provisional recommendations were discussed via web conferences until agreement was reached and final recommendations was formulated according to the GRADE approach. Questions addressed by the guideline and recommendations: Recommendations were formulated regarding systematic testing in asymptomatic individuals upon admission to a healthcare setting, during hospital stay, prior to elective procedures, and prior to scheduled non-surgical procedures. Moreover, recommendations regarding testing of asymptomatic visitors, personal caregivers and healthcare workers in healthcare facilities were presented. Also, recommendations were given on contact tracing in asymptomatic patients or healthcare workers, and the possibility of a negative screening test to shorten the quarantine period.

The association between mild non-hospitalized illness and VTE is unclear. The purpose of this research is to assess the association between VTE and mild COVID-19 infection. Methods A case-control study was conducted. The cases were adult patients diagnosed with VTE from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. The controls were randomly chosen adult patients who required healthcare services that were equivalent to those of the cases, for any cause, during the same time period, without a VTE diagnosis. To assess the association between mild COVID and VTE, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted, considering other thromboembolic risk variables, such as age, gender and active cancer, among others. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 186 cases and 475 controls were analyzed. There were 21 (11.3%) and 31 (6.5%) patients infected with mild COVID-19 in the previous three months in the groups of cases and controls, respectively.

This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU), where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed, and comprehensive statistical modeling was performed. A typical routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 h/wk) in a 40-bed ICU with a 2:1 patient-to-staff ratio. A pandemic model assumed that staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were simulated for a total period of 120 days, with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality after infection, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage, and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively.

The active electrode and its cord emit radiofrequency energy that couples (or transfers) to nearby conductive material without direct contact. This phenomenon is increased when the active electrode cord is oriented parallel to another wire/cord. The parallel orientation of the \\"Bovie\\" and laparoscopic camera cords cause transfer of energy to the camera cord resulting in cutaneous burns at the camera trocar incision. We hypothesized that separating the active electrode/camera cords would reduce thermal injury occurring at the camera trocar incision in comparison to parallel oriented active electrode/camera cords. METHODS In this prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial, patients undergoing standardized laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to separated active electrode/camera cords or parallel oriented active electrode/camera cords. The primary outcome variable was thermal injury determined by histology from skin biopsied at the camera trocar incision. RESULTS Eighty-four patients participated.

One hundred patients with type-2 diabetes, with a mean preoperative HbA1C of 7.7  1.9 %, were followed for >2 years; the total resolution rate was 85.7 %. CONCLUSION This study confirms that the OAGB is an effective procedure for morbid obesity with comparable outcomes to RYGB; in addition, it seems to be safer with lower morbidity.

There are no data about parents' SM practices for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding self-medication for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Turkey. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in the pediatric dental clinic at Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown ended. A total of 389 parents who agreed to participate in the study completed the questionnaire from July 1 to October 1. A questionnaire with 18 items was designed to collect information on the parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding when, why, and how to use drugs and on their practices on medicating their children. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (chi-square test). RESULTS: The majority of parents (n = 273; 70.2%) practiced self-medication for their children's dental problems. Self-medication with a previously prescribed medications was usually preferred by parents (n = 179; 62.2%). Analgesics (98%) were the most commonly used medicines by parents in their self-medication for their children's dental problems. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of self-medication practices for children's dental problems is high in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, new healthcare services, such as teledentistry, may be useful to overcome problems related to the self-medication of children during times when the ability to reach healthcare providers is limited, such as during pandemics.","output":"Evaluation of parents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding self-medication for their children's dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 lockdown in education institutions required music teachers to use ICT to continue teaching.

As an emerging seed cell type widely used in skin wound healing and plastic surgery, HF-MSCs show considerable prospects in the treatment of LC due to their proliferation and multidirectional differentiation capabilities. We established an LC model in C57BL/6J mice by administering carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and injected HF-MSCs through the tail vein to explore the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of HF-MSCs on LC. Here, we found that HF-MSCs improved liver function and ameliorated the liver pathology of LC. Notably, PKH67-labeled HF-MSCs were detected in the injured liver and expressed the hepatocyte-specific markers cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and albumin (ALB). In addition, in contrast to that in the LC group, the -SMA expression showed a decreasing trend in the treatment group in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the pathological activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was inhibited by HF-MSC treatment. Moreover, the levels of transforming growth factor ?

Severe vascular problems and several other manifestations, including neurological ones, have also been frequently reported, particularly in the great majority of long hauler patients. SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in lung epithelial cells, while dysfunction of endothelial and neuronal brain cells has been observed in the absence of productive infection. It has been shown that the Spike protein can interact with specific cellular receptors, supporting both viral entry and cellular dysfunction. It is thus clear that understanding how and when these receptors are regulated, as well as how much they are expressed would help in unveiling the multifaceted aspects of this disease. Here, we show that SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells express three important cellular surface molecules that interact with the Spike protein, namely ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1. Their levels increase when cells are treated with retinoic acid (RA), a commonly used agent known to promote differentiation. This increase matched the higher levels of receptors observed on HUVEC (primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells). We also show by confocal imaging that replication-defective pseudoviruses carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can infect differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y, and HUVEC cells, although with different efficiencies. Neuronal cells and endothelial cells are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the interaction of the Spike viral protein with these cells may cause their dysregulation.

DESIGN: This study used panel data of the Indonesian Family Life Survey conducted in 2007 (Wave 4) and 2014 (Wave 5). SETTING: The original sampling frame was based on 13 out of 27 provinces in 1993, representing 83% of the Indonesian population. PARTICIPANTS: We included respondents aged 50 years and above in 2007, excluding those who did not participate in both Waves 4 and 5. The total number of participants in this study are 3678 respondents. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined three main outcomes; health service use (outpatient and inpatient care), financial burden (catastrophic health expenditure) and productivity loss (labour participation, days primary activity missed, days confined in bed). We applied multilevel mixed-effects regression models to assess the associations between NCD multimorbidity and outcome variables, RESULTS: Women were more likely to have NCD multimorbidity than men and the prevalence of NCD multimorbidity increased with higher socioeconomic status. NCD multimorbidity was associated with a higher number of outpatient visits (compared with those without NCD, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 4.25, 95% CI 3.33 to 5.42 for individuals with >3 NCDs) and inpatient visits (IRR 3.68, 95% CI 2.21 to 6.12 for individuals with >3 NCDs).

Natural killer (NK) cells have been described to express different endosomal TLRs triggered by RNA and DNA sequences derived from both viruses and bacteria. This study was addressed to establish which endosomal TLR could directly mediate NK activation and function after proper stimuli. It was also important to establish the most suitable TLR agonist to be used as adjuvant in tumor vaccines or in combined cancer immunotherapies. METHODS: We assessed endosomal TLR expression in total NK cells by using RT-qPCR and western blotting technique. In some experiments, we purified CD56brightCD16- and CD56dimCD16+ cells subsets by using NK Cell Isolation Kit Activation marker, cytokine production, CD107a expression and cytotoxicity assay were evaluated by flow cytometry. Cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. NK cells obtained from ovarian ascites underwent the same analyses. RESULTS: Although the four endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9) were uniformly expressed on CD56brightCD16- and CD56dimCD16+ cell subsets, the TLR7/8 (R848), TLR3 (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, Poly I:C) and TLR9 (ODN2395) ligands promoted NK-cell function only in the presence of suboptimal doses of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, produced in vivo by other environmental cells. We showed that R848 rather than TLR3 and TLR9 agonists primarily activated CD56brightCD16- NK cells by increasing their proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxic activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that R848, which usually triggers TLR7 and TLR8 on dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils cells, activated CD56brightCD16- NK-cell subset only via TLR8. Indeed, specific TLR8 but not TLR7 agonists increased cytokine production and cytotoxic activity of CD56brightCD16- NK cells.

Consequently, leadership is continuing to develop through the support of these technologies. This emerging phenomenon has been labeled e-leadership, and it has been studied with the objective of understanding the differences it exhibits from traditional leadership. Our research seeks to examine whether enterprises, which use leadership as an important tool to manage workers as effectively as possible, are conscious of this evolution, whether their behavior is supportive of the related needs, and how they are organizing themselves to face the problems and opportunities arising in this new context. The present study involved 15 Italian companies. Through in-depth interviews based on face-to-face meetings using a semi-structured questionnaire with enterprises representatives, we explored the extent of these changes. We developed the analysis across two points in time in order to verify if a change was observable with regard to the way these enterprises considered and managed e-leadership. It was also possible to enhance the role of the technologies themselves in leadership, which in the same period has seen a rapid evolution toward mobile and social developments. Our results help to illuminate that, on the one hand, awareness with regard to e-leadership has increased and, on the other hand, the pervasiveness of technologies is playing a relevant role in the change of leadership together with renewed attention toward soft competencies. We identify four different typologies of e-leadership, which summarize different ways of conceptualizing it, and indicate their main features. We should add that this topic is becoming extremely relevant because of the critical crises organizations are now facing (such as the COVID-19 emergency we are experiencing at the present time) and the urgency of adopting e-instruments, which seem now to be the main path to managing the present situation and the aftermath it inevitably will have. Despite this research being carried out before such an event has happened, we believe that its results may further enrich the current lively debate.","output":"The Way Toward E-leadership: Some Evidence From the Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly modified Earths social-ecological systems in many ways; here we study its impacts on human-nature interactions. We conducted an online survey focused on peoples relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking, jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as Nurture and Recreation values and Inspiration and Nourishment values. Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are statistically associated with some demographic characteristics, including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and associated values that people perceive as most important may vary between populations.

PARTICIPANTS: The four sites of this cohort are in northern (Ballabgarh), southern (Chennai), eastern (Kolkata) and western (Pune) parts of India. We enrolled 5336 participants across 4220 households and began surveillance in July 2018 for viral respiratory infections with additional participants enrolled annually. Trained field workers collected data about individual-level and household-level risk factors at enrolment and quarterly assessed frailty and grip strength. Trained nurses surveilled weekly to identify acute respiratory infections (ARI) and clinically assessed individuals to diagnose acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) as per protocol. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected from all ALRI cases and one-fifth of the other ARI cases for laboratory testing. Cost data of the episode are collected using the WHO approach for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza. Handheld tablets with Open Data Kit platform were used for data collection. FINDINGS TO DATE: The attrition of 352 participants due to migration and deaths was offset by enrolling 680 new entrants in the second year. All four sites reported negligible influenza vaccination uptake (0.1%C0.4%), low health insurance coverage (0.4%C22%) and high tobacco use (19%C52%). Ballabgarh had the highest proportion (54.4%) of households in the richest wealth quintile, but reported high solid fuel use (92%). Frailty levels were highest in Kolkata (11.3%) and lowest in Pune (6.8%). The Chennai cohort had highest self-reported morbidity (90.1%).

For this reason, it has been taken into account the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, which began in China at the end of December 2019, has rapidly spread around the globe, and it has led to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), declared to the 30th of January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: The IDS takes advantage of an off-line database, built before the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a pivotal characteristic for working without an internet connection. The software has been tested using the epidemiological data available in different and progressive stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a comparison, the results of the tests performed using the epidemiological data from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012, are shown. RESULTS: The overall outcomes provided by the software are comforting, as a matter of the fact that IDS has identified with a good accuracy the SARS and MERS epidemics (over 90%), while, as expected, it has not provided erroneous and equivocal readings after the elaboration COVID-19 epidemic data. CONCLUSIONS: Even though IDS has not recognized the COVID-19 epidemic, it has not given to the end user a false result and wrong interpretation, as expected by the developers. For this reason, IDS reveals itself as useful software to identify a possible epidemic or outbreak.

Any material conservation gained during manufacturing directly affects the green credentials of a product. Manufacturing waste can be contrived to approach zero through a recently developed frugal design approach that quantifies resource conservation at all stages of development of a product engineered for frugality. Accordingly, this effort presents frugal manufacturing (FM), integral to the frugal design approach, for utmost reduction of waste while aiming for good surface integrity, better properties, minimal number of processes and low cost. Other than saving on energy and hence emissions, the new concept of FM also goes beyond current near net shape technologies, which advocate mainly for zero wastage and suitable properties while using a narrow range of manufacturing processes. Case studies involving high-speed machining, superplastic forming and additive manufacturing of aerospace alloys have been presented that bring out the features and benefits of FM. As such the multipronged objectives of FM should be dovetailed with those of smart factories for creating novel technologies that abet widespread sustainable development. Such enhancement of the smart factories concept has been argued to support unusual applications such as the fight against pandemics including the current one involving COVID-19.","output":"Frugal manufacturing in smart factories for widespread sustainable development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The PLOS Medicine editors discuss the role of the World Health Organization in pandemic responses.","output":"Pandemic preparedness and responses: WHO to turn to in a crisis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the relationship between reactions of the bereaved to conditions of the pandemic and severity of their grief and levels of impairment.

The significant feature of this algorithm lies in that it does not require the derivation of the transition probability matrix for the corresponding embedded Markov chain. Furthermore, we can resort to the queue-length distribution at the pre-arrival epoch to quickly get the expected sojourn time for an arbitrary customer.

Stringent government-mandated physical distancing measures (lockdown) have been demonstrated to be epidemiologically effective, but can have both positive and negative economic consequences. The duration and frequency of any intervention policy could, in theory, could be optimised to maximise economic benefits while achieving substantial reductions in disease. Methods Here we use a pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to assess the health and economic implications of different strengths of control through time in order to identify optimal approaches to non-pharmaceutical intervention stringency in the UK, considering the role of vaccination in reducing the need for future physical distancing measures. The model is calibrated to the COVID-19 epidemic in England and we carry out retrospective analysis of the optimal timing of precautionary breaks in 2020 and the optimal relaxation policy from the January 2021 lockdown, considering the willingness to pay for health improvement. Results We find that the precise timing and intensity of interventions is highly dependent upon the objective of control. As intervention measures are relaxed, we predict a resurgence in cases, but the optimal intervention policy can be established dependent upon the willingness to pay (WTP) per QALY loss avoided. Our results show that establishing an optimal level of control can result in a reduction in net monetary loss of billions of pounds, dependent upon the precise WTP value.

We demonstrate how some of these can be quantified, employing mechanistic infectious disease transmission models to establish optimal levels of control for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Optimal health and economic impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures prior and post vaccination in England: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For real-time monitoring of hospital patients, high-quality inference of patients&#039;health status using all information available from clinical covariates and lab test results is essential to enable successful medical interventions and improve patient outcomes Developing a computational framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step In this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on multi-output Gaussian process (GP) regression for hospital patient monitoring METHODS: We propose MedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical covariates and supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of patient state over time To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and periodicity in patient observations MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series data, (ii) quantifying confidence regions in the predictions, (iii) exploiting a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) inferring interpretable relationships among clinical covariates RESULTS: We evaluate and compare results from MedGP on the task of online prediction for three patient subgroups from two medical data sets across 8,043 patients We find MedGP improves online prediction over baseline and state-of-the-art methods for nearly all covariates across different disease subgroups and hospitals CONCLUSIONS: The MedGP framework is robust and efficient in estimating the temporal dependencies from sparse and irregularly sampled medical time series data for online prediction The publicly available code is at https://github com/bee-hive/MedGP","output":"Sparse multi-output Gaussian processes for online medical time series prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is uncommon and less severe in children than adults. It is thought that infants may be at higher risk for severe disease than older children. There is a paucity of literature on infants with COVID, particularly those with severe disease. OBJECTIVE: We describe demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, radiological, laboratory features and outcomes of infants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary care teaching hospital in Pune, India. METHODOLOGY: Infants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted between 1 April 2020 and 7 August 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 13 infants were admitted during the study period. The median age was 8 months (IQR 6) and nine were male. Common presenting features were fever (n = 8, 62%), poor feeding, irritability, and runny nose (n = 3, 23%). Comorbidities noted were severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in three cases (23%) and nutritional megaloblastic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, sickle thalassemia and renal calculi in one case (8%) each. There was a history of low birth weight in two cases (15%). Pallor was noted in three cases (23%), SAM in three cases (23%) and tachypnea and respiratory distress in four cases (30%). Severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ferritin, abnormal procalcitonin, abnormal C Reactive Protein and deranged D-dimer was noted in three cases (23%) each. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was normal in all cases. Three infants (43%) had evidence of pneumonia on the chest radiograph, of which one had adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) like pattern, one infant had cardiomegaly and perihilar infiltrates. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were given to five patients (38%), Intravenous Immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were administered to one patient (8%).

This prospective study tested whether pre-pandemic self-regulation was associated with mental health, well-being, and substance use during the initial COVID-19 surge. Methods: Participants (N = 236;Mage = 30.3;64% female) were assessed 1C3 years prior to the pandemic and again in April of 2020. Markers of self-regulation (vagal tone, attachment insecurity, stress-reactive rumination, and attentional control) were assessed at Time 1, as were depressive symptoms, sleep problems, relationship satisfaction, perceived stress, and substance use. These outcomes were assessed again during the pandemic, along with anxiety symptoms and peri-traumatic distress. Results: Poor pre-pandemic self-regulation was associated with higher peri-pandemic depressive and anxiety symptoms, peri-traumatic distress, and cannabis use. Self-regulation was not associated with sleep, relationship satisfaction, alcohol use, or drug use and did not moderate changes over time. Discussion: Prospective analyses indicated simultaneous, independent associations of cognitive and emotional self-regulation with mental health and well-being during the initial COVID-19 pandemic surge, yet pre-pandemic self-regulation did not account for trajectories of change over time.

Here we analyzed the spatial, age and temporal evolution of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile, a southern hemisphere country covering a long and narrow strip comprising latitudes 17S to 56S. METHODS: We analyzed the dissemination patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across 15 regions of Chile based on daily hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory disease and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection from 01-May to 31-December, 2009. We explored the association between timing of pandemic onset and peak pandemic activity and several geographical and demographic indicators, school vacations, climatic factors, and international passengers. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset, estimated using maximum likelihood methods. RESULTS: While earlier pandemic onset was associated with larger population size, there was no association with connectivity, demographic, school or climatic factors. In contrast, there was a latitudinal gradient in peak pandemic timing, representing a 16-39-day lag in disease activity from the southern regions relative to the northernmost region (P < 0.001). Geographical differences in latitude of Chilean regions, maximum temperature and specific humidity explained 68.5% of the variability in peak timing (P = 0.01). In addition, there was a decreasing gradient in reproduction number from south to north Chile (P < 0.0001). The regional mean R estimates were 1.6-2.0, 1.3-1.5, and 1.2-1.3 for southern, central and northern regions, respectively, which were not affected by the winter vacation period. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lag in the period of most intense 2009 pandemic influenza activity following a South to North traveling pattern across regions of Chile, significantly associated with geographical differences in minimum temperature and specific humidity. The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P < 0.0001).

METHODS: We used a series of bioinformatics analyses to understand and characterize the biological functions, pharmacological targets and therapeutic mechanisms of quercetin in COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. RESULTS: We revealed the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and DENGUE, including pathological mechanisms, key inflammatory pathways and possible methods of intervention, 60 overlapping targets related to the co-infection and the drug were identified, the proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) was constructed and TNF, CCL-2 and CXCL8 could become potential drug targets.

METHODS The authors reviewed PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar electronic databases for pre- and post-marketing studies on OxyContin, Xtampza ER, and Hysingla ER. RESULTS Studies showed lower rates of abuse (19% reduction), opioid use disorder (27%), overdose (34%), and fatalities (85%) with the reformulated OxyContin when compared with the original product and comparator opioids. However, these studies revealed the potential for bypassing abuse-deterrent mechanisms and diverting abuse to other drugs.Post-marketing studies are unavailable for Xtampza ER or Hysingla ER, although pre-marketing studies suggested some controlled-release properties persist when the product is manipulated, indicating that abuse may be more difficult and less rewarding. CONCLUSIONS Abuse-deterrent opioid products may lead to reductions in abuse, overdose, and overdose fatalities. However, cost, loopholes in deterrence mechanism, and possible diversion to other substances hinder their role in the opioid crisis.

METHODS Lambs at an estimated gestational age (EGA) 116-121 days (term 145 days) were placed on venovenous ECLS with jugular drainage and umbilical vein reinfusion and intubated. Airways were managed by the instillation of amniotic fluid and tracheal occlusion (TO; n = 4), or lactated Ringer's (LR; n = 4) or perfluorodecalin (a PFC) without occlusion (n = 4). After 7 days, the animals were sacrificed. Early (EGA 116-121 days) and late (EGA 125-131 days) tissue control lambs were delivered and sacrificed. Lungs were formalin-inflated to 30 cm H2O and sectioned for histology. Injury was scored by an unbiased pathologist. Slides were immunostained for PDGFR- and -actin; development was quantified by the area fraction of double-positive tips. Surfactant protein-C (SP-C) concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was quantified using ELISA. RESULTS Total injury scores were lower in PFC lungs (1.8  1.7) than in TO (6.5  2.1; p = 0.01) and LR lungs (5.5  2.4; p = 0.01). The area fraction of double-positive alveolar tips appeared higher in PFC lungs than in TO lungs (0.18  0.007 vs. 0.008  0.004; p = 0.07).

Shared biological underpinnings between ASD symptoms and altered circadian rhythms/autonomic functions are also discussed.

Additional paracrine effects in other organs exist as well. As a biomarker, the FGF23 plasma concentration increases in renal and cardiovascular diseases, and is correlated with outcome. The regulation of FGF23 is incompletely understood and dependent on several factors, including oxidative stress. L-homocysteine is an amino acid produced in methionine metabolism, and can be converted into further metabolites depending on the availability of vitamin B. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a potential cardiovascular risk factor. Our study aimed to explore whether homocysteine impacts FGF23 synthesis. METHODS: Experiments were performed in UMR106 osteoblast-like cells. Fgf23 gene expression and FGF23 protein concentration were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Oxidative stress was determined by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. RESULTS: Homocysteine dose-dependently upregulated Fgf23 gene expression and protein synthesis. Moreover, homocysteine imposed oxidative stress on UMR106 cells. The effect of homocysteine on Fgf23 was abrogated by antioxidant ascorbic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Homocysteine is a potent stimulator of FGF23 production, an effect at least in part mediated by oxidative stress. The homocysteine-dependent upregulation of FGF23 presumably contributes to its role as a cardiovascular risk factor.","output":"The synthesis of fibroblast growth factor 23 is upregulated by homocysteine in UMR106 osteoblast-like cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As young adults living with perinatal HIV (PHIV) or perinatal HIV exposure but uninfected (PHEU) grow older and manage the challenges and competing demands of young adulthood, new approaches are needed to facilitate their retention in longitudinal research and clinical care beyond in-person clinic visits. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged in the United States in January 2020 and has underscored this need; studies are adapting to remote communication with and data collection from participants. However, there are limited data on communication preferences among young adults who are living with PHIV or PHEU. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this qualitative study were to describe participants perceptions and use of social media and technology in their personal lives and in the context of participating in longitudinal pediatric HIV research and to describe the implications of the use of technology and social media for communication and retention purposes within a longitudinal pediatric study about HIV. METHODS: We conducted 6 focus group discussions with 31 young adults living with PHIV and 13 in-depth interviews with 6 young adults living with PHIV and 7 living with PHEU. We asked about their preferences for the use of social media and digital technology in the Adolescent Master Protocol, a US-based longitudinal cohort study of youth affected by HIV. RESULTS: Participants willingness to use social media platforms, telephone calls, SMS text messages, and video calls within the context of HIV research varied due to fears of HIV stigma and inadvertent disclosure. However, trusting relationships with clinical staff positively impacted their willingness to use these platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer insight into how pediatric studies and clinics can communicate with participants as they age, even as new technologies and social media platforms emerge and replace old ones. For optimal retention, pediatric clinical staff should consider communication approaches offering flexible and tailored options for young adults participating in HIV research.","output":"Using Social Media and Technology to Communicate in Pediatric HIV Research: Qualitative Study With Young Adults Living With or Exposed to Perinatal HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to the whole world. In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.","output":"Genome Scale-Differential Flux Analysis reveals deregulation of lung cell metabolism on SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This preliminary study describes the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on peoples interests, opinions, and behaviour towards food.

The air filter plays a major role as an important component in the air conditioning systems. Thus, it requires more effort by researchers to improve its design to prevent the ultra-size of particles loaded with coronavirus (COVID-19). This paper provides insight into the design of existing combined air-conditioners on their suitability and their impact on the spread of the hybrid coronavirus epidemic and review efforts to obtain a highly efficient air filter to get rid of super-sized particles for protection against epidemic infection.

To gain insight into the diffusion of spatters and possible preventive measures, we measured the particle spatial-temporal distribution characteristic and evaluated the effectiveness of the control measures. Methods: : We conducted an experiment to observe the emitted spatters obtained during the simulated dental preparation by using high-speed videography. We measured the particle size distributions by laser diffraction and preliminarily estimated its velocity. We qualitatively and quantitatively described the spatial-temporal distributions of spatters and their control measure effects. Results: : Majority of the dental spatters were small droplets (diameter less than 50 m). A large number of smallest droplets (diameter less than 10 m) were generated by high-speed air turbine handpiece. At the oral outlet, the speed of large droplets could exceed 2.63 m/s, and the speed of aerosol clouds ranged from 0.31C2.37 m/s. The evolution of the spatters showed that the more fully developed the state, the greater the number of spatters and the wider the contamination range. When the operation mode was moved from the central incisor to the first molar, the spatter direction became increasingly concentrated, and the velocities were enhanced. Larger droplets randomly moved along trajectories and rapidly settled. The aerosol cloud tended to float as a mass that interacted with the surrounding air. The high-volume evacuation could effectively clear away most of the dental spatters. The suction air purifier could change the diffusion direction of the spatters, compress the contamination range, and control aerosol escape into surrounding air. Conclusions: : Our view is that we should combine the point control measure (high-volume evacuation) and area control measure (suction air purifier) to reduce the scope of pollution and prevent the aerosol escape into the surroundings. The study contributes to devising more accurate infection control guidelines, establishing appropriate interventions for different oral treatments, and minimizing the spread of respiratory diseases so that we can reduce cost and achieve the best results when medical resources are limited.","output":"The Spatial-Temporal Distribution and Control Measures Evaluation of Droplets and Aerosol Cloud in Dental Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Improving access to primary health care in the UK has focused on the use of telephone and online access, but little is known about how awareness of and use varies between different patient groups.

However, it is possible that a well sampled molecular phylogenetic analysis might show that one of these genera is nested inside the other. In this case the synonymisation of Pseudohydrosme will be required. Three species, one new to science, are recognised, in two sections.

There are limited data and controversies regarding the relationship between vitamin D (Vit D) status and COVID-19 disease. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the association between Vit D levels and the severity or outcomes of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia from January to August 2021. All the admitted patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were distributed into three groups depending on their Vit D levels: normal, insufficiency, and deficiency. For the three groups, demographic data, and laboratory investigations as well as data regarding the severity of COVID-19 were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 203 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 were included in this study. The Vit D level was normal (>30) in 31 (15.3%) cases, insufficient in 45 (22.2%) cases and deficient in 127 (62.6%) cases. Among the included cases, 58 (28.6%) were critical cases, 109 (53.7%) were severe and 36 (17.7%) had a mild-moderate COVID-19 infection. The most prevalent comorbidity of patients was diabetes mellitus 117 (57.6%), followed by hypertension 70 (34.5%), cardiac disease 24 (11.8%), chronic kidney disease 19 (9.4%) and chronic respiratory disease in 17 (8.4%) cases.

Staple line leak and bleeding are the most dangerous complications of LSG. Staple line reinforcement (SLR) by oversewing the staple line was suggested to reduce the incidence of leak and bleeding. We designed a randomized controlled prospective study to investigate the value of SLR by invaginating the whole staple line using unidirectional absorbable 3/0 V-Loc 180 sutures (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) to no SLR in LSG. PATIENTS AND METHODS Nine hundred and twenty patients undergoing LSG between March 2016 and March 2017 were included in the study; they were prospectively randomized into two groups: A and B, each of 460 patients. In group A, the entire staple line was invaginated with continuous seromuscular suturing using 3/0 V-Loc 180 suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), and in group B, no reinforcement was done. The patients were selected according to National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines. All procedures were performed by the same team of experienced bariatric surgeons. Patients were followed up for 6 weeks after surgery for occurrence of complications. RESULTS The two groups were matched considering the demographic data. Operative time was significantly longer in group A (P = 0.001), with mean operative time in group A was 69 min, while that in Group B was 50.8 min. Leak occurred in eight cases (1.7%) in group B and none (0%) in group A; leak was significantly lower in group A (P = 0.008). Bleeding occurred in two patients (0.4%) in group A and in seven (1.5%) in group B (P = 0.178), with no statistically significant difference between both groups as regards bleeding.

The protocol involves re-orienting the spray axis to harness inertial motion of particulates and has been developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations of respiratory airflow and droplet transport in medical imaging-based digital models. Simulated dose in representative models is validated through in vitro spray measurements in 3D-printed anatomic replicas using the gamma scintigraphy technique. This work breaks new ground in proposing an alternative user-friendly strategy that can significantly enhance topical delivery inside human nose. While these findings can eventually translate into personalized spray usage instructions and hence merit a change in nasal standard-of-care, this study also demonstrates how relatively simple engineering analysis tools can revolutionize everyday healthcare. Finally, with respiratory mucosa as the initial coronavirus infection site, our findings are relevant to intra-nasal vaccines that are in-development, to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Numerical evaluation of spray position for improved nasal drug delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Reducing human presence in vehicles and transportation infrastructure is a common concept of Intelligent Transportation Systems and COVID-19 guidelines However, the motivation for the reduced human presence is different Intelligent Transportation Systems aim to improve transportation services with innovative technologies that can replace human handling and supervision In contrast, COVID-19 guidelines aim to make the transportation means less busy, because a busy bus or a busy train means more opportunities for potential infection of passengers Objective: The study aims to explain how the transportation market will be changed and why these changes are going to take place Methods: The paper analyzes the current situation with its pros and cons and evaluates the ways in which the Intelligent Transportation Systems and the COVID-19 pandemic will affect this situation A case study is also considered Results: Intelligent Transportation Systems and the COVID-19 pandemic are two major factors in the transportation market that will significantly change the transportation means we know Conclusion: It seems that the influence of the intense Intelligent Transportation Systems development and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is still underestimated by many governments;hence they continue to invest in traditional transportation instead of moving forward for a new generation of transportation ? 2021 Yair Wiseman","output":"Intelligent transportation systems along with the covid-19 pandemic will significantly change the transportation market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the United States government began a series of measures designed to dramatically restrict immigration as part of its response to the global health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic This included Title 42, which deported asylum seekers immediately and prevented them from applying for asylum These measures worsened an already precarious situation at the USCMexico border for an estimated 60,000 asylum seekers who were prevented, by the Trump administrations Remain in Mexico (aka MPP) policy enacted in January 2019, from remaining in the United States while they awaited their asylum hearings In-depth interviews, participant observation, and social media analysis with humanitarian and legal advocates for asylum seekers living in a camp at the border in Matamoros, Mexico reveal that COVID-19s impacts are not limited to public health concerns Rather, COVID-19s impacts center on how the Trump administration weaponized the virus to indefinitely suspend the asylum system We argue that the Matamoros refugee camp provides a strategic vantage point to understand the repercussions of state policies of exclusion on im/mobility and survival strategies for asylum seekers Specifically, we use the analytical lenses of the politics of im/mobility, geographies of exclusion, and asylum seeker resilience to identify how COVID-19 has shaped the im/mobility and security of the camp and its residents in unexpected ways At the same time, our research illustrates that camp residents exercise im/mobility as a form of political visibility to contest and ameliorate their precarity as they find themselves in conditions not of their choosing","output":"Im/Mobility at the USCMexico Border during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tools of empirical epidemiology have been and are indispensable to focus political power on blocking the spreading of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by stopping transmission.

METHODS: Adults (age 18 years or older) with CHD and with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 were included from CHD centers worldwide. Data collection included anatomic diagnosis and subsequent interventions, comorbidities, medications, echocardiographic findings, presenting symptoms, course of illness, and outcomes. Predictors of death or severe infection were determined. RESULTS: From 58 adult CHD centers, the study included 1,044 infected patients (age: 35.1  13.0 years; range 18 to 86 years; 51% women), 87% of whom had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. The cohort included 118 (11%) patients with single ventricle and/or Fontan physiology, 87 (8%) patients with cyanosis, and 73 (7%) patients with pulmonary hypertension. There were 24 COVID-related deaths (case/fatality: 2.3%; 95% confidence interval: 1.4% to 3.2%).

Following emotional approach, this study on Bama in China argues that residents' emotions toward tourism development and its environmental impacts are dynamic and ambivalent.

The results show that during tourism development, interactions with outsiders encouraged the residents to realize the symbolic healing effects of their living environment and develop feelings of amazement and pride. However, continuous development had negative effects on the physical and symbolic environments, which induced complex emotional responses in the residents, including dislike, dissatisfaction, tolerance, anger, and fear. However, in this wealth-building stage, the residents ecological grief is compensated by economic growth and has not evolved to resisting actions against development. The emotional ambivalence between eagerness to economic prosperity and concern of ecological loss still exists in Bama and was enhanced in the shutdown of tourism caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lactic acid has been shown to predict worse outcomes in patients with multi-organ failure in various disease processes. During episodes of acute hypoxia there is increased conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid. In COVID-19 patients, the dysregulated inflammatory response, also known as the cytokine storm, has been known to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing refractory hypoxemia and worsening lactic acidosis. Various inflammatory markers have been studied to predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The objective of this study was to identify whether lactic acid at admission correlated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Methods: Seventy-one patients admitted to our hospital with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 were studied. Medical records were reviewed to obtain demographics including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), outcome (survivor or non-survivor) and admission lactic acid levels. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between admission lactic acid levels and mortality. Independent t-test was performed to determine the impact of this parameter on mortality. p &lt; 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results: Of the seventy-one (71) patients, admission lactic acid levels were obtained in sixty-four (64) patients. Mean age was 47.7 + 16.7 years, 73% were male, and mean BMI was 32.27 + 2.73 kg/m2. Twelve patients (18.75%) did not survive. The mean admission lactic acid for non-survivors was 2.05 + 1.032 mmol/L and for survivors was 1.16 + 0.85 mmol/L (p = 0.002, independent t-test) [Figure 1]. Pearson's correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between admission lactic acid levels and mortality (r = -0.372, p = 0.002). Conclusions: A lactic acid at admission has a significant correlation with mortality in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Further studies are required to assess this correlation and of rise in lactic acid to risk of mortality in patients.

The adsorption of curcumin and PVA into nanocellulose, and the presence of anionic sulphate groups, which is important for the interaction with viral glycoproteins were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated against these epitopes are broadly neutralizing against H1N1 viruses spanning 40 years of viral evolution and provide potent protection in vivo. Lateral patch-targeting antibodies demonstrated near universal binding to H1 viruses, and RBS-binding antibodies commonly cross-reacted with H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses. Lateral patch-targeting mAbs were restricted to expressing the variable heavy-chain gene VH3-23 with or without the variable kappa-chain gene VK1-33 and often had a Y-x-R motif within the heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3 to make key contacts with HA. Moreover, lateral patch antibodies that used both VH3-23 and VK1-33 maintained neutralizing capability with recent pH1N1 strains that acquired mutations near the lateral patch. RBS-binding mAbs used a diverse repertoire but targeted the RBS epitope similarly and made extensive contacts with the major antigenic site Sb.

We compared these findings to the gold standard technique for noninvasive CBF assessment, Transcranial Doppler (TCD). Methods: Mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Policlinico San Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy, who underwent multimodal neuromonitoring (including NIRS and TCD), were included. rSO(2) and its components [relative changes in O(2)Hbi, HHbi, and total haemoglobin (cHbi)] were compared with TCD (cerebral blood flow velocity, CBFV). Changes () in CBFV and rSO(2), O(2)Hbi, HHbi, and cHbi after systemic arterial blood pressure (MAP) modifications induced by different manoeuvres (e.g., rescue therapies and haemodynamic manipulation) were assessed using mixed-effect linear regression analysis and repeated measures correlation coefficients. All values were normalised as percentage changes from the baseline (%). Results: One hundred and four measurements from 25 patients were included. Significant effects of %MAP on %CBF were observed after rescue manoeuvres for CBFV, cHbi, and O(2)Hbi.

The viruses were found using new sequencing methods from the organ tissue of dead animals. METHODS: Severe pneumonia and stomatitis resulted in a high mortality rate in a captive breeding collection of green tree pythons. Unbiased deep sequencing lead to the detection of nidoviral sequences. A developed RT-qPCR was used to confirm the metagenome results and to determine the importance of this virus. A total of 1554 different boid snakes, including animals suffering from respiratory diseases as well as healthy controls, were screened for nidoviruses. Furthermore, in addition to two full-length sequences, partial sequences were generated from different snake species. RESULTS: The assembled full-length snake nidovirus genomes share only an overall genome sequence identity of less than 66.9% to other published snake nidoviruses and new partial sequences vary between 99.89 and 79.4%.

Based on our in vivo experience with digitoxin as an inhibitor of TNF&#945;-driven NFB signaling for cytokine expression in prostate cancer in rats and in cystic fibrosis in humans, we hypothesize that this drug will also block a virally-activated cytokine storm. Materials Methods: Digitoxin was administered intraperitoneally to cotton rats, followed by intranasal infection with 107TCID50/100 g of cotton rat with influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95. Daily digitoxin treatment continued until harvest on day 4 of the experiment. RESULTS: The cardiac glycoside digitoxin significantly and differentially suppressed levels of the cytokines TNF&#945;, GRO/KC, MIP2, MCP1, and IFN?3, in the cotton rat lung in the presence of influenza virus. CONCLUSION: Since cytokine storm is a host response, we suggest that digitoxin may have a therapeutic potential not only for influenza and but also for coronavirus infections.","output":"Classical Drug Digitoxin Inhibits Influenza Cytokine Storm, With Implications for Covid-19 Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Germany experienced one of the lowest COVID-19 case-fatality rates (CFRs) in Western Europe in the first pandemic wave, and further CFR decreases in the spring and summer of 2020. However, Germany's CFR increased markedly during the second wave, becoming one of the highest in Western Europe. Furthermore, CFRs varied considerably across German federal states. The drivers of this CFR time trend and the state differences remain unclear. OBJECTIVE We aim to identify the contribution to the CFR differences across and within German states of (1) the population age structure, (2) the age structure of confirmed infection rates, and (3) the age-specific fatality. METHODS We use data documenting COVID-19 cases and deaths from the COVerAGE-DB, applying demographic decomposition methods proposed by Kitagawa and Horiuchi. RESULTS The CFR decrease between spring and autumn 2020 in Germany resulted from a shift toward younger ages in confirmed infection rates and decreasing age-specific fatality. The CFR increase that followed was predominantly driven by a shift toward older ages in the age composition of confirmed infection rates. Although most of the CFR variation across German states resulted from differences in the population age distribution, differences in the age structure of detected infection rates contributed substantially to this variation. CONCLUSIONS Differences in German CFRs depended mainly on the age structure of the population and the confirmed infection rates. Age-specific fatality played a noteworthy role only in CFR changes over time.

The most common recombinants generated by these viruses are either defective interfering (DI) RNAs or chimeric satellite RNAs, which are thought to be generated by template switching of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during the viral replication process. To test if RNA recombination is mediated by the viral RdRp, we used either a purified recombinant RdRp of Turnip crinkle carmovirus or a partially purified RdRp preparation of Cucumber necrosis tombusvirus. We demonstrated that these RdRp preparations generated RNA recombinants in vitro. The RdRp-driven template switching events occurred between either identical templates or two different RNA templates. The template containing a replication enhancer recombined more efficiently than templates containing artificial sequences. We also observed that AU-rich sequences promote recombination more efficiently than GC-rich sequences. Cloning and sequencing of the generated recombinants revealed that the junction sites were located frequently at the ends of the templates (end-to-end template switching). We also found several recombinants that were generated by template switching involving internal positions in the RNA templates. In contrast, RNA ligation-based RNA recombination was not detected in vitro. Demonstration of the ability of carmo- and tombusvirus RdRps to switch RNA templates in vitro supports the copy-choice models of RNA recombination and DI RNA formation for these viruses.","output":"Mechanism of RNA recombination in carmo- and tombusviruses: evidence for template switching by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimating the time-varying reproductive number, Rt, is critical for monitoring transmissibility of an infectious disease.

In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays, the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima), and the BioFire Defense COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance as well as workflow. All three assays showed similar limits of detection (LODs) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection, ranging from 500 to 1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7%, compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had cycle threshold (Ct ) values of >37 by the Fusion assay. In conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed.

Information collected included demographic characteristics, attitude toward medical study, infection of COVID-19 in acquaintances, anxiety symptoms evaluated using the GAD-7, and health literacy level measured using the IDSHL. RESULTS: Of 21,085 participants, 3,575 (17.0%), 943 (4.5%) and 448 (2.1%) reported with mild, moderate, and severe anxiety. Female, higher academic year, worse self-evaluated academic performance, negative attitude toward medical study, living in Hubei province and having acquaintance infected with COVID-19 were significantly associated with anxiety level, while higher education level of mother and higher IDSHL score were associated with a lower risk.

With the increased uptake of digital technologies, digital health has the potential to improve the provision of supportive cancer care. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate digital health interventions for supportive cancer care. METHODS: Published literature between 2000 and 2020 was systematically searched in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus. Eligible publications were randomized controlled trials of clinician-led digital health interventions to support adult cancer patients. The interventions included were determined by applying a digital health conceptual model. Studies were appraised for quality using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Twenty randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Interventions varied by duration, frequency, degree of technology use, and applied outcome measures. Interventions targeting a single tumor stream, predominantly breast cancer, and studies involving the implementation of remote symptom monitoring have dominated the results. In most studies, digital intervention resulted in significant positive outcomes in patient-reported symptoms, levels of fatigue and pain, health-related quality of life, functional capacity, and depression levels compared with the control. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions are helpful and effective for supportive care of patients with cancer. There is a need for high-quality research. Future endeavors could focus on the use of valid, standardized outcome measures, maintenance of methodological rigor, and strategies to improve patient and health professional engagement in the design and delivery of supportive digital health interventions.

METHODS Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, Cochrane Library, Entrez PubMed and Clinical Trials Database until December 2008. We divided the different technologies into four groups: clipping, stitching, stapling and occluding systems. We analysed the different technologies in terms of (1) simplicity of manoeuvring for port closure, (2) security of introduction, (3) permanent implantation of the device into the organ, (4) effectiveness of port closure and (5) availability on the market. RESULTS Twenty-eight published studies were identified, while nine clinical trials are ongoing. Among proposed technologies, staplers and occluders have greater effectiveness but lack of security, and in the case of staplers also lack of simplicity of use. None of the stitching technologies can really be considered effective except for the Flexible Endostitch, which on the other side is difficult to handle in the current fashion. Standard clips, although easy to handle, have never been proved to be reliable, as only mucosal layer closure has been demonstrated to date. On the other side, the over-the-scope clip is likely to be effective, secure to introduce and simple to handle within the hollow organ.

AREAS COVERED The authors discuss the pharmacotherapeutic management of SOT patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and provide their expert perspectives. EXPERT OPINION Prophylactic reduction of immunosuppression because of fear of COVID-19 is not suggested in SOT patients. With maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, corticosteroids can be continued during COVID-19. Continuing other immunosuppressive drugs with lowest effective dose/blood concentration is suggested for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Discontinuation of antimetabolites and perhaps inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is suggested in moderate to severe COVID-19. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may be continued or substituted for mTOR inhibitors with lowest therapeutic concentrations in moderate to severe COVID-19. If continued in patients with COVID-19, therapeutic drug monitoring of CNIs/mTOR inhibitors and appropriate dose reduction is recommended in co-administration with protease inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, or interleukin (IL)-1/IL-6 receptor antagonists. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended in patients who continue taking antimetabolites or mTOR inhibitors.

The disease burden associated with HMPV infection has not been fully elucidated; however, studies indicate that HMPV may cause upper or lower respiratory tract illness in patients between ages 2 months and 87 years, may co-circulate with RSV, and HMPV infection may be associated with asthma exacerbation. The mechanisms and effector pathways contributing to immunity or disease pathogenesis following infection are not fully understood; however, given the clinical significance of HMPV, there is a need for a fundamental understanding of the immune and pathophysiological processes that occur following infection to provide the foundation necessary for the development of effective vaccine or therapeutic intervention strategies.

Action observation via video self-modeling, combined with physical practice, has potential as a noninvasive intervention to reduce freezing of gait. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based, personalized video self-modeling intervention delivered via a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD) to reduce freezing of gait in people with Parkinson disease. The secondary aim is to investigate the potential effect of this intervention on freezing of gait, mobility, and anxiety. METHODS: The study was a single-group pre-post mixed methods pilot trial for which 10 participants with Parkinson disease and freezing of gait were recruited. A physiotherapist assessed the participants in their homes to identify person-specific triggers of freezing and developed individualized movement strategies to overcome freezing of gait. 180 videos of the participants successfully performing their movement strategies were created. Participants watched their videos using a virtual reality HMD, followed by physical practice of their strategies in their own homes over a 6-week intervention period. The primary outcome measures included the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures included freezing of gait physical tests and questionnaires, including the Timed Up and Go Test, 10-meter walk test, Goal Attainment Scale, and Parkinson Anxiety Scale. RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 24% (10/42), and the retention rate was 90% (9/10). Adherence to the intervention was high, with participants completing a mean of 84% (SD 49%) for the prescribed video viewing and a mean of 100% (SD 56%) for the prescribed physical practice. One participant used the virtual reality HMD for 1 week and completed the rest of the intervention using a flat-screen device because of a gradual worsening of his motion sickness. No other adverse events occurred during the intervention or assessment. Most of the participants found using the HMD to view their videos interesting and enjoyable and would choose to use this intervention to manage their freezing of gait in the future. Five themes were constructed from the interview data: reflections when seeing myself, my experience of using the virtual reality system, the role of the virtual reality system in supporting my learning, developing a deeper understanding of how to manage my freezing of gait, and the impact of the intervention on my daily activities. Overall, there were minimal changes to the freezing of gait, mobility, or anxiety measures from baseline to postintervention, although there was substantial variability between participants. The intervention showed potential in reducing anxiety in participants with high levels of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Video self-modeling using an immersive virtual reality HMD plus physical practice of personalized movement strategies is a feasible and acceptable method of addressing freezing of gait in people with Parkinson disease.","output":"A Video Self-Modeling Intervention Using Virtual Reality Plus Physical Practice for Freezing of Gait in Parkinson Disease: Feasibility and Acceptability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by one of several strains of feline coronaviruses which are grouped into 2 general types of viruses.

There is emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in the blood of patients from China and some developed countries. However, there is inadequate data reported in Ghana and other parts of Africa, where blood transfusion service heavily relies on voluntary and replacement blood donors. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma of infected individuals could pose significant transfusion transmitted risk of COVID-19 in Ghanaian populations. METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research into Tropical Medicine (KCCR), KNUST, Ghana. Study subjects comprised contacts of COVID-19 individuals, those with classical symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who had recovered based on the new Ghana discharge criteria. Whole blood, sputum or deep coughed saliva samples were collected and transported to KCCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from sputum/nasopharyngeal samples using Da An Gene column based kit and from plasma using LBP nucleic acid extraction kit. Real-Time PCR was performed specifically targeting the ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid (N) genomic regions of the virus. RESULTS: A total of 97 individuals were recruited into the study, with more than half being males (58; 59.7%). The mean age of all subjects was 33 years (SD = 7.7) with minimum being 22 years and maximum 56 years. Majority (76; 78.4%) of all the subjects were asymptomatic, and among the few symptomatic subjects, cough (10; 10.3%) was the most predominant symptom. Of the 97 sputum samples tested, 79 (81.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the plasma of 1 (1.03%) subject who had clinically recovered. CONCLUSION: This study reports the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in a convalescent individual in Ghana. Due to the low prevalence observed and the marginal cycling thresholds associated, the risk of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is negligible. Well-powered studies and advanced diagnostics to determine infectious viremia is recommended to further evaluate the potential risk of hematogenous transmission among recovered patients.","output":"Low risk of SARS-CoV-2 in blood transfusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the strategies for the preservation of archival materials in the International Council on Archives Section on University and Research Institution Archives (ICA SUV) by the members and to make recommendations for the digital archival preservation to continue its accessibility during the national lockdown because of COVIDC19 Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the survey conducted on the ICA SUV members during the national lockdown The study used a survey research methodology through e-mails as data collection instruments Findings: The key findings revealed that most of the sections on university and research institution archives lack digitization preservation strategies and most of their records are not accessible online, as most of their collections are still preserved manually through the paper-based system;furthermore, archivists are not fully trained on digital management The paper recommends universities to develop preservation strategies to migrate records from the paper-based system to electronic records management system Research limitations/implications: The population of the study comprised ICA SUV members, who responded to the survey Therefore, the sample size and geographical spread were inadequate for generalization of the findings In conclusion, the study demonstrated that accessibility of the archives was dependent on the quality of digitized archives Practical implications: This study demonstrates that the development of a preservation strategy enhances access to archival materials during the national lockdown because of COVIDC19 Social implications: This paper highlights the plight of university archives and reiterates the need for urgent digitization of their archives of universities all over the world Originality/value: To the best of authors knowledge, this paper appears to be the first to review the responsibilities of archivists now and in the future as the result of COVIDC19 This study is confirmed to be on the positive side of COVIDC19 and change the archive sector by adapting to information communication technology ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Responsibilities of archivist now and in the future as the result of COVID C 19;Case of ICA-SUV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present research was to test whether involvement in a 14-days training program in the performing arts could reduce implicit biases.

The TREVO-2 trial was a randomized controlled trial comparing a novel endovascular stroke treatment device (the Trevo device) to a previous-generation endovascular stroke treatment device (the Merci device). METHODS We used data from the TREVO-2 trial to validate the Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score in patients receiving treatment with a third-generation endovascular stroke treatment device and to compare THRIVE to other predictive scores. We used logistic regression to model outcomes and compared score performance with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS In the TREVO-2 trial, the THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality. The relationship between THRIVE score and outcome is not influenced by either success of recanalization or the type of device used (Trevo versus Merci). The superiority of the Trevo device to the Merci device is evident particularly among patients with a low-to-moderate THRIVE score (0-5; 53.8% good outcome with Trevo versus 27.5% good outcome with Merci). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the THRIVE score was comparable or superior to several other outcome prediction scores (HIAT, HIAT-2, SPAN-100, and iScore). CONCLUSIONS The THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality in the TREVO-2 trial. Taken together with THRIVE validation data from patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator or no acute treatment, the THRIVE score has broad predictive power in patients with acute ischemic stroke, which is likely because THRIVE reflects a set of strong nonmodifiable predictors of stroke outcome.

Methods: We included routine attendance data from emergency departments who continuously transferred data between week 10-2017 and 10-2021, with ICD-10 codes available for >75% of the attendances. Case definitions for acute respiratory illness (ARI), severe ARI (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), respiratory syncytial virus disease (RSV) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were based on a combination of ICD-10 codes, and/or chief complaints, sometimes combined with information on hospitalisation and age. Results: We included 1,372,958 attendances from eight emergency departments. The number of attendances dropped in March 2020, increased during summer, and declined again during the resurge of COVID-19 cases in autumn and winter of 2020/2021. A pattern of seasonality of acute respiratory infections could be observed. By using different case definitions (i.e. for ARI, SARI, ILI, RSV) both the annual influenza seasons in the years 2017-2020 and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 were apparent.

Little is known about whether access to telemedicine was equitable, especially among older patients. Our objectives were to (1) examine older adults' use of telemedicine versus in-person primary care visits; and (2) compare hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) between the groups. METHODS In this retrospective cross-sectional study of 17,103 patients aged 65 years seen at 32 clinics in the Mid-Atlantic, primary care patients were classified into two groups - telemedicine vs. in-person - based on the first visit between March-May, 2020 and followed for 14 days. Using multivariable logistic regression, we measured the odds of being seen via telemedicine vs. in-person as a function of patient demographics, comorbidities, and week of study period. We then measured the odds of ACSC hospitalization by visit modality. RESULTS Mean age was 75.1 years (SD, 7.5), 60.6% of patients were female, 64.6% White, 28.1% Black, and 2.0% Hispanic. Overall, 60.3% of patients accessed primary care via telemedicine. Black (vs. White) patients had higher odds of using telemedicine (aOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.47) and Hispanic (vs. not Hispanic) patients had lower odds (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.92). Compared to the in-person group, patients in the telemedicine group had lower odds of ACSC hospitalization (aOR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-1.00). Among patients who used telemedicine, Black patients had 1.43 higher odds of ACSC hospitalization (95% CI, 1.02- 2.01), compared to White patients.

An inductive analysis of the global literature on the quality of the public health data collection process has led to the formation of a preliminary 4D component framework, that is, data collection management, data collection personnel, data collection system, and data collection environment. It is necessary to empirically validate the framework for its use in future research and practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to obtain empirical evidence to confirm the components of the framework and, if needed, to further develop this framework. METHODS: Expert elicitation was used to evaluate the preliminary framework in the context of the Chinese National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Response Information Management System. The research processes included the development of an interview guide and data collection form, data collection, and analysis. A total of 3 public health administrators, 15 public health workers, and 10 health care practitioners participated in the elicitation session. A framework qualitative data analysis approach and a quantitative comparative analysis were followed to elicit themes from the interview transcripts and to map them to the elements of the preliminary 4D framework. RESULTS: A total of 302 codes were extracted from interview transcripts. After iterative and recursive comparison, classification, and mapping, 46 new indicators emerged; 24.8% (37/149) of the original indicators were deleted because of a lack of evidence support and another 28.2% (42/149) were merged. The validated 4D component framework consists of 116 indicators (82 facilitators and 34 barriers). The first component, data collection management, includes data collection protocols and quality assurance. It was measured by 41 indicators, decreased from the original 49% (73/149) to 35.3% (41/116). The second component, data collection environment, was measured by 37 indicators, increased from the original 13.4% (20/149) to 31.9% (37/116). It comprised leadership, training, funding, organizational policy, high-level management support, and collaboration among parallel organizations. The third component, data collection personnel, includes the perception of data collection, skills and competence, communication, and staffing patterns. There was no change in the proportion for data collection personnel (19.5% vs 19.0%), although the number of its indicators was reduced from 29 to 22. The fourth component, the data collection system, was measured using 16 indicators, with a slight decrease in percentage points from 18.1% (27/149) to 13.8% (16/116). It comprised functions, system integration, technical support, and data collection devices. CONCLUSIONS: This expert elicitation study validated and improved the 4D framework. The framework can be useful in developing a questionnaire survey instrument for measuring the quality of the public health data collection process after validation of psychometric properties and item reduction.","output":"Validation of 4D Components for Measuring Quality of the Public Health Data Collection Process: Elicitation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to estimate the losses of tourism-related sectors and businesses to take recovery steps by disseminating policies and strategic directions.

In steroid dependent patients (Addisons disease, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary steroid insufficiency, use of long term steroids for other conditions - 5mg or more of prednisolone (or equivalent doses) daily for longer than 4 weeks) admitted to hospital very unwell with confirmed or suspected COVID recommendations is to start on Hydrocortisone 100 mg per IV injection followed by continuous IV infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h per intravenous or IM bolus injection). Method: Retrospect data collection on Patients admitted in May 2020 to Bedford Hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 disease with adrenal insufficiency or on long term steroid use. Those patients should be started on Hydrocortisone 100 mg per IV injection followed by continuous IV infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h per intravenous or IM bolus injection). Results: In May 2020, 295 patients admitted under the medical team in Bedford Hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Only 12 patients met the inclusion criteria, one patient with a diagnosis of Addison disease and the remaining 11 patients on long term steroids. None of these patients were managed as per updated guidelines. 6 patients had less than the adequate dose, they were started on prednisolone 30-40mg. 4 patients dose of oral steroids was only doubled, 1 patient received the same dose of oral steroid and the only confirmed Addison had higher dose of hydrocortisone. Moreover, In June 2020, The RECOVERY Outcome trial results showed that Dexamethasone 6mg for 10 days reduces the death by one third in hospitalised patient with severe respiratory complications of COVID-19. Dexamethasone 6mg is 12 times the physiological required steroid dose, this is equivalent to 240mg hydrocortisone, which is adequate for steroid replacement in patients with adrenal insufficiency or suppression. Conclusion: In view of these results and the outcome of the RECOVERY Trial, Local trust guidelines updated, indicated that any patient with Adrenal insufficiency or suppression including those on long term steroids very unwell admitted to the hospital should receive Dexamethasone if requiring oxygen or Hydrocortisone if not requiring oxygen. Recommendation of changes included teaching sessions delivered to doctors, posters on updated guidelines distributed in major areas in hospital and trust guidelines updated on the intranet.","output":"Audit on Steroid Replacement in Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Patients With Adrenal Insufficiency or Adrenal Suppression in a District General Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the pandemic mitigation effects of lockdown in Italy have been influenced by the level of penetration of COVID-19 in Italian Regions at the onset of containment (March 9, 2020).

To examine changes in the frequency of use of telehealth services during the early pandemic period, CDC analyzed deidentified encounter (i.e., visit) data from four of the largest U.S. telehealth providers that offer services in all states. Trends in telehealth encounters during January-March 2020 (surveillance weeks 1-13) were compared with encounters occurring during the same weeks in 2019.

To address this gap in knowledge, we aimed to explore staffs experiences of integrating LFDs into routine practice for visitors and staff testing with a view to understand implementation facilitators and barriers. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified two main themes and five subthemes. The main themes included: visitor-related testing factors and staff-related testing factors. Subthemes included: restoring a sense of normality, visitor-related testing challenges, staff-related testing challenges, and pre-pilot antecedent factors. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the real-world implementation of LFDs to test visitors and staff faces significant challenges as a result of several contextual factors negatively affecting the work practice and environment. More comprehensive studies are needed to identify and inform effective implementation strategies to ensure that LFDs can be adopted in an agile way that better supports an already exhausted and morally depleted workforce.","output":"Implementing lateral flow devices in long-term care facilities: experiences from the Liverpool COVID-19 community testing pilot in care homes a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is defined by respiratory symptoms, but cardiac complications including viral myocarditis are also prevalent. Although ischemic and inflammatory responses caused by COVID-19 can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human cardiomyocytes is not well-understood. Here, we utilize human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a model to examine the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte-specific infection by SARS-CoV-2. Microscopy and RNA-sequencing demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can enter hiPSC-CMs via ACE2. Viral replication and cytopathic effect induce hiPSC-CM apoptosis and cessation of beating after 72 hours of infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection activates innate immune response and antiviral clearance gene pathways, while inhibiting metabolic pathways and suppressing ACE2 expression. These studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect hiPSC-CMs in vitro, establishing a model for elucidating infection mechanisms and potentially a cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform.","output":"Human iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes , are Susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thorough postmortem investigations of fatalities following vaccination with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are of great social significance. From 11.03.2021 to 09.06.2021, postmortem investigations of 18 deceased persons who recently received a vaccination against COVID-19 were performed. Vaxzevria was vaccinated in nine, Comirnaty in five, Spikevax in three, and Janssen in one person. In all cases, full autopsies, histopathological examinations, and virological analyses for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were carried out. Depending on the case, additional laboratory tests (anaphylaxis diagnostics, VITT [vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia] diagnostics, glucose metabolism diagnostics) and neuropathological examinations were conducted. In 13 deceased, the cause of death was attributed to preexisting diseases while postmortem investigations did not indicate a causal relationship to the vaccination. In one case after vaccination with Comirnaty, myocarditis was found to be the cause of death. A causal relationship to vaccination was considered possible, but could not be proven beyond doubt. VITT was found in three deceased persons following vaccination with Vaxzevria and one deceased following vaccination with Janssen. Of those four cases with VITT, only one was diagnosed before death. The synopsis of the anamnestic data, the autopsy results, laboratory diagnostic examinations, and histopathological and neuropathological examinations revealed that VITT was the very likely cause of death in only two of the four cases. In the other two cases, no neuropathological correlate of VITT explaining death was found, while possible causes of death emerged that were not necessarily attributable to VITT. The results of our study demonstrate the necessity of postmortem investigations on all fatalities following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. In order to identify a possible causal relationship between vaccination and death, in most cases an autopsy and histopathological examinations have to be combined with additional investigations, such as laboratory tests and neuropathological examinations.","output":"Postmortem investigation of fatalities following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Exposure to pregnant women with cardiovascular disease (CVD) during cardiology fellowship training is limited and without a standard curriculum in the United States. The authors sought to evaluate a dedicated curriculum to teach management of CVD in pregnancy to improve general cardiology fellowship training. METHODS: The authors developed a dedicated CVD in pregnancy curriculum for the general cardiology fellows at a large academic medical center in the fall of 2019. Fellows knowledge was assessed via a board-style examination and exposure and attitudes related to the care of pregnant women with CVD were evaluated with a needs assessment questionnaire before and after the curriculum. RESULTS: Of the 17 fellows who participated in the curriculum, 12 completed the needs assessment pre-curriculum and 9 post-curriculum. The mean (SD) number of pregnant women with CVD cared for by each fellow in the inpatient and outpatient settings were 0.75 (1.29) and 0.56 (0.73), respectively. After the curriculum, all fellows reported awareness of available resources to treat pregnant women with CVD, while a majority disagreed that they receive regular exposure to pregnant patients with CVD in their training. The authors observed significant increases in fellows confidence in their knowledge of normal cardiovascular physiology of pregnancy, physical exam skills, and ability to care for pregnant women with valvular disease and arrhythmias from pre to post-curriculum. A total of 15 fellows completed the board-style exam pre-curriculum and 15 post-curriculum.

Computations were carried out using large eddy simulation, and, in particular, the effect of the co-flow (5% and 10% of maximum cough velocity) on the evolution of the jet was quantified. The Reynolds number (Re) of the cough jet, based on the mouth opening diameter (D) and the average cough velocity, is 13 002. The time-varying inlet velocity profile of the cough jet is represented as a combination of gamma-probability-distribution functions. Simulations reveal the detailed structure of cough jet with and without a co-flow for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. The cough jet temporal evolution is similar to that of a continuous free-jet and follows the same routes of instability, as documented for a free-jet. The convection velocity of the cough jet decays with time and distance, following a power-law variation. The cough jet is observed to travel a distance of approximately 1.1 m in half a second. However, in the presence of 10% co-flow, the cough jet travels faster and covers the similar distance in just 0.33 s. Therefore, in the presence of a co-flow, the probability of transmission of COVID-19 by airborne droplets and droplet nuclei increases, since they can travel a larger distance. The cough jet without the co-flow corresponds to a larger volume content compared to that with the co-flow and spreads more within the same range of distance. These simulations are significant as they help to reveal the intricate structure of the cough jet and show that the presence of a co-flow can significantly augment the risk of infection of COVID-19.","output":"Effect of co-flow on fluid dynamics of a cough jet with implications in spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to quantify the role of the number of Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) risk factors on in-hospital mortality The secondary objective was to assess the associated hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization, and ICU LOS with the number of CDC risk factors METHODS: A retrospective cohort study consisting of all hospitalizations with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis discharged between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 was conducted Data was obtained from 276 acute care hospitals across the United States Cohorts were identified based upon the number of the CDC COVID-19 risk factors Multivariable regression modeling was performed to assess outcomes and utilization The odds ratio (OR) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) were reported RESULTS: Compared with patients with no CDC risk factors, patients with risk factors were significantly more likely to die during the hospitalization: One risk factor (OR 2 08, 95% CI, 1 60-2 70;P &lt; 0 001), two risk factors (OR 2 63, 95% CI, 2 00-3 47;P &lt; 0 001), and three or more risk factors (OR 3 49, 95% CI, 2 53-4 80;P &lt; 0 001) The presence of CDC risk factors was associated with increased ICU utilization, longer ICU LOS, and longer hospital LOS compared to those with no risk factors Patients with hypertension (OR 0 77, 95% CI, 0 70-0 86;P &lt; 0 001) and those administered statins were less likely to die (OR 0 54, 95% CI, 0 49-0 60;P &lt; 0 001) CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying the role of CDC risk factors upon admission may improve risk stratification and identification of patients who may require closer monitoring and more intensive treatment","output":"Outcomes of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients by Risk Factors: Results from a United States Hospital Claims Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government of India imposed various phases of lockdown starting from the third week of March 2020 Improvement in city air quality has emerged as a benefit of this lockdown in India The objective of this paper is to quantify the health benefits due to this lockdown PM2 5 concentrations in nonattainment cities (NACs) in Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) in North India were studied Data from prelockdown and the various lockdown phases were compared, with 2019 as a benchmark Compared with those in 2019, the PM2 5 concentrations during lockdown Phase 1 were approximately 44 6% lower for cities in Uttar Pradesh and approximately 58 5% lower for the Delhi-NCR The health impacts of particle inhalation were quantified using the multiple-path particle dosimetry and AirQ+ models, which revealed that the most considerable improvement was during lockdown Phase 1 Among the prelockdown and lockdown phases, Phase 1 exhibited the minimum PM2 5 concentration and thus the greatest health benefits For the selected cities, the concentration of particle deposition in the tracheobronchial region of human lungs showed its maximum reduction during lockdown Phase 1(30 14%) Furthermore, the results highlighted a decrease of 29 85 deaths per 100,000 persons during lockdown Phase 1, primarily due to the reduction in PM2 5 concentrations This quantification of the health benefits due to a decrease in PM2 5 may help policymakers implement suitable control measures, especially for NACs, where the respirable particulate matter concentrations remain very high ? 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research All rights reserved","output":"Health benefits due to reduction in respirable particulates during covid-19 lockdown in india"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A world without HIV is only possible by addressing the socio-structural determinants of health.

The compiled data are classified in application categories, including agronomic improvements, industrial use and medical use, namely production of recombinant therapeutic molecules or vaccines (including against Covid-19). The data indicate that gene editing appears to be an effective complement to 'classical' transgenesis, the use of which is not declining, rather than a replacement, a trend also observed in the patenting landscape.

Methods: This single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. Findings: All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; four received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16.36%) with immunomodulators. Interpretation: Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.","output":"Medical treatment of 55 patients with COVID-19 from seven cities in northeast China who fully recovered: a single-center, retrospective, observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Numerous digital tools to self-assess visual acuity have been introduced. The recent COVID-19 pandemic underlined the need for high-quality remote care. This review gives a current overview of digital tools for remotely assessing visual function and reports on their accuracy. Methods: We searched the databases of Embase and Pubmed, and systematically reviewed the literature, conforming to PRISMA guidelines. Two preliminary papers were added from medRxiv.org. The main outcome was the agreement of the digital tools with conventional clinical charts, as expressed by mean differences and 95% limits of agreement (95% LoA). Results: Seventeen publications included studies reported on 13 different digital tools. Most of the tools focus on distance visual acuity. The mean differences of the digital tools ranged from - 0.08 to 0.10 logMAR, when compared to traditional clinical assessments. The 95% LoA differed considerably between studies: from  0.08 logMAR to  0.47 logMAR, though the variability was less pronounced for higher visual acuities. Conclusion: The low mean differences between digital visual acuity assessments and reference charts suggest clinical equivalence, though the wide 95% LoA identify a lower precision of digital self-assessments. This effect diminishes in individuals with better visual acuities, which is a common feature of visual acuity assessments. There is great potential for the digital tools to increase access to eye care and we expect the accuracy of the current tools to improve with every iteration in technology development.

IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1?, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-&#954;B and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-&#954;B followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is an NF-&#954;B target, simultaneous activation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-&#954;B activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively.

Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60-80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO2, O3, BC, PM2.5, and PM10 are compared between the lockdown period and comparable periods in the historical air pollution record, while taking into account changes in the local meteorology. We show that this 'natural experiment' in source emission reductions had significant but non-linear impacts on air quality. While emission inventories and receptor modelling approaches confirm the dominance of traffic sources for NOx (86%), and BC (72%) across the city, observations suggest a consequent reduction in NO2 of only 34-57% and a reduction in BC of 55-75%. The observed reductions in PM2.5 (still likely to be dominated by traffic emissions), and PM10 (dominated by sea salt, traffic emissions to a lesser extent, and affected by seasonality) were found to be significantly less (8-17% for PM2.5 and 7-20% for PM10). The impact of this unplanned controlled intervention shows the importance of establishing accurate, local-scale emission inventories, and the potential of the local atmospheric chemistry and meteorology in limiting their accuracy.","output":"Implications for air quality management of changes in air quality during lockdown in Auckland (New Zealand) in response to the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA sequencing has become the method of choice to study the transcriptional landscape of phage-infected bacteria.

This contrasts sharply with the efficacy of potent virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. However, resistance of the Omicron variant against almost all licensed monoclonals turns back the clock and we can expect that ConvP will regain interest. Indeed, the effectivity of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies supports the premise that ConvP will work when used at the right time, at the right dose, containing antibodies with the right affinity. OBJECTIVES: Review available evidence on dosing of ConvP for COVID-19 and provide guidance for future trials or patient care. SOURCES: As no dose finding human trials were ever performed, we reviewed COVID-19 animal model studies and human trials that provide (in)direct data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ConvP. We also discuss the identification of appropriate ConvP donors in the context of emerging SARS-COV2 variants. CONTENT: Compared with dosing in animal studies, almost all human trials used substantially lower doses. Identifying donors with sufficiently high virus neutralizing antibody titers is challenging, in particular when new variants escape immunity induced by ancestral variants. Ways to avoid underdosing are 1. The use of ConvP from two different donors 2. Only use ConvP known to neutralize the variant the patient is infected with. 3. Use 2 convalescent plasma units with a NAb titer 1/1250. When only one plasma unit is available, a NAb titer of 1/2500 is recommended. 4. Use an antibody test that correlates well with virus neutralization. The use of international units for virus neutralization is strongly encouraged. 5. The use of donors shortly after a third mRNA vaccination may simplify the donor selection process.

This work aims to describe the problem-solving approaches used by NICs and the coordination of their role with other team members. Methods Observations and semi-structured interviews were performed with NICs in a single centre, where NICs were purposively sampled for a variety of experience levels. During the observations, field notes were taken for every action conducted by the NIC in ED; the semi-structured interviews involved a combination of question prompts and a blank diagram of the ED that the NICs were asked to annotate. Constant comparative analysis based on grounded theory methodology was used for this qualitative study. Results Eight different problem-solving approaches were identified. These are placing, targeting, guiding, juggling, chasing, team-leading, escalating and de-escalating. The last three were exclusive to NICs, whereas the others were shared to some degree with the EPIC. Seven team situational awareness processes used by NICs for coordination with other team members were identified, leading to a discussion on team synchronisation and shared awareness mechanisms. In particular, shared internal models amongst the NICs and also other team members provide a framework for analysing how team members function together in a healthcare setting. Conclusions Emergency department NICs have a number of problem-solving approaches that have been defined and shown to have a degree of overlap with the emergency physician in charge.

However, less is known about the processes through which ACE are linked to multiple negative outcomes. The aim of the FACE epidemiological study is to investigate emotion regulation (emotional reactivity, perseverative thinking and self-efficacy for managing emotions) and social information processing (rejection sensitivity, interpretation biases and social understanding) as potential mechanisms linking adverse childhood experiences and psychosocial functioning in a large population sample of young adults. It is embedded in a larger project that also includes an ecological momentary assessment of emotion regulation and social information processing and informs the development and evaluation of an online self-help intervention for young adults with a history of ACE. METHODS: The study plans to recruit 5000 young adults aged 18 to 21 from the German-speaking Swiss population. Addresses are provided by Swiss Federal Statistical Office and participants are invited by mail to complete a self-report online survey. If the targeted sample size will not be reached, a second additional sample will be recruited via educational facilities such as universities or teacher training colleges or military training schools. Three follow-ups are planned after 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, resulting in ages 18C24 being covered. The main exposure variable is self-reported adverse childhood experiences before the age of 18, measured at the baseline. Primary outcomes are psychosocial functioning across the study period. Secondary outcomes are social information processing, emotion regulation and health care service use. Statistical analyses include a range of latent variable models to identify patterns of adverse childhood experiences and patterns and trajectories of psychosocial adaptation. DISCUSSION: The results will contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms that link ACE with psychosocial functioning which is crucial for an improved insight into risk and resilience processes and for tailoring interventions. Furthermore, the identification of factors that facilitate or hinder service use among young adults with ACE informs healthcare policies and the provision of appropriate healthcare services.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of a simple intraoperative visual liver score to stratify the risk of NASH and NAFLD in obesity and determine the need for liver biopsy. METHODS This is a prospective cohort study of obese adults undergoing bariatric surgery. The surgical team used a visual liver score to evaluate liver colour, size and surface. This was compared to histology from an intraoperative liver biopsy. RESULTS There were 152 participants, age 44.6  12 years, BMI 45  8.3 kg/m2. Prevalence of NAFLD was 70.4%, with 12.1% NASH and 26.4% borderline NASH. Single-visual components were less accurate than total composite score. Steatosis was most accurately identified (significant steatosis: AUROC 0.746, p < 0.05; severe steatosis: AUROC 0.855, p < 0.05). NASH was identified with moderate accuracy (AUROC 0.746, p = 0.001), with sensitivity 75% for a score  2. Stratification into low ( 1) and high-risk ( 4) scores accurately identified patients who should or should not have an intraoperative biopsy. Most patients with a normal-appearing liver did not have disease (94.4%). The structured visual assessment was quick and interobserver agreement was reasonable ( = 0.53, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A simple, structured tool based on liver appearance can be a useful and reliable tool for NAFLD risk stratification and identification of patients who would most and least benefit from a biopsy.

Given that COVID-19 is less deadly for young adults, this study explores whether highlighting potential benefits or disadvantages that others may experience as a result of one's vaccination increases young adults' intention to get vaccinated, particularly for those who have low perceived risk of COVID-19. To test this idea, we conducted an experiment and analyzed the effect of interaction between message frame (gain vs. loss) and reference point (self vs. others) on intention for vaccination by one's perceived risk (low vs. high). The results show that for those with low perceived risk of COVID-19, messages about potential negative consequences to others (e.g., family, friends, community members) from one's failure to get vaccinated led to message elaboration and favorable attitude toward vaccination, which in turn promoted one's intention to get vaccinated. We discuss practical implications of the findings for message strategies that target populations experiencing COVID-19 disparities.","output":"I Will Get Myself Vaccinated for Others: The Interplay of Message Frame, Reference Point, and Perceived Risk on Intention for COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the emergency educational consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is necessary to find an effective and alternative way of learning Moreover, during this epidemic, the Chinese Ministry of Education announced the \\"Disrupted Classes, Undisrupted Learning\\" initiative, offering flexible online learning With the aim of facilitating a sound learning environment when using online learning systems, various kinds of tools can be applied Tencent Meeting is one tool that offers various learning features This study aimed to investigate how students perceived the effect of the Tencent Meeting system features on the two main determinants of the TAM model, namely perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) The study further analyzed the effects of these two determinants on learning performance Data were analyzed using regression analysis The study found the Tencent Meeting system features could account for 55 1% of PEOU and 40% of PU Another finding shows that PEOU and PU had a significant effect on the students' learning performance Finally, a discussions and implications are presented","output":"Students Perceptions, System Characteristics and Online Learning During the COVID-19 Epidemic School Disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The massive upheaval that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to all our lives has caused many of us to think long and hard about what kind of future we want and need.","output":"Back to Normal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Excessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19.

Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high).

Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread to nearly all countries of the world in only a few months. However, in different countries, the COVID-19 epidemic takes variable shapes and forms in how it affects communities. Until now, the insights gained on COVID-19 have been largely dominated by the COVID-19 epidemics and the lockdowns in China, Europe and the USA. But this variety of global trajectories is little described, analysed or understood. In only a few months, an enormous amount of scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has been uncovered (knowns). But important knowledge gaps remain (unknowns). Learning from the variety of ways the COVID-19 epidemic is unfolding across the globe can potentially contribute to solving the COVID-19 puzzle. This paper tries to make sense of this variabilityby exploring the important role that context plays in these different COVID-19 epidemics; by comparing COVID-19 epidemics with other respiratory diseases, including other coronaviruses that circulate continuously; and by highlighting the critical unknowns and uncertainties that remain. These unknowns and uncertainties require a deeper understanding of the variable trajectories of COVID-19.

In normal Schwann cells, ectopic overexpression of HERV-K Env increased proliferation and upregulated expression of c-Jun and pERK1/2, which are key components of known tumorigenic pathways in schwannoma, JNK/c-Jun and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK. Furthermore, FDA-approved retroviral protease inhibitors ritonavir, atazanavir, and lopinavir reduced proliferation of schwannoma and grade I meningioma cells.

Using these questions, along with workers actual labor market participation, we construct a labor market underutilization measure, the Aggregate Hours Gap (AHG), following Faberman et al. (2020). The AHG captures changes in labor market underutilization for the full population along both the extensive and intensive margins using data on desired work hours as a measure of their potential labor supply. We find that the sharp increase in the AHG during the Covid pandemic essentially disappeared by the end of 2021. We also document a sharp decline in desired work hours during the pandemic that persists through the end of 2021 and is roughly double the drop in the labor force participation rate. Ignoring the decline in desired hours overstates the degree of underutilization by 2.5 percentage points (12.5%). Our findings suggest that, as of 2021Q4, the labor market is tighter than suggested by the unemployment rate and the adverse labor supply effect of the pandemic is more pronounced than implied by the labor force participation rate.

This systematic review aimed to summarize and meta-analyze the salient features and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS. METHODS We searched the PubMed (Medline), Web of Science and Cochrane databases for articles published between January 1st and August 5th 2020 using SARS-CoV-2 and GBS-related keywords. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, antecedent symptoms, clinical, serological and electrophysiological features, and hospital outcomes were recorded. RESULTS We included 45 articles from 16 countries reporting 61 patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS. Most (97.7%) articles were from high- and upper-middle-income countries. Forty-two (68.9%) of the patients were male; median (interquartile range) age was 57 (49-70) years. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 90.2% of patients. One report of SARS-CoV-2-associated familial GBS was found which affected a father and daughter of a family. Albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid was found in 80.8% of patients. The majority of patients (75.5%) had a demyelinating subtype of GBS. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis were given to 92.7% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. Around two-thirds (65.3%) of patients had a good outcome (GBS-disability score  2) on discharge from hospital. Two patients died in hospital. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS mostly resembles the classical presentations of GBS that respond to standard treatments. Extensive surveillance is required in low- and lower-middle-income countries to identify and report similar cases/series.

Herein, female C57Bl/6 J mice were exposed intranasally or intratracheally to one dose of either saline or 3 mg/kg of LPS. They were studied 24 h later.

In this study, we have taken a docking-based virtual screening approach to select natural molecules (from plants) with possible therapeutic potential. For this purpose, AUTODOCK Vina-based determination of binding affinity values (blind and active-site oriented) was obtained to short-list molecules with possible inhibitory potential against the main Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 6Y2F -the monomeric form). The 4 molecules selected were Chebuloside (?8.2;?8.2), Acetoside (?8.0;?8.0), Corilagin (?8.1;?7.7) and Arjunolic Acid (?8.0;?7.6) (blind and active-site oriented docking scores (Kcal/mol) in parenthesis, respectively). Further, a comparative search, with FDA-approved drugs, has shown that Ouabain was comparable to Chebuloside with a similarity score of 0.227.

This quality improvement project aimed to reduce the did not attend (DNA) rate in the physical health clinic by 20% in order to improve patient outcomes, particularly in the context of their physical health. METHOD: The project took place between September and November 2020, over the course of 10 weeks. A driver diagram was constructed to identify key influencing factors and subsequent change ideas. In order to implement each of these changes, three cycles within the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) ramp framework were completed. These consisted of phone reminders within 48 hours of appointments, a teaching session for staff alongside the distribution of an accompanying information leaflet and increased flexibility in clinic times with opportunistic appointments. The change ideas were cumulative with each cycle lasting a duration of seventeen days. RESULT: The baseline DNA rate was calculated based on the preceding month and found to be 55%. Following cycle one of the project, there was a significant reduction in DNA rates to 30% although this remained relatively stable at 33% after cycle two. By the end of cycle three when all interventions had been introduced, the DNA rate had dropped to 22%. As such, a total drop in DNA rate of over 30% was achieved which surpassed the initial aim of the project. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this project demonstrate that the introduction of even simple measures can lead to positive change. Successful implementation of these changes requires teamwork and a culture of openness and flexibility. Feedback from team members, particularly care coordinators, also indicated better resulting engagement of clients with the service overall, suggesting potential for both improved mental and physical health outcomes.

This review summarizes the current understanding of the contributions of differentially polarized macrophages to various infectious and inflammatory diseases and the ongoing effort to develop novel therapies that target this key aspect of macrophage biology.","output":"The Role of Macrophage Polarization in Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microalgae are potential plant biostimulants and biocontrol agents. A major hurdle towards their commercialization is the production of large volumes of biomass at the correct time of year. Secondary metabolites are unstable and the shelf-life of bioactive microalgal biomass needs to be investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of storage conditions on freeze-dried microalgae to determine how long the biomass retained its growth promoting and bioactive properties under various temperature and light conditions. Chlorella vulgaris biomass was stored in the dark at ? 70 C, 10 C, and 25 C and in the light at 25 C. Samples were tested every 3C4 months for 15 months. Storage time significantly influenced the rate of change in the bioactivity in the C. vulgaris biomass with storage temperature also having some effect. Rooting activity decreased in the mungbean rooting assay over time up to 12 months and then increased slightly. Antimicrobial activity increased against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for up to 12 months and then declined. Antioxidant activity measured in the DPPH assay remained relatively stable for up to 12 months and then significantly decreased with longer storage. The change in bioactivity over time was attributed to the gradual breakdown of the rigid cell wall of C. vulgaris, thereby improving extraction efficiency but exposing the secondary metabolites to oxygen, thus quickening their degradation. Biomass produced for commercial purposes requires preliminary validation as the results of the present study showed that bioactive compounds are susceptible to degradation over time.

The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate whether vitamin D status is associated with the COVID-19 severity, defined as ARDS requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or mortality (primary endpoints) and with the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-related hospitalization (secondary endpoints). Methods: A search in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and preprints repositories was performed until March 31th 2021 to identify all original observational studies reporting association measures, or enough data to calculate them, between Vitamin D status (insufficiency <75, deficiency <50, or severe deficiency <25 nmol/L) and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admission, or death during COVID-19 hospitalization. Findings: Fifty-four studies (49 as fully-printed and 5 as pre-print publications) were included for a total of 1,403,715 individuals. The association between vitamin D status and SARS-CoV2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalization, COVID-19 related ICU admission, and COVID-19 related mortality was reported in 17, 9, 27, and 35 studies, respectively.

Considering specific subgroups (i.e., Caucasian patients, high quality studies, and studies reporting adjusted association estimates) the results of primary endpoints did not change. Interpretations: Patients with low vitamin D levels present an increased risk of ARDS requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related hospitalization.","output":"Vitamin D Status and SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Clinical Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has infected more than half of the worlds population and is still a threat to human health. The urea breath test, despite being widely used in clinical diagnosis, still faces huge challenges in the immediate detection of H. pylori. Thus, a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific point of care diagnosis is particularly important for preventing the further transmission of H. pylori and for real-time monitoring of the disease in a given population. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostics have been applied to various types of nucleic acid testing; however, there are often shortcomings of complex operation and high signal transmission background. In this study, we proposed a new platform for the assay of H. pylori using one-tube-based CRISPR/Cas12a diagnostic methods and designed a detector for this platform, which is a portable array detector for visible analysis of thermostatic nucleic acid amplification (Pad-VATA). By incorporating isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification, our platform could detect the conserved gene fragments of H. pylori with a constant low as 2 copies/l. The assay process can be performed at a single temperature in about 30 min and integrated into the reactor in the palm-sized Pad-VATA to facilitate rapid diagnosis of H. pylori. We also verified the accuracy of our platform using 10 clinical samples and found that the platform can quickly detect H. pylori infection in a given population. We believe that this fast, convenient, efficient, and inexpensive screening and diagnostic platform can be widely used in various settings, including homes and clinics.","output":"Rapid and Sensitive Assay of Helicobacter pylori With One-Tube RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 by Portable Array Detector for Visible Analysis of Thermostatic Nucleic Acid Amplification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main concerns of the last century is regarding the air pollution and its effects caused on human health.

There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model.

This study aimed to analyze perioperative and oncologic outcomes in patients aged 70 years (elderly group) and compare with those <70 years (non-elderly group). METHODS From April 1997 to September 2015, 402 consecutive patients with lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas underwent LDP at Rikshospitalet, Oslo University Hospital. RESULTS Of these, 118 (29.4%) were elderly, whereas 284 (70.6%) were non-elderly. Despite higher rate of comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists score (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), elderly patients had lower postoperative morbidity, pancreatic fistula (PF) and readmission rates, compared with non-elderly (P = 0.032, 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). Spleen-preserving LDP (SPLDP) resulted in similar postoperative outcomes in the two groups. Elderly patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were comparable to non-elderly in terms of median and 3-year survival (20.2 vs. 19 months (P = 0.94, log-rank) and 26.7% vs. 34.3%, respectively).

Similar to influenza virus and Ebolavirus, the coronavirus also contains single-stranded RNA, as its viral genome interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins are strongly acetylated by human histone acetyltransferases, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), but not by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in vitro.

Confirmatory factor analysis followed by multiple logistic regression models adjusting for relevant covariates were used to identify vaccine perceptions uniquely associated with (a) intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine (intention), and (b) intention to get vaccinated right away (urgency). RESULTS: In total, 95.4% of participants of the seroprevalence study completed the vaccine questionnaire, corresponding to 17.7% of the target population. Vaccine intention was associated with staff who valued expert recommendations (AOR = 10.5, 95% CI = 7.39C14.90) accepted routine vaccines (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.26C2.98) and perceived higher benefits (AOR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.01C1.65) and lower safety risks of vaccination (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.29C0.54).

Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The virus has four essential structural proteins which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and small envelope (E) protein. Different technologies are being used for vaccine development to battle the pandemic. There are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, protein subunit-based vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines and virus-like particle-based vaccines. Vaccine development has five stages. In the clinical developmental stage, vaccine development can be sped up by combining phase 1 and 2. The vaccines can also be approved more swiftly on an emergent basis and released sooner for usage. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines for emergency use. There are other vaccines that have been approved around the world. The mRNA vaccines have been created using a novel technology and they contain a synthetically created RNA sequence of virus fragments encoding the S-protein which is injected. These vaccines have a relatively low cost of production and faster manufacturing time but can have comparatively lower immunogenicity and more than one dose of vaccine may be required. In the case of viral vector-based vaccines, genes encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are isolated and following gene sequencings are introduced into the adenovirus vector. These vaccines have a relatively fast manufacturing time but the efficacy of the vaccine is variable based on the hosts immune response to the viral vector. At the time of this paper, there were 81 vaccines in clinical development stage and 182 vaccines in preclinical development stage. Vaccines are an essential tool in our battle against COVID-19. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines have completed their phase III trials while many other potential vaccines are still in developmental stages.

METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted one month post-impose of the quarantine, between the April 21 and the May 3, 2020. Adult respondents in a relationship completed a questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, structured inquiries regarding sexual activity and quality of relationship, anxiety level, and mood during the quarantine, as well as the IIEF and FSFI indices. OUTCOMES: Sexual function was assessed using the Greek versions of the FSFI and IIEF for females and males respectively. Sexual activity using 5 statements regarding frequency of sexual thoughts, masturbation, and intercourse, quality of intercourse and general estimation of the level of sexual function. Participants graded their level of agreement. Relationship quality was assessed using 5 questions regarding communication, company, understanding, tension and general estimation of companionship. Participants graded their level of agreement. Two additional statements were used in order to evaluate mood and the level of anxiety. RESULTS: A sum of 299 adult heterosexual participants in a relationship participated. Little or no negative impact on sexual function was reported. Increased anxiety and deficient mood were reported only for those with no access to their partner. Being in a steady relationship and living with their partner, but only for couples without children, resulted in satisfaction by sexual activity and enhanced emotional security.

The mean concentrations of air pollutants were extracted from Sentinel 5P data. The COVID-19 confirmed case densities of two provinces, Semnan and Qom, were more than all other provinces. The effect of pollutants on the confirmed case densities was analyzed using multiple linear regression in order to estimate the impact coefficients for individual provinces. The impact coefficients determine the level of each pollutant's contribution to the density of total confirmed cases. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone had both considerable negative and positive correlations with the density of confirmed COVID-19 cases, although sulfur dioxide was correlated more negatively than positively. In Semnan, a high hot spot province, nitrogen dioxide had the most significant effect on the density of confirmed cases among all pollutants, while the effect of carbon monoxide was greater in Qom.

Likewise, the non-randomised trials failed to show an association between NVAP risk and OCI (RR random 1.42, 95% CI, 0.70-2.88, p value 0.32). However, in the subgroup analysis comparing dental professional involvement in care vs usual care, reduced NVAP risk was demonstrated (RR random 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.98, p value 0.03). Conclusions Study results suggest that professional dental care may confer some benefit among NVAP patients. The lack of consistent OCI protocols, data in hospitalised patients and robust randomised clinical trials do not allow definitive conclusions about the contribution of OCI in mitigating NVAP risk.

Each of the proteins from the homologous family VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC and VEGFD employs a core cysteine-knot structural domain for the specific interaction with one or more of the cognate tyrosine kinase receptors. Additional diversity is exhibited by the involvement of neuropilinsCtransmembrane co-receptors, whose b1 domain contains the binding site for the C-terminal sequence of VEGFs. Although all relevant isoforms of VEGFs that interact with neuropilins contain the required C-terminal Arg residue, there is selectivity of neuropilins and VEGF receptors for the VEGF proteins, which is reflected in the physiological roles that they mediate. To decipher the contribution made by the C-terminal sequences of the individual VEGF proteins to that functional differentiation, we determined structures of molecular complexes of neuropilins and VEGF-derived peptides and examined binding interactions for all neuropilin-VEGF pairs experimentally and computationally. While X-ray crystal structures and ligand-binding experiments highlighted similarities between the ligands, the molecular dynamics simulations uncovered conformational preferences of VEGF-derived peptides beyond the C-terminal arginine that contribute to the ligand selectivity of neuropilins. The implications for the design of the selective antagonists of neuropilins functions are discussed.","output":"VEGFA, B, C: Implications of the C-Terminal Sequence Variations for the Interaction with Neuropilins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Safe and effective oral formulation of a drug, that is easy to store, transport, and administer, is imperative to reach the masses including those without adequate facilities and resources, in order to combat globally transmitted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this decision analytic modeling study, the safety of investigational COVID-19 drugs in clinical trials was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Drugs (APOD) methodology. The method was extensively tested for various unbiased datasets based on different criteria such as drugs recalled worldwide for failing to meet safety standards, organ-specific toxicities, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs with remarkable successes. Experimental validation of the predictions made by APOD were demonstrated by comparison with a progression of multiparametric optimization of a series of cancer drugs that led to a potent drug (GDC-0941) which went into the clinical development. The drugs were classified into three categories of safety profiles: strong, moderate and weak. A total of 3556 drugs available in public databases were examined. According to the results, drugs with strong safety profiles included molnupiravir (EIDD-2801), moderate safety profiles included dexamethasone, and weak safety profiles included lopinavir. In this analysis, the physicochemical-pharmacokinetic APOD fingerprint was associated with the drug safety profile of withdrawn, approved, as well as drugs in clinical trials and the APOD method facilitated decision-making and prioritization of the investigational treatments.","output":"Abbreviated Profile of Drugs (APOD): modeling drug safety profiles to prioritize investigational COVID-19 treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Previous studies have suggested an association between Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the current study was to examine the association in Guatemala, a region with elevated prevalences of both H pylori and NAFLD. Associations between H pylori and other metabolic conditions were also examined, as were associations between H hepaticus and H bilis and the metabolic conditions. MATERIALS & METHODS The analysis included 424 participants from a cross-sectional study in Guatemala. H pylori seropositivity was defined as positivity for  4 antigens. Seropositivities for H bilis and H hepaticus were defined as positivity for  2 antigens. NAFLD was estimated using the Fatty Liver Index and the Hepatic Steatosis Index. Other conditions examined were obesity, central obesity, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS No overall associations between H pylori, H hepaticus, or H bilis and NAFLD or related metabolic conditions were found. Seropositivity for H pylori antigens CagA and VacA and H hepaticus antigen HH0713 was each significantly associated with NAFLD, however. In addition, associations were observed between the H pylori antigens HyuA, HP1564, and UreA and specified metabolic conditions. CONCLUSIONS While no overall associations between H pylori or Helicobacter species with NAFLD or related conditions were observed, some selected Helicobacter spp. antigens were associated with NAFLD. Further research is warranted to examine whether H. species are associated with any metabolic condition.","output":"Associations between Helicobacter pylori with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other metabolic conditions in Guatemala."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, bacterial and viral infections play a relevant role in worsening lung function and, therefore, favour disease progression.

We here review data on the bacterialCviral infections and related airways and lung parenchyma inflammation in stable and exacerbated COPD, focussing our attention on the prevalent molecular pathways in these different clinical conditions. The roles of macrophages, autophagy and NETosis are also briefly discussed in the context of lung infections in COPD. Controlling their combined response may restore a balanced lung homeostasis, reducing the risk of lung function decline. KEY MESSAGE: Bacteria and viruses can influence the responses of the innate and adaptive immune system in the lung of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The relationship between viruses and bacterial colonization, and the consequences of the imbalance of these components can modulate the inflammatory state of the COPD lung. The complex actions involving immune trigger cells, which activate innate and cell-mediated inflammatory responses, could be responsible for the clinical consequences of irreversible airflow limitation, lung remodelling and emphysema in COPD patients.","output":"Bacterial and viral infections and related inflammatory responses in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we propose a Transformer-based model to trace students knowledge acquisition.

Qualitative risk labels: Determine whether attaching a qualitative risk label (e.g. adding \\"very low risk\\" next to the actual numerical risk) impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. 2. Comparison groups: Determine how framing side-effect risks in comparison to other causes of mortality (COVID-19 mortality and motor vehicle mortality) impacts individuals willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. 3. How the comparison risks are presented: Determine whether comparisons to other causes of mortality are presented on an absolute or relative scale impacts individuals willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. Secondarily, we will also randomize a subset of individuals to receive the \\"status-quo\\" framing, where the vaccine side-effect risks are presented like how they were presented in the media. We will then compare vaccine intentions and perceptions of vaccine safety between the status-quo and the pooled intervention group samples to provide some insight into how \\"harmful\\" the status-quo framing was. Ultimately, we believe that our results will provide the some of the first experimental evidence on how the communication of COVID-19 vaccine risks may impact the public's willingness to be vaccinated and can inform future efforts to increase vaccination rates. TRIAL DESIGN: Our study is an online-based randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of different vaccine side-effect framings on COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceived safety for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Using a factorial design, we will experimentally assess the impact of 3 risk framing strategies, varying whether the risk is presented: (1) with a qualitative label, (2) whether the risk is presented with a comparison risk, and (3) for comparison cases, whether the comparison is in absolute or relative terms. We will also randomize a portion of respondents to a status quo framing where the side effect risk mimics the media's communication in early April 2021. PARTICIPANTS: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla platform. To be eligible, participants must be 18 years old or over (male, female, or other), have current residence in the US or UK, and be able to speak English. Participants will be excluded from the study if they do not meet our inclusion criteria. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Our study content will consist of five pages presented to individuals online. Page 1 will explain the purpose of the study and contain the consent information. Page 2 will contain basic sociodemographic questions, including participants' age, sex, and schooling level. Page 3 will set up the experiment by telling individuals that we will describe a hypothetical new COVID-19 vaccine and that we would like to know how likely they would be to take the vaccine and how safe they think the vaccine is. On this page, we will also encourage individuals to respond truthfully and remind them that their answers are confidential and cannot be linked back to any personal identifying information. Page 4 will be the main experimental slide, where we will present individuals with information on the vaccine, varying how the vaccination risk is communicated based on which experimental framing arm they are randomized to. We will factorially randomize across the following factors in the following order (separately by country). First, we will determine whether individuals are randomized to the status quo framing, or the intervention framings (1500 respondents to the status quo, and 4500 to the intervention). Among those randomized to the intervention framing, we will randomize (equal allocation) whether the side effect is presented without a comparison, with a comparison to COVID-19 mortality, or with a comparison to motor vehicle mortality. We will then factorially randomize (equal allocation) whether the risk is presented with a qualitative risk label or not (e.g. \\"very low risk\\"). To ensure that the factors are independent of one another, we will do this by randomizing individuals to the risk labels within strata of the comparison group factor. Lastly, among those randomized to the comparison group, we will factorially randomize whether the risk is presented as an absolute or relative comparison. As previously, we will ensure independence by doing this randomization within strata of comparison group*risk labelling. This entire design is visualized in the full protocol.

The risk information will be presented on a single page along with the two main outcome questions. Lastly, for individuals that reported that they are unlikely or unsure about whether they would take the vaccine, the final page will ask them their reason (question based on a recently published study of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy). MAIN OUTCOMES: Our primary outcome is individuals' willingness to take the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. We will measure this outcome by asking, \\"How likely would you be to take this vaccine?\\" allowing individuals to choose from a four-point Likert response of \\"Unlikely, Unsure leaning towards unlikely, Unsure leaning towards likely, Very likely.\\" This outcome variable, including the categories and phrasing, is based on a recently published study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy conducted by researchers with the Vaccine Hesitance Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Our secondary outcome is individuals' perceived safety of the vaccine. We will assess this outcome by asking individuals, \\"How safe do you feel this vaccine is?\\" allowing them to choose answers ranging from 1-10 where 1 is extremely unsafe, and 10 is extremely safe. Both outcomes will be measured at the time of the questionnaire. Participants can take up to 45 min to complete the questions but will not be able to go back and change their responses after submitting their questionnaire. RANDOMIZATION: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to each of the experimental arms. Gorilla allows for two randomization options - independent randomization of each individual based on a probability draw and balanced randomization, which randomizes without replacement such that among groups of respondents a fixed proportion will end up in each experimental arm. We will use the \\"balanced randomization\\" option to ensure that our experimental arms are balanced. Participants will be randomized based on the allocations described above. BLINDING: Because Prolific handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED: We will randomize 6000 participants per country for a total sample of 12000 individuals. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is July 14, 2021.

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.","output":"Potential preanalytical and analytical vulnerabilities in the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is related to the oxygen therapy requirement at hospital admission and to ascertain the prognostic effect of the PNI and the oxygen therapy requirement as predictors of hospital length of stay in patients with moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The participants were categorized: (1) non-oxygen therapy (moderate COVID-19 not requiring oxygen therapy); (2) nasal cannula therapy (severe COVID-19 requiring nasal cannula oxygen therapy); and (3) high-flow therapy (severe COVID-19 requiring high-flow oxygen therapy). PNI was calculated for each patient according to the following equation: serum albumin [g/dL]  10 + total lymphocyte count [per mm(3)]  0.005. The participants were categorized into malnutrition (PNI <40), mild malnutrition (PNI 40C45), and non-malnutrition (PNI > 45). RESULTS: According to PNI, malnutrition was more prevalent in the high-flow therapy group (94.9%; P < 0.001) with significantly lower PNI compared to both groups even after adjusting for the center and C-reactive protein. Patients in the high-flow therapy group [9 days (95% CI 7.2, 10.7), P < 0.001] and malnutrition status [7 days (95% CI 6.6, 7.4), P = 0.016] showed a significant longer hospital length of stay compared to their counterparts. The multivariable Cox proportional hazard models showed significant associations between both oxygen therapy requirement and PNI categories and hospital discharge.

There are limited data regarding the optimal duration of treatment with NET and the ideal patient (pt) population for NET in terms of age and RS result. This question rose to critical importance amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, during which NET was utilized more broadly in attempts to delay surgery or chemotherapy while preserving optimal pt outcomes. This study re-examines the use of NET among a cohort of pts with HR+ BC randomized to NET or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) based on RS (performed on initial core biopsy specimens). Methods:Data were pooled from two independent studies performed at Emory's Winship Cancer Institute and Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) from 2010-2012. These studies evaluated rates of clinical and pathologic complete response (pCR) among pts with early stage, HR+ BC assigned to treatment groups based on RS results. Pts with RS 0-10 received NET (Group (Grp) A), RS 11-24/25 (Emory 11-24 vs VCU 11-25) were randomized to NET (Grp B) or NCT (Grp SC), and those with RS 25/26-100 received NCT (Grp D). Associations between RS result, neoadjuvant therapy and pCR in the breast, lymph nodes (LN) and breast plus LN were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Results:109 pts were included in this analysis. The Emory cohort was younger (median age 56 years (yrs) vs 63 yrs in VCU cohort) and more diverse (37.5% African American (AA) vs 18.6% AA in VCU cohort). The pts were predominantly post-menopausal (69.6% Emory vs 83.1% VCU). Nodal status among the Emory cohort was evenly divided with 50% N0 and 50% N+, while the majority of VCU pts were N0 (76.3% N0 vs 22.0% N+). Pts were grouped based on RS result: RS <11 (18% Emory vs 20.3% VCU), RS 11-24/25 (36% Emory vs 55.9% VCU) and RS 24/25 or higher (46% Emory vs 23.7% VCU). Pts with low RS result were older (median 64 yrs vs 59 yrs among RS > 24/25) with higher percentage of low-grade tumors (47.6% grade 1 vs 5.4% grade 1 among RS >24/25). With regard to pCR, there were no significant differences among pts with low or intermediate RS results, as no pts in these groups achieved pCR in the breast or breast + LN (Table). Pts with RS result 25/26-100 (Grp D) were the only pts shown to achieve pCR in breast + LN (18.9%, p= 0.0043 across groups). Notably, while pts on the Emory study received longer courses of NET (median 10 months vs 5.5 months), there were no significant differences in pCR across RS result subgroups noted between the two institutions. Conclusion:Our results demonstrate that the use of Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score? or other genomic assays in the neoadjuvant setting may help guide treatment decisions when considering the use of NET versus NCT. Pt age and length of endocrine therapy as well as pt preferences should be considered when determining neoadjuvant treatment plans. There are currently ongoing studies evaluating the use of NET with CDK4/6 inhibitors that will offer further insight into optimal neoadjuvant treatment strategies in HR+ BC. Subsequent phase III evaluation of the role of genomic assays in the neoadjuvant setting is feasible and may help determine whether NET + CDK 4/6 inhibitors could replace NCT for pts with higher RS values.","output":"Using Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score?

In this paper were investigated the physiological traits of two populations of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata, living at two different pH for several generations to assess the reasons of the algae reduced abundance at current (8.1) compared to low pH (6.7). Besides, through transplant experiments, the two populations were analysed for the stress response and reversibility of physiological performance at different pH. The long-term acclimation to high pCO2/low pH favours an ecotype characterised by low energetic costs, higher photochemical efficiency and more resistance to the oxidative stress, compared to individuals living at current pH. These traits promoted the growth and reproduction of the community living at pH 6.7, favouring a lower macroalgal diversity, but a higher ecological success under ocean acidification. The similar behaviour observed between Dictyota living at pH 6.7 and transplanted thalli from pH 6.7 to 8.1, suggested a high tolerance to pH changes in the short-term. On the contrary, adaptive responses may have favoured molecular adjustments on the long-term, as showed by the significant differences between the wild populations at pH 8.1 and 6.7. The overall data indicate that both plasticity and adaptive mechanisms may be the reasons for the success of the brown seaweeds under future high pCO2/low pH. The plasticity due to photochemistry adjustments is likely involved in the early response to environmental changes. Conversely, modifications in the photosynthetic biochemical machinery suggest that more complex adaptive mechanisms occurred in the current population of Dictyota living at pH 6.7. Further studies on population genetics will reveal if any differentiation is taking place at the population level or a local adaptation has already occurred in Dictyota and other brown algae under chronic low pH.","output":"Long-term response of Dictyota dichotoma var. intricata (C.

CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old woman without Marfan syndrome was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain in the 34(th) week of gestation. She has diagnosed as having a Stanford type-A AAD involving an aortic arch and descending aorta via aortic computed tomographic angiography. The patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure operating room in one hour and underwent cesarean delivery and ascending aorta replacement. All medical staff adopted third-level medical protection measures throughout the patient transfer and surgical procedure. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure intensive care unit ward. The nucleic acid test and anti-COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM were performed and were negative. The patient and infant were discharged without complication nine days later and recovered uneventfully.

Moreover, it is a great challenge to determine how to promote the target molecules to be more concentrated on the hotspots of the SERS substrate by engineering a surface with switching interfacial wettability. Along these lines, wafer-scale uniformly hydrophobic silicon nanorods arrays (SiNRs) decorated with Au nanoparticles were designed as the SERS substrate. Typically, the SERS substrate was fabricated by enforcing the polystyrene (PS) sphere self-assembly, as well as the plasma etching and the magnetron sputtering techniques. Consequently, the SERS substrate was treated by soaking within a n-dodecyl mercaptan (NDM) solution at different times in order to obtain adjustable wettabilities. By leveraging the electromagnetic enhancement resulted from the Au nanostructures and enrichment effect induced by the hydrophobicity, the SERS substrate is endowed with efficient SERS capabilities. During the detection of malachite green (MG), an ultralow relative standard deviation (RSD) 4.04C6.14% is achieved and the characteristic signal of 1172 cm(?1) can be detected as low as 1 ng/mL.

This is especially apparent during times of pandemics or other social unrest situations as currently seen during the COVID-19 crisis. It can manifest itself as violence (towards or from the mentally ill person), increased substance use, increased overcrowding of our prisons, tackling with comorbid medical conditions which have worsened due to lack of initial attention (a particularly big problem among the mentally ill), increased strain on tax payers, and overall affecting the quality of everyone's life. Furthermore, mental health maladies can cause increase work absenteeism and poor work performance and decreased economic productivity. The stigma associated with mental health also leads to poor funding form policy makers, as there is a lack of forceful advocacy in dealing with these issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the loss of productivity due to mental health disability accounts to close to 5% of the gross national product of the European Union (WHO 2019). One of the most crucial causes of lack of mental screening, recognition, and treatment is the limited availability of mental health trained providers. The physician assistant profession is in a unique role to fill this niche as they have been trained as generalists who specialize only when getting trained in their specific field during their employment. Additionally, the fact that PAs do have lateral mobility does lend this profession to meet the needs of society, especially in the psychiatric fields, in a prompt and competent manner. The need for physician assistants (PAs) in psychiatry and addiction medicine is a nationwide trend resulting in existing and emerging shortages of psychiatric and addiction medicine providers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of one of the worlds largest CCT (the Brazilian Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP)) on maternal mortality during a period of 11 years. METHODS: The study had an ecological longitudinal design and used all 2548 Brazilian municipalities with vital statistics of adequate quality during 2004C2014. BFP municipal coverage was classified into four levels, from low to consolidated, and its duration effects were measured using the average municipal coverage of previous years. We used negative binomial multivariable regression models with fixed-effects specifications, adjusted for all relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare variables. RESULTS: BFP was significantly associated with reductions of maternal mortality proportionally to its levels of coverage and years of implementation, with a rate ratio (RR) reaching 0.88 (95%CI 0.81C0.95), 0.84 (0.75C0.96) and 0.83 (0.71C0.99) for intermediate, high and consolidated BFP coverage over the previous 11 years. The BFP duration effect was stronger among young mothers (RR 0.77; 95%CI 0.67C0.96). BFP was also associated with reductions in the proportion of pregnant women with no prenatal visits (RR 0.73; 95%CI 0.69C0.77), reductions in hospital case-fatality rate for delivery (RR 0.78; 95%CI 0.66C0.94) and increases in the proportion of deliveries in hospital (RR 1.05; 95%CI 1.04C1.07). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a consolidated and durable CCT coverage could decrease maternal mortality, and these long-term effects are stronger among poor mothers exposed to CCT during their childhood and adolescence, suggesting a CCT inter-generational effect. Sustained CCT coverage could reduce health inequalities and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1, and should be preserved during the current global economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Women who delivered at Inha University Hospital (Incheon, Korea) in 2011C2012 and 2018C2019 were enrolled in the study. We surveyed the rate of influenza vaccination, perception scores, and related factors through telephonic interviews and compared the results from 2011C2012 and 2018C2019 with those from 2006C2007. RESULTS: The number of survey respondents was 227 in 2006C2007, 152 in 2011C2012, and 171 in 2018C2019. The rate of vaccination coverage increased from 4.0% in 2006C2007 to 42.0% in 2011C2012 and 59.3% in 2018C2019. Perception scores also increased progressively from 3.8 in 2006C2007 to 4.2 in 2011C2012 and 5.1 in 2018C2019.

METHODS: COVID-19 cases were identified through a prospective ongoing survey between March 17 and April 30, 2020 among all severe asthma specialists from 15 hospitals of the Dutch Severe Asthma Registry RAPSODI. From these cases, data was collected on patient characteristics, including co-morbidities, COVID-19 disease progression and asthma exacerbations. Findings were then compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population. RESULTS: Of 634 severe asthma patients who received biologic therapy in RAPSODI, 9 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19.

METHODS: Fourteen independent operators visually evaluated 133 coronary lesions which had a previous FFR measurement, indicating the degree of stenosis (DS), FS and IFA intention. We determined the accuracy of FS prediction using several scenarios combining individual and group decision, considering IFA as deemed necessary by the operator or only in intermediate lesions. RESULTS: The accuracy of VE in predicting FS was largely variable between operators (average 66.1%); it improved significantly when IFA was used either as per operator's opinion (86.3%; p < 0.0001) or only in intermediate DS (82.9; p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between using IFA per observer's opinion or only in intermediate DS lesions (p = 0.166).

These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the 'gender health paradox' and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates - where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women.

To gain insight into virus-host interactions, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen. The expression of over 20,000 cellular genes was individually knocked down in human airway epithelial A549 cells, followed by infection with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Knockdown of expression of the cellular ATP1A1 protein, which is the major subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase of the plasma membrane, had one of the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP expression and viral titer. Inhibition was not observed for vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that it was RSV-specific rather than a general effect. ATP1A1 formed clusters in the plasma membrane very early following RSV infection, which was independent of replication but dependent on the attachment glycoprotein G. RSV also triggered activation of ATP1A1, resulting in signaling by c-Src-kinase activity that transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by Tyr845 phosphorylation. ATP1A1 signaling and activation of both c-Src and EGFR were found to be required for efficient RSV uptake. Signaling events downstream of EGFR culminated in the formation of macropinosomes. There was extensive uptake of RSV virions into macropinosomes at the beginning of infection, suggesting that this is a major route of RSV uptake, with fusion presumably occurring in the macropinosomes rather than at the plasma membrane. Important findings were validated in primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). In A549 cells and HSAEC, RSV uptake could be inhibited by the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 (rostafuroxin) that bind specifically to the ATP1A1 extracellular domain and block RSV-triggered EGFR Tyr845 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we identified ATP1A1 as a host protein essential for macropinocytic entry of RSV into respiratory epithelial cells, and identified PST2238 as a potential anti-RSV drug.","output":"The alpha-1 subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (ATP1A1) is required for macropinocytic entry of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in human respiratory epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Maxillofacial departments all over Italy were increasingly involved in facing the COVID-19 emergency.

Falls and their consequences have an impact on peoples quality of life, particularly the older adults. However, there have been very few studies on falls among ethnic minority groups living in rural areas. The aim of this study was to examine factors related to fall awareness, falls, and quality of life among ethnic minority older adults living in northern Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 462 older adults from ethnic minority groups living in rural communities in Phayao and Lamphun provinces of northern Thailand using a multi-stage sampling technique. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews, with structured questionnaires covering health information, fall awareness, and quality of life (WHOQOL-OLD). The factors were determined using simple linear regression and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 68.2, Karen (35.5%), Mien (24.2%), indigenous (20.8%), and Hmong (19.5%). In the previous 12 months, 20.6% of elders had experienced a fall, and 4.5% of them had experienced multiple falls. More than half of the elders had moderate fall awareness and quality of life (71.6% and 68.6%, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that minority group, sociodemographic characteristics, sleep duration, and fear of falling were all found to be associated with fall awareness, falls, and quality of life score (p<0.001). There was a significant relationship among fall awareness, falls, and quality of life score (p<0.001). Compared to those who had not fallen in the previous year, the quality of life of the older adults who had fallen was about 11 points lower. CONCLUSION: Several independent variables were discovered to be fall risk factors and quality of life indicators. It is critical to recognize the risk factors to promote fall prevention programs that are appropriate for the older adults among ethnic minorities. Therefore, public health agencies and local government should be aware of the problem and initiate an implementation program and policy to prevent falls and improve the quality of life among ethnic minority older adults.","output":"Risk Factors Associated with Fall Awareness, Falls, and Quality of Life Among Ethnic Minority Older Adults in Upper Northern Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the worldwide need for simple remotely delivered (digital) scalable interventions that can also be used preventatively to protect the mental health of health care staff exposed to psychologically traumatic events during their COVID-19Crelated work. We have developed a brief behavioral intervention that aims to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events but has only been delivered face-to-face so far. After digitalizing the intervention materials, the intervention was delivered digitally to target users (health care staff) for the first time. The adaption for staffs working context in a hospital setting used a co-design approach. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this mixed method exploratory pilot study with health care staff who experienced working in the pandemic were to pilot the intervention that we have digitalized (for remote delivery and with remote support) and adapted for this target population (health care staff working clinically during a pandemic) to explore its ability to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events and improve related symptoms (eg, posttraumatic stress) and participants perception of their functioning, and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of both the digitalized intervention and digitalized data collection. METHODS: We worked closely with target users with lived experience of working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic in a hospital context (registered nurses who experienced intrusive memories from traumatic events at work; N=3). We used a mixed method design and exploratory quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: After completing the digitalized intervention once with remote researcher support (approximately 25 minutes) and a brief follow-up check-in, participants learned to use the intervention independently. All 3 participants reported zero intrusive memories during week 5 (primary outcome: 100% digital data capture). Prior to study inclusion, two or more intrusions in the week were reported preintervention (assessed retrospectively). There was a general pattern of symptom reduction and improvement in perceived functioning (eg, concentration) at follow-up. The digitalized intervention and data collection were perceived as feasible and rated as acceptable (eg, all 3 participants would recommend it to a colleague). Participants were positive toward the digital intervention as a useful tool that could readily be incorporated into work life and repeated in the face of ongoing or repeated trauma exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention when delivered remotely and adapted for this population during the pandemic was well received by participants. Since it could be tailored around work and daily life and used preventatively, the intervention may hold promise for health care staff pending future evaluations of efficacy. Limitations include the small sample size, lack of daily intrusion frequency data in the week before the intervention, and lack of a control condition. Following this co-design process in adapting and improving intervention delivery and evaluation, the next step is to investigate the efficacy of the digitalized intervention in a randomized controlled trial.","output":"Digitalizing a Brief Intervention to Reduce Intrusive Memories of Psychological Trauma for Health Care Staff Working During COVID-19: Exploratory Pilot Study With Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oleandrin is a highly lipid-soluble cardiac glycoside isolated from the plant Nerium oleander (Apocynaceae) and is used as a traditional herbal medicine due to its excellent pharmacological properties.

FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, of 194 637 people with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, 30 569 (157%) received two or more prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine. Between March 1 and July 13, 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 023% (95% CI 018 to 029) among users and 022% (020 to 025) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0008% (?0051 to 0066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunosuppressive drugs, and geographical region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 103, 95% CI 080 to 133). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressive drugs. Quantitative bias analyses indicated that our observed associations were robust to missing information for additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among people who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease before the COVID-19 outbreak in England. Therefore, completion of randomised trials investigating pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe outcomes from COVID-19 are warranted.

The purpose of this study is to interpret the Purpose in Life Test (PIL) and its relationship to physical activity and mental relaxation/meditation in confinement. A survey was conducted in an online form on 533 individuals (39  11 years) using the Purpose in Life Test (PIL) and an ad-hoc questionnaire regarding physical activity time (PA), mental relaxation/meditation time (RM), hours of sleep (HS), number of people in confinement (NPC) and concerns and satisfaction during confinement. The overall mean of the PIL test was 114  16, indicating a strong life purpose, and there were no differences by sex or by levels of physical activity, but for RM and age levels. The scores of the PIL test were positively correlated with the age, PA and time of RM. On the other hand, the main concern is the economy (50%) and health or getting sick by COVID-19 (37%), and what gives the greatest satisfaction is the family (40%) and sharing and spending time with the family (33%). People who perform RM activities at least 30 min/week have significantly higher PIL test scores. Despite the drastic changes caused by confinement, individuals have a strong life purpose.

Materials and methods Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. The OE-MRI was based on a respiratory-gated three-dimensional (3D) radial UTE sequence. For each patient, the percent signal enhancement (PSE) map was calculated using the expression PSE = (S100% C S21%)/S21%, where S21% and S100% are signals acquired during room air and 100% oxygen inhalation, respectively. Agreement of lesion detectability between UTE-MRI and computed tomography (CT) was performed using the kappa test. The MannCWhitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in the mean PSE between mild-type COVID-19 and common-type COVID-19. Spearmans test was used to assess the relationship between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. Furthermore, the MannCWhitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in region of interest (ROI) mean PSE between normal pulmonary parenchyma and lesions. The KruskalCWallis test was applied to test the difference in the mean PSE between different lesion types. Results CT and UTE-MRI reached good agreement in lesion detectability. Ventilation measures in mild-type patients (5.3  5.5%) were significantly different from those in common-type patients (3  3.9%). Besides, there was no significant correlation between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. The mean PSE of COVID-19 lesions (3.2  4.9%) was significantly lower than that of the pulmonary parenchyma (5.4  3.9%). No significant difference was found among different lesion types.

The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. With the outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, occasional outbreaks of measles and tuberculosis, and the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, it is important to estimate the risks for dental health care workers. Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. This equation incorporated the indoor air quality by using carbon dioxide as a proxy and added the respiratory protection rate from medical face masks and N95 respirators. Scenario-specific analyses, uncertainty analyses, and sensitivity analyses were run to produce probability rates. A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100%), coronaviruses (99.4%), influenza virus (89.4%), and M. tuberculosis (84.0%). The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5% for measles virus and 0% for the other pathogens. From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. The risk magnitude, however, is highly dependent on specific conditions in each dental clinic. Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen.","output":"Modeling of the Transmission of Coronaviruses, Measles Virus, Influenza Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Legionella pneumophila in Dental Clinics"},{"instruction":"Please

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the competitive advantage offered to the national economies by the implementation of policies dedicated to the digitalization of the society and the economy. In the last year, national economies have been faced with huge challenges imposed by the continuation and adaptation of economic processes in the virtual environment. The pace of adaptability of the workforce to digital technologies, the functional and technical literacy of human resources, the work organization and the level of digitalization influence the economic and social performance of the countries. The main aim of this research is to determine the defining characteristics in terms of the ability to adapt to telework in 30 European countries, to classify them according to their digital performance, but also to analyze their differences and determine the directions of action to capitalize on the opportunities offered by the online environment. The results of this research highlight that despite the investments which the analyzed European countries have made in recent years in digital infrastructure, there are large disparities in terms of adaptability to telework, as follows: poor adaptability (Southern and South-Eastern Europe), medium (Central Europe), high adaptability (Western and Central Europe), very high adaptability (Northern and North-Western Europe). The research is intended to be a catalyst for data-driven discussions on the adaptability of the European countries to digital innovations and the process of managing adaptation by governments to meet the economic and social needs.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study assessing the Europe-wide use of digital online pre-operative patient information or evaluation in the health sector. The aim of this study was to give an overview of the current status in Europe. Methods: A web-based questionnaire covering the informed consent process was sent to members of the European Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (ESAIC) in 47 European countries (42,433 recipients/930 responses). Six questions related specifically to the practice in paediatrics. Results: A total of 70.2% of the respondents indicated that it was not possible to obtain informed consent via the Internet in a routine setting, and 67.3% expressed that they did not know whether it is in line with the legal regulations. In paediatric anaesthesia, the informed consent of only one parent was reported to be sufficient by 77.6% of the respondents for simple interventions and by 63.8% for complex interventions. Just over 50% of the respondents judged that proof of identity of the parents was necessary, but only 29.9% stated that they ask for it in clinical routine. In the current situation, 77.9% would favour informed consent in person, whereas 60.2% could imagine using online or telephone interviews as an alternative to a face-to-face meeting if regulations were changed. Only 18.7% participants reported a change in the regulations due to the current pandemic situation. Conclusion: Whether informed consent is obtained either online or on the telephone in the paediatric population varies widely across Europe and is not currently implemented as standard practice.

We measured their expression levels in lung tissues of control non-IPF and IPF patients, and used murine animal models to study the deterioration of IPF caused by particulate matter (PM) and the molecular pathways involved in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Results: : In non-IPF patients, cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were limited to human alveolar cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were largely upregulated in IPF patients, and were co-expressed by fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP-1)+ lung fibroblasts in human pulmonary fibrotic tissue. In animal models, PM exposure increased the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also expressed in FSP-1+ lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-inuced pulmonary fibrosis, and when combined with PM exposure, they were further upregulated. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis and the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 caused by PM exposure were blocked by deletion of KC, a murine homologue of IL\\\\8, or treatment with reparixin, an inhibitor of IL\\\\8 receptors CXCR1/2.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) seems to effectively prevent the formation of gallstones detectable by ultrasound after bariatric surgery. The aim of the UPGRADE trial is to provide evidence on the prophylactic use of UDCA in preventing symptomatic gallstone disease postoperatively. METHODS: The UPGRADE trial is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicentre trial in patients with morbid obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Patients are randomly assigned to either UDCA 900 mg daily for 6 months or placebo treatment. This paper details the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of this trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of this trial is symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months after bariatric surgery, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary outcomes consist of the development of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24 months in the gallstone-negative group at baseline, presence of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24 months, number of cholecystectomies, side effects of UDCA, therapy compliance, quality of life, costs and revenues. Analyses will be completed according to this pre-specified SAP. The main analysis will be performed as a standard ITT analysis using the chi-squared test.

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) were included in the clinically extremely vulnerable group for complications of coronavirus by the UK government and advised to shield during a national lockdown. Data suggests that pandemic-related restrictions have been linked to a reduction in pulmonary exacerbation events (PEx). We sought to explore whether an increase in medicine possession ratio and potentially adherence may be a factor in this finding. Methods: 50 patients who received medication through a homecare delivery system at a single large adult centre were randomly selected. Data from 12 months pre-lockdown was compared to data for 9 months following start of shielding in March 2020. MPR was calculated and capped at 100%. Medications that were started or stopped during the pandemic were not included. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare pre- and post-values. Results: 91 prescription medications were valid for analysis (45 nebulised antibiotics, 34 mucolytics and 12 CFTR modulators). MPR increased for 41 prescriptions (45.1%), decreased for 21 medications (23.1%) and remained unchanged for 29 medications (31.9%). Median MPR increased from 83% [57C100%] to 89% [66C100%], p = 0.037. MPR for nebulised antibiotics significantly increased (median 75% [54C100%] vs 89% [61C100%], p = 0.027). Median MPR for CFTR modulators was 100% throughout and did not change for mucolytics (75% [42C100%] vs 78% [53C100%], p = 0.419). Conclusion: We report a significant change in medication possession in adults with CF during the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. It is unclear whether this change translated to an increase in adherence but may be one factor in the reported decrease in PEx events described during this time.

In Europe, it is subject to a complex framework of EU regulation, which includes consumer contract law, in particular the rules on information obligations, passing of risk and the right of withdrawal in the Consumer Rights Directive. We argue that these rules currently exacerbate the environmental externalities of B2C e-commerce of physical goods. They tend to increase the number of failed deliveries and product returns and they subsidize the most unsustainable consumer behaviour at the expense of others. While raising awareness on this impact is crucial, this paper also contemplates alternatives. Emerging technical and economic solutions can be accommodated rather than ignored by consumer contract law. And consumers can potentially receive more relevant information on the environmental impact of e-commerce, which would fit with the European Commissions sustainable consumption agenda. However, we believe that so-called green defaults are the most effective regulatory instruments, notwithstanding the possibility of more intrusive green amendments to the rules on deliveries and the right of withdrawal.","output":"The Role of European Consumer Regulation in Shaping the Environmental Impact of e-Commerce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Students constantly seek ways to improve productivity within academia. With the advancement of technology in the recent decade, virtual implementations may provide additional support for student productivity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic with online learning. One of the virtual realms for motivation include gamification, which has potential as an effective tool to further bolster an individual's source of intrinsic motivation. METHODS Qualitative and quantitative studies were extracted from APA PsycInfo, ProQuest, and IEEE for relevance to virtual gamification and intrinsic motivation. Studies were reviewed based on a pre-determined and piloted screening tool. Included studies were published between 1990 and 2020 in English within Asia, North America, or Europe. Only systematic reviews, randomized control trials (RCTs), meta-analysis, and grey literature were included. Study screening, extraction, and quality appraisals using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) were performed independently among two authors. Disagreements following reconciliation between two authors were settled by a third author. Heterogeneity in study designs, outcomes, and measurements precluded meta and statistical analyses; thus, a qualitative analysis of studies was provided. RESULTS Based on the appraised articles, gamification improves intrinsic motivation through badges, social interactions, points, and leaderboards.

Cumulative exposure to PPTEs can lead to clinically significant symptoms of mental disorders. PURPOSE We designed the current study to investigate the prevalence of different PPTEs among Canadian nurses and estimate the associations between diverse exposures and several mental disorders. METHODS Canadian nurses (i.e., registered nurses, registered psychiatric nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse practitioners) completed an online, self-reported survey. In total, 4067 participants (94.8% women) completed all relevant survey measures. RESULTS Nurses reported exposures to several PPTE categories including severe human suffering, life threatening illness or injury, and physical assault, often 11 or more times. There were significant (p<.05) associations between diverse traumatic events and all mental disorders (i.e., Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder) except Alcohol Use Disorder. CONCLUSIONS The current findings suggest that Canadian nurses are substantially exposed to traumatic events, which vary by several sociodemographic categories. PPTE exposures were significantly associated with mental disorders; that is, if PPTEs were eliminated among Canadian nurses in the sample, symptoms would be reduced between 42.0% and 58.0%.","output":"Exposures to Potentially Psychologically Traumatic Events Among Nurses in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir has received significant attention for its potential application in the treatment of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has already been tested for Ebola virus disease treatment and found to have activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The remdesivir core contains GS-441524, which interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases alone. In non-human primates, following IV administration, remdesivir is rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h to the active nucleoside triphosphate form, while GS-441524 is detectable in plasma for up to 24 h. Nevertheless, remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans are still unexplored, highlighting the need for a precise analytical method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification. OBJECTIVES: The validation of a reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification in human plasma. METHODS: Remdesivir and GS-441524 standards and quality controls were prepared in plasma from healthy donors. Sample preparation consisted of protein precipitation, followed by dilution and injection into the QSight 220 UHPLC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was obtained through an Acquity HSS T3 1.8 m, 2.1  50 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile with 0.05% formic acid. The method was validated using EMA and FDA guidelines. RESULTS: Analyte stability has been evaluated and described in detail. The method successfully fulfilled the validation process and it was demonstrated that, when possible, sample thermal inactivation could be a good choice in order to improve biosafety. CONCLUSIONS: This method represents a useful tool for studying remdesivir and GS-441524 clinical pharmacokinetics, particularly during the current COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Development and validation of a UHPLC-MS/MS method for quantification of the prodrug remdesivir and its metabolite GS-441524: a tool for clinical pharmacokinetics of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 69-year-old man renal transplant recipient for 4 years, presented with 4-day history of cough and dyspnoea.

For this reason, the photoreactive DNA-binding dye propidium monoazide (PMAxx?) has been developed by improving standard PMA. This compound binds and inactivates free DNA, thus preventing its amplification and sequencing. While the performances of PMA have been previously investigated, the efficiency with PMAxx? has been tested mainly for amplicon-based profiling approaches on a limited number of biological matrices. In this study, we validated the performance of PMAxx? for shotgun metagenomics approaches employing various human-associated matrices.

While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (IQR: 17-40). After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations.

This approach has been employed in the past to select subsamples of persons from a large panel of volunteers. One method of weighting, introduced here, is to assign a unit in the nonprobability sample the weight from its matched case in the probability sample. The properties of resulting estimators depend on whether the probability sample weights are inverses of selection probabilities or are calibrated. In addition, imperfect matching can cause estimates from the matched sample to be biased so that its weights need to be adjusted, especially when the size of the volunteer panel is small. Calibration weighting combined with matching is one approach to correcting bias and reducing variances. We explore the theoretical properties of the matched and matched, calibrated estimators with respect to a quasirandomization distribution that is assumed to describe how units in the nonprobability sample are observed, a superpopulation model for analysis variables collected in the nonprobability sample, and the randomization distribution for the probability sample.

This reduces the rate of rectal toxicity and allows dose escalation to the prostate. Our objectives were to provide an overview of technique for injection of a PEG hydrogel spacer, reduction in rectal dosimetry, gastrointestinal toxicity and potential complications. METHODS We systematically reviewed the role of PEG hydrogel spacers in PBT using the Cochrane and PRISMA methodology for all English-language articles from January 2013 to December 2019. Data was extracted for type of radiotherapy, number of patients, type of PEG-hydrogel used, mean prostate-rectum separation, rectal dosimetry, acute and late GI toxicity, procedure-related complications and the technique used for hydrogel insertion. RESULTS Nine studies (671 patients and 537 controls) met our inclusion criteria. Of these 4 used DuraSeal? and 5 used SpaceOAR?. The rectal spacing achieved varied between 7.7-16 mm. Failure of hydrogel insertion was seen only in 12 patients, mostly related to failure of hydrodissection in patients undergoing salvage PBT. Where reported, the rectal D2 cc was reduced by between 21.6 and 52.6% and the median rectal V75% cc was reduced by between 91.8-100%. Acute GI complications were mostly limited to grade 1 or 2 toxicity (n = 153, 33.7%) with low levels of grade 3 or 4 toxicity (n = 1, 0.22%). Procedure-related complications were limited to tenesmus (0.14%), rectal discomfort (1.19%), and bacterial prostatitis (0.44%). CONCLUSIONS PEG hydrogel spacers are safe to insert. Gel insertion is easy, fast and has a low rate of failure. These studies convincingly demonstrate a significant reduction in rectal dosimetry.

Early research indicated that not all non-medical prescribers utilised their qualification. A systematic review described 15 factors influencing NMP implementation. Findings from a recent linked Delphi study with independent physiotherapist and pharmacist prescribers achieved consensus for 1 barrier and 28 facilitators. However, item ranking differed for pharmacist and physiotherapist groups, suggesting facilitators and barriers to NMP differ depending on profession. The aim of this study was to further explore the lived experiences of NMP by pharmacists and physiotherapists. METHOD: Study design and analytical approach were guided by Interpretative Phenomenology Analysis principles. Focus groups (November and December 2020) used the Zoom virtual platform with pharmacist and physiotherapist prescribers. Each focus group followed a topic guide, developed a priori based on the Delphi study results, and was audio recorded digitally. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis and data were visualised using a concept map and sunburst graph, and a table of illustrative quotes produced. Research trustworthiness was enhanced through critical discussion of the topic guide and study findings by the research group and by author reflexivity. The study is reported in line with COREQ guidelines. RESULTS: Participants comprised three physiotherapists and seven pharmacists. Five themes were identified. The most frequently mentioned theme was Staff, and the subtheme Clinical team, describing the working relationship between participants and team members. The other themes were Self, Governance, Practical aspects and Patient care. Important inter-dependencies were described between themes and subthemes, for example between Governance and Quality and Safety. Differences were highlighted between the professions, some relating to the way each profession practises (for example decision making), others to the way the prescribing role had been established (for example administration support). CONCLUSIONS: The key finding of collaborative working with the clinical team emphasises its impact on successful implementation of NMP. Themes may be inter-dependent, and inter-profession differences were identified. Specifically designed prescribing roles were beneficial for participants.

Haemophagocytes with erythrophagocytosis were detectable in 67% of the deceased patients. In tissues with low number of haemophagocytes or ill-defined haemophagocytes, an increase in iron deposits was frequently seen. Next, morphological findings were correlated with several important clinical data and the H-Score was calculated to posthumously confirm the diagnosis secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Median duration of disease and hospitalisation time were shorter in patients with haemophagocytosis (n=10) compared to patients without haemophagocytosis (n=5). In addition, patients with haemophagocytes showed increased inflammatory parameters two to five days prior to death compared to patients without haemophagocytes.

This method allows for more lenient measures in areas less prone to the virus spread. There exist methods to model the spread of the virus, by predicting the number of confirmed cases. But the proposed system focuses more on the preventive side of the solution from a geographical point of view, by predicting the areas or regions that may become hotspots for the virus in the near future. The fact that the virus can only be transmitted by being in close proximity to an already infected person, suggests that, the regions that can easily be reached from an existing hotspot, have a higher chance of becoming a new hotspot. Moreover, in smaller regions, even after strict provisions, positive cases have been found. To consider this fact, the geographic distance between the nearest hotspots can be used as a measure of likelihood of the region also becoming a hotspot. In this paper, a weighted graph of regions with the regions themselves as weighted nodes with weight of the nodes as the number of active cases and the distance as edge weights. The graph can be completely connected or connected based on a distance threshold. The nodes are the administrative, and the distance measure tells the possible transmission between separate communities.

We previously found that a neurogenic differentiated human adipose tissue-derived stem cell-conditioned medium (NI-hADSC-CM) was protective against ROT-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. In the present study, ROT significantly decreased the phospho (p)-mTORC1/total (t)-mTOR, p-mTORC2/t-mTOR, and p-/t-ULK1 ratios and the ATG13 level by increasing the DEPTOR level and p-/t-AMPK ratio. Moreover, ROT increased the p-/t-Akt ratio and glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK3?) activity by decreasing the p-/t-ERK1/2 ratios and beclin-1 level. ROT also promoted the lipidation of LC3B-I to LC3B-II by inducing autophagosome formation in Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble cell lysate fractions. Additionally, the levels of ATG3, 5, 7, and 12 were decreased, along with those of lysosomal LAMP1, LAMP2, and TFEB, leading to lysosomal dysfunction. However, NI-hADSC-CM treatment increased the p-mTORC1, p-mTORC2, p-ULK1, p-Akt, p-ERK1/2, ATG13, and beclin-1 levels and decreased the p-AMPK level and GSK3? activity in response to ROT-induced toxicity. Additionally, NI-hADSC-CM restored the LC3B-I level, increased the p62 level, and normalized the ATG and lysosomal protein amounts to control levels. Autophagy array revealed that the secreted proteins in NI-hADSC-CM could be crucial in the neuroprotection. Taken together, our results showed that the neuroprotective effects of NI-hADSC-CM on the autophagy signaling pathways could alleviate the aggregation of -syn in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.","output":"Autophagy Signaling by Neural-Induced Human Adipose Tissue-Derived Stem Cell-Conditioned Medium during Rotenone-Induced Toxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Introduo]: Muitos pases j demonstraram que a transmiss?o por COVID- 19 de uma pessoa para outra pode ser desacelerada ou interrompida Essas aes salvaram vidas e deram ao restante do mundo mais tempo para se preparar para a chegada da COVID-19: prontid?o dos sistemas de resposta a emergncias;aumento da capacidade de deteco e assistncia aos pacientes;garantia de espa?o, insumos e equipes necessrias nos hospitais, e desenvolvimento de intervenes mdicas que salvam vidas Todos os pases devem urgentemente tomar as medidas necessrias para desacelerar a disseminao e evitar que seus sistemas de sade fiquem sobrecarregados, em funo de pacientes gravemente doentes por COVID-19","output":"Aes crticas de preparao, prontid?o e resposta  COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following its emergence in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused what rapidly became a global pandemic.

The government responded by making suggestions about how people could reduce the risk of spread on 16 March, moved swiftly into closing schools on the 18 March before announcing a mandatory lockdown on the 23rd March. This was a challenging time for UK equestrians who had to balance maintaining their equines routine and daily care alongside the increasing biosecurity measures. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to UK equestrians via social media over two days (28 and 29 March 2020) to better understand the decisions made by UK horse, pony and donkey owners during this time. Data from 452 respondents were generated across all four countries comprising the UK, although there were no significant differences in owner response to the pandemic between locations. The changes respondents made differed between the 16th and the 18th of March 2020, with an early emphasis on improving yard biosecurity and opting to stop riding, as well as reducing the time spent at the yard. After the 18 March, respondents placed more emphasis on risk reduction by changing the activities they did with their horse, including riding, with common examples including avoiding high risk activities such as riding on busy roads, jumping, riding young or nervous horses. Few respondents reported having an emergency plan in place should they become ill or otherwise unable to care for their equine. The findings highlight areas that would significantly benefit from in-depth investigation in future research. Equestrian behaviour and mindset around risk-taking and risk perception have already been researched in relation to equestrian activities and sport but have received little attention in the context of wider health challenges. Understanding the uptake of emergency planning and preparation in the UK equestrian community also warrants consideration.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of intra-articular (IA) administration of tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic commonly used in TKA, and ALM chondroprotective solution on postoperative inflammation and joint tissue healing in a rat model of knee implant surgery. METHODS: Male SpragueCDawley rats (n = 24) were randomly divided into TXA or ALM treatment groups. The right knee of each rat was implanted with titanium (femur) and polyethylene (tibia) implants. An IA bolus (0.1 ml) of TXA or ALM was administered after implantation and capsule closure, and before skin closure. Postoperative coagulopathy, haematology and systemic inflammatory changes were assessed. Inflammatory and fibrotic markers were assessed in joint tissue, 28 days after surgery. RESULTS: Haemostasis was comparable in animals treated with TXA or ALM after knee implant surgery. In contrast to ALM-treated animals, systemic inflammatory markers remained elevated at day 5 (IL-6, IL-12, IL-10, platelet count) and day 28 (IL-1, IL-10) following surgery in TXA-treated animals. At day 28 following surgery, the extension range of motion of operated knees was 1.7-fold higher for ALM-treated animals compared to the TXA group. Key inflammatory mediators (NF-B, IL-12, IL-2), immune cell infiltration (CD68(+) cells) and markers of fibrosis (-SMA, TGF-) were also lower in capsular tissue of ALM-treated knees at day 28. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that IA administration of ALM is superior to TXA for reducing postoperative systemic and joint inflammation and promoting restoration of healthy joint tissue architecture in a rat model of TKA. Further studies are warranted to assess the clinical translational potential of ALM IA solution to improve patient outcomes following arthroplasty.

With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, end of the year data and 2021 revealed the gradual increase to prevalence of known variants of concern, particularly B.1.1.7, that have acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral genomes are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may become problematic when super-spreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in the United States: High accumulation of viral mutations over time likely through serial Founder Events and mutational bursts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Com o objetivo de estabelecer medidas de proteo para a conteno e disseminao do COVID-19 na liberao da retomada das atividades econ?micas no Estado de Gois - Brasil, estabelece protocolos para o retorno  operao de academias, quadras poliesportivas, treinamento esportivo profissional, instituies religiosas, shopping centers, shopping centers, restaurantes e similares, indstrias de abate e processamento de carnes, hotis e similares, transporte pblico local, intermunicipal e interestadual, servi?os de call center e call centers, sal?es de beleza e afins, para atividades esportivas quadras, piscinas e quadras em condomnios residenciais In order to establish protective measures for the containment and dissemination of COVID-19 in the liberation of the resumption of economic activities in the State of Gois - Brazil, it establishes protocols for returning to the operation of gyms, sports courts, professional sports training, religious institutions, shopping centers , Shopping centers, restaurants and the like, slaughtering and meat processing industries, hotels and the like, local, intercity and interstate public transportation, call center services and call centers, beauty salons and the like, for activities in sports courts, swimming pools and blocks in residential condominiums","output":"Protocolos para funcionamento de atividades econ?micas, religiosas e espa?os comuns de condomnios durante a pandemia de COVID19 em Gois"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January 2020, Santa Clara County, California, USA, began identifying laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease among residents.

To mitigate transmission, most states ordered shelter-in-place orders in March and reopening strategies varied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess COVID-19 cases and deaths after reopening compared with trends prior to reopening for two groups of states: (1) states with an evidence-based reopening strategy, defined as reopening indoor dining after implementing a statewide mask mandate, and (2) states reopening indoor dining rooms before implementing a statewide mask mandate. DESIGN: Interrupted time series quasi-experimental study design applied to publicly available secondary data. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty United States and the District of Columbia. INTERVENTIONS: Reopening indoor dining rooms before or after implementing a statewide mask mandate. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes included daily cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for each state. KEY RESULTS: On average, the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks (643.1 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 406.9, 879.2 and 62.9 cases; CI = 12.6, 113.1, respectively). Excess cases after 6 weeks could have been reduced by 90% from 576,371 to 63,062 and excess deaths reduced by 80% from 22,851 to 4858 had states implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. Over 50,000 excess deaths were prevented within 6 weeks in 13 states that implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. CONCLUSIONS: Additional mitigation measures such as mask use counteract the potential growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to reopening businesses. This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing, and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A panel including intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health-care environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidence-based consensus statement and expert panel report. RESULTS: Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health-care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended.

This review synthesizes recent research evaluating APRV mode and provides perspectives on the utility of this mode in children with ARDS. RECENT FINDINGS Two single-center clinical trials on APRV, one adult and one pediatric, have been published this year. These two trials have not only elicited editorials and letters that highlight some of their strengths and weaknesses but also rekindled debate on several aspects of APRV. Despite their contradicting results, both trials provide significant insights into APRV strategies that work and those that may not. This review places the newer evidence in the context of existing literature and provides a comprehensive analysis of APRV use in children. SUMMARY There have been significant recent advancements in our understanding of the clinical utility of APRV in children with ARDS. The recent trial highlights the urgent need to evolve a consensus on definition of APRV and identify strategies that work. Pending further research, clinicians should avoid the use of a zero-PLOW Personalized-APRV strategy as a primary ventilation modality in children with moderate-severe ARDS.","output":"Airway pressure release ventilation in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In December 2019 a new respiratory disease known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China. Three months later it was declared a pandemic by WHO. In the United States, the first case was identified on January 19, 2020, and in San Joaquin County, California on March 9, 2020. Since then the case count has surged to over 36,000 in San Joaquin county with more than 500 deaths and community transmission is believed to be widespread. Our aim was to study the patient's initial characteristics, presentation and outcomes at San Joaquin General Hospital providing care to underserved population. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of patients with SARS-COV-2 infection in 150-bed county hospital between March-October 2020. Confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 were defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay from a nasopharyngeal swab. Clinical Characteristics of SARS-COV-2 were obtained through review of Electronic Medical Records. Results: Data was obtained from 1168 positive cases with SARS-COV-2 infection. Average age was 42 years, 54% were male, by ethnicity majority were Hispanic (60%), Asians (9%), African American (9%), White (9%) and others (11%). Of the overall positive cases, 28% (n=323) were hospitalized and 9% (n=102) were admitted to ICU. On admission, the most common symptom was cough (57%), followed by fever (50%) and dyspnea (38%). Average of Comorbidities among hospitalized patients was 3, most common was Obesity (36%, n=419), followed by hypertension (24%, n=275), diabetes (20%, n=236) and cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension) (6%, n=72). Of the 323 hospitalizations, 31.5% patients were admitted to ICU for acute respiratory failure, and 21% patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Mean ICU length of stay was 9.3 days and mean duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 10.9 days. Overall mortality was 3% for all positive cases, 16% in hospitalized patients, 33% in ICU admits and was 49% in intubated patients. Conclusion: Major risk factors for SARS-COV-2 include male gender, Hispanic ethnicity, obesity and hypertension. Patients admitted to ICU, especially requiring invasive mechanical ventilation had the worse prognosis.","output":"Clinical characteristics of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in san joaquin valley: A single center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus 2019 (COVID -19) is a public health emergency and according to the recent statistic of World Health Organization (WHO), this novel virus has infected all continents During this outbreak, there is an urgent need for documentation of laboratory predictors to discriminate between mild and severe forms of this virus In this pandemic, prompt identification of clinical and laboratory prognostic factors of progression towards critical and lethal forms of this disease is mandatory During this new infection, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, sometimes neutrophilia, elevation of Ddimer, prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), and also increased level of fibrin degradation products (FDP) could occur Moreover, elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL6) are other laboratory features These parameters will enable risk stratification and favorable allocation of limited and technical resources particularly in under developed countries In this review article, alteration of hematologic laboratory findings has been discussed","output":"Hematologic Parameters of COVID - 19: A Review on Alteration of Hematologic Laboratory Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery and development of a new drug is a complex, time consuming and costly process that typically takes over 10 years and costs around 1 billion dollars from bench to market.

When COVID-19 arrived in Brazil, a crisis scenario that incorporated economic, social and political aspects became highly visible. This scenario fostered unemployment, poverty and hunger. Besides that, it exposed multiple vulnerabilities that were getting worse over the past few years prior to the pandemic. In this context, COVID-19 found in Brazil a fertile ground for its dissemination and community transmission. The impacts of the suspension of many commercial activities and other economic sectors due to the pandemic were quickly felt socially and economically in Brazil. Some of the actions carried out by the Brazilian government included the emergency aid payment and exemption from payment of energy bills for vulnerable individuals, release of funds for programmes for the direct purchase of food from family farmers, delivery of school food kits directly to students despite the closure of schools and publication of sanitary rules for the operation of restaurants. However, these actions are still insufficient, slow and not sufficiently coordinated to contain the progress of the food and nutritional insecurity crisis in Brazil.

Here, we design a flexible single-cell multimodal analysis framework, called CITEMO, to integrate the transcriptome and antibody-derived tags (ADT) data to capture cell heterogeneity from the multi omics perspective. CITEMO uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the transcriptome and ADT, respectively, and then employs PCA again to integrate these low-dimensional multimodal data for downstream analysis. To investigate the effectiveness of the CITEMO framework, we apply CITEMO to analyse the cell subtypes of Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (CBMC) samples. Results show that the CITEMO framework can comprehensively analyse single-cell multimodal samples and accurately identify cell subtypes. Besides, we find some specific immune cells that co-express multiple ADT markers. To better describe the co-expression phenomenon, we introduce the co-expression entropy to measure the heterogeneous distribution of the ADT combinations. To further validate the robustness of the CITEMO framework, we analyse Human Bone Marrow Cell (HBMC) samples and identify different states of the same cell type. CITEMO has an excellent performance in identifying cell subtypes and states for multimodal omics data.

High-risk patients (body mass index  45 kg/m2) underwent either 3 strategies of parietal closure (suture with or without permanent or absorbable mesh) during SPSG. The primary outcome was the occurrence of radiologically defined incisional hernia during the first postoperative year. Secondary outcomes included surgical site infection rates and postoperative pain. RESULTS Between November 2018 and November 2019, 255 patients were included (85 in each group). All patients reached one-year postoperative follow-up. Significantly more incisional hernias were observed in the no mesh group in comparison with permanent and absorbable mesh groups, respectively (20% vs. 7.1% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.005). No difference was observed in mesh groups. No difference was observed regarding other parietal complications. One patient in the absorbable mesh group presented a superficial surgical site infection and required surgical drainage without mesh removal and one patient in the permanent mesh group presented a parietal hematoma and required surgical drainage with mesh removal. Twenty-six (92.8%) asymptomatic patients presented incisional hernia discovered on the one-year CT-scan.

This could improve a design hypothesis through feedback analysis, data integration that can provide a basis for the introduction of end-to-end automation for compound discovery and optimization, and enable more intelligent searches of chemical space. Several state-of-the-art ML architectures are predominantly and independently used for predicting the properties of small molecules, their high throughput synthesis, and screening, iteratively identifying and optimizing lead therapeutic candidates. However, such deep learning and ML approaches also raise considerable conceptual, technical, scalability, and end-to-end error quantification challenges, as well as skepticism about the current AI hype to build automated tools.

PURPOSE: To examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV on HCWs and risk factors for infection, using rapid and living review methods. DATA SOURCES: Multiple electronic databases including the WHO Database of Publications on Coronavirus Disease and medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections. New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: 64 studies met inclusion criteria; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections (15 on SARS-CoV-2), and 34 studies addressed risk factors (3 on SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers accounted for a significant proportion of coronavirus infections and may experience particularly high infection incidence after unprotected exposures. Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a doseCresponse relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Infection control training was associated with decreased risk. LIMITATION: There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used. CONCLUSION: Health care workers experience significant burdens from coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

In the context of COVID-19 fomites can be an important vehicle of virus transmission and contribute to infection risk in public environments. The aim of the study was to analyze through surface sampling (sponge method) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in public and working environments, in order to evaluate the risk for virus transmission. Seventy-seven environmental samples were taken using sterile sponges in 17 animal farms, 4 public transport buses, 1 supermarket and 1 hotel receptive structure. Furthermore, 246 and 93 swab samples were taken in the farms from animals and from workers, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 detection was conducted by real-time RT-PCR and by digital droplet RT-PCR ( RT-PCR) using RdRp, gene E and gene N as targets. None of the human and animal swab samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while detection was achieved in 20 of the 77 sponge samples (26%) using  RT-PCR. Traces of the RdRp gene, gene E and gene N were found in 17/77 samples (22%, average concentration 31.2 g.c./cm(2), range 5.6 to 132 g.c./cm(2)), 8/77 samples (10%, average concentration 15.1 g.c./cm(2), range 6 to 36 g.c./cm(2)), and in 1/77 (1%, concentration 7.2 g.c./cm(2)). Higher detection rates were associated with sampling in animal farms and on public transport buses (32% and 30%) compared to the supermarket (21%) and the hotel (no detection). The result of the study suggests that the risk of contamination of surfaces with SARS-CoV-2 increases in environments in which sanitation strategies are not suitable and/or in highly frequented locations, such as public transportation. Considering the analytical methods, the  RT-PCR was the only approach achieving detection of SARS-CoV-2 traces in environmental samples.

These differences are commonly attributed to technical and methodological factors, including small sample sizes, differences in diagnostic practices, and population heterogeneity. We leveraged the Norwegian Prescription Database, a population-based registry of drug prescriptions dispensed from Norwegian pharmacies to assess the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of PD in Norway. The diagnosis of PD was defined based on the prescription of dopaminergic drugs for the indication of PD over a continuous time. During 2004C2017, 12,229 males and 9831 females met our definition for PD diagnosis. PD prevalence increased over the observation period, with larger changes observed in the older age groups. Incidence and prevalence of PD increased with age, peaking at 85 years. The male/female prevalence ratio was 1.5 across all ages, whereas the incidence ratio increased with age, from 1.4 in those 60 years, to 2.03 among those >90 years. While PD mortality was generally higher than that of the general population, mortality odds ratios decreased with age, approaching 1.0 among individuals >90 years old. When adjusted for the sex-specific mortality of the general population, the mortality among females with PD was equal to or higher than the mortality among males with PD. Our findings demonstrate that the epidemiological features of PD, including sex-differences, are age and time-period dependent and indicate that sex differences in PD mortality are unlikely to stem from disease-specific negative impact of survival in males.","output":"A nationwide study of the incidence, prevalence and mortality of Parkinsons disease in the Norwegian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening.

Recent studies have suggested that UTX mutations promote MDS and AML by blocking the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we performed an epigenetic drug library screening for small molecules able to release the differentiation block on HSPCs induced by UTX deficiency. We found that SP2509, a selective inhibitor of LSD1, specifically promoted the differentiation of Utx-null HSPCs while sparing wild-type HSPCs. Transcriptome profiling showed that Utx loss reduced the expression of differentiation-related and tumor suppressor genes, correlating with their potential roles in HSPC self-renewal and leukemogenesis. In contrast, SP2509 treatment reversed these changes in gene expression in Utx-null HSPCs. Accordingly, Utx loss decreased H3K4 methylation level probably through the COMPASS-like complex, while LSD1 inhibition by SP2509 partially reversed the reduction of H3K4 methylation in Utx-deficient HSPCs. Further, SP2509 promoted the differentiation of Utx-null AML cells in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, extended the survival of these leukemic mice. Thus, our study identified a novel strategy to specifically target both premalignant and malignant cells with Utx deficiency for differentiation therapy and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Utx in regulating HSPCs and related diseases.","output":"Epigenetic drug library screening identified an LSD1 inhibitor to target UTX-deficient cells for differentiation therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the S precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons, and more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2 and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH- and cathepsin-dependent in late endosomes where, like SARS-CoV-1 S, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we find that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs. IMPORTANCE The furin cleavage site in the S protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2, and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.","output":"The polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike modulates viral sensitivity to Type I IFN and IFITM2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study has the purpose of determining if pneumoperitoneum with CO2 develops bacterial translocation in normal rats and in rats submitted to induced colitis.

While the shortages are becoming acute due to supply chain disruptions, the demand for testing has increased both as a prerequisite to lifting restrictions and in preparation for the second wave. One of the potential solutions to this crisis is the development of 3D printed nasopharyngeal swabs that behave like traditional swabs. However, the opportunity to digitally conceive and fabricate swabs allows for design improvements that can potentially reduce patient pain and discomfort. The study reports the progress that has been made on the development of auxetic nasopharyngeal swabs that can shrink under axial resistance. This allows the swab to navigate through the nasal cavity with significantly less stress on the surrounding tissues. This is achieved through systematically conceived negative Poisson's ratio ([Formula: see text]) structures in a biocompatible material. Finite element (FE) and surrogate modelling techniques were employed to identify the most optimal swab shape that allows for the highest negative strain ([Formula: see text]) under safe stress ([Formula: see text]). The influence and interaction effects of the geometrical parameters on the swab's performance were also characterised.

Patients were divided into three groups depending on the presence and amount of atelectasis at the computed tomography: no atelectasis, small atelectasis (< 5% of the estimated lung volume) or large atelectasis (> 5% of the estimated lung volume). In all patients, clinical severity, oxygen-therapy need, Intensive Care Unit admission rate, the length of in-hospital stay and in-hospital mortality data were collected. RESULTS: Thirty patients (19%) showed small atelectasis while eight patients (5%) showed large atelectasis. One hundred and seventeen patients (76%) did not show atelectasis. Patients with large atelectasis compared to patients with small atelectasis had lower SatO(2)/FiO(2) (182 vs 411 respectively, p = 0.01), needed more days of oxygen therapy (20 vs 5 days respectively, p = 0,02), more frequently Intensive Care Unit admission (75% vs 7% respectively, p < 0.01) and a longer period of hospitalization (40 vs 14 days respectively p < 0.01).

Using an RNA-seq approach, we show that several members of the ERV9 lineage, particularly LTR12C elements, are activated upon HIV-1 infection of primary CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, HIV-1-induced ERVs harboring transcription start sites are primarily found in the vicinity of immunity genes. For example, HIV-1 infection activates LTR12C elements upstream of the interferon-inducible genes GBP2 and GBP5 that encode for broad-spectrum antiviral factors. Reporter assays demonstrated that these LTR12C elements drive gene expression in primary CD4(+) T cells. In line with this, HIV-1 infection triggered the expression of a unique GBP2 transcript variant by activating a cryptic transcription start site within LTR12C. Furthermore, stimulation with HIV-1-induced cytokines increased GBP2 and GBP5 expression in human cells, but not in macaque cells that naturally lack the GBP5 gene and the LTR12C element upstream of GBP2. Finally, our findings suggest that GBP2 and GBP5 have already been active against ancient viral pathogens as they suppress the maturation of the extinct retrovirus HERV-K (HML-2). In summary, our findings uncover how human cells can exploit remnants of once-infectious retroviruses to regulate antiviral gene expression.","output":"HIV-1 infection activates endogenous retroviral promoters regulating antiviral gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to develop and validate an emergency nursing-care patient satisfaction scale to measure patient satisfaction with emergency room (ER) nursing.

The study population included patients who visited five ERs in Japan (March to December 2021) (n = 135). The rating scales were provided to patients who visited the ER and gave consent, and the patients were asked to reply. In the process of validating the scale, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the construct and criterion validity were conducted. The confirmatory factor analysis results showed a factorial structure consisting of four factors. The domain and summary scores demonstrated good-to-excellent internal reliability (Cronbachs range = 0.81C0.89). This patient satisfaction scale was designed and validated from the perspective of the Japanese healthcare system and cultural backgrounds.

Owing to adverse social determinants of health, including pervasive HIV and sexual stigma, harassment, violence, barriers in access to health care, and existing health and mental health disparities, sexual and gender minorities in India and Thailand are at disproportionate risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. Despite global health disparities among LGBT+ populations, there is a lack of coordinated, community-engaged interventions to address the expected excess burden of COVID-19 and public healthCrecommended protective measures. OBJECTIVE: We will implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief, peer-delivered eHealth intervention to increase COVID-19 knowledge and public healthCrecommended protective behaviors, and reduce psychological distress among LGBT+ people residing in Bangkok, Thailand, and Mumbai, India. Subsequent to the RCT, we will conduct exit interviews with purposively sampled subgroups, including those with no intervention effect. METHODS: SafeHandsSafeHearts is a 2-site, parallel waitlist-controlled RCT to test the efficacy of a 3-session, peer counselorCdelivered eHealth intervention based on motivational interviewing and psychoeducation. The study methods, online infrastructure, and content were pilot-tested with LGBT+ individuals in Toronto, Canada, before adaptation and rollout in the other contexts. The primary outcomes are COVID-19 knowledge (index based on US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] items), protective behaviors (index based on World Health Organization and US CDC guidelines), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2). Secondary outcomes include loneliness, COVID-19 stress, and intended care-seeking. We will enroll 310 participants in each city aged 18 years and older. One-third of the participants will be cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men; one-third will be cisgender lesbian, bisexual, and other women who have sex with women; and one-third will be transfeminine, transmasculine, and gender nonbinary people. Participants will be equally stratified in the immediate intervention and waitlist control groups. Participants are mainly recruited from online social media accounts of community-based partner organizations. They can access the intervention on a computer, tablet, or mobile phone. SafeHandsSafeHearts involves 3 sessions delivered weekly over 3 successive weeks. Exit interviews will be conducted online with 3 subgroups (n=12 per group, n=36 in each city) of purposively selected participants to be informed by RCT outcomes and focal populations of concern. RESULTS: The RCT was funded in 2020. The trials started recruitment as of August 1, 2021, and all RCT data collection will likely be completed by January 31, 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The SafeHandsSafeHearts RCT will provide evidence about the effectiveness of a brief, peer-delivered eHealth intervention developed for LGBT+ populations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. If the intervention proves effective, it will provide a basis for future scale-up in India and Thailand, and other low- and middle-income countries.

A feasibility study is necessary regarding the practicality of the application of neoliberalist policies in Zimbabwes water sector. This is important because there has been a lack of water in urban and rural areas of Zimbabwe even before the COVID-19 era. Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the commercialisation of water in Zimbabwe. Setting: The formation of the state-owned Zimbabwe National Water Authority signified a move towards the solidification of the commercialisation of the water sector in Zimbabwe, based in part on neoliberal principles. Methods: This study is a conceptual study, involving the review of various sources of literature to identify trends in the commercialisation of Zimbabwes water sector. This study is descriptive in nature and involves the use of secondary data gathered from various publications. This study also makes use of a case study approach. Results: The findings of this study show that the commercialisation of the water sector in Zimbabwe is practical to a certain extent;however, it needs to be performed in a way that acknowledges existing strengths and weaknesses with continuous monitoring and evaluation taking place.

However, to date, no research has fully explored these behavioral risks or the consequences. Methods: Two thousand and ninety home-confined students from two Chinese high schools participated in an online-based questionnaire battery that assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related exposures, daytime sleepiness, problematic smartphone use, and PTSD. The subsequent data were subjected to mediation analysis, and structural equation models (SEM) were employed to explore the variable relationships. Results: The problematic smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and PTSD prevalence were respectively 16.4%, 20.2% and 6.9%. The number of COVID-19 related exposure was directly associated with problematic smartphone use and PTSD symptoms. Problematic smartphone use was found to be a mediator between COVID-19 related exposure and PTSD symptoms, and daytime sleepiness was found to partially mediate the associations between problematic smartphone use and PTSD. Conclusions: The more exposure associated with the pandemic, the more psychological and behavioral problems the adolescents had. The relatively high rate of problematic smartphone use in home isolated adolescents possibly increased the risk of daytime sleepiness and psychological problems. Therefore, targeted improvements are needed to reduce the risk of psychological problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents.","output":"The mediating role of daytime sleepiness between problematic smartphone use and post-traumatic symptoms in COVID-19 home-refined adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a novel corona virus that started as an outbreak in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 and later became a pandemic affecting every continent on the planet.

Renewed efforts to minimize oral polio vaccine acceptance erosion may be needed. This study examines the possible role of social norms in protecting against acceptance erosion and the role of vaccinators in promoting these social norms. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a poll conducted by local interview teams between February 23 and April 5, 2016, among 4,070 parents and other caregivers of children under age 5 living in areas at high-risk for polio transmission in Pakistan. The sample was drawn via a stratified multistage cluster design utilizing random route methods at the household level. We calculated the prevalence of subjective and descriptive social norms around vaccine acceptance; vaccine acceptance and commitment to vaccinate in future; and experiences and views of polio vaccinators across the population. We examined the relationship between these social norms and vaccination behaviors as well as the relationship between experiences with and views of vaccinators and social norms using uncontrolled comparisons (t-tests of proportion) and logistic repressions to control for demographics. RESULTS: Both descriptive and subjective positive social norms were associated with vaccine acceptance and future commitment. Positive experiences with and views of vaccinators (trust, perceived technical knowledge, compassion, and overall pleasantness of the interaction) were associated with both descriptive and subjective positive social norms. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the idea that positive social norms could be protective against erosion of oral polio vaccine acceptance and that positive experiences with, and views of, vaccinators could help promote these positive social norms.

There is an urgent need to develop programs to protect the well being and health of migrant peoples. Increased population movement is already evident throughout the Americas as exemplified by the rising number of migrant peoples that pass through the Darien neotropical moist broadleaf forest along the border region between Panama and Colombia. The transit of migrant peoples through this area has an increase in the last years. In 2021 an average of 9,400 people entered the region per month compared to 2,000-3,500 people monthly in 2019. Along this trail, there is no access to healthcare, food provision, potable water, or housing. To date, much of what is known about health needs and barriers to healthcare within this population is based on journalistic reports and anecdotes. There is a need for a comprehensive approach to assess the healthcare needs migrant peoples in transit.

However, the instruments to assess PCEs are scarce. Objective In this study, we assessed the validity and reliability of the Benevolent Childhood Experiences (BCEs) scale, a new instrument of PCEs, in a large sample of Chinese adults. Furthermore, we examined associations of PCEs with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, as well as, prosocial behaviours across different levels of trauma. Method Participants were 6929 adults (33% male; mean age 38.04 years, SD = 7.81, ranging from 18 to 81.) recruited from Jiangxi and Hunan provinces in China. Self-administrated questionnaires were used to measure PCEs, childhood trauma, lifetime trauma, PTSD, depression, and prosocial behaviours. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine the interdependent and interactive effects of PCEs, lifetime trauma, childhood trauma on symptoms of PTSD and depression and prosocial behaviours. Results In the current sample, the Cronbach's  of the BCEs scale was 0.70. PCEs were not related to lifetime trauma, while modestly associated with childhood trauma, demonstrating excellent discriminant validity. PCEs were negatively correlated with severity of PTSD and depression, while positively correlated with prosocial behaviours, indicating good predictive validity. PCEs, lifetime trauma and childhood trauma were independently associated with severity of PTSD and depression and prosocial behaviours. Moreover, the interaction of PCEs and lifetime trauma negatively predicted severity of PTSD and depression, while the interaction of PCEs and childhood trauma negatively predicted prosocial behaviours. PCEs had a protective effect on PTSD and depression in high level of lifetime trauma, and showed a reduced positive effect on prosocial behaviours in high level of childhood trauma.

Intracranial pressure is different from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In addition, intracranial pressure differs considerably according to the body position of the patient. Despite this, the current reference values do not distinguish between intracranial and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressures, and body position-dependent reference values do not exist. In this study, we aim to establish these reference values. METHOD A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Sciences. Methodological quality was assessed using an amended version of the Joanna Briggs Quality Appraisal Checklist. Intracranial pressure and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure were independently evaluated and subdivided into body positions. Quantitative data were presented with mean  SD, and 90% reference intervals. RESULTS Thirty-six studies were included. Nine studies reported values for intracranial pressure, while 27 reported values for the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Reference values for intracranial pressure were - 5.9 to 8.3 mmHg in the upright position and 0.9 to 16.3 mmHg in the supine position. Reference values for lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure were 7.2 to 16.8 mmHg and 5.7 to 15.5 mmHg in the lateral recumbent position and supine position, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first to provide position-dependent reference values for intracranial pressure and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

HCWs are exposed to a number of occupational hazards and physically demanding work tasks. Musculoskeletal disorders, stress, exhaustion, high sick leave rates and a high probability of being granted a disability pension are common challenges. This qualitative study explored the views of HCWs on how working conditions affect their safety, health, and wellbeing. METHODS: A descriptive and explorative design was utilised using semi-structured individual interviews with eight HCWs from three home care units in a middle-sized Norwegian city. Interviews were conducted in the Norwegian language, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The data was analysed by systematic text condensation. Key data quotes were translated into English by the authors. RESULTS: HCWs reported that meaningful work-related interactions and relationships contributed to their improved wellbeing. Challenging interactions, such as verbal violence by consumers, were deemed stressful. The unpredictable work conditions HCWs encounter in users homes contributed to their exposure to environmental hazards and unhealthy physical workloads. This was the case, although the employer promoted ergonomic work practices such as ergonomic body mechanics when mobilising and handling of clients, using safe patient handling equipment. HCWs perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company safety policies and practices, representing a health barrier for some. Organisational frameworks created unhealthy work conditions by shift work, time pressure and staffing challenges. Performing tasks in accordance with HCWs professional skills and identity was perceived as health-promoting. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unpredictable working conditions at users home can adversely affect the safety, health, and wellbeing of HCWs. The interaction between the unpredictable environment at users homes, HCWs perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company safety policies and practices, and staffing challenges due to sickness-related absences upon the workplace creates tense work conditions with a negative influence on HCWs health.","output":"Home care workers experiences of work conditions related to their occupational health: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The renewed interest in the concept of One Health has occurred as a result of the increased emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases over the past decade.

Immune serum from vaccinated subjects seems (largely) to retain titres of neutralizing antibodies, even against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 infection in three HCWs in a hospital setting; two of the HCWs were fully vaccinated (i.e. had received two doses). METHODS: Two physicians and one nurse working on the same shift on 20th February 2021 were involved in the outbreak. Real-time PCR, antigen tests, and serological tests for the IgG anti-spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were performed, along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all three HCWs; all presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19. The two physicians were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine, with the second dose administered 1 month before symptom onset. Both had high titres of IgG anti-spike antibodies at the time of diagnosis. WGS confirmed that all virus strains were VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7, suggesting a common source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the suspected source was a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who required endotracheal intubation due to severe COVID-19. All procedures were carried out using a full suite of personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSIONS: This mini-outbreak highlights some important issues about the efficacy of vaccines against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the high risk of exposure among HCWs, and the need for optimized implementation of PPE in hospitals. The wide circulation of VOC 202012/01 in Europe and Italy highlights the need to improve surveillance and genetic sequencing.","output":"Investigation of an outbreak of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01-lineage B.1.1.7 infection in healthcare workers, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impacts of COVID-19 are not evenly distributed in society. Understanding demographic and occupational differences in personal experiences and information seeking and how these shape perceptions of COVID-19 related risk may help to improve the effectiveness of public health strategies in the future. We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 496 participants during the first UK lockdown, in May 2020. We recorded data to assess peoples experiences of the pandemic, examining how they varied with demographic factors such as age, gender, occupational status, and key worker status. We also recorded data on COVID-19 related information seeking, and how experiences and information seeking behaviours were related to perceptions of COVID-19 related risk. We found that key workers reported greater exposure to COVID-19 and more extensive experience of the virus within their social circles. Those key workers who perceived their personal protective equipment to be more effective felt that the virus was less of a threat to their lives. Trust in COVID-19 information was highest in information from the UK Government and NHS, and lowest in information from social media. We also found that men reported lower levels of perceived threat to life from the virus than womenCa difference that mirrors the gender difference in occupational risk within our sample. Among those in employment, lower occupational class was also associated with higher levels of perceived risk of infection and perceived threat to life. Key workers who feel that they are insufficiently protected by their PPE experience increased levels of perceived threat, which may lead to negative health behaviours. This highlights the need for employers to ensure that key workers feel they are adequately protected from COVID-19. Our findings highlight some of the inequalities in the distribution of risk across society and discuss demographic differences in perceptions of risk. ? 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","output":"Information seeking, personal experiences, and their association with COVID-19 risk perceptions: demographic and occupational inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author discusses the significance of the patient-physician covenant despite the ethical challenges associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Topics explored include the obligation of physicians to provide adequate care to their patients, the need to ensure the safety of healthcare professionals while at work, and the importance of self-care particularly for nurses","output":"Protecting Our Covenant in Pandemic Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Games involving quantum strategies often yield higher payoff.

However, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces serum responses that cross-react with other coronaviruses remains poorly studied. Here, we define serum profiles in rhesus macaques after vaccination with DNA- or Ad26-based vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein followed by SARS-CoV-2 challenge, or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. Analysis of serum responses showed robust reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD), both included in the vaccine. However, serum cross-reactivity to the closely related sarbecovirus SARS-CoV-1 spike and RBD was reduced. Reactivity was also measured to the distantly related common cold alphacoronavirus (229E and NL63) and betacoronavirus (OC43 and HKU1) spike proteins. Using SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 lentivirus-based pseudoviruses, we show that neutralizing antibody responses were predominantly SARS-CoV-2 specific. These data define patterns of cross-reactive binding and neutralizing serum responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in rhesus macaques. Our observations have important implications for understanding polyclonal responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which will facilitate future CoV vaccine assessment and development. IMPORTANCE The rapid development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been unprecedented. In this study, we explore the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to other coronaviruses. By analyzing responses from nonhuman primates (NHPs) both before and after immunization with DNA or Ad26-vectored vaccines, we find patterns of cross-reactivity that mirror those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Up to 4% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit because they developed a critical illness (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Numerous patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who had been admitted to the intensive care unit required rescue therapy like prone positioning. OBJECTIVES To describe the respiratory management of and the extensive use of prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit hub in Lombardy, Italy. METHODS A total of 89 patients (67% male; median age, 59 years [range, 23-80 years]) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted between February 23 and March 31, 2020, were enrolled in this quality improvement project. RESULTS Endotracheal intubation was required in 86 patients (97%). Prone positioning was used as rescue therapy in 43 (48%) patients. Significantly more younger patients (age  59 years) were discharged alive (43 of 48 [90%]) than were older patients (age  60 years; 26 of 41 [63%]; P < .005). Among the 43 patients treated with prone ventilation, 15 (35% [95% CI, 21%-51%]) died in the intensive care unit, of which 10 (67%; P < .001) were older patients.

Telehealth can increase the diversity of people who take part in research. This matters because most autism spectrum disorder studies have included people who have resources, are White, and live in North America and Europe.

PURPOSE: To address gender inequality, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) created a steering committee that recommended the collection of baseline and ongoing metrics of pharmacy leadership. The purpose of this study was to quantify gender inequality in distributions of residency program director (RPD) and director of pharmacy (DOP) positions and to investigate gender distributions among recipients of ASHP professional leadership awards. METHODS: RPD and DOP information for postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) programs included in the online ASHP Residency directory were collected in December of 2020. Publicly available records were used to collect information on recipients of the Harvey A.K. Whitney Award and John W. Webb Award during the periods 1950-2020 and 1985-2020, respectively. Gender information for RPDs, DOPs, and award recipients was collected from listed pronouns available in public records. A  2 test was used for analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 1,176 PGY1 residency programs were included. Of the RPD positions assessed, 66% (n = 775) were filled by women pharmacists (P < 0.0001), while the percentage of DOP leadership positions held by women was 42% (n = 496) (P < 0.0001). Evaluation of data on recipients of the Harvey A.K. Whitney Award and John W. Webb Award revealed the occurrence of female recipients is 19.7% (n = 14) and 16.7% (n = 6), respectively (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: RPD positions have a higher prevalence of being filled by women. DOP positions remain male-dominated and revealed gender inequality among senior-level leadership roles.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals are in the forefront of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic facing an unprecedented global health crisis, which can have consequences on their psychosocial health. There is a need to identify risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes to inform the design of tailored psychological interventions. DESIGN: Cross\\\\sectional online study. METHODS: A total of 1071 healthcare professionals completed self\\\\report questionnaires. Measures included sociodemographic information, COVID\\\\19\\\\related characteristics, quality of life (Brief World Health Organization Quality of Life; WHOQOL\\\\Bref), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder\\\\7; GAD\\\\7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire\\\\8; PHQ\\\\8), occupational burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; CBI), and coping (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced; Brief COPE). This article follows the STROBE reporting guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and clinically significant depression was 27.6% and 26.8%, respectively. Significant risk factors for poor psychological outcomes included being female, being a nurse or doctor (vs non\\\\medical professional), working in frontline units (inpatient, intensive care), perceptions of inadequate workplace preparation to deal with the pandemic, and using avoidance coping.

This study aims to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased referral of young people with OCD in one area of London and determine if COVID-19 has been associated with change in symptom severity and treatment offered in recent years. Method A retrospective study was conducted using clinical service data investigating 58 young people (8C17 years) referred and assessed in CNWL NHS Foundation Trust CAMHS, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (months MarchCOctober 2018C2020). Changes in symptom severity were measured using the health of the nation outcome scale for children and adolescents (HoNOSCA). Total HoNOSCA and three HoNOSCA items were used;emotional symptoms, family relationships and school attendance. Patient clinical records were reviewed to assess if COVID-19 had exacerbated OCD symptoms. The type of treatment offered (cognitive behavioural therapy -CBT- only vs combined CBT and medication) was also compared. Analysis was carried out using Chi-square, KruskalCWallis and MannCWhitney U tests. Result 26 (5.62%) initial assessments to CAMHS were related to OCD in 2020, compared to 12 (1.30%) and 20 (2.27%) assessments pre-pandemic (2018 and 2019), showing a significant increase in the proportion of OCD cases (X2 (1, N = 58) = 20.3, p < .001). There was no significant difference in total HoNOSCA, emotional, family relationships, or school attendance scores on initial assessment. However, 69.2% of clinical records in 2020 showed symptom worsening over the COVID-period, compared to 30.8% of cases assessed pre-pandemic.There was a significant difference between the type of treatment offered before and during COVID-19 (X2 (2, N = 58) = 12.7, p = .002), with a higher proportion of patients who were referred to CAMHS for OCD but discharged without treatment before the pandemic (37.5% vs 0%). While CBT only remains the most frequent treatment offered, combined treatment was more frequent during the pandemic, although this difference was not significant. Conclusion The proportion of OCD-related initial assessments in CAMHS increased during the pandemic despite the overall number of referrals falling. Furthermore, fewer cases were discharged without treatment in CAMHS during this period. Given this, and that many were reported to have deteriorated during the pandemic, services will likely need to address the increased burden of more severe cases.

Increasing evidence is available about the involvement of PCSK9 in the pathogenesis of viral infections, mainly HCV, and the regulation of host response to bacterial infections, primarily sepsis and septic shock. Moreover, the action of PCSK9 has been investigated as a crucial step in the pathogenesis of malaria infection and disease severity. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to review the available published literature on the role of PCSK9 in a wide array of infectious diseases. CONCLUSION Besides the ongoing investigation on PCSK9 inhibition among HIV-infected patients to treat HIV- and ART-related hyperlipidemia, preclinical studies indicate how PCSK9 is involved in reducing the replication of HCV. Interestingly, high plasmatic PCSK9 levels have been described in patients with sepsis. Moreover, a protective role of PCSK9 inhibition has also been proposed against dengue and SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. Finally, a loss of function in the PCSK9-encoding gene has been reported to reduce malaria infection mortality.","output":"The role of PCSK9 in infectious diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing recovered COVID-19 patients with recurrent-positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results is challenging. We performed a population-based observational study to characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in recurrent-positive patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk. Of 479 recovered COVID-19 patients, 93 (19%) recurrent-positive patients were identified, characterized by younger age, with a median discharge-to-recurrent-positive length of 8 days. After readmission, recurrent-positive patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in recurrent-positive patients ranged from 1.8 to 5.7 log10 copies/mL (median: 3.2), which was significantly lower than the corresponding values at disease onset. There are generally no significant differences in antibody levels between recurrent-positive and non-recurrent-positive patients, or in recurrent-positive patients over time (before, during, or after recurrent-positive detection). Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. Whole genome sequencing of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. 96 close contacts and 1,200 candidate contacts of 23 recurrent-positive patients showed no clinical symptoms; their viral RNA (1,296/1,296) and antibody (20/20) tests were negative. After full recovery (no longer/never recurrent-positive), 60% (98/162) patients had neutralizing antibody titers of &#8805;1:32. Our findings suggested that an intermittent, non-stable excretion of low-level viral RNA may result in recurrent-positive occurrence, rather than re-infection. Recurrent-positive patients pose a low transmission risk, a relatively relaxed management of recovered COVID-19 patients is recommended.","output":"Viral RNA level, serum antibody responses, and transmission risk in recovered COVID-19 patients with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results: a population-based observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 78-year-old patient with acute respiratory distress was transferred to our hospital with ST segment elevation on electrocardiography.

To reduce virus spread and ensure continuity of cancer care, the use of telehealth was rapidly implemented. Currently, there is no mature data on patient's perception about the use of telemedicine during this period, so we sought to evaluate the opinion of patients with cancer who were attended telematically in Hospital Parc Taul. Methods: 646 patients were visited by an oncologist via phone call between Marc 13 and April 30 2020. A 12-question survey was conducted between February 4 and April 19 2021 during an in-person visit or by telephone. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. Results: 487 patients (75.4%) responded;57% by phone call. Median age was 68 years [27-90]. 65.7% of patients had a follow-up visit and 34.3% were receiving treatment. Most patients (>80%) were satisfied with the telephonic visit and believed that it was useful to solve their concerns. Around 60% said that they would agree to continue with some virtual visits following the COVID-19 pandemic. 62% of patients would agree to be informed telematically of radiological results while 82% would agree for analytical results. 52% would agree to be visited virutally if they were receiving an oral treatment whereas only 33.5% would agree if the treatment was endovenous. In general, younger patients (<50 years old) feel more comfortable with virtual visits than older ones (>70 y) (77.4% vs 62%, p=0.07). Only 20% of patients older than 50 believe that they can handle new technologies as opposed to 58.5% of younger ones (p=0.001). 60.4% of the younger patients would like to have different technological tools to contact their oncologist whereas most patients (47.6%) older than 70 prefer only phone calls (p=0.001). Regardless of the type of visit (treatment or follow-up) patients felt comfortable with virtual attendance (58.7% and 65.6% respectively, p=0.2). Conclusions: As a whole, patients surveyed believed that telehealth could have a role following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, telemedicine is not applicable in all cases. Visits to older patients, to inform about radiological results and to patients recieving treatment should be assessed case by case. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

A high disability and mortality level in tuberculous meningoencephalomyelitis is often caused by an untimely clinical diagnosis, which may be associated with an atypical clinical picture of the disease, as well as insufficient information content of the results of instrumental and immunological examination. The authors present a case of tuberculous meningoencephalomyelitis in a female patient without concomitant HIV infection, in the absence of manifestations of visceral, including pulmonary, tuberculosis throughout the disease. Despite the fact that the tuberculous nature of the nervous system lesion was suspected at the initial neurological examination stage, the diagnosis was complicated by the lack of laboratory confirmation by a positive PCR test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis during repeated cerebrospinal fluid studies. Nevertheless, due to the dramatic development of the situation (progressive deterioration of the patient's condition, confusion of consciousness deepening to the coma level) and the direct threat to the life of the patient, it was decided to prescribe anti-tuberculosis therapy ?ex juvantibus?, which led to a rapid neurological symptoms regression and, ultimately, almost complete neurological deficits recovery. The case is atypical because tuberculous damage to the nervous system (in the form of a positive PCR test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis) was confirmed only on the third day of anti-tuberculosis therapy, and microbiological confirmation of tuberculosis invasion was established only on the 12th day from the start of specific therapy (the 23rd day of illness).","output":"[A case of tuberculous meningoencephalomyelitis]./ Sluchai tuberkuleznogo meningoentsefalomielita"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thirty-four calf and five infant fecal specimens were tested for the neonatal calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) and for the reovirus-like infantile diarrhea agent; respectively.

METHODS: To analyze initial and long-term humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis population, we retrospectively evaluated findings from SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologic assays targeting the nucleocapsid antigen or spike antigen up to 6 months of follow-up in patients on hemodialysis in the Paris, France, region who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Our analysis included 83 patients (median age 65 years); 59 (71%) were male and 28 (34%) had presented with severe COVID-19. We observed positive initial SARS-CoV-2 IgG antinucleocapsid serology in 74 patients (89%) at a median of 67 days postdiagnosis. By multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status was the only factor significantly associated with lack of an IgG antinucleocapsid antibody response. Follow-up data were available at 6 months postdiagnosis for 60 of 74 patients (81%) with positive initial antinucleocapsid serology, and 15 (25%) of them had negative antinucleocapsid serology at month 6. In total, 14 of 15 sera were tested for antispike antibodies, 3 of 14 (21%) of which were also negative. Overall, 97% of antinucleocapsid-antibody-positive specimens were also antispike-antibody positive. Female sex, age >70 years, and nonsevere clinical presentation were independently associated with faster IgG antinucleocapsid titer decay in multivariable analysis. After adjustment for sex and age >70 years, nonsevere clinical presentation was the only factor associated with faster decay of IgG antispike antibodies.

Siglec-8 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically on 235 primary BC cases and was correlated with clinical and pathological parameters and outcome. Cell culture experiments were performed with various BC cell lines. Siglec-8 was expressed in 215 BC cases and expression was lowest in triple-negative BC. It correlated with estrogen receptor-status, grading and the prognostic factors galectin (Gal)-7 and tumor-associated mucin-1 (TA-MUC1). However, Gal-7 and TA-MUC1 were only prognosticators for clinical outcome in the cohort expressing high (Immunoreactivity score IRS > 3) Siglec-8 levels but not in the low-expressing cohort. Siglec-8 knockdown led to a significantly reduced Gal-7 expression in MCF7 cells. All BC cell lines expressed low Siglec-8-levels, that could be elevated in MCF7 by Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-stimulation. This study demonstrates that Siglec-8 is expressed in BC cells and correlates with known clinical and prognostic parameters.

However, these social contacts can also facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases through a population. Animals engaging in social interactions therefore face a trade-off between the potential informational benefits and the risk of acquiring disease. Theoretical models have suggested that modular social networks, associated with the formation of groups or sub-groups, can slow spread of infection by trapping it within particular groups. However, these social structures will not necessarily impact the spread of information in the same way if its transmission follows a complex contagion, e.g. through individuals disproportionally copying the majority (conformist learning). Here we use simulation models to demonstrate that modular networks can promote the spread of information relative to the spread of infection, but only when the network is fragmented and group sizes are small. We show that the difference in transmission between information and disease is maximised for more well-connected social networks when the likelihood of transmission is intermediate. Our results have important implications for understanding the selective pressures operating on the social structure of animal societies, revealing that highly fragmented networks such as those formed in fissionCfusion social groups and multilevel societies can be effective in modulating the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.

Remarkably, this virus, known as Mimivirus, has a genome that encodes for nearly 1000 proteins, some of which are involved in the biosynthesis of unusual sugars. Indeed, the virus is coated by a layer of glycosylated fibers that contain d-glucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-rhamnose, and 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. Here we describe a combined structural and enzymological investigation of the protein encoded by the open-reading frame L780, which corresponds to an l-rhamnose synthase. The structure of the L780/NADP+ /UDP-l-rhamnose ternary complex was determined to 1.45 ? resolution and refined to an overall R-factor of 19.9 %. Each subunit of the dimeric protein adopts a bilobal-shaped appearance with the N-terminal domain harboring the dinucleotide binding site and the C-terminal domain positioning the UDP-sugar into the active site. The overall molecular architecture of L780 places it into the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Kinetic analyses indicate that the enzyme can function on either UDP- and dTDP-sugars but displays a higher catalytic efficiency with the UDP-linked substrate.

To probe the origin and transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences of viruses available in the GISAID platform as of March 05, 2020. A substantial number of earliest sequences reported in Wuhan in December 2019, including those of viruses recovered from the Huanan Seafood Market (HNSM), the site of the initial outbreak, were genetically diverse, suggesting that viruses of multiple sources were involved in the original outbreak. The viruses were subsequently disseminated to different parts of China and other countries, with diverse mutational profiles being recorded in strains recovered subsequently. Interestingly, four genetic clusters defined as Super-transmitters (STs) were found to become dominant and were responsible for the major outbreaks in various countries. Among the four clusters, ST1 is widely disseminated in Asia and the US and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California in the US as well as those in South Korea at the end of February and early March, whereas ST4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Each ST cluster carried a signature mutation profile which allowed us to trace the origin and transmission patterns of specific viruses in different parts of the world. Using the signature mutations as markers of STs, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after February 29, 2020. We found that around 90% of these genomes belonged to STs with ST4 being the dominant one and their contribution to pandemic in different continents were also depicted. The identification of these super-transmitters provides insight into the control of further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Identification of super-transmitters of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Written in weekly instalments, Michelle Munyikwa's Covid-19 diary reflects upon the experience of an unfolding pandemic from her dual role as a medical trainee and anthropologist living in the United States.

This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient transmission among health professionals in maternity units. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK, and to determine associations between healthcare workers' characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. Five out of 40 (12.5%; 95%CI 4.2-26.8%) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95%CI 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95%CI 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95%CI 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (21%) and 10/29 (35%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (52%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95%CI 6-55). Of those who were seropositive, 59% had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This is the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that one out of six were seropositive, of whom one out of three were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity units.

It often involves multiple tensor-compatible datasets with non-linear multi-way relationships, spatiotemporal structures, and different levels of sparsity. Current non-linear tensor completion algorithms tend to learn noisy embedding and incur overfitting. This paper focuses on the embedding learning aspect of the tensor completion problem and proposes a new multi-layer neural network architecture for tensor factorization and completion (MLCTR). The network architecture entails multiple advantages: a series of low-rank matrix factorizations (MF) building blocks to minimize overfitting, interleaved transfer functions in each layer for non-linearity, and by-pass connections to reduce the gradient diminishing problem and increase the depths of neural networks. Furthermore, the model employs Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based optimization for fast convergence in training. Our algorithm is highly efficient for imputing missing values in the EPS data. Experiments confirm that our strategy of incorporating non-linearity in factor matrices demonstrates impressive performance in embedding learning and end-to-end tensor models, and outperforms approaches with non-linearity in the phase of reconstructing tensors from factor matrices.","output":"MLCTR: A Fast Scalable Coupled Tensor Completion Based on Multi-Layer Non-Linear Matrix Factorization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is an unusual, but potentially harmful, manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis (SA), a chronic disease characterized by organ involvement from noncaseating and nonnecrotizing granulomas.

Due to the potential of hydrogen combustion in gas turbines to reduce the overall CO2 emissions and the dependency on natural gas, further research is needed to understand the impact on the overall thermodynamic cycle. For that purpose, a qualitative thermodynamic analysis was carried out to assess the exergetic and energetic efficiencies of the cycle as well as the irreversibilities associated to a subsystem. A single step reaction was considered in the hypothesis of complete combustion of a generic H2/CH4 mixture, where the volumetric H2 percentage was represented by fH2, which was varied from 0 to 1, defining the amount of hydrogen in the fuel mixture. Energy and entropy balances were solved through the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) code. Results showed that global exergetic and energetic efficiencies increased by 5% and 2%, respectively, varying fH2 from 0 to 1. Higher hydrogen percentages resulted in lower exergy destruction in the chamber despite the higher air-excess levels. It was also observed that higher values of fH2 led to lower fuel mass flow rates in the chamber, showing that hydrogen can still be competitive even though its cost per unit mass is twice that of natural gas.","output":"Thermodynamic Analysis of a Regenerative Brayton Cycle Using H2, CH4 and H2/CH4 Blends as Fuel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This special issue contains 7 articles that discuss the exhaustive and illustrative different approaches and highlight different contexts for problematizing human rights in health care during COVID-19.

The rapid increase in chilblain/pernio-like cases during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely SARS-CoV-2-associated. The relationship between skin symptom onset and COVID-19 PCR/antibody test timing, however, remains uncharacterized. We established an international registry for cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.2, 3 Providers reported time between dermatologic symptom onset and positive/negative COVID-19 laboratory results, when available. From 8 April-30 June, 2020, 906 laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with dermatologic manifestations were reported, 534 of which were chilblains/pernio.3 Among PCR-tested patients, 57%(n=208) overall and 15%(n=23) of chilblains/pernio cases were PCR-positive. Antibody positivity was 37%(n=39) overall and 19%(n=15) for chilblains/pernio. We evaluated 163 patients with timing information on PCR and/or antibody testing (Table 1). For patients with suspected COVID-19 and any cutaneous manifestation, PCR-positive testing occurred median 6 (IQR 1-14) days after dermatologic symptoms started while PCR-negative testing occurred median 14 (IQR 7-24) days later. For patients with pernio/chilblains, PCR-positivity was noted 8 (IQR 5-14) days after symptoms and negativity median 14 (IQR 7-28) days later. Antibody testing (IgM or IgG) was positive median 30 (IQR 19-39) days after symptom onset for all dermatologic manifestations and 27 (IQR 24-33) days after chilblains/pernio onset. Like Hubiche et al, our data highlight the low frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ testing in COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations. Positive predictive values for COVID-19 PCR are influenced by viral shedding kinetics, which are difficult to assess in non-respiratory presentations.4 Our data reveal that early PCR testing is more likely to be positive than later testing, even when date-of-onset is defined by cutaneous manifestations rather than systemic symptoms. Most COVID-19 antibody data are from systemically-ill patients; the kinetics of antibody production in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections remain unclear.5 Here, positive antibodies resulted median 30 days from disease onset, beyond the frequently used 14-21 day testing window. In outpatients with true infection, many factors influence the likelihood of a positive antibody result: antibody production, test availability, assay sensitivity, and timing of care-seeking in relation to symptom-onset. These variables influence our interpretation of individual test results and our understanding of the association between pernio and COVID-19. More population-level testing data is necessary to optimize diagnostic test timing. Positive identification of COVID-19 in minimally-symptomatic patients, including patients with skin findings, is critical to the public health effort.","output":"Timing of PCR and Antibody Testing in Patients with COVID-19 associated dermatologic manifestations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an endangered species.

The control group was given routine nursing intervention, based on which, the observation group was supplemented with precise positioning for sputum expectoration. The 24-hour sputum volume, respiratory rate (RR), blood gas analysis indexes, inflammatory indicators, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale score, and quality of life (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36) were observed in both arms before and after intervention. The incidence of adverse reactions was counted. RESULTS: The observation group showed better mMRC scores than the control group (P < 0.05).

THE CASE: In our COVID-19 ICU a 49-year-old male patient was admitted, with past medical history of obesity, smoking and diabetes, but no reported atherosclerotic complications. The patient had been admitted with severe hypoxemia and multiple pulmonary emboli were CT-confirmed. ICU-treatment included mechanical ventilation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Preparing the insertion of a new radial artery catheter for invasive blood pressure measurement and blood sampling, we detected that both radial arteries were non-pulsating and occluded: (a) Sonography showed the typical anatomical localization of both radial and ulnar arteries. However, Doppler-derived flow-signals could only be obtained from the ulnar arteries. (b) To test collateral arterial supply of the hand, a pulse-oximeter was placed on the index finger. Thereafter, the ulnar artery at the wrist was compressed. This compression caused an immediate loss of the fingers pulse-oximetry perfusion signal. The effect was reversible upon release of the ulnar artery. (c) To test for collateral perfusion undetectable by pulse-oximetry, we measured regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) of the thenar muscle by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Confirming our findings above, ulnar arterial compression demonstrated that thenar rSO(2) was dependent on ulnar artery flow. The described development of bilateral radial artery occlusion in a relatively young and therapeutically anticoagulated patient with no history of atherosclerosis was unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: Since COVID-19 patients are at increased risk for arterial occlusion, it appears advisable to meticulously check for adequacy of collateral (hand-) perfusion, avoiding the harm of hand ischemia if interventions (e.g., catheterizations) at the radial or ulnar artery are intended.","output":"First, do no harm: bilateral radial artery occlusion in a COVID-19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo: Pouco se sabe sobre o enfrentamento e mitigao  COVID-19 em servi?os de longa permanncia para idosos (ILPIs) na Amrica Latina (AL).

METHODS: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers.

Therefore, we aimed to develop, implement, and assess the feasibility of an intervention using SMS to primary care patients taking warfarin in a medium-sized Brazilian city. METHODS: A bank of 79 SMS was drafted and validated by an expert panel. During 6 months, three times a week, patients received messages about anticoagulation with warfarin. At baseline and after 3 months, we assessed their knowledge and adherence with validated instruments. At the end of the follow-up, participants answered a satisfaction questionnaire. Subsequently, a scale-up phase was conducted, with another round of the intervention including 82 participants (29 from the first phase and 53 newly recruited). Seven months after the end of the scale-up, we asked the patients for their insights about the long-term effects of this program. All patients signed informed consent. The study was approved by the Research and Ethics committee of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. RESULTS: In the pilot, 33 (89.2%) patients completed the follow-up. Among the participants who answered the satisfaction questionnaire (n = 29), 86.2% considered that the intervention motivated a healthy lifestyle and improved their understanding of warfarin therapy. All patients were willing to continue receiving the messages. Adherence measured by the Measure of Adherence to Treatment (MAT) test was high in the pre-intervention assessment and remained high (96.7% vs. 93.3%; p = 1.0000). The proportion of patients who achieved > 75% correct answers on the Oral Anticoagulation Knowledge (OAK) test increased from 6.5% to 25.6, p = 0.0703. In the scale-up, 23 patients answered the long-term assessment questionnaire. The main long-term knowledge reported was dietary information. Nine patients received the messages but did not remember their content. CONCLUSION: The intervention was well-accepted and had a positive impact on patients knowledge about oral anticoagulation therapy. The scale-up assessment reinforced the need to constantly monitor digital interventions.

While teaching and learning shifted online, assessment posed a roadblock. A pilot study was performed to check the feasibility and acceptability of online open-book examination. METHODS: A pilot study was carried out on sixth semester (fourth year) students. An online open-book examination was conducted on an ENT topic, and feedback was obtained using a pre-validated questionnaire. Two teachers scored and collated the answers, and the marks were averaged for each candidate. RESULTS: Ninety-eight students appeared for the examination: 21.4 per cent failed and 78.6 per cent passed. Eight students scored above 75 per cent correct. Only 55 students volunteered to give feedback; most agreed that the best advantage of this assessment was that it was stress-free. The disadvantage most complained of was network connectivity issues.

Objectives: To evaluate the appropriate timing of systemic dexamethasone initiation in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: : A multicenter, non-interventional cohort study including adults with COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) received systemic dexamethasone between March 2020 and January 2021. Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing for dexamethasone use (early vs. late). Early use is defined as the new initiation of dexamethasone within 24 hours of ICU admission. Propensity score matching was used based on the patients SOFA score, MV within 24 hours of ICU admission, proning status, and tocilizumab use during ICU stay. Results: : A total of 480 patients were included in the study;dexamethasone was initiated early within 24 hours of ICU admission in 367 patients. Among 202 patients matched using propensity score, 101 had received dexamethasone after 24 hours of ICU admission (1:1 ratio). The 30-day mortality (OR [95%CI]: 1.82[1.04, 3.19], P =0.04) and in-hospital mortality (OR [95%CI]: 1.80[1.03, 3.15], P =0.04) were higher in the late group. Among the non-mechanically ventilated patients, late use of dexamethasone was associated with higher odds of developing respiratory failure that required MV (OR [95%CI]: 3.8 [1.41, 10.3], P =0.008). Conclusion: Early use of dexamethasone within 24 hours of ICU admission in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was associated with mortality benefits. Moreover, dexamethasone's early use might be considered a proactive measure in non-mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with COVID-19, to prevent further complications.","output":"Early Versus Late Use of Dexamethasone in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Multicenter, Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis patients and kidney-transplant patients are at high risk of developing severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Data regarding the immunogenicity of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccines in dialysis patients were published recently. We assessed the immunogenicity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in dialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred-nine patients on hemodialysis (n = 85) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 24) have received two injections of 30-g doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), that were administered intramuscularly 28 days apart. Those who were still seronegative after the second dose were given a third dose one month later. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested before and after vaccination. RESULTS: Ninety-one out of the 102 patients who had at least a one-month follow-up after the second (n = 97) or the third (n = 5) vaccine doses had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was 88.7% (86 out of 97 patients) among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients at the initiation of vaccination. Receiving immunosuppressive therapy was an independent predictive factor for non-response to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-doses vaccination of dialysis patients. A third dose can be required in non-responders to two doses. When possible, patients waiting for a kidney transplantation, should be offered the vaccine before transplantation.","output":"High immunogenicity of a messenger RNA based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in chronic dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the infective agent causing COVID-19, is having a global impact both in terms of human disease as well as socially and economically.

Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships.

Nineteen of 29 reptiles had tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with flagellates, and this lesion was considered contributory to death in 15 cases, although concurrent diseases were frequent. Infection was invasive into the renal interstitium in three reptiles due to tubular rupture and in one chameleon also spread to adjacent tissues, coelomic cavity, and blood vessels due to renal rupture. Cytologic or ultrastructural evaluation of trophozoites in two cases was consistent with diplomonad flagellates. Renal disease was often complicated with soft-tissue mineralization and/or gout. Gastrointestinal and cloacal infection with flagellates and inflammation were frequent in reptiles in which the digestive tract was available for histopathologic examination, and this supports the possibility of infections ascending the urinary tract from the cloaca.

Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13 to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with presymptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates as symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection subpopulations have reproductive numbers lower than three. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using a nationally representative online panel to measure where food-insecure individuals acquired food, food acquisition barriers and mobility to food sources, which were evaluated across urbanicity levels using chi-squared tests and 95 % CI. SETTING: USA. PARTICIPANTS: 2011 adults (18 years or older). RESULTS: Food insecurity impacted 623 % of adults in urban areas, 405 % in rural areas and 367 % in suburban areas (P < 0001). Food acquisition barriers that were significantly more prevalent among food-insecure adults in urban areas were a change in employment status (342 %; 95 % CI 272 %, 411 %; P < 00001) and limited availability of food in retailers (388 %; 95 % CI 317 %, 459 %; P < 0001). In rural areas, food-insecure adults primarily acquired food for the household from supercentres (615 %; 95 % CI 504 %, 725 %; P < 005), while locally sourced foods were less common among food-insecure adults in rural areas (69 %; 95 % CI 001 %, 130 %) compared to urban areas (198 %; 95 % CI 143 %, 254 %; P < 001). Transportation as a barrier did not vary significantly by urbanicity, but food-insecure adults across urbanicity levels reported utilising a range of transportation modes to acquire food.

On the surface, RNC may appear to be a case of the usual NP comparative construction in that two NPs are involved. But, unlike typical NP comparatives, the element bearing the marker of the standard of comparison in RNC does not directly participate in the comparison, i.e., there is a mismatch between the standard and pivot. I argue this is due to the fact that the standard is reduced to leave only the pivot on the surface, hence the name reduced NP comparatives. I also argue that one of the factors that determines the availability of RNC is the notion of comparability, which is based on whether or not the compared elements can be associated with the same scale, where the scale is part of the semantics of the gradable predicate (Cf. Kennedy 2009). The interesting twist is that RNC is possible only if the relevant elements are not comparable with each other, i.e., they should denote different types of objects that cannot be associated with the same scale.

Data collection in each phase was performed through holding group discussions with the main users, nominal group techniques, interviews, and questioners. The dashboard prototype for the data display was designed using the Power BI Desktop software. Subsequently, users' comments were obtained using the focus group method and included in the dashboard. RESULTS: In total, 25 indicators related to input, process, and output areas were identified based on the findings of the first stage. Moreover, eight items were introduced by participants as dashboard requirements. The dashboard was developed based on users' feedback and suggestions, such as the use of colors, reception of periodic and specific reports based on key performance indicators, and rearrangement of the components visible on the page. The result of the user satisfaction survey indicated their satisfaction with the developed dashboard. CONCLUSION: The selection of proper criteria for the implementation of an effective dashboard is critical for the health care organization since they are designed with a high-tech and content-based environment.

The peoples response to preventive measures initiated by the Government to control COVID-19 is the focus of the study. Aim: To assess the knowledge for prevention and adoption of safety measures against COVID-19 by the tribal masses. Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional study, covering 300 selected tribal families, was conducted in a tribal belt during the period September 2020 to December 2020. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic profile, knowledge aspects and adoption pattern regarding preventive measures of COVID-19. The head of the family or in his/her absence any available adult family member has been the respondent to provide the required information. Based on maximum score of 15 for correct knowledge, the families were categorised as poor (5), average (6 to 10) and good (11 to 15). With a maximum score of 24 for correct adoption, the categorisation was made as poor (8), average (9 to 16) and good (17 to 24). The association of socio-demographic factors with knowledge and practice level was tested through chi-square test and correlation coefficient between knowledge and adoption scores. Results: Among the 300 families studied, the nuclear type tribal families dominated in the study area 204 (68%) and the average age of respondents was 61 years. The mean knowledge score was 7.6 (50.67%) and adoption score was 11.22 (46.75%). The percentage shares of respondents in poor, average and good categories were 31.33%, 35.33% and 33.33% for knowledge and 32.66%, 34.66% and 32.66%, respectively for adoption scores. The education level, income of the family and access to media sources were found to have significant association between knowledge and adoption scores. Conclusion: The highest education level of family members, family income and access to media sources were significantly associated with knowledge as well as practice. The positive correlation between knowledge and adoption scores indicated that the adoption level can be improved by enhancing knowledge to the socially backwards tribal communities. Socially visible practices like mask wearing were well adopted by tribals whereas the adoption level of invisible components like immunity building was relatively low.","output":"Adoption of safety measures against COVID-19 by tribal families in Southern Rajasthan- A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies report a strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related stressors on the mental wellbeing of general population. In this paper, we investigated whether COVID-19 related concerns and social adversity affected schizotypal traits, anxiety and depression using structural equational modelling. In mediation analyses, we furthermore explored whether these associations were mediated by healthy (sleep and physical exercise) or unhealthy behaviours (drug and alcohol consumption, excessive media use). We assessed schizotypy, depression and anxiety as well as, healthy and unhealthy behaviours and a wide range of sociodemographic scores using online surveys from residents of Germany and the United Kingdom over one year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four independent samples were collected (April/ May 2020: N=781, September/ October 2020: N=498, January/ February 2021: N=544, May 2021: N= 486). The results revealed that COVID-19 related life concerns were significantly associated with schizotypy in the autumn 2020 and spring 2021 surveys, and with anxiety and depressive symptoms in all surveys; and social adversity significantly affected the expression of schizotypal traits in all but the spring 2020 survey, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in all samples. Importantly, we found that excessive media consumption (>4h per day) fully mediated the relationship of COVID-19 related life concerns and schizotypal traits in the winter 2021 survey. Furthermore, several of the surveys showed that excessive media consumption was associated with increased depressive and anxiety- related symptoms in people burdened by COVID-19 related life. The ongoing uncertainties of the pandemic and the restrictions on social life have a strong impact on mental well-being and especially the expression of schizotypal traits. The negative impact is further boosted by excessive media consumption, which is especially critical for people with high schizotypal traits.","output":"The relationship of COVID-19 related stress and media consumption with schizotypy, depression and anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case series is presented of five overweight or obese patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Miami, Florida, United States.

Accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) have been named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these epidemics. Multi-model ensembles make accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza, but current operational ensemble forecasts are static: they require an abundance of past ILI data and assign fixed weights to component models at the beginning of a season, but do not update weights as new data on component model performance is collected. We propose an adaptive ensemble that (i) does not initially need data to combine forecasts and (ii) finds optimal weights which are updated week-by-week throughout the influenza season. We take a regularized likelihood approach and investigate this regularizer's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance. After finding an optimal regularization value, we compare our adaptive ensemble to an equal-weighted and static ensemble. Applied to forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level, our adaptive model outperforms an equal-weighted ensemble and has similar performance to the static ensemble using only a fraction of the data available to the static ensemble.

SETTING: Private practice. DESIGN: Open-label, multicenter, prospective study. METHODS: Seventy-five patients (75 eyes) who presented for cataract surgery evaluation with signs of dry eye disease were prescribed topical cyclosporine 0.09% for 28 days BID. Corneal curvature measurements, slit lamp exam, and Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire were evaluated at the initial and follow-up visits. Cataract surgery occurred 1 to 3 weeks after the second biometry visit. Refraction and corrected distance visual acuity measurements were performed 1-month post-surgery. The primary outcome was the difference in absolute prediction error of 1-month spherical equivalent refractive outcome before and after cyclosporine treatment. Secondary outcomes included the effect of topical cyclosporine 0.09% on ocular surface irregularity. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients completed the study. The absolute prediction error of 1-month spherical equivalent refractive outcome was 0.39  0.30 D vs 0.33  0.25 D (P < 0.03) before and after treatment, respectively. The proportion of eyes that achieved the target refraction was greater based on measurements after topical cyclosporine 0.09% than would have occurred using pre-treatment measurements.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been more than 100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than 2.4 million deaths. It is extremely important the early detection of the disease, and the use of medical imaging such as chest X-ray (CXR) and chest Computed Tomography (CCT) have proved to be an excellent solution. However, this process requires clinicians to do it within a manual and time-consuming task, which is not ideal when trying to speed up the diagnosis. In this work, we propose an ensemble classifier based on probabilistic Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to identify pneumonia patterns while providing information about the reliability of the classification. Specifically, each CCT scan is divided into cubic patches and features contained in each one of them are extracted by applying kernel PCA. The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location. Decisions of each individual patch are then combined into a global one according to the reliability of each individual classification: the lower the uncertainty, the higher the contribution. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario, yielding an accuracy of 97.86%. The large performance obtained and the simplicity of the system (use of deep learning in CCT images would result in a huge computational cost) evidence the applicability of our proposal in a real-world environment.","output":"Probabilistic combination of eigenlungs-based classifiers for COVID-19 diagnosis in chest CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To present the response of the Israel National Transplantation Center (NTC) to the evolving challenge of COVID-19, the impact on deceased organ donation and living organ kidney donation during 2020, and resultant policy and ethical implications. METHODS: Data collected included (i) for deceased donors, the total number of potential organ donors, if hospitalized in ICU or general ward, cause of death, number of family authorizations and refusals, number of actual donors, number of organs transplanted/donor and total number of transplants performed; (ii) for living-kidney-donors (related or altruistic), the number of procedures performed; and (iii) the number of patients registered on the national organ waiting-list. RESULTS: Following the first case (February 2020), deceased organ donation continued uninterrupted. The total number of potential donors was similar to 2019 (181 vs. 189). However, the number of families approached for donation decreased significantly (P = 0.02). This may be attributed to COVID-19-imposed limitations including fewer brain death determinations due to limited possibilities for face-to-face donor coordinator-donor family interactions providing emotional support and visual explanations of the medical situation. Fewer donors were admitted to ICU (P = 0.1) and the number of organs retrieved/donor decreased (3.8/donor to 3.4/donor). The overall result was a decrease of 24.2% in the number of transplant procedures (306 vs. 232). Living kidney donation, initially halted, resumed in May and the total number of procedures increased compared to 2019 due to a significant increase in altruistic donations (P < 0.0001), while the number of related-living donations decreased. CONCLUSION: This study of organ donation during a crisis has informed the introduction of policy changes in the NTC including the necessity to mobilize rapidly a war room, the use of innovative virtual tools for contact-less communication, and the importance of cooperation with hospital authorities in allocating scarce health-care resources. Finally, the pandemic highlighted and intensified ethical considerations, such as under what circumstances living kidney donation be continued in the face of uncertainty, and what information to provide to altruistic donors regarding a prospective recipient, in particular whether all options for related living donation have been exhausted.

Exposures COVID-19 vaccination (1 Ad26.COV2.S dose or 2 mRNA doses) 14 or more days prior. Main Outcomes and Measures Association between symptomatic infection and prior vaccination measured using the odds ratio (OR) from spline-based multivariable logistic regression. Results The analysis included 390 762 test-positive cases (21.5%) and 1 423 621 test-negative controls (78.5%) (59.9% were 20-44 years old; 9.9% were 12-19 years old; 58.9% were female; 71.8% were White). Among adults 20 years and older, the BNT162b2 mean OR for days 14 to 60 after a second dose (initial OR) was lower during the pre-Delta period (0.10 [95% CI, 0.09-0.11]) than during the Delta period (0.16 [95% CI, 0.16-0.17]) and increased with time since vaccination (per-month change in OR, pre-Delta: 0.04 [95% CI, 0.02-0.05]; Delta: 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.03]). The initial mRNA-1273 OR was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.04-0.05) during the pre-Delta period, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.10-0.11) during the Delta period, and increased with time (per-month change in OR, pre-Delta: 0.02 [95% CI, 0.005-0.03]; Delta: 0.03 [95% CI, 0.03-0.04]). The Ad26.COV2.S initial OR was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.37-0.47) during the pre-Delta period and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58-0.65) during the Delta period and did not significantly increase with time since vaccination. Among adolescents, the BNT162b2 initial OR during the Delta period was 0.06 (95% CI, 0.05-0.06) among 12- to 15-year-olds, increasing by 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03) per month, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.09-0.11) among 16- to 19-year-olds, increasing by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.06) per month. Conclusions and Relevance Among adults, the OR for the association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination (as an estimate of vaccine effectiveness) was higher during Delta variant predominance, suggesting lower protection. For mRNA vaccination, the steady increase in OR by month since vaccination was consistent with attenuation of estimated effectiveness over time; attenuation related to time was greater than that related to variant.","output":"Association of COVID-19 Vaccination With Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Time Since Vaccination and Delta Variant Predominance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since late December 2019, the city of Wuhan in China has reported a novel pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has now spread domestically and internationally.

From these surveys, we found that 72.2% of residents used the teaching sheets on their inpatient oncology rotation and that the teaching sheets led to an increase in the number of formal oncology teaching sessions (mean 3.4  2.1 post-implementation vs 2.6  2.0 pre-implementation, p = 0.008), the breadth of oncology topics taught (% reporting  5 topics; 26.1% vs 16.3%, p = 0.035), the proportion of residents reporting improvement in overall oncology knowledge (80.2% vs 62.4%, p = 0.012), and the proportion of residents reporting improvement in their ability to care for patients (70.8% vs 48.9%, p = 0.013). These results demonstrate that formal oncology teaching can be improved on inpatient oncology rotations through a simple and easily replicable oncology curriculum.

Many reports have documented that health care professionals are experiencing significant psychological morbidity as a result of providing essential care and services during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In these reports, pharmacists are not well represented, and, therefore, it is essential to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists across multiple practice settings. This is particularly true as the experiences of pharmacists working through previous pandemics and disasters, and the associated psychological burden, are likely to offer insights and be useful in supporting the psychological well-being of pharmacists during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Since the introduction of PrEP and HIVST for the key population groups in Nigeria, government entities and implementing partners have used a range of channels in messaging these essential services across to the target groupsranging from in-person, social media, television, and radio adverts. Yet, few successes have been documented, thereby necessitating the need to understand the enabling facilitators, barriers to, and communication needs of the KP groups in messaging PrEP and HIVST services in Nigeria. Communicating PrEP and HIVST services will empower the key populations to seek available HIV prevention services and help to increase access to HIV testing services in Nigeria. METHODS: This study was a mixed-method cross-sectional design; involving 1169 participants from the key populations in Nigeria. The study used a survey and qualitative exploratory methods (interviews and focus group discussion), to collect data from the participantsMSM, FSWs, and key influencers of the KP groups (health providers, peer educators, HIV program officers). In August 2020, data collection was conducted using an open data kit (ODK). Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 for descriptive statistics, while qualitative data were analyzed using deductive and thematic analysis based on the codebook. RESULTS: The KPs were mainly urban dwellers (77.7%), and the majority of the participants were between 18 to 28 years (89.3%). However, the MSM group was of a younger population compared to the FSWs. A majority completed secondary education (56.1% FSWs and 43.5% MSM). The MSM group showed more tendency to acquire higher education compared to the FSWs. For example, about 51.3% of the MSM group were undergraduates compared to 9.5% of the FSWs. The majority of the KPs were self-employed (56.4% FSWs and 40% MSM). Only about 51% of the KPs were aware of PrEP, with typological variations (39.9% FSWs and 62.3% MSM). MSM group in Lagos (82.5%) were more aware of PrEP services, than 53.1% and 54.5% in A/Ibom (53.1%) and C/River (54.5%). Among the enablers to acquiring PrEP information was the ability of the KPs to network within their communities and on personal relationships. Evidence shows that no single approach influenced the acquisition and use of PrEP information by KPs. Although this proportion varied across the geographic locations, only about 50% of the KPs were aware of HIVST services (40% FSWs and 60% MSM). The factors that enabled the acquisition and use of the prevention commodities were cross-cutting, including a previous or current role as a peer educator, integration of the messages, peer networking, multi-lingual and multi-channel presentation, job aids, and reminders. KPs expressed the need for information on how to take PrEP, eligibility, clarification on differences between PrEP and PEP, clarification on any side effects, for PrEP, price, efficacy, sales point, dosage, available brands. A scale-up of the research across all geopolitical zones and a survey to quantify the prevalence would help understand the dynamics and prioritization of interventions for scaling up PrEP and HIVST services in Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: The study documented barriers and facilitators to the uptake of PrEP and HIVST among key populations in Nigeria. It highlighted that KPs are willing to receive PrEP and HIVST messages. The policy actors should consider the preferences of the KPs and the key influencers in reducing barriers to communication and increasing the uptake of PrEP and HIVST services; ensure it reflects in a tailored communication strategy. Since multi-linguistics and multi-channels of presentation were enablers to acquiring PrEP and HIVST messages, the communications strategy for HIV prevention should incorporate these recommendations and adapt to context-specific approaches for effective messaging.","output":"Communication needs for improved uptake of PrEP and HIVST services among key populations in Nigeria: a mixed-method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency use authorization of COVID vaccines has brought hope to mitigate pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) However, there remains a need for additional effective vaccines to meet the global demand and address the potential new viral variants mRNA technologies offer an expeditious path alternative to traditional vaccine approaches Here we describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA vaccine candidates based on the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Several mRNA constructs of S-protein, including wild type, a pre-fusion stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form (2P/GSAS), as well as others, were tested in animal models for their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in mice and Cynomolgus macaques, and for efficacy in a Syrian golden hamster model The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, designated MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in neutralization assays in all three preclinical models and more importantly, protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced weight loss and lung pathology in hamsters In addition, MRT5500 elicited TH1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate (NHP), thus alleviating a hypothetical concern of potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases known associated with TH2-biased responses These data position MRT5500 as a viable vaccine candidate for entering clinical development","output":"Immunogenicity and efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine MRT5500 in preclinical animal models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiology of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) in the Republic of Ireland was first published in 2005 but has not been updated since.

Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is a well-known phenomenon that may explain the olfactory dysfunction reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. METHODS: A scoping literature review was performed to identify studies that investigated the mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction. Studies demonstrating pathophysiological, histological, immunochemical, and epidemiological outcomes of PVOD were included. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in addition to one international news article. Three studies reported destruction of the olfactory epithelium following intranasal inoculation of various viral strains in mice. Three studies isolated pathogenic, anosmia inciting viruses (Parainfluenza virus, Human Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) through nucleic acid amplification. Eleven studies demonstrated female predilection in patients with PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction, of which the majority were over 50 years old. CONCLUSIONS: PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction demonstrates considerable similarities in epidemiological trends and disease sequela of other viruses to suggest identical pathophysiological mechanisms.

Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. METHODS: There were two parts to this study. Between 15th March 2020 to 15th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. RESULTS: In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic and 25 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. Of the 22 patients in COVID-19 arm that underwent testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies beyond 7 months, all had detectable antibodies. A higher proportion of the patients with COVID-19 were frail compared to patients without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (64.3% vs 34.1%, p = 0.003). Other characteristics were similar between the groups. Over a median follow up of 7 months, a higher number of deaths were recorded in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to those without (18.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Serological testing in the HD population is a valuable tool to determine seroprevalence, monitor exposure, and guide improvements for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to help prevent local outbreaks. This study revealed HD patients mount a humoral response detectable until at least 7 months after COVID-19 infection and provides hope of similar protection with the vaccines recently approved.

Methods: In this qualitative study, through recorded in-depth individual and focal group interviews, gymnasts (n = 16) and martial arts (n = 18) athletes from Brazil and Spain reported their eating practices. Transcripts were analyzed through the Content Analysis method. Results: The main determinants of athletes' eating practices were the quest for a specific body in line with each sports' discipline and cultural food aspects. The everyday eating practices respected the country of origin's food culture; however, some practices, especially aiming at weight loss were similar in both countries and related to the sports discipline. Female Brazilian aesthetics athletes were particularly worried about achieving a thinner body. Martial arts athletes from both countries reported adopting fast weight loss strategies presently or at some point in their sports trajectory. Internal and external pressure to lose weight was a constant factor, especially amongst Brazilians. Conclusions: There is a specific body culture in each sport discipline, which extends beyond country borders. The idealized bodies athletes seek are constructed socially according to their sports. This confers them an identity and promotes beliefs and meanings to foodways. The sports-related eating practices which superimposed national foodways were similar in both countries, suggesting a group identity process, and the existence of a \\"sports discipline's food culture\\".

In this preregistered study, we investigated the effects of social-emotional headline contents on social judgments and brain responses and whether they can be modulated by explicit evaluations of the trustworthiness of the media source. Participants (N=30) evaluated -and clearly discerned- the trustworthiness of news sources before they were exposed to person-related news headlines. Despite this intervention, social judgments and brain responses were dominated largely by emotional headline contents. Results suggest differential effects of source credibility might depend on headline valence. Electrophysiological indexes of fast emotional and arousal-related brain responses, as well as correlates of slow evaluative processing were enhanced for persons associated with positive headline contents from trusted sources, but not when positive headlines stemmed from distrusted sources. In contrast, negative headlines dominated fast and slow brain responses unaffected by explicit source credibility evaluations. These results provide novel insights into the brain mechanisms underlying the \\"success\\" of emotional news from untrustworthy sources, suggesting a pronounced susceptibility to negative information even from distrusted sources that is reduced for positive contents. The differential pattern of responses to misinformation in mind and brain sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of misinformation and possible strategies to avoid their potentially detrimental effects.","output":"Negative news dominates fast and slow brain responses and social judgments even after source credibility evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telocytes (TCs) are experimentally evidenced as an alternative of cell therapies for organ tissue injury and repair. The aims of the present studies are to explore direct roles of TCs and the roles of TC-derived exosomes in support of experimental acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo or in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The roles of TCs in experimental ALI were firstly estimated. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p110 and // isoform inhibitors were used in study dynamic alterations of bio-behaviors, and in expression of functional factors of TCs per se and TC-co-cultured airway epithelial cells during the activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TC-driven exosomes were furthermore characterized for intercellular communication by which activated or non-activated TCs interacted with epithelia. RESULTS: Our results showed that TCs mainly prevented from lung tissue edema and hemorrhage and decreased the levels of VEGF-A and MMP9 induced by LPS. Treatment with CAL101 (PI3K p110 inhibitor) and LY294002 (PI3K// inhibitor) could inhibit TC movement and differentiation and increase the number of dead TCs. The expression of Mtor, Hif1, Vegf-a, or Mmp9 mRNA increased in TCs challenged with LPS, while Mtor, Hif1, and Vegf-a even more increased after adding CAL101 or Mtor after adding LY. The rate of epithelial cell proliferation was higher in co-culture of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and TCs than that in HBE alone under conditions with or without LPS challenge or when cells were treated with LPS and CAL101 or LY294002. The levels of mTOR, HIF1, or VEGF-A significantly increased in mono-cultured or co-cultured cells, challenged with LPS as compared with those with vehicle. LPS-pretreated TC-derived exosomes upregulated the expression of AKT, p-AKT, HIF1, and VEGF-A protein of HBE. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of TCs ameliorated the severity of lung tissue edema accompanied by elevated expression of VEGF-A. TCs could nourish airway epithelial cells through nutrients produced from TCs, increasing epithelial cell proliferation, and differentiation as well as cell sensitivity to LPS challenge and PI3K p110 and // inhibitors, partially through exosomes released from TCs.

Our objective is to determine whether the fibrin clot structure and function differ between critically ill patients with or without COVID-19 and to correlate the structure with clinical coagulation biomarkers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. Platelet poor plasma was used to analyze fibrin clot structure; the functional implications were determined by quantifying clot turbidity and porosity. SETTING: ICU at an academic medical center and an academic laboratory. PATIENTS: Patients admitted from July 1 to August 1, 2020, to the ICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood was collected from 36 patients including 26 ICU patients with COVID-19 and 10 ICU patients with sepsis but without COVID-19 at a median of 11 days after ICU admission (interquartile range, 3C16). The cohorts were similar in age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and mortality. More patients with COVID-19 (100% vs 70%; p = 0.003) required anticoagulation. Ex vivo fibrin clots formed from patients with COVID-19 appeared to be denser and to have smaller pores than those from patients with sepsis but without COVID-19 (percent area of fluorescent fibrin 48.1% [SD, 16%] vs 24.9% [SD, 18.8%]; p = 0.049). The turbidity and flow-through assays corroborated these data; fibrin clots had a higher maximum turbidity in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 (0.168 vs 0.089 OD units; p = 0.003), and it took longer for buffer to flow through these clots (216 vs 103 min; p = 0.003). In patients with COVID-19, d-dimer levels were positively correlated with percent area of fluorescent fibrin ( = 0.714, p = 0.047). Denser clots (assessed by turbidity and thromboelastography) and higher SOFA scores were independently associated with delayed clot lysis.

If the potential benefits of PGData are to be realised, we need a better understanding of the psychological barriers and facilitators to the collection and beneficial sharing of health and lifestyle data. Due to the understudied role that stigma plays in sharing PGData, we explore the attitudes and experiences of those living with potentially stigmatised LTHCs with respect to collecting and sharing health and lifestyle data. METHODS: This study used semi-structured interviews and a card sorting task to explore the attitudes and experiences of people living with potentially stigmatised LTHCs. Fourteen adult participants who reported having a range of conditions were recruited in England. Template analysis was used to analyse interview transcripts and descriptive statistics were used for the card sorting task. RESULTS: The findings present four overarching themes: Preferences for collecting health and lifestyle data, Importance of anonymity, Expected use of data, and Sources of emotional support. Participants illustrated a general willingness to share health and lifestyle data; however, there were some notable differences in sharing experiences, varying both by information type and recipient group. Overall, participants did not identify health-related stigma as a barrier to collecting or sharing their personal health and lifestyle data.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective descriptive analysis of patients admitted into the ED recorded in the Lombardy online regional portal called EUOL (Emergenza e Urgenza OnLine). We compared the data registered in the EUOL with the patients admitted to the EDs from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 and from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. RESULTS: The number of admissions to the ED decreased by 32.5% in 2020 compared with 2019, reaching the lowest number in March and April. However, the percentage of patients hospitalized after ED significantly increased in 2020 compared with 2019 (P < 0.0001), reflecting the management of patients with a more severe clinical condition.

It is unclear if the choice of NSAID impacts outcomes. We compared ibuprofen, ketorolac, and diclofenac for the treatment of acute, non-radicular LBP. METHODS This was a three armed, double-blind, comparative effectiveness study, in which we enrolled patients at the conclusion of an ED visit for musculoskeletal LBP and determined outcomes by telephone 5 days later. Patients were randomized to receive a 5 day supply of ibuprofen 600 mg, ketorolac 10 mg, or diclofenac 50 mg, each to be used TID PRN. Every participant also received LBP education. The primary outcome was improvement in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), a 24 item instrument on which lower scores indicate better LBP functional outcomes, between ED visit and day 5. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, measured using the descriptors none, mild, moderate, and severe, and the presence of stomach irritation. RESULTS 868 patients were screened and 66 patients were enrolled in each of the three arms. Baseline characteristics were similar. Improvements in RMDQ by day 5 were as follows: ibuprofen 9.4, ketorolac 11.9, diclofenac 10.9 (p = 0.34). Mild or no pain at day 5 was as follows: ibuprofen 38/61 (62%); ketorolac 47/59 (80%); diclofenac 45/62 (71%); 95% CI for rounded mean difference of 17% between ibuprofen and ketorolac: 1, 33%, p = 0.04, number needed to treat = 6 (95%CI: 3, 69).

This paper seeks to examine whether the type of health insurance enrollment affects the utilization of health services, choice of provider and financial protection of households in Togo. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, representative household survey involving 1180 insured households that had reported either illness in the household in the 4 weeks preceding the survey or hospitalization in the 12 months preceding the survey. A nested logit model was used to account for the utilization of health services and provider choice, and methods of assessing catastrophic health care expenditures were used to analyze the level of household financial protection. RESULTS: Policyholders of private health insurance use private health care facilities more than policyholders of public health insurance. The main reasons for not using health centers among households with public insurance were out-of-pocket payments (49.19%), waiting time (36.80%), and distance to the nearest health center (36.76%). Furthermore, on average, households with public insurance spent a higher proportion of their total monthly nonfood expenditures on health care than those with private insurance. We find that the type of insurance, share of expenditures allocated to food, distance to the nearest health center, and waiting time significantly impact the choice of provider. Regardless of the type of health insurance, elderly individuals avoid using private health centers and referral hospitals due to the high cost. CONCLUSION: We found that a multiple health insurance system results in a multilevel health system that is not equitable for everyone. The capacity of the health insurance system to provide equitable health care services and protect its members from catastrophic health care expenditures should be at the core of health care reform. This study recommends raising awareness of the criteria for the reimbursement of medical procedures within the framework of public insurance and promoting specific health insurance mechanisms for elderly individuals.

That is why the need to protect consumer rights when buying goods via the Internet keeps growing. In particular, the author considers the problem of implementing consumer rights when purchasing goods in online stores in Ukraine and Moldova. The study showed that Ukraine and Moldova are gaining huge rates of development in the internet trade sector, which is further intensified in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of lockdown. In this regard, the issue of compliance with consumer rights on the Internet is extremely relevant today. When studying the issue of consumer protection upon purchasing goods on the Internet, the author used a formal and logical method to determine the content of the main concepts, systematise the material, and obtain generalising conclusions within the framework of the subject matter. The comparative legal method helped identify trends and compare the legislation of Ukraine and the legislation of the Republic of Moldova in the context of consumer protection when purchasing goods on the Internet. According to the findings of the study, the legislative framework in the area of protecting the rights of consumers who purchase goods via the internet should be one of the priority areas of the worlds states. With regard to the legislation of Ukraine and Moldova in this area, it should be noted that given that Ukraine and Moldova have European integration aspirations, which in particular is reflected in the ratification of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU (European Union) of 2014, as well as the Association Agreement between Moldova and the EU of 2014, and the commitments made by these states to bring the legislation into line with the EU acquis, it is important to harmonise national legislation with EU standards in this area.

We established a theoretical framework and goals for a psychological preparedness programme to support healthcare workers at the study sites. SETTING: Data were collected at the Dora Nginza Hospital, Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital and Elizabeth Donkin Hospital. METHODS: We employed an observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional design. A group psychological intervention was developed and implemented at the three sites in South Africa, from mid-April 2020 over 20 weeks. We collected data using an audit tool to measure healthcare workers perceptions of the outbreak before and after the intervention. We analysed the data to test for a statistically significant difference between the pre-intervention and post-intervention audit tools. RESULTS: We supported 761 healthcare workers during the 20 weeks of the programme. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive change from pre- to post-intervention measures in perceptions of health worker about the outbreak, their anxiety associated with the outbreak, their ability to control reactions to stress and the perception of their ability to support others. Feedback comments indicated that the programme was beneficial for the majority of those who attended.

The treatment consists of an initial intensive phase of chemotherapy followed by a prolonged period of maintenance chemotherapy intended to reduce the risk of relapse. Children are commonly seen in clinic every 4-6 weeks for bloodwork and physical examination during the maintenance phase. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted consideration of alternative means of providing medical care. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of in-person clinic visits during ALL maintenance therapy for which the outcome of the physical examination resulted in a change of patient management. Methods A retrospective chart review of children diagnosed with precursor-B ALL between January 2017 and December 2018, and who were in maintenance therapy between September 2019 and February 2020, was conducted. All routine maintenance visits were reviewed to identify new physical examination findings and patient outcomes and classified as either could be managed virtually or essential in-person visit. For the latter, a second classification was conducted to distinguish between visits necessitating a change of management versus not. Results Eighty-five children were diagnosed with precursor B ALL and continued to maintenance treatment during the study period. 10 children were excluded as not meeting the inclusion criteria or not evaluable. Of the remaining 75 children, 54 were male (72%) and 21 female (28%). The median age at diagnosis was 4.83 years (0.73 - 14.8 years). 39 patients (52%) had standard risk ALL, 35 patients (46.7%) had high risk ALL and one patient had Infant ALL (1.3%) A total of 240 routine maintenance visits were included in the final analysis. An abnormal physical exam finding was noted in 20 visits (8.3%) and of these, new findings were noted in 14 (5.8%). 6 visits were classified as essential in-person visits (2 for new bruising, 1 for new limp, 1 for new lymphadenopathy, 1 for acute otitis media, and 1 for new wheezing). Among the 14 visits with new exam findings, only 5 had an impact on patient management and of these, only 2 (0.8%) were classified as obligate in-person visit for requiring immediate management (acute otitis media and wheezing). Conclusion Our results demonstrate that most in-person visits can be provided as virtual visits without affecting patient outcomes. The results of this study provide the foundation for a prospective study that will evaluate the benefits, risks and families' preferences associated with virtual visits and delineate the optimal frequency and timing of in-person clinic visits during ALL maintenance therapy.

PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (> 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (> 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (> 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.","output":"Cellular immune responses of pigs after primary inoculation with porcine respiratory coronavirus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus and challenge with transmissible gastroenteritis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SignificanceProminent events, such as the 2021 US Capitol attack, have brought politically motivated violence to the forefront of Americans' minds.

Cancer vaccines aim to clear active disease instead of aiming to prevent disease, the only exception being the recently approved vaccine that prevents cancers caused by the Human Papillomavirus. The development of therapeutic cancer vaccines has been disappointing with many early cancer vaccines that showed promise in preclinical models often failing to translate into efficacy in the clinic. In this review we provide an overview of the current vaccine platforms, adjuvants and delivery systems that are currently being investigated or have been approved. With the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, we also review the potential of these to be used with cancer vaccines to improve efficacy and help to overcome the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment.","output":"Cancer Vaccines, Adjuvants, and Delivery Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well-known player of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related morbidities, was supposed to be involved in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), but no data exist about COVID-19, DM, and the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) forms. We quantified total sRAGE and its forms, the endogenously secretory esRAGE and the membrane-cleaved cRAGE, in COVID-19 patients with and without DM and in healthy individuals to explore how COVID-19 may affect these molecules and their potential role as biomarkers. Circulating sRAGE and esRAGE were quantified by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays. cRAGE was obtained by subtracting esRAGE from total sRAGE. sRAGE, esRAGE, cRAGE, and the cRAGE/esRAGE ratio did not differ between DM and non-DM patients and had the same trend when compared to healthy individuals. Levels of total sRAGE, cRAGE, and cRAGE/esRAGE ratio were upregulated, while esRAGE was downregulated. The lack of difference between DM and non-DM COVID-19 patients in the levels of sRAGE and its forms supports the hypothesis that in COVID-19 the RAGE system is modulated regardless of glycemic control.

Among ischemic stroke, cardio-embolic has both higher severity and mortality. Objective To find out clinical outcomes and determine predictors of mortality related to cardio-embolic stroke. Methodology This prospective cohort study was conducted among patients of acute ischemic stroke of cardiac origin admitted at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital, Bangladesh from 1 st October 2020 to 30 September, 2021. Patients were kept under follow-up to 90 days from discharge. Results A total of 689 ischemic stroke patients were screened, 156 had confirmed Cardio-embolic stroke. So, the frequency of cardio-embolic stroke was 22.64%. Male to female ratio was 1.3:1, mean age of 63 years. Hypertension 119 (76.3%), atrial fibrillation 107 (68.6%), and IHD 40 (25.6%) were most common comorbidities. Interestingly, we found only 23 (14.7%) patients with chronic rheumatic heart diseases. NIH Stroke scale score (median, IQR) during admission was 13 [7- 19]. Overall mortality was 47 (29.9%), among them 30 (19.2%) died within 48 hours of hospital admission while 17 (10.9%) within 90 days of hospital discharge. Modified Rankin score at 90 days was 2 [min 0, max 5] those who survived. Cumulative incidence of recurrent stroke was 9 (7.1%) and incidence of anticoagulant induced hemorrhage were 5 (3.2%) among them. Risk factors associated with mortality (odds ratio, [95% CI], p value) were acute myocardial infarction (1.6 [1.14 - 2.52] , 0.04), raised Troponin (1.89 [1.16-2.99], 0.01), reduced ejection fraction (3.38 [2.17-5.27], <0.001), hypotension (3.12 [2.07 - 4.68], < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (1.82 [1.06 - 3.10], 0.04), raised Creatinine (2.41 [1.52 -3.84], 0.01), raised blood sugar ( 1.82 [1.14 - 2.89], 0.02) , severe stroke (9.45 [3.57 - 25.03] , <0.001), large infarct (53.67 [7.59 - 379.47] , < 0.001), hemorrhagic transformation (4.43 [2.89 - 6.84] , < 0.001) and aspiration pneumonia (1.9 [1.28-2.39], 0.01) .

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the demographic profile, clinical picture, risk factors for mortality, and outcomes of critically ill patients with AKI requiring dialysis (AKI-RRT) and with COVID-19 in the megalopolis of S?o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, observational study was conducted in the intensive care units of 13 public and private hospitals in the metropolitan region of the municipality of S?o Paulo. Patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit, aged  18 years, and treated with RRT due to COVID-19-associated AKI were included. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 375 patients (age 64.1 years, 68.8% male). Most (62.1%) had two or more comorbidities: 68.8%, arterial hypertension; 45.3%, diabetes; 36.3%, anemia; 30.9%, obesity; 18.7%, chronic kidney disease; 15.7%, coronary artery disease; 10.4%, heart failure; and 8.5%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Death occurred in 72.5% of the study population (272 patients). Among the 103 survivors, 22.3% (23 patients) were discharged on RRT. In a multiple regression analysis, the independent factors associated with death were the number of organ dysfunctions at admission and RRT efficiency. CONCLUSION: AKI-RRT associated with COVID-19 occurred in patients with an elevated burden of comorbidities and was associated with high mortality (72.5%). The number of organ dysfunctions during hospitalization and RRT efficiency were independent factors associated with mortality.

The presence of gross hematuria is a frightening experience for patient. The reasons for this gross hematuria can be various like nephrolithiasis, malignancies, glomerular diseases, trauma, urinary tract infections, drugs, hemoglobinuria, etc. To differentiate between the various causes of gross hematuria one must begin by taking good history and clinical examination, followed by urine examination and then other tests. Glomerular hematuria is smoky or cola coloured and is usually accompanied by signs and symptoms of fluid overload, high blood pressure, and proteinuria. However cola coloured urine should not be considered synonymous with glomerular hematuria Methods: We report a case of 22 year old pregnant female who was Gravida-3 (22 weeks gestation) but no live issues. Her previous 2 pregnancies ended up in Intra Uterine Death (IUD) of foetus at 6 months gestation. She was referred to us in view of history of cola coloured urine. History of similar episodes of hematuria in previous 2 pregnancies were also present.The history taking was limited because of the prevailing 2ndpeak of COVID-19 pandemic in India and hence most history taking was done indirectly via phone. Clinically she had mild pedal edema and her BP was 110/70 mm of Hg. Her workup showed that she had severe anaemia. Her Complete Blood Count showed Hb-5.8 gm/dL,TLC-3600/mm3,Plt-1.64lakh/mm3,PBS-Microcytic hypochromic with target cells. Renal function was normal. Liver function showed mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 50-60 RBCs, 5-10 Pus cell, No casts. Urine culture was sterile. 24 hour urine protein was 1.29 grams. Ultrasonography-bilateral normal sized kidneys. Her COVID-19 RTPCR was negative Results: Differentials we considered were : Primary Glomerulonephritis;Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH);Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLA) & Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (a-HUS). These were ruled out based on further relevant tests.Kidney biopsy was not offered as there was no nephrotic syndrome. Anti-Nuclear Antigen was negative. Complements were normal. APLA antibodies were negative.BP was always normal making PIH less likely. However LDH was raised (2700 U/L) & serum haptoglobulin was low. So a clear cut evidence of hemolytic anaemia but normal renal function, compelled us to revisit the history by calling the patient in-person despite the pandemic. She admitted that anaemia was present since her childhood days and she had suppressed this history due to social issues. Also the hematuria was episodic with clear urine in between. Hence Flowcytometry for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria was done which confirmed the diagnosis as PNH. Conclusions: Our case report highlights the fact that while evaluating cases of hematuria one must keep all possibilities open. Especially when dealing with cola coloured urine it should not be assumed to be glomerular hematuria It also stresses the well established fact that history taking is the key to making any diagnosis. In situations where social factors may lead to suppression of facts,efforts must be made to gain the confidence of patient and provide a conducive environment for complete history. Finally, even after diagnosis of PNH, the definitive treatment is still out of reach for many patients in this part of world.

One-hundred seventeen adult patients with epilepsy were recruited from a tertiary epilepsy center and completed the BDI-II. A single-item analysis of the 21 questions of the BDI-II was computed and differences between women and men in each depressive symptom were evaluated. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify clinical features associated with the severity of depression. Results showed gender differences in some items, with women reporting overall higher depression severity than men. The most common symptoms regarded domains of sleeping patterns, tiredness, and loss of energy. Regression evidence suggested that being female, having an epilepsy duration < 10 years, as well as being treated with psychotropic drugs and reporting generalized seizure, were associated with higher depression severity.

The ongoing pandemic constitutes a major health burden of world proportions that is also having a devastating impact on whole economies worldwide, the knock-on effects of which could be catastrophic especially in poorer countries. Alternative measures to ameliorate the impact and hamper or minimally slow down disease progression are urgently called for. This review discusses past and currently evolving data on the etiological agent of the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, and its host cell receptors with a view to disclosing alternative drugs for palliative or therapeutic approaches. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits marked tropism for cells that harbor the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at their plasmalemma, predominantly in cells lining the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and bronchoalveolar cells, making these epithelial mucosae the most likely viral receptor cell targets and entry routes. Secondly, the crystal structures of several coronavirus spike proteins in complex with their cell host target receptors, and of SARS-Cov-2 in complex with an inhibitor, are now available at atomic resolution through X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy studies. Thirdly, viral entry of other viruses has been successfully blocked by inhibiting viral endogenous proteases or clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis, the same internalization pathway followed by ACE2 and some viruses. Fourthly, the target cell-surface receptor molecules and SARS-CoV-2 possess other putative sites for drugs potentially modulating receptor activity or virus processing.

In addition, participating doctors were asked to provide their guidelines for PPE in their countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, UK) for consideration in the presented practice recommendations. RESULTS: World Health Organization guidance for respiratory aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as intubation in a COVID19 environment was clear and included the use of an FFP3 (filtering face piece level 3) mask and face protection. However, the recommendation for surgical AGPs, such as the use of high-speed power tools in the operating theatre, was not clear until the UK Public Health England (PHE) guidance of 27 March 2020. This guidance included FFP3 masks and face protection, which UK surgeons quickly adopted. The recommended PPE for orthopaedic surgeons, working in a COVID19 environment, should consist of level 4 surgical gowns, face shields or goggles, double gloves, FFP2-3 or N95-99 respirator masks. An alternative to the mask, face shield and goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure. However, there is a high cost and limited availabilty of these devices at present. Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake. During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles. Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery. In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.

Inpatient falls are the most commonly reported safety incident in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), costing the NHS 630 million a year. Injurious falls are particularly life-limiting and costly. There is a growing body of evidence on shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention; however, no systematic review exists to inform practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically identify, appraise and summarise studies investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness, and experiences of shock-absorbing flooring in hospitals and care homes. Our search will build on an extensive search conducted by a scoping review (inception to May 2016). We will search electronic databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, MEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Scopus and Web of Science; May 2016-present), trial registries and grey literature. We will conduct backward and forward citation searches of included studies, and liaise with study researchers. We will evaluate the influence of floors on fall-related injuries, falls and staff work-related injuries through randomised and non-randomised studies, consider economic and qualitative evidence, and implementation factors. We will consider risk of bias, assess heterogeneity and explore potential effect modifiers via subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Where appropriate we will combine studies through meta-analysis. We will use the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach to evaluate the quality of evidence and present the results using summary of findings tables, and adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will follow the ethical principles of systematic review conduct, by attending to publication ethics, transparency and rigour. Our dissemination plan includes peer-reviewed publication, presentations, press release, stakeholder symposium, patient video and targeted knowledge-to-action reports. This review will inform decision-making around falls management in care settings and identify important directions for future research.

In this retrospective study we have evaluated results and complications of gynaecological cancer surgeries in a tertiary care hospital during the first 9 months of covid pandemic in our country. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of patients who underwent these surgeries from March-December, 2020. Results The study included 116 patients, 48 endometrial, 50 ovarian, 14 cervical and 4 vulval &vaginal cancers. Majority of cancers were early stage (64%). The median age was 58 years (range 22-85years). Surgical approach was laparotomy in 77.6% including 48% complex surgeries. Based on the BGCS framework for prioritization of these surgeries, most of our surgeries belong to priority level 2(89%) and 3(11%). COVID verbal screening (by a questionnaire) was done in 90% of patients starting in Mid-March. Formal COVID testing by PCR for all pre-operative patients was commenced in April and hence 89(77%) of all patients underwent this testing. Only 2 patients were found COVID positive and the surgery was deferred for 4 weeks. Complications based on Clavien- Dindo grade 1, grade 4a and grade 5 were observed in 4 patients. Median hospital stay was 5 days. Out of 12 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID within 30 days of surgery 3 were found to be covid positive, including one requiring ICU admission. Conclusions The results show that with adequate preventive measures cancer surgeries can be performed with low risk of severe complications and post-surgical COVID positivity.","output":"Gynecological cancer surgeries in tertiary care hospital of Pakistan in the era of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections frequently complicate the treatment course in children with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains a major cause of hospital admissions in this population, and respiratory tract is often proven to be the site of infection even without respiratory signs and symptoms. Clinical presentation may be subtle due to impaired inflammatory response. Common respiratory viruses and bacteria are widely identified in these patients, while fungi and, less commonly, bacteria are the causative agents in more severe cases. A detailed history, thorough clinical and basic laboratory examination along with a chest radiograph are the first steps in the evaluation of a child presenting signs of a pulmonary infection. After stratifying patients risk, prompt initiation of the appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment is crucial and efficient for the majority of the patients. High-risk children should be treated with an intravenous antipseudomonal beta lactam agent, unless there is suspicion of multi-drug resistance when an antibiotic combination should be used. In unresponsive cases, more invasive procedures, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration or open lung biopsy (OLB), are recommended.

Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies.","output":"A potential role for cyclophosphamide in the mitigation of acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social interactions promote the communication of explicit and implicit information between individuals.

We report the intraoperative assessment of sentinel node metastasis by thoracoscopic ICG fluorescence imaging system and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS Sixty-one patients who underwent surgery between January 2009 and December 2010 were investigated for sentinel node biopsy. ICG fluorescence imaging was applied by an infrared light CCD system, and sentinel nodes were identified and dissected. Intraoperative real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) was performed for evaluation of metastasis and finally histologic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained, paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS Sixteen (80%) of 20 patients with segmentectomy and 33 (80.5%) of 41 with lobectomy were identified for sentinel lymph nodes. The total identification rate was 80.3% (49 of 61). The false-negative rate was 2.1% (1 of 49). The overall accuracy rate was 78.7% (48 of 61 patients). Disease of four of these patients was upstaged to stage IIA by RT-PCR for CK-19 expression, which was positive for sentinel nodes and micrometastases. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrated that thoracoscopic ICG fluorescence imaging-guided surgery and real-time quantitative RT-PCR were useful for sentinel node biopsy and might be a powerful tool for more focused pathologic or molecular evaluation for staging.","output":"Sentinel node navigation surgery by thoracoscopic fluorescence imaging system and molecular examination in non-small cell lung cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The recent introduction of 3D exoscopic surgery has engendered interesting technical improvements in head and neck surgery.

They are highly efficacious and generally well tolerated. Vaccination in patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases is recommended. A number of cases with de novo or relapsing glomerulonephritis shortly after vaccine application have been reported, some of which presented with gross haematuria. METHODS: We collected 10 cases of macrohaematuria following mRNA-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination at our tertiary care institution and referring centres. Additionally, we pooled all 25 published cases from the literature with ours to analyse their clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Most macrohaematuria episodes (72.2%) began within 2 days after vaccination, the majority after the second dose. In some individuals, repeated episodes occurred after subsequent doses of the same vaccine. A total of 65.7% of patients never had macrohaematuria before. A total of 45.7% were known to suffer from immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN); the rest had no prior renal diagnosis. IgAN was the most frequent new diagnosis, but anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease were also identified. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 28.6% of patients, with an increase in serum creatinine not meeting Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes AKI criteria in 28.6%. Treatment ranged from conservative management, reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system inhibitors, steroids and cyclophosphamide to plasmapheresis. While renal outcomes were mainly favourable in isolated IgAN, they were poor in patients with additional or isolated small vessel vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Awareness of gross haematuria after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is important. Close follow-up and additional work up, particularly in individuals without known underlying kidney disease or worsening renal function, is essential. For patients with vaccine-associated macrohaematuria, an alternative vaccine class might be considered for subsequent vaccinations.","output":"Clinical spectrum of gross haematuria following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with mRNA vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crowd counting has drawn much attention due to its importance in safety-critical surveillance systems. Especially, deep neural network (DNN) methods have significantly reduced estimation errors for crowd counting missions. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., normal images with human-imperceptible perturbations could mislead DNNs to make false predictions. In this work, we propose a robust attack strategy called Adversarial Patch Attack with Momentum (APAM) to systematically evaluate the robustness of crowd counting models, where the attacker's goal is to create an adversarial perturbation that severely degrades their performances, thus leading to public safety accidents (e.g., stampede accidents). Especially, the proposed attack leverages the extreme-density background information of input images to generate robust adversarial patches via a series of transformations (e.g., interpolation, rotation, etc.). We observe that by perturbing less than 6\\\\% of image pixels, our attacks severely degrade the performance of crowd counting systems, both digitally and physically. To better enhance the adversarial robustness of crowd counting models, we propose the first regression model-based Randomized Ablation (RA), which is more sufficient than Adversarial Training (ADT) (Mean Absolute Error of RA is 5 lower than ADT on clean samples and 30 lower than ADT on adversarial examples). Extensive experiments on five crowd counting models demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.

Literature reviews show comparable disease free survival rates. However, in the era of shared decision-making, patients need to be able to balance the pros and cons of both treatment options. A web-based decision aid will be developed to inform patients and to support them in deciding which risks or benefits are most important for them. In addition to the literature, former patients provide an important source of information on treatment aspects that are relevant to patients. Aim of the current qualitative study is to gather information about the perspectives of (former) patients in order to incorporate these in the development of the decision aid. Materials and Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with patients who have undergone either cystectomy or chemoradiation. The patients were recruited by urologists and radiation oncologists and by a call of the Dutch patient association (LMBNK). They were asked about their overall experience, the harms and benefits of their treatment and possible information gaps prior to their treatment. The interviews were performed by telephone, due to Covid restrictions. Results: In total, 17 patients who had been treated 1 to 5 years ago in different hospitals in the Netherlands were interviewed. Eleven were treated with cystectomy and six with chemoradiation. The mean age was 66.4 yrs (range 33 to 78). Patients reported several topics to be taken into account when making a treatment choice. These included not only outcome related issues, but also logistic and emotional issues. (Table Presented) Seven patients indicated that they had missed information on possible side effects or on the procedure. All patients endorsed the need for neutral and balanced information to help patients with this difficult decision. Conclusion: These results indicate that the perspective of former patients has added value for developing a decision aid for MIBC patients. While the literature focusses on outcome related differences between the treatments, such as survival and toxicity, patients added emotional and logistic issues to the trade-off. A decision aid which incorporates the full patient perspective will help patients make an informed decision and choose a treatment that best matches their needs and values.","output":"Decision aid for bladder cancer patients choosing between cystectomy and bladder sparing treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The global adoption of teleconsultation has been expedited as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. By allowing remote communication, teleconsultation may help limit the spread of the virus while maintaining the crucial patient-provider relationship. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of teleconsultation compared to in-person visits in the management of elective orthopaedic and spinal procedures. Methods: : This was a prospective observational cohort study of 853 patients receiving orthopaedic and spinal care at a private outpatient clinic in New Zealand. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: (1) patients receiving telephone consultation remotely;and (2) patients receiving in-person office consultations at the outpatient clinic. All patients received telephone consultations for four weeks during the mandated COVID-19 lockdown, followed by four weeks of telephone or in-person consultation. Patient preference, satisfaction, and duration of visit were recorded. Comparisons of patient preference between groups, visit type, sex, and location were performed using Chi-square tests;similarly, satisfaction scores and visit durations were compared using a general linear model. Results: : We report that 91% of patients in the telephone group preferred teleconsultation over in-person office visits during the COVID-19 lockdown (p=0.000). A combined-group analysis shows that 55.3% of all patients preferred teleconsultation compared to 31.2% who preferred in-person office visits (p=0.000). Patients in the telephone group reported significantly higher satisfaction scores (9.95 +/- 0.04, 95% CI [9.87-10.03]) compared to patients in the in-person group (9.53 +/- 0.04, 95% CI [9.45-9.62];p=0.000). Additionally, in-person consultations were significantly longer in duration compared to telephone consultations, with a mean visit time of 6.70 min +/-0.18, 95% CI [6.32-7.02] compared to 5.10 min +/-0.17, 95% CI [4.73-5.42], respectively (p=0.000). Conclusion: Patients who utilize telephone consultations are more likely to prefer it over traditional, in-person visits in the future. This increased preference, coupled with higher patient satisfaction scores and shorter duration of visits, suggests that teleconsultation has a role in orthopaedic surgery, which may even extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Teleconsultation in the Management of Elective Orthopaedic and Spinal Conditions During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Program Pembelajaran Jarak Jauh (PJJ) dilakukan untuk memutus rantai penyebaran virus COVID-19.

This review summarizes the rationale for antibiotic use in animal agriculture, therapeutic classes used, risks from antibiotic-resistant organisms, and limits of existing regulation. In addition, opportunities for improved surveillance, stewardship, and advocacy will be highlighted. METHODS: A transdisciplinary narrative review of drivers of antibiotics in food production was conducted, including concepts from population health, infectious diseases, veterinary medicine, and consumer advocacy. FINDINGS: Globally, antibiotics of many important classes in human medicine are given to animals for the treatment of a diagnosed illness, disease control and prevention, and growth promotion. Extensive antibiotic use on farms drives the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in food-producing animals, which can be transmitted to people and the environment. Antibiotic stewardship in food production has been associated with decreased rates of resistance in both animals and humans, without reducing farm productivity. Multiple European nations have successfully implemented stewardship strategies, including banning uses for disease prevention, benchmarking antibiotic utilization, and setting national reduction targets. In the United States, medically important antibiotics are no longer permitted for growth promotion; however, antibiotics may be prescribed for other indications with limited veterinary oversight and requirements for reporting. Marked reductions in use have been achieved in the poultry industry, although use in the pork and beef industries remain high. IMPLICATIONS: Despite some progress, significant challenges in surveillance and regulatory oversight remain to prevent the overuse of antibiotics in food production. Consumers remain a potent force via market pressure on grocery stores, restaurants, suppliers, and farmers. Improved, verified labelling is important for informing consumer choices. Numerous public health agencies, consumer groups, and professional societies have called for judicious antibiotic use, but increased direct advocacy from health care professionals is needed.","output":"Antibiotic Stewardship in Food-Producing Animals: Challenges, Progress, and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In Aotearoa New Zealand, Mori and Pacific people experience worse health outcomes compared with other New Zealanders. No population-based eye health survey has been conducted, and eye health services do not generate routine monitoring reports, so the extent of eye health inequality is unknown. This information is required to plan equitable eye health services. Here we outline the protocol for a scoping review to report the nature and extent of the evidence reporting vision impairment, and the use of eye health services by ethnicity in New Zealand. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An information specialist will conduct searches on MEDLINE and Embase, with no limit on publication dates or language. We will search the grey literature via websites of relevant government and service provider agencies. Reference lists of included articles will be screened. Observational studies will be included if they report the prevalence of vision impairment, or any of the main causes (cataract, uncorrected refractive error, macular degeneration, glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy) or report the use of eye health services in New Zealand among people of any age. Two authors will independently review titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and complete data extraction. Overall findings will be summarised using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, with an emphasis on disaggregation by ethnicity where this information is available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval has not been sought as our review will only include published and publicly accessible data.

Exposure to COVID-19 has increased the risk of numerous socio-psychological problems such as the risk of domestic violence, suicidal behavior, social stigma and discrimination, human-rights-related challenges and crime, depression, anxiety, stress, phobias, confusion, traumatic events, and other mental health problems. This article describes the socio-psychological implications pertaining to the spread of coronavirus, how it has caused numerous deaths, and how developing and developed countries alike have imposed lockdowns, curfews, and restrictions on public movement, affecting markets, workplaces, construction sites, and transport facilities, while members of society have been instructed to maintain social distance, adversely affecting their day-to-day lives. This study is based on a comprehensive review of literature, as well as data regarding the socio-psychological implications of COVID-19. The study concludes that the outbreak of COVID-19 has catastrophic socio-psychological implications, especially in developing countries, where the vulnerable in society are hit hard.

The objectives of our study were to describe patterns of COVID-19 testing among LGBTQ+ people and to differentiate rates of COVID-19 testing and test results by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Participants residing in the United States and US territories (N = 1090) aged &#8805;18 completed an internet-based survey from May through July 2020 that assessed COVID-19 testing and test results and sociodemographic characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). We analyzed data on receipt and results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19 in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 1090 participants, 182 (16.7%) received a PCR test; of these, 16 (8.8%) had a positive test result. Of the 124 (11.4%) who received an antibody test, 45 (36.3%) had antibodies. Rates of PCR testing were higher among participants who were non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born (16.3%) and employed full-time or part-time (18.5%) versus unemployed (10.8%).

Our objective was to report on a new technique to solve this problem. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS We describe our experience with the use of cryopreserved iliac artery grafts for right renal vein extension. Two renal grafts from living donors with a short right renal vein were subjected to an extension with a cryopreserved external iliac artery allograft. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. There were also no changes in ischemia times. The renal implantation was performed easily and conveniently using our standard technique. For the first and second procedures, at 3 and 3.5 years after surgery, respectively, both vascular grafts maintain good patency, and the renal function of both recipients is optimal. CONCLUSION Tissue-banked cryopreserved cadaveric vessels can be a useful tool in renal transplant surgery. The use of a cryopreserved iliac artery for renal vein extension is a simple and effective new technique that can be added to the pool of surgical solutions for a short renal vein in living-donor kidney transplantation.

Objective To characterize the association of planned in-person school attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic with factors, including family socioeconomic characteristics, and parent attitudes and beliefs about their child's school attendance. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional survey study. Data were collected from June 2, 2020, to June 5, 2020, weighted to reflect population norms, and analyzed using ordered probit regression. A sample of US parents (of children ages 5-17 years) were recruited using a nonprobability survey panel with stratification by socioeconomic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was parent-reported plan to send their child to school or keep their child home, conditional on their school opening for in-person instruction. Additional measures assessed family socioeconomic characteristics, medical vulnerability, worry about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome, confidence in their child's school, and homeschooling difficulties. Results The sample of 730 parents was balanced by parent sex (53% women) with successful oversampling for Black (28%; n = 201) and Hispanic (27%; n = 200) participants. In estimates weighted to US population norms, 31% (95% CI, 27% to 34%) of participants indicated they would probably or definitely keep their child home this fall, and 49% indicated that they would probably or definitely send their child to school this fall. Factors associated with planning to keep children home included lower income (38% with incomes <$50 000 vs 21% with incomes $100 000-$150 000 per year; difference, 17%; 95% CI, 9% to 26%), being unemployed (40% unemployed vs 26% employed; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 25%), and having a flexible job (33% with flexible jobs vs 19% with inflexible jobs; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 30%). Planning to keep children home was also associated with fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.19; P < .001), fear of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (B = 0.12; P = .04), confidence in schools (B = -0.22; P < .001), and challenges of homeschooling (B = -0.12; P = .01).

Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS: 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There (P = .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001).

Thus, it is imperative to characterize the features of this disease in the domestic context. METHODOLOGY: We identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status. RESULTS: The study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3%) were males. 159 (72.3%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.001), imported cases (85.2% vs. 69.8%, p = 0.02), illiterates (26.8% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.01), alcohol users (43.3% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.01), and had higher platelet count (253109/L vs. 185109/L, p = 0.02).

This by-product might be a useful alternative to antibiotic growth stimulators in poultry nutrition. The purpose of this research was to test the impact of OMW on the immune responses and on the morphology of intestine of broiler chickens. Four dietary therapies with five replicas of 15 birds in each, totalling 300 day- Ross 308 broiler chickens, were utilized in this study. Control chickens were fed a mixed diet that included a maize-soybean meal complemented by 1 and 2% OMW in addition to the basal diet. Furthermore, Enramycin (125 g/kg) was added to the control diet as an antibiotic. Throughout this experiment, performance was studied as well as the immune response to the Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and intestinal morphological traits. A substantial surge was noted in body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI) of chickens after the addition of 1% OMW (p  0.05). In contrast, feed supplementation with 2% OMW, compared with the control diet, produced no noteworthy increase in BWG or the feed conversion rate (FCR). Antibiotic addition, on the other hand, increased serum cholesterol (p  0.05). After 42 days, neither OMW nor antibiotic addition affected organ mass. In contrast, antibiotic addition reduced the small intestine percentage, crypt depth and villus height (p  0.05). The Newcastle disease vaccine (NDV) antibody titer improved after feed supplementation with 1% OMW comparing with the control and antibiotic diet group. Furthermore, OMW supplementation decreased the heterophil-to-lymphocyte H/L ratio (p  0.05). The use of OMW led to a reduction in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the breast and liver and an increase in glutathione peroxidase.

There is little data on the hybrid technique of laparoscopic-assisted two-phase oesophago-gastrectomy (LA2OG). Here we aim to review our experience, which exceeds 10 years, of this technique for oesophageal malignancy. METHODS From June 1998 to May 2009, 111 patients underwent LA2OG. Patients included 84 men and 27 women with mean age 65 years (range 35-85 years). Retrospective analysis of indications, outcome, staging, complications and survival was performed. RESULTS The majority of resections (96%) were performed for gastro-oesophageal junction or distal oesophageal pathology. Indications included adenocarcinoma (84.7%), squamous cell carcinoma (7.2%) and high-grade dysplasia (5.4%). Of patients, 67.6% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median time for the laparoscopic phase was 207 min (range 105-600 min), and 420 min (range 210-780 min) overall. Estimated blood loss was 330 ml (range 100-1,200 ml). Median critical care and post-operative stays were 3 and 14 days, respectively. Over time, the radicality of surgery increased. From 1998 to 2001 median lymph node yield was 5, from 2002 to 2005 it was 12 nodes, and from 2006 to 2009 it was 28 nodes (p < 0.001). The overall complication rate was 38.7%, minor in 24.3%, with anastomotic leak rate of 5.5%. Median survival was 38.5  5.4 months. Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality were 1.8 and 2.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Two-stage laparoscopic-assisted oesophago-gastrectomy is a safe staged method of developing minimal access surgery for oesophago-gastric cancer. This study provides a useful reference for comparison with other minimally invasive methods.","output":"Two-phase laparoscopic-assisted oesophago-gastrectomy: a single-unit experience of 111 consecutive cases and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 has seen the world gripped by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not the first time, nor will it be last, that our increasingly globalized world has been significantly affected by the emergence of a new disease. In much of the Northern Hemisphere, the academic year begins in September, and for many countries, September 2020 marked the return to full schooling after some period of enforced closure due to COVID-19. In this paper, we focus on the airborne spread of disease and investigate the likelihood of transmission in school environments. It is crucial to understand the risk airborne infection from COVID-19 might pose to pupils, teachers, and their wider social groups. We use monitored CO2 data from 45 classrooms in 11 different schools from within the UK to estimate the likelihood of infection occurring within classrooms regularly attended by the same staff and pupils. We determine estimates of the number of secondary infections arising via the airborne route over pre/asymptomatic periods on a rolling basis. Results show that, assuming relatively quiet desk-based work, the number of secondary infections is likely to remain reassuringly below unity; however, it can vary widely between classrooms of the same school even when the same ventilation system is present. Crucially, the data highlight significant variation with the seasons with January being nearly twice as risky as July. We show that such seasonal variations in risk due to changes in ventilation rates are robust and our results hold for wide variations in disease parameterizations, suggesting our results may be applied to a number of different airborne diseases.","output":"Seasonal variation in airborne infection risk in schools due to changes in ventilation inferred from monitored carbon dioxide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread infections have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to evolve in human, leading to the emergence of multiple circulating variants. Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccines, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring the vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. These probes could be produced by a single step using in-process biotinylation and purification. We characterized the physical properties and antigenicity of these probes, comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the RBD and subdomain 1 (RBD-SD1), and the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain (S2P) with sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or of interest, including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. We functionally validated probes by using yeast expressing a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies and confirmed sorting capabilities of variant probes using yeast displaying libraries of plasma antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors. We deposited these constructs to Addgene to enable their dissemination. Overall, this study describes a matrix of SARS-CoV-2 variant molecular probes that allow for assessment of immune responses, identification of serum antibody specificity, and isolation and characterization of neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Molecular probes of spike ectodomain and its subdomains for SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha through Omicron"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) plays an important role in mammals as a signaling molecule. Recently, abnormal H(2)S concentration has been associated with several pathophysiological states, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As regulating H(2)S concentration can be a very prominent way of developing new drugs, many researchers have paid great attention to H(2)S research. To understand the role of H(2)S in pathophysiology and develop H(2)S-based therapies, it is necessary to measure the exact concentration of H(2)S within biological systems. But, H(2)S is volatile and can be easily oxidized. Besides, the active sites for several biological effects of H(2)S are inside the cell.

We consider mean temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO as independent variable and daily COVID 19 cases as dependent variable for 18 states during 18th march to 30th April, 2020.After dividing the dataset for 0 to 10 day, 10 to 25 days and 0 to 44 days, the current study applied Akaike s Information Criteria (AIC) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to examine the kind of relationship between independent variables with COVID 19 cases. Initially GAM model result shows variables like temperature and solar radiation has positive relation (p<0.05) in 0 to 10 days study with daily cases. In 25 days dataset it significantly shows that temperature has positive relation above 23 degree centigrade, SO2 has a negative relationship and relative humidity has negative (between 30% to 45% and > 60%) and a positive relationship (45% to 60%) with COVID 19 cases (p=0.05). 44 days dataset has six parameters includes temperature as positive, relative humidity as negative (between 0 to 45%) and then positive (after >45%), NO2 as Positive (0 to 35 microgram/m3) followed by negative trend (after > 40 microgram/m3), SO2 and rainfall as negative relation. After sensitive analysis, it is found that weather variables like relative humidity, solar radiation and rainfall are more sensitive than temperature and wind speed. Whereas pollutants like NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO are more sensitive variables than SO2 in this study. In summary this study finds temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, SO2, PM2.5, and CO may be important factors associated with COVID 19 pandemic.

While novel methods for virtual resident training have been described, many of these demonstrate a substantial change from previous instructional methods and their efficacy cannot be directly compared to in-person teaching. We sought to determine if the conversion of our intern \\"summer school\\" from an in-person to online format (a) impacted the knowledge acquisition of interns, and (b) their preferences for senior resident-led didactics. DESIGN: A senior-resident led intern summer curriculum was started in an in-person format with the 2019-2020 academic year. Interns underwent assessments of their knowledge and surveys of changes in subject confidence. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum was shifted to an online format for the academic year 2020-2021. SETTING: Washington University in St. Louis, an academic medical center located in St. Louis, Missouri PARTICIPANTS: PGY1 general surgery residents during academic year 2019-2020 (na?=a?13) and 2020-2021 (na?=a?14). RESULTS: In both years, interns demonstrated significant increases in confidence pre- and post-summer school in all domains (p <0.01). This was no different between the in-person and the virtual administration of the bootcamp (p 0.76). In both virtual and in-person curricula, interns demonstrated increased knowledge as measured by multiple choice, boards-style question quizzes. There were no significant differences between virtual and in-person formats. In both formats, interns reported a preference for senior residents as teachers (81% v. 77%) and increased comfort in asking questions in senior resident-led vs. attending-led didactics (91% v 100%). CONCLUSION: Virtual senior-resident led intern educational sessions are equally as effective as in-person sessions for knowledge acquisition and improving confidence in intern-specific domains. In both virtual and in-person settings, interns prefer senior resident teachers to attendings. Virtual senior resident-led education is an effective and simple method for intern instruction, regardless of the format/approach.","output":"Maintaining Effective Senior Resident-Led Intern Education through Virtual Curricular Transition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID19 laid various adverse effects and made mark on domestic workers lives.

Endotracheal intubation was attempted using a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope with or without a 3D-printed ergonomic support grip. Primary outcomes were intubation time and overall success rate. Secondary outcomes were number of unsuccessful attempts, first-attempt success rate, airway Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade, and difficulty score. In the easy airway scenario, intubation time, and the overall success rate were similar between two group. CL grade and ease-of-use scores were significantly better for those using the ergonomic support grip (P < 0.05).

This introduction to the special issue on Trauma and Repair in the Museum, which aims to reintroduce psychoanalytic perspectives in these debates, outlines the issues around reparation that surround the modern museum due to the traumatic legacies of coloniality. Timothy P. Browns notion of how the trauma of displacement and dissociation effects both objects and communities is key to our consideration of the museum as symptomatic of trauma, as is Cathy Caruths reading of history as trauma. Referring to several artists practices, such as Lisa Reihana, Erika Tan, and especially Kader Attias concept of repair, as well as a number of museological approaches to restitution, we expand on the complexities of ongoing coloniality and its implication with museums as institutions, practices of collection and display, and highly charged psychoactive spaces. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwicks rereading of Melanie Kleins notion of reparation allows us to posit a form of decolonial repair that involves the assembling of damaged part-objects into something like a whole [but] not necessarily like any preexisting whole (2003, p. 128, original emphasis). This approach enables a reckoning with trauma and its legacies that keeps them visible without ruling out processes of reparation. We follow our outline of trauma and repair in the museum with summaries of our contributors articles, which expose and unpack the mutual implication of collections, institutions and displays with patriarchy, colonialism and racial capitalism through the critical discourse of contestation, while also acknowledging the potential of museums to overcome their traumatic origins.","output":"Trauma and repair in the museum: an introduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim We focused on the preparation and activities of clinics for spectators and athletes in the Izu Velodrome in Shizuoka Prefecture, which was managed by the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOC).

In this work, we consider non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives in which the items are linearly ordered and the positives are consecutive in that order. We present two contributions here. The first is the direct use of a binary code to construct measurement matrices compared to the use of Gray code in the state-of-the-art work, which is a rearrangement of the binary code, when the maximum number of consecutive positives is known. This leads to a reduction in decoding time in practice. The second one is efficient designs to identify positives when the number of consecutive positives is known. To the best of our knowledge, this setting has not been surveyed yet. Our simulations verify the efficiency of our proposed designs. In particular, it only requires up to $300$ tests to identify up to $100$ positives in a set of $2^{32} \\\\approx 4.3\\\\mathrm{B}$ items in less than $300$ nanoseconds.

We have introduced several new measures in our laboratory to accommodate the collection and testing of samples for COVID-19 from both within the hospital and external screening sites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 patients of the 156 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between March 27, 2020 and March 31, 2020 at our quaternary care academic medical center and who underwent CT imaging within 1 week of admission were included in this retrospective study. Demographics and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Two thoracic radiologists independently categorized each CT study on the basis of RSNA/STR/ACR consensus guidelines. Disagreement in categorization was resolved by consensus discussion with a third thoracic radiologist. RESULTS: At the time of imaging, 16 patients (73%) were suspected of COVID-19, and 6 patients (27%) were not. Common symptoms at presentation were fever (73%), cough (77%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (59%). An overall 63% of suspected COVID-19 patients exhibited shortness of breath, whereas 0 unsuspected COVID-19 patients did (P=0.02). On the basis of the RSNA consensus guidelines, 68%, 18%, 9%, and 5% of studies were categorized as \\"typical appearance,\\" \\"indeterminate appearance,\\" \\"atypical appearance,\\" and \\"negative for pneumonia,\\" respectively.

SalivaDirect is a nucleic acid extraction-free method for detecting SARS-CoV2 in saliva specimens. Studies evaluating the concordance of gold standard NPS and newly developed SalivaDirect protocols are limited. The aim of our study was to to assess SalivaDirect as an alternative method for COVID-19 testing. Methods: Matching NPS and saliva samples were analysed from a cohort of symptomatic (n=127) and asymptomatic (n=181) participants recruited from hospital and university settings, respectively. RNA was extracted from NPS while saliva samples were subjected to the SalivaDirect protocol before RT-qPCR analysis. The presence of SARS-Cov-2 was assessed using RdRP and N1 gene targets in NPS and saliva, respectively. Results: Overall we observed 94.3% sensitivity (95% CI 87.2-97.5%), and 95.9% specificity (95% CI 92.4-97.8%) in saliva when compared to matching NPS samples. Analysis of concordance demonstrated 95.5% accuracy overall for the saliva test relative to NPS, and a very high level of agreement ( coefficient = 0.889, 95% CI 0.833-0.946) between the two sets of specimens. Fourteen of 308 samples were discordant, all from symptomatic patients. Ct values were >30 in 13/14 and >35 in 6/14 samples. No significant difference was found in the Ct values of matching NPS and saliva sample ( p=0.860). A highly significant correlation (r = 0.475, p<0.0001) was also found between the Ct values of the concordant positive saliva and NPS specimens. Conclusions: Use of saliva processed according to the SalivaDirect protocol represents a valid method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Accurate and less invasive saliva screening is an attractive alternative to current testing methods based on NPS and would afford greater capacity to test asymptomatic populations especially in the context of frequent testing.","output":"Concordance between PCR-based extraction-free saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel  coronavirus that is the etiological agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that at the time of writing (June 16, 2020) has infected almost 6 million people with some 450,000 deaths. These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 80%) cases of COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVID-19 infection appears to occur globally between 0.1 and 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) represent the primary causes of lethality during COVID-19 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the coagulation system including marked elevation of D-dimer that correlate negatively with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the development of DIC provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a secondary anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for coagulopathy during the course of COVID-19 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. METHODS: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This exploratory study is part of a larger mixed methods survey project, reporting the qualitative data from an on-line survey of clinical staff working at one acute hospital between April 16th and May 13th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to five free-text questions were analysed using inductive content analysis. 321 medical, nursing, allied health and non-clinical staff responded to the survey. Respondents reported anxiety, fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic, from the perspectives of work, home, family and community. They reported feeling confused by inconsistent messages received from government, hospital executive, managers and media. Seven themes were identified: (i) worrying about patient care, (ii) changed working conditions, (iii) working in the changed hospital environment, (iv) impact of the pandemic, (v) personal isolation and uncertainty, (vi) leadership and management and (vii) additional support needed for staff. Despite the pandemic being comparatively well-controlled in Australia, all disciplines reported a high degree of anticipatory anxiety. Staff working in healthcare require both managerial and psychological support to minimise anxiety and promote well-being and resilience in order to deal with the health crisis.

The aim of this study was to characterise CRFK cells via immunofluorescence, enzyme cytochemistry, western blotting, RT-qPCR for S100A4 and comparison to primary feline proximal tubular epithelial cells (FPTEC) and feline cortical fibroblasts (FCF). CRFK cells were of fusiform morphology and appeared similar to FCF. CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging. This finding may have potential implications for future research utilising this cell line.","output":"Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests in most cases with respiratory symptoms, other presentations can occur. Direct damage to the cardiovascular system has been reported and recently, acute myocardial injury has been identified as a risk factor for mortality. Transthoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive tool that allows the detection of myocardial damage with validated markers (left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain). Herein, we present the echocardiographic findings in four patients with COVID-19. All cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome (100%). Three out of four had elevated levels of creatine kinase and creatine kinase myocardial band. One case had ventricular concentric remodeling (25%). All cases (100%) had altered ventricular function: two had a reduced ejection fraction (50%) and, of those available for global longitudinal strain analysis, all had abnormal global longitudinal strain (100%). One case was found to have a tricuspid vegetation of 12  10 mm with no other manifestation of endocarditis. All of our cases had left ventricular dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography. One of our patients had a vegetation in the tricuspid valve. Two of our cases had a reduced ejection fraction. The importance of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 has recently been established. A recent study found it to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with this disease. Information regarding echocardiographic characteristics of this population is scarce.

OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the 6-month respiratory outcomes and exercise capacity of COVID-19 acute respiratory failure (ARF) patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during the first wave of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: retrospective observational study. PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients with ARF. INTERVENTIONS: CPAP during hospitalization and 6-month follow-up. MAIN MEASURES: frailty assessment through frailty index (FI), pO2/FiO2 during hospitalization and at follow-up, respiratory parameters, 6-min walking test (6MWT) and the modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) and Borg scale at follow-up. KEY RESULTS: more than half of the patients had no dyspnoea according to the mMRC scale. Lower in-hospital pO2/FiO2 correlated with higher BORG scale levels after 6MWT (&#961; 0.27; p 0.04) at follow up visit. FI was positively correlated with length of hospitalization (&#961; 0.3; p 0.03) and negatively with the 6MWT walked distance (&#961; -0.36; p 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: robust and frail patients with COVID-19 ARF treated with NIV outside the intensive care unit setting had good respiratory parameters and exercise capacity at 6-month follow-up, although more severe patients had slightly poorer respiratory performance compared to patients with higher PaO2/FiO2 and lower FI.

These patients travelled with a group of 29 other Dutch travellers. We conducted an epidemiological assessment of the travel group to identify likely source(s) of infection and presence of potential risk factors. METHODS: All travellers, including the two cases, completed a questionnaire focussing on potential human, animal and food exposures to MERS-CoV. The questionnaire was modified from the WHO MERS-CoV questionnaire, taking into account the specific route and activities of the travel group. RESULTS: Twelve non-cases drank unpasteurized camel milk and had contact with camels. Most travellers, including one of the two patients (Case 1), visited local markets, where six of them consumed fruits. Two travellers, including Case 1, were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in Medina. Four travellers, including Case 1, visited two hospitals in Mecca. All travellers had been in contact with Case 1 while he was sick, with initially non-respiratory complaints. The cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiological study revealed the complexity of MERS-CoV outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposures to MERS-CoV reported such as healthcare visits, camel exposure, and exposure to untreated food products. Exposure to MERS-CoV during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for Case 1 but not for Case 2. For Case 2, the most likely source could not be determined. Exposure to MERS-CoV via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two Dutch cases. Furthermore, exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out. More comprehensive research into sources of infection in the Arabian Peninsula is needed to strengthen and specify the prevention of MERS-CoV infections.","output":"Travel-related MERS-CoV cases: an assessment of exposures and risk factors in a group of Dutch travellers returning from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, May 2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which caused by SARS-COV-2 has spread globally.

There is also no information as to whether the expression of these mediators is altered in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE) or preterm birth (PTB). This is important since the expression of decidual and placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across gestation may impact susceptibility of pregnancies to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Objectives To investigate the expression pattern of specific SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in the placenta across human pregnancy and in paired samples of decidua and placenta in pregnancies complicated by PTB or PE compared to term, uncomplicated pregnancies. Study Design Two separate cohorts of patients, totalling 87 pregnancies were included. The first cohort comprised of placentae from first (7-9 weeks), second (16-18 weeks), third-trimester preterm (26-31 weeks) and third-trimester term (38-41 weeks) pregnancies (n=5/group), whereas, the second independent cohort, included matched decidua and placentae from pregnancies from term, uncomplicated pregnancies (37-41 weeks; n=14) as well as pregnancies complicated by PTB (26-37 weeks, n=11) or PE (25-37 weeks n=42). Samples were subjected to qPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS)/RNAseq for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression quantification, respectively. Results In the first cohort, the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 exhibited a gestational-age dependent expression profile, i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA was higher (p<0.05) in the first trimester compared to second trimester, PTB and term placentae (p<0.05) and exhibited a negative correlation with gestational age (p<0.05). In the second cohort, RNAseq demonstrated very low/undetectable expression levels of ACE2 in PTB, PE and term decidua and in placentae from late gestation. In contrast, TMPRSS2 was expressed in both decidual and placental samples but did not change in pregnancies complicated by either PTB or PE. Conclusions The increased expression of these SARS-CoV-2 cell entry associated genes in the placenta during the first trimester compared to later stages of pregnancy suggest the possibility of differential susceptibility to placental entry to SARS-CoV-2 across pregnancy. Even though there is some evidence of increased rates of PTB associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found no increase in mRNA expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the maternal-fetal interface.","output":"Expression of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in the placenta across gestation and at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnancies complicated by preterm birth or preeclampsia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The limited data on LGBTQ+ farmers demonstrate that this population lacks adequate healthcare access and faces stigma in agricultural communities.

She had been admitted to the hospital because of incomplete obstructive ileus. Ultrasound and computed tomography were carried out, which revealed an intussusception of the small bowel. This pathogenic situation was treated by single-incision laparoscopic surgery. Her pathology report revealed a benign, hamartomatous excised polyp of the Peutz-Jeghers type.

The epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations were analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven clusters of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao City between January 29, and February 23, 2020, involving 44 confirmed cases, which accounted for 73.33% of all confirmed cases. From January 19 to February 2, 2020, the cases mainly concentrated in the district that had many designated hospitals. Patients aged 20-59 y old accounted for the largest proportion (68.18%) of cases; the male-to-female sex ratio was 0.52:1. Three cases were infected from exposure to confirmed cases. The average incubation period was 6.28 d. The median number of cases per cluster was 4, and the median duration time was 6 d. The median cumulative number of exposed persons was 53.

However, the extent of these impairments is still unclear and social cognition is excluded from the cognitive domains considered in the current criteria for PD mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aims to analyze emotion recognition, affective and cognitive theory of mind in early PD patients classified according to Level II MCI criteria, and to evaluate the prevalence of socio-cognitive deficits in this sample. METHODS: We enrolled 45 participants with PD, classified as cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 32) or MCI (n = 13) based on a standard neuropsychological assessment. Social cognitive skills were evaluated through validated tests for emotion recognition (i.e., Ekman 60-faces test, Ek60 Test) and mental states attribution (Story-based Empathy Task, SET) and compared to a group of 45 healthy controls (HC). Between-group differences in social tasks were performed, as well as correlation analyses to assess the relationship between social, cognitive, and clinical variables. Finally, the number of patients with social cognitive impairments in both MCI and CU subgroups was computed based on Italian normative data. RESULTS: Statistical comparison revealed significant differences among groups in the Ek60 test, with MCI obtaining significantly lower scores than HC and CU, especially for negative emotions. Significant differences were detected also in the SET, with lower performance in emotion and intention attribution for both PD groups compared to HC. A significant correlation emerged between the Ek60 test and emotion attribution. Nine patients showed poor performance at social tasks, five of them being classified as PD-CU. DISCUSSION: Parkinsons disease cognitive profile was characterized by emotion recognition and attribution deficits. These results, as well as the detection of CU patients with isolated socio-cognitive impairments, underline the importance of assessing social cognition in PD as a possible early marker of cognitive decline.","output":"Deficits in Emotion Recognition and Theory of Mind in Parkinsons Disease Patients With and Without Cognitive Impairments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory disease that has spread widely throughout the world.

In limited-resource settings such as Somalia, providing healthcare workers with adequate information on COVID-19 is crucial to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study assessed the knowledge of, preparedness for, and perceptions toward COVID-19 prevention and treatment among Somali healthcare workers. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was completed by 364 Somali healthcare workers in summer of 2020 utilizing a convenience sampling method. RESULTS: Participants most accessed sources of COVID-19 information were from social media (64.8%), official government and international health organization websites (51.1%,), and traditional media sources such as radio, TV, and newspapers (48.1%). A majority of participants demonstrated strong knowledge of treatment of COVID-19, the severity of COVID-19, and the possible outcomes of COVID-19, but only 5 out of 10 symptoms listed were correctly identified by more than 75% of participants. Although participants indicated seeing a median number of 10 patients per week with COVID-19 related symptoms, access to essential medical resources, such as N95 masks (30.2%), facial protective shields (24.5%), and disposable gowns (21.4%), were limited. Moreover, 31.3% agreed that Somalia was in a good position to contain an emerging outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, 40.4% of participants agreed that the Somali governments response to the pandemic was sufficient to protect Somali healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the need to equip Somali healthcare providers with more information, personal protective equipment, and treatment resources such that they can safely and adequately care for COVID-19 patients and contain the spread of the virus.

Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, we describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a Connections Plan to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during social distancing restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a Safety Plan for suicide risk.

Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with participants recruited from Italy and Spain by an international consortium group. METHODS: Summary GWAS statistics for 1610 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and 2205 controls were downloaded. In the current study, we analyzed the summary statistics with the information of loci and p-values for 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using gene ontology analysis to determine the top biological processes implicated in respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We considered the top 708 SNPs, using a p-value cutoff of 5  10- 5, which were mapped to the nearest genes, leading to 144 unique genes. The list of genes was input into a curated database to conduct gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. The top ranked biological processes were wound healing, epithelial structure maintenance, muscle system processes, and cardiac-relevant biological processes with a false discovery rate < 0.05. In the PPI analysis, the largest connected network consisted of 8 genes. Through a literature search, 7 out of the 8 gene products were found to be implicated in both pulmonary and cardiac diseases.

The purpose of this prospective study was to report incidence and transmission regarding SARS-CoV-2, of professional golfers competing on the PGA European Tour across 23 events in 11 countries. METHODS: Daily symptom and temperature checks and weekly reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) screening were performed to determine potential carriage of SARS-CoV-2. Onset and type of symptomology were analysed. Gene expression and cycle thresholds (Cts) were reviewed for all positive cases. Repeat PCR testing was performed on all positive players. RT-PCR analysis included human housekeeping genes and various RNA genes specific for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 2900 RT-PCR tests performed on 195 professional golfers competing on the European Tour. Four players tested positive on-site during the study period (0.14% of tests; positive results were declared with Ct <40). Two positive tests were returned as part of routine protocols, while two reported a history of close contact with an individual who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were isolated and target tested. All were asymptomatic at time of testing, with three developing symptoms subsequently. None required hospital admission. There was no transmission from player to player. CONCLUSION: Golf is an outdoor sport where social distancing is possible, meaning risks can be low if guidance is followed by participants. Risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be mitigated by highly accurate RT-PCR testing of participants and by setting up a safe bubble that includes testing players and support staff, as well as all persons coming into contact with them during the course of the tournament, for example, drivers and hotel staff. This report can also provide reassurance for participants and policy makers regarding community golf, which can be encouraged for the health benefits it provides, in a relatively low-risk environment, with minimal risk of transmission by observing sensible viral hygiene protocols.","output":"Assessing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in international professional golf"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1/TNK2) has a significant role in cell endocytosis, survival, proliferation, and migration.

The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-Dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients although they had never been exposed to heparin.

Initial hospitalisation strives to minimise multisystem organ failure and of those that survive, individuals can present with profound rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this case series is to describe occupational therapy (OT) and special technology considerations for three male Veteran patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This is a descriptive case series using a retrospective electronic health record review at a Veterans Administration hospital. The case series includes three male Veterans with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ages 69-78) who were referred to OT. The cases were selected to demonstrate the novel use of technology and strategies to reduce the risk of transmission. In two of three of our cases, we describe acute rehabilitation with a focus on activity tolerance, participation in occupations, and discharge planning. In all cases, we measured vital signs and activity tolerance as primary outcomes. Results and conclusions: The findings suggest that outcome measures focussing on activity tolerance to maintain stable vital signs during the recovery phase is central to the progression of activities. We observed in our cases that the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) model can guide practice and complement the medical model in management of these patients. We utilised technology to engage family members in the rehabilitation care and minimise exposure risks. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Acute occupational therapy for rehabilitation early in the recovery of Cornavirus-2019 can be guided by the Person-Occupation-Environment-Performance model as seen in this case series of three Veteran patients.

This systematic review aimed to determine whether providing food to patients in primary care can help to reduce body weight. METHODS: Four databases were searched for studies that aimed to elicit weight loss by directly providing foodstuffs and/or supplements to patients in primary care settings. Interventions with adults of any gender or race were included. Interventions that involved other components such as exercise classes or education sessions were excluded. The methodological quality of each study was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. RESULTS: Four heterogeneous studies met the eligibility criteria, representing 476 adults. Two studies used meal-replacement products but differed in length and intensity, another study provided green tea and vitamin E supplementation, and the final study provided vouchers for use at a farmers market hosted at a primary care clinic. Interventions ranged in length from 4 to 13 weeks. Three of the four studies observed weight loss in some form and all studies observed at least one other improvement in a health outcome such as waist circumference, blood pressure or fasting insulin levels.

Furthermore, many viruses interact with cellular membrane compartments during their replication and often induce cytoplasmic membrane structures, in which genome replication and assembly occurs. Recent studies revealed details of membrane interaction, membrane bending, fission, and fusion for a number of viruses and unraveled the lipid composition of raft-dependent and -independent viruses.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The research involves 17 men (Italians and foreigners) detained in a Lombardy prison from 1 March to 4 May 2020, corresponding to the lockdown phase in Italy. The qualitative content analysis (CA) of 27 posts, written by participants during that period and published on the blog LObl, were analysed. The analysis allowed the identification of topics and subtopics that are related to two major categories of content: cognitions and emotional connotations about the COVID-19 lockdown in prison. FINDINGS: Analysis showed that blog post content was predominately negative in terms of emotional connotations. The most frequent coded negative emotional connotations were: missing, worry, psychological pain and fear, whilst the most frequent coded positive emotional connotations were: hope and gratitude for the support they received from prison workers. The rest of the blog content was coded as cognitions. Cognitions were coded as descriptions of lockdown effect on detention; prison during the COVID-19 emergency; the pandemic situation in general; and comparison between inside and outside prison.

The percentage of stroma was visually assessed on hematoxylin-eosin stained slides. The cases of tumor-stroma ratio more than 50% were categorized as tumor-stroma ratio high, and those less than 50% and below were categorized as tumor-stroma ratio low. RESULTS Tumor-stroma ratio-high tumors had shorter overall survival (p=0.002). Disease-free survival tended to be shorter in tumor-stroma ratio-high tumors (p=0.082) compared with tumor-stroma ratio-low tumors. Tumor-stroma ratio was an independent prognostic parameter for the total group of patients (p=0.003) and also axillary lymph node metastasis and tumor-stroma ratio was statistically associated (p=0.004).

Of these, mutations in the spike (S) protein can alter the properties of the virus, particularly transmissibility and antigenicity. However, it is difficult to detect antigenic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by immunoassay. Here, we developed an ACE2-based biosensor designed to detect both SARS-CoV-2 S1 mutations and neutralizing antibodies. In binding mode, the biosensor works by detecting binding of the S protein to an immobilized ACE2 receptor. The ACE2-based biosensor was able to detect S1 proteins of the alpha (500 pg/mL) and beta variants (10 ng/mL), as well as wild-type S1 (10 ng/mL), of SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor distinguished wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S1 from the S1 alpha and beta variants via color differences. In addition, a slight modification to the protocol enabled the ACE2-based biosensor to operate in blocking mode to detect neutralizing antibodies in serum samples from COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the ACE2-based biosensor is a versatile test for detecting wild-type S1, S1 mutants, and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This approach to targeting both the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells and the subsequent adaptive immune response will facilitate the development of various biosensors against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Versatile role of ACE2-based biosensors for detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis is an immune\\\\mediated disease with an environmental component.

Recently, SUP has been associated with an increased incidence of hospital-acquired infections, community-acquired pneumonia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of performing a randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of withholding SUP in infants with congenital heart disease admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. METHODS: A single center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled pilot feasibility trial will be performed in infants with CHD admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit and anticipated to require respiratory support for > 24 h. Patients will be randomized to receive a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) or placebo until they are discontinued from respiratory support. Randomization will be performed within 2 strata defined by admission type (medical or surgical) and age (neonate, age < 30 days, or infant, 1 month to 1 year). Allocation will be a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks to ensure balanced allocations across the two treatment groups within each stratum. The primary outcomes include feasibility of screening, consent, timely allocation of study drug, and protocol adherence. The primary safety outcome is the rate of clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The secondary outcomes are the difference in the relative and absolute abundance of the gut microbiota and functional microbial profiles between the two study groups. We plan to enroll 100 patients in this pilot study. DISCUSSION: Routine use of SUP to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in infants is controversial due to a low incidence of bleeding events and concern for adverse effects. The role of SUP in infants with CHD has not been examined, and there is equipoise on the risks and benefits of withholding this therapy. In addition, this therapy has been discontinued in other neonatal populations due to the concern for hospital-acquired infections and necrotizing enterocolitis. Furthermore, exploring changes to the microbiome after exposure to SUP may highlight the mechanisms by which SUP impacts potential microbial dysbiosis of the gut and its association with hospital-acquired infections. Assessment of the feasibility of a trial of withholding SUP in critically ill infants with CHD will facilitate planning of a larger multicenter trial of safety and efficacy of SUP in this vulnerable population.

Here, we report the increase of specificity of isothermal amplification in the presence of poly(aspartic) acids (pAsp). We hypothesized that side reactions occur due to the binding of the phosphate backbone of synthesized DNA strands with surface amino groups of the polymerase, and weakly acidic polyelectrolytes could shield polymerase molecules from DNA and thereby inhibit nonspecific amplification. Suppression of nonspecific polymerase activity by pAsp was studied on multimerization as a model side reaction. It was found that a low concentration of pAsp (0.01%) provides successful amplification of specific DNA targets. The inhibitory effect of pAsp is due to its polymeric structure since aspartic acid did affect neither specific nor nonspecific amplification. Strongly acidic polyelectrolyte heparin does not possess the same selectivity since it suppresses any DNA synthesis. The applicability of pAsp to prevent nonspecific reactions and reliable detection of the specific target has been demonstrated on the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus using Loop-mediated isothermal amplification.","output":"INHIBITION OF NONSPECIFIC POLYMERASE ACTIVITY USING POLY(ASPARTIC) ACID AS A MODEL ANIONIC POLYELECTROLYTE."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through globalization and financial market liberalization, the opening up of markets has increased cross-border investments as investors search for higher risk-adjusted returns. This ability to invest internationally has raised the attention given to emerging markets that offer higher risk-adjusted returns relative to developed markets.

To fill this gap, this study comparatively examined the nature of stock return volatility in developed G7 and emerging BRICS markets. Broad market index data and GARCH models over the period 2003:01C2020:08 were employed. The study found evidence of volatility persistence, asymmetry, mean reversion and weak evidence of a risk premium in both emerging and developed markets. There was also evidence of significant differences in the nature of volatility within the two sets of markets.

However, little is known about the incidence and impact of AKI occurring in the community or early in the hospital admission. The traditional Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition can fail to identify patients for whom hospitalisation coincides with recovery of AKI as manifested by a decrease in serum creatinine (sCr). We hypothesised that an extended KDIGO (eKDIGO) definition, adapted from the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) 0by25 studies, would identify more cases of AKI in patients with COVID-19 and that these may correspond to community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) with similarly poor outcomes as previously reported in this population. Methods and findings All individuals recruited using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)CWorld Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) and admitted to 1,609 hospitals in 54 countries with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from February 15, 2020 to February 1, 2021 were included in the study. Data were collected and analysed for the duration of a patients admission. Incidence, staging, and timing of AKI were evaluated using a traditional and eKDIGO definition, which incorporated a commensurate decrease in sCr. Patients within eKDIGO diagnosed with AKI by a decrease in sCr were labelled as deKDIGO. Clinical characteristics and outcomesintensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital deathwere compared for all 3 groups of patients. The relationship between eKDIGO AKI and in-hospital death was assessed using survival curves and logistic regression, adjusting for disease severity and AKI susceptibility. A total of 75,670 patients were included in the final analysis cohort. Median length of admission was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7, 20). There were twice as many patients with AKI identified by eKDIGO than KDIGO (31.7% versus 16.8%). Those in the eKDIGO group had a greater proportion of stage 1 AKI (58% versus 36% in KDIGO patients). Peak AKI occurred early in the admission more frequently among eKDIGO than KDIGO patients. Compared to those without AKI, patients in the eKDIGO group had worse renal function on admission, more in-hospital complications, higher rates of ICU admission (54% versus 23%) invasive ventilation (45% versus 15%), and increased mortality (38% versus 19%). Patients in the eKDIGO group had a higher risk of in-hospital death than those without AKI (adjusted odds ratio: 1.78, 95% confidence interval: 1.71 to 1.80, p-value < 0.001). Mortality and rate of ICU admission were lower among deKDIGO than KDIGO patients (25% versus 50% death and 35% versus 70% ICU admission) but significantly higher when compared to patients with no AKI (25% versus 19% death and 35% versus 23% ICU admission) (all p-values <5  10?5). Limitations include ad hoc sCr sampling, exclusion of patients with less than two sCr measurements, and limited availability of sCr measurements prior to initiation of acute dialysis. Conclusions An extended KDIGO definition of AKI resulted in a significantly higher detection rate in this population. These additional cases of AKI occurred early in the hospital admission and were associated with worse outcomes compared to patients without AKI.","output":"Use of an extended KDIGO definition to diagnose acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19: A multinational study using the ISARICCWHO clinical characterisation protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic causes upheaval in New York City (NYC), 1 consequence is the accessibility of sexual health services The NYC STD Prevention Training Center at Columbia University administered an online provider survey to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the availability of sexual health care services regionally","output":"PAIN MANAGEMENT AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMICThe Potential Impact and Availability of Sexual Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide in 2020, there is a growing concern about the impact of the pandemic on mental health.

As COVID-19 has ravaged the world, maintaining minimum medical staffing requirements and proper social distancing have become major topics of interest. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying the unisurgeon approach in single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery aided by a robotic camera holder. METHODS: Operative time, blood loss, setup time, postoperative hospital stays, and the number of participating surgeons in single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resections were gathered for investigation after the introduction of the ENDOFIX(exo) robotic endoscope holder system. In this cohort, we collected 213 patients who underwent single port video thoracoscope surgery, including 57 patients underwent robotic endoscope arm assisted surgery and case-matched 52 patients in the robotic armCassisted group with patients in the human-assisted group through propensity scoreCmatched analysis. RESULTS: In wedge resection, a single surgeon was able to completely operate on all lobes of target lesions. However, for anatomical resections, namely segmentectomy, the success rate was 95%, and for lobectomy, the success rate was only 64%. No significant differences between setup times, blood loss, or operative times between the two groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS: When an experienced uniport surgeon is assisted by a robotic endoscope holder, wedge resection is the most suitable procedure to be performed through unisurgeon single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without increasing setup time, operative time, or short-term complications. Verification of the techniques applicability for use in anatomic resections requires further investigation.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to immunofluorescence for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression. Fluorescent-labeled tissue slides were imaged on a quantitative pathology scope with various zoom levels allowing for qualitative and quantitative interpretation. Tissue from four COVID-19 positive autopsy cases and a live seroconverted patient was imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: H&E histomorphology showed three of the six COVID-19 biopsies had normal spermatogenesis while the remaining three had impaired spermatogenesis. TEM showed the COVID-19 virus in testis tissue of one COVID-19 positive autopsy case and the live biopsy, H&E stain on the same autopsy case demonstrated interstitial macrophage and leukocyte infiltration. Immunofluorescent stained slides from six COVID-19 positive men demonstrated a direct association between increased quantitative ACE-2 levels and impairment of spermatogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The novel COVID-19 has an affinity for ACE-2 receptors. Since ACE-2 receptor expression is high in the testes, we hypothesized that COVID-19 is prevalent in testes tissue of infected patients.

Escape rooms can be a novel educational strategy for learning about and empathizing with SMI, thus reducing stigma among health care students. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of the Without Memories escape room on nursing students stigma against SMI. METHODS: A pre- and postintervention study was conducted with a control group and an experimental group. A total of 306 students from 2 Andalusian universities participated in the study. Data were collected through a pre-post study questionnaire, consisting of an adapted version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire and a questionnaire on motivation for cooperative playful learning strategies. The control group carried out an escape room scenario without sensitizing content, whereas the experimental group carried out an escape room scenario on SMI, with both escape rooms being carried out in a 1-hour session of subjects related to mental health. To answer the research questions, a 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, a linear regression, and a 2-way analysis of variance were performed. RESULTS: After the intervention, a significant reduction (P<.001) was observed in the experimental group in stigmatizing attitudes compared with the control group, in which no statistically significant changes (P>.05) were observed. In contrast, the linear regression (t(195)=?22.15; P<.001) showed that there was an inverse relationship between flow and the level of reduced stigma. When controlling for having or not having a close relative, the intervention was also shown to be effective (P<.001) in reducing the stigma displayed, both for people with affected and unaffected relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Without Memories escape room can be used as an effective tool to educate and raise awareness about stigmatizing attitudes toward SMI in university students studying health care. Future testing of the effectiveness of educational escape rooms should be designed with new programs through playful strategies of longer duration to evaluate whether they can achieve a greater impact on motivation, acquisition of knowledge, and awareness.

As age is the most significant risk factor for cancer, and with the aging of the population, there is a vast increase in the number of older cancer patients. BACKGROUND: The cases highlight the unique challenges in geriatric oncology: disease goals may differ; treatment toxicities are higher; the extensive use of prescription medication increases the chances of harmful drug-drug interactions; finally, older adults have unique psychosocial needs. Cancer treatment in older adults poses a risk of under-treatment as well as a risk for over-treatment. DISCUSSION: 'Onco-geriatrics' is a field in geriatrics in which a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is performed. The CGA focuses on specific therapeutic challenges of the older patient, on frailty and on toxicity-risk assessment. In geriatric oncology, a field in oncology aimed at providing care to older cancer adults, the most important first step is to define treatment intent - cure or palliation. Achievement of cure usually mandates a multi-disciplinary aggressive approach. Compromising any component of the treatment may hamper its success rate, yet administering the full therapeutic plan may be too toxic. Thus, each older patient being considered for definitive treatment must be discussed in a multi-disciplinary tumor board, and preferably assessed by a dedicated geriatrician prior to decision-making. In cases in which treatment intent is palliative - i.e. prolongation of survival and/or improvement in quality of life, we propose the following scheme - accurate definition of the palliative goal; adaptation of the therapeutic regime to the patient's geriatric condition; frequent clinical monitoring and flexibility in administration; continued treatment as long as palliative benefit is achieved, and early cessation in its absence. Such a scheme maintains the principal of 'primum non nocere' while facilitating the palliative benefit for older adults.","output":"[geriatric Oncology - Cancer Treatment in Older Adults and Oldest-old]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review As telemedicine gains popularity among providers and patients alike, it is important to ensure the standards of care remain equivalent between the in-person and virtual settings.

Addressing the community-specific social determinants of health (SDOH) that correlate with spread of SARS-CoV-2 provides an opportunity for targeted public health intervention to promote greater resilience to viral respiratory infections. METHODS: Our work combined publicly available COVID-19 statistics with county-level SDOH information. Machine learning models were trained to predict COVID-19 case growth and understand the social, physical and environmental risk factors associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tennessee and Georgia counties. Model accuracy was assessed comparing predicted case counts to actual positive case counts in each county. RESULTS: The predictive models achieved a mean R(2) of 0.998 in both states with accuracy above 90% for all time points examined. Using these models, we tracked the importance of SDOH data features over time to uncover the specific racial demographic characteristics strongly associated with COVID-19 incidence in Tennessee and Georgia counties. Our results point to dynamic racial trends in both states over time and varying, localized patterns of risk among counties within the same state. For example, we find that African American and Asian racial demographics present comparable, and contrasting, patterns of risk depending on locality. CONCLUSION: The dichotomy of demographic trends presented here emphasizes the importance of understanding the unique factors that influence COVID-19 incidence. Identifying these specific risk factors tied to COVID-19 case growth can help stakeholders target regional interventions to mitigate the burden of future outbreaks.","output":"Predictive modeling of COVID-19 case growth highlights evolving racial and ethnic risk factors in Tennessee and Georgia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has came in existence in late December 2019 at Wuhan, China.

The impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of chronic disease treatment is severe in terms of poorer health outcomes and increased health care costs (2). Information regarding covid-19 on adherence behavior in Latin-American is scarce. Objectives: The aim of this study is to describe impact of COVID-19 outbreak on adherence behavior in Latin-American population with rheumatic diseases. Methods: We carried out a descriptive, cross-sectional, self-report study through voluntary telephonic survey, to determine adherence behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, from September 9th, 2020 to November 19th, 2020, for consecutive patients of the outpatient rheumatology clinic in the Hospital Universitario (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico), which serves a resource limited population that lack access to health insurance, from five neighboring states. A 17-items survey was designed. Baseline demographics that were collected included age, sex, rheumatologic diagnosis, current medications and patient perception of disease control. Patients were asked if they continued follow-up care, last prescribed therapy and reasons. Also, the survey assessed whether patients had any issues with medication supply and where they were obtaining information about covid-19 (could choose as many options as applicable). Transferred to SPSS for analysis for descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 150 patients were called, the survey response rate was 54.6% (n=82), with a mean completion time of 10 minutes. The mean +/-SD age of the participants was 52 +/-15.9 years, and 95% were female. The most common self-reported diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13.4%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (13.4%) [Table 1]. Patient perception of disease control was primary good 37.8% and regular 35.4%. Patients that continued their follow-up with their rheumatologist (on the clinic face-to-face, electronically or telehealth) or in another clinic were 26.9%, the majority were nonadherent 73%. Persistence to treatment was 82.9%, the main reason to discontinue therapy was lack of prescriptions or medical advice 8.5% and overall 58.5% had trouble finding their medicine.

The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive. His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment. The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies. Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages. The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance. Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury. Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified.

This approach should serve as positive example for the planning and execution of clinical proteomics studies.","output":"Proteomic Biomarkers to Guide Stratification for Covid-19 Treatment: Exemplifying a Path Forward Toward Implementation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disaster-related deaths are of two types: direct and indirect. Preventable disaster-related deaths reported in the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) included a large number of indirect deaths. This study aimed to investigate the data on disaster-related deaths in the GEJE in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, and to clarify the scope of disaster-related deaths to help future disaster preparedness. A retrospective observational study was conducted using public data on disaster-related deaths from March 2011 to January 2021, available at Ishinomaki City Hall. Descriptive and Cox regression analyses were conducted. The most common direct cause of disaster-related deaths was respiratory diseases, which were more common among those aged less than three months and over 60 years. Suicide was common among those aged under 60 years, and the proportion increased more than six months after the disaster. The risk of death was significantly higher among those who needed nursing care than among those independent in daily living. The results indicate that measures should be taken for the elderly and those who need care from an early phase after the disaster. The analysis of data on disaster-related deaths in other affected municipalities may provide further evidence to help reduce disaster-related deaths.","output":"Analysis of Disaster-Related Deaths in the Great East Japan Earthquake: A Retrospective Observational Study Using Data from Ishinomaki City, Miyagi, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly stable and facile one-pot copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) coated with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) have been synthesized for selectively sensing deferasirox (DFX) in -thalassemia plasma. DFX is an important drug used for treating iron overloading in -thalassemia, but needs to be monitored due to certain toxicity. In this study, the PAH-Cu NCs showed highly stable fluorescence with emission wavelengths at 450 nm. The DFX specifically interacted with the copper nanocluster to turn off the fluorescence of the PAH-Cu NCs, and could be selectively quantified through the fluorescence quenching effect. The linear range of DFX in plasma analyzed by PAH-Cu NCs was 1.0C100.0 g/mL (r = 0.985). The relative standard deviation (RSD) and relative error (RE) were lower than 6.51% and 7.57%, respectively, showing excellent reproducibility of PAH-Cu NCs for sensing DFX in plasma. This method was also successfully applied for an analysis of three clinical plasma samples from -thalassemia patients taking DFX. The data presented high similarity with that obtained through a capillary electrophoresis method. According to the results, the PAH-Cu NCs could be used as a tool for clinically sensing DFX in human plasma for clinical surveys.","output":"Stable Luminescent Poly(Allylaminehydrochloride)-Templated Copper Nanoclusters for Selectively Turn-Off Sensing of Deferasirox in -Thalassemia Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies are important for immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and as therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

However, proper auscultation of these patients is difficult when medical workers wear personal protective equipment and when it is necessary to minimize contact with patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to design and develop a low-cost electronic stethoscope enabling ear-contactless auscultation and digital storage of data for further analysis. The clinical feasibility of our device was assessed in comparison to a standard electronic stethoscope. METHODS: We developed a prototype of the ear-contactless electronic stethoscope, called Auscul Pi, powered by Raspberry Pi and Python. Our device enables real-time capture of auscultation sounds with a microspeaker instead of an earpiece, and it can store data files for later analysis. We assessed the feasibility of using this stethoscope by detecting abnormal heart and respiratory sounds from 8 patients with heart failure or structural heart diseases and from 2 healthy volunteers and by comparing the results with those from a 3M Littmann electronic stethoscope. RESULTS: We were able to conveniently operate Auscul Pi and precisely record the patients auscultation sounds. Auscul Pi showed similar real-time recording and playback performance to the Littmann stethoscope. The phonocardiograms of data obtained with the two stethoscopes were consistent and could be aligned with the cardiac cycles of the corresponding electrocardiograms. Pearson correlation analysis of amplitude data from the two types of phonocardiograms showed that Auscul Pi was correlated with the Littmann stethoscope with coefficients of 0.3245-0.5570 for healthy participants (P<.001) and of 0.3449-0.5138 among 4 patients (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Auscul Pi can be used for auscultation in clinical practice by applying real-time ear-contactless playback followed by quantitative analysis. Auscul Pi may allow accurate auscultation when medical workers are wearing protective suits and have difficulties in examining patients with COVID-19.

While several other bus studies have been conducted, they were limited to clinical contact tracing, simulation, or partial characterization of aerosol transmission in the passenger areas with constraint conditions. When considering the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and other highly infectious airborne diseases, ground based public transportation systems are high-risk environments for airborne transmission particularly since social distancing of six feet is not practical on most buses. This study demonstrates that wearing of masks reduced the overall particle count released into the bus by an average of 50% or more depending on mask quality and reduced the dispersion distance by several feet. The study also demonstrates an 84.36% reduction in aerosol particles and an 80.28% reduction in the mean aerosol residence time for some test cases. We conducted 84 experimental runs using nebulized 10% sodium chloride and a mechanical exhalation simulator that resulted in 78.3 million data points and 124 miles of on-the-road testing. Our study not only captures the dispersion patterns using 28 networked particle counters, as well as quantifies the effectiveness of using on-board fans, opening of various windows, use of face coverings or masks, and the use of the transit bus HVAC system. This work also provides empirical observations of aerosol dispersion in a real-world turbulent air environment, which are remarkably different than many existing fluid dynamics simulations, and also offers substantial discussion on the implications for inclement weather conditions, driver safety, retrofit applications to improve bus air quality, and operational considerations for public transportation organizations.","output":"Reducing COVID-19 Airborne Transmission Risks on Public Transportation Buses: An Empirical Study on Aerosol Dispersion and Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging research identified physical inactivity and weight-related comorbidities as significant risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), reinforcing the importance of maintaining regular exercise during the pandemic.

Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.","output":"Neutrophils in respiratory syncytial virus infection: A target for asthma prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An efficient health care system combines maximum accessibility with high-quality treatments, as well as cost optimization of individual health care facilities throughout the entire system.

Notably, diabetes has been shown to be one of the strongest factors influencing healthcare outcome in COVID-19 infections. Though it has long been noted that lymphocytes upregulate insulin receptors following immune activation, until recently, this observation has received little attention. Here, we point out key findings implicating dysregulated insulin signalling in immune cells as a possible contributing factor in the immune pathology associated with diabetes. Mechanistically, insulin, by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, regulates various aspects of both myeloid cells and lymphocytes, such as cell survival, metabolic reprogramming and the polarization and differentiation of immune cells. PI3K signalling is also supressed by immune checkpoint proteins, suggesting that insulin signalling may antagonize peripheral tolerance. Remarkably, it has also recently been shown that, following insulin binding, the insulin receptor translocates to the nucleus where it plays a key role in regulating the transcription of various immune-related genes, including pathways involved in viral infections. Taken together, these observations suggest that dysregulated insulin signalling may directly contribute to a defective immune response during COVID-19 infections.","output":"Diabetes and susceptibility to infections: Implication for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine dietary patterns changes from preconception to during pregnancy and their associations with socio-demographic and lifestyle factors.

During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, there has been research considering the impact on medical healthcare professionals and the mental health needs of the general population. However, limited focus has been placed on mental health services or mental health staff providing care in the community and in hospitals. While nurses make up the largest section of the mental health workforce in the UK, the impact that this pandemic has had on their work has been largely ignored. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE? This paper provides a unique insight into the experiences and impact that the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has had on mental health nurses across a range of community and inpatient settings to understand what has changed in their work and the care they can and do provide during this crisis. This includes exploring how services have changed, the move to remote working, the impact of the protective equipment crisis on nurses and the difficult working conditions facing those in inpatient settings where there is minimal guidance provided. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE? By understanding the impact the pandemic has had on mental health nursing care, we can understand the gaps in guidance that exist, the challenges being faced and the impact the crisis has had on care for mental health service users. By doing so, we can plan for the ongoing nature of this pandemic and the aftermath that the crisis may leave for our service users and workforce alike. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: While evidence has emerged concerning the impact of COVID\\\\19 on the general population and the challenges facing health services, much less is known regarding how the pandemic has directly affected the delivery of mental health nursing care. AIM: This paper aimed to explore how COVID\\\\19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK. METHOD: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed\\\\methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated. DISCUSSION: Key themes within the data explore the following: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users. Targeted guidelines are required to support mental health nurses providing care and support during a pandemic to people in severe mental distress, often in unsuitable environments. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Service developments need to occur alongside tailored guidance and support for staff welfare supported by clear leadership. These findings identify areas requiring attention and investment to prepare for future crises and the consequences of the pandemic.","output":"How has COVID\\\\19 affected mental health nurses and the delivery of mental health nursing care in the UK?

Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity-Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%). Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was &#8804; 30C for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively.

Mechanical chest compression devices, transfer sheets, and strategic defibrillator placement were suggested as approaches to high-rise OHCA management. A shift to maximising on-scene treatment time, along with bundling novel prehospital interventions, could ameliorate some of these difficulties and improve clinical outcomes for patients.","output":"Cardiac Arrest Occurring in High-Rise Buildings: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indicated potential therapeutic benefits with high-dose dexamethasone (HDD) or tocilizumab (TCZ) plus standard care in moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods Patients admitted with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS with clinical worsening within 48 hours of standard care were randomly assigned to receive either HDD or TCZ plus standard care. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days. The main secondary outcomes were 28-day all-cause mortality and the incidence of adverse events. Our initial plan was to perform an interim analysis of the first 42 patients. Results VFDs were significantly lower in the HDD arm (median difference: 28 days; 95% confidence interval (CI): 19.35-36.65; Cohens d = 1.14;p < 0.001). We stopped the trial at the first interim analysis due to high 28-day mortality in the HDD arm (relative risk (RR) of death: 6.5; p = 0.007; NNT (harm) = 1.91). The incidence of secondary infections was also significantly high in the HDD arm (RR: 5.5; p = 0.015; NNT (harm) = 2.33). Conclusions In our study population, HDD was associated with a very high rate of mortality and adverse events.

This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible 'lockdown' effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and their outcomes. METHODS: Two separate cohorts of adult emergency general surgery inpatient admissions 30 days immediately before (February 16, 2020 to March 15, 2020), and after UK government advice (March 16, 2020 to April 15, 2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, severity of disease, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 per day (pa?<a?0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of acute kidney injury, and also were significantly more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade &#8805;3 complications (pa?=a?0.001), all cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, pa?=a?0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a \\"lockdown\\" effect on general surgical admissions with a profound impact; fewer surgical admissions, more acutely unwell surgical patients, and an increase in all cause 30-day mortality.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of anagliptin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMVEC) injury, as well as its underlying mechanism. HPMVECs were exposed to LPS in the presence or absence of anagliptin co-treatment. MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability and nitric oxide (NO) production was detected using a commercial kit. DPP4 and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels, apoptosis and migration were assessed via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, TUNEL staining and wound healing assay, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed to assess expression levels of proteins involved in NF-B signaling, cell apoptosis and migration, as well as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). LPS decreased cell viability and NO production, but elevated expression of DPP4 in HPMVECs. LPS promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, NF-B activation and cell apoptosis, but inhibited cell migration and phosphorylated-AKT/endothelial NO synthase expression. Anagliptin co-treatment significantly restored all of these effects. Mechanistically, the upregulation of HMGB1/RAGE expression induced by LPS was markedly blocked by anagliptin. In conclusion, anagliptin alleviated inflammation, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction in LPS-induced HPMVECs via modulating HMGB1/RAGE expression.

As the protons enter from the viral exterior, four central His37 residues control the channel activation by binding subsequent protons, which opens the Trp41 gate and allows proton flux to the viral interior. Asp44 is essential for maintaining the Trp41 gate in a closed state at high pH, which results in asymmetric conduction. The prevalent D44N mutant disrupts this gate and opens the C-terminal end of the channel, resulting in overall increased conduction in the physiologically relevant pH range and a loss of this asymmetric conduction. Here, we use extensive Multiscale Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MS-RMD) and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations with an explicit, reactive excess proton to calculate the free energy of proton transport in the M2 mutant and to study the dynamic molecular-level behavior of D44N M2. We find that this mutation significantly lowers the barrier of His37 deprotonation in the activated state and shifts the barrier for entry up to the Val27 tetrad. These free energy changes are reflected in structural shifts. Additionally, we show that the increased hydration around the His37 tetrad diminishes the effect of the His37 charge on the channels water structure, facilitating proton transport and enabling activation from the viral interior. Altogether, this work provides key insight into the fundamental characteristics of PT in WT M2 and how the D44N mutation alters this PT mechanism, and it expands our understanding of the role of emergent mutations in viroporins.","output":"Multiscale Simulation of an Influenza A M2 Channel Mutant Reveals Key Features of Its Markedly Different Proton Transport Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile map applications are typically used by a broad range of users.

RESULTS: Seventy-eight cases were identified (4.5 per 1,000 ICU days, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6C5.7). Out of 98 MDR GNB isolates, the most frequent species were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (24, 24.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23, 23.5%). Two (8.7%) K. pneumoniae, and six (85.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem resistant. A total of 24 (24.5%) isolates were not considered to be associated with active infection. Those with active infection received appropriate antimicrobial agent within a median of one day. The case group had significantly longer median central venous line days, mechanical ventilation days, and hospital length of stay (P<0.001 for each).

METHODS/DESIGN: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of WeChat mini-programs to increase the consumption of MOM feeding in twelve NICUs in Jiangsu Province, namely, six intervention NICUs and six control NICUs. The study process is as follows: (1) design and preparation, (2) NICU recruitment and training, (3) interpretation and analysis of baseline data, (4) quality control implementation process, and (5) data analysis feedback and publication of study reports. The primary outcome is the proportion of MOM feeding of premature infants during NICU hospitalization. The secondary outcomes are as follows: (1) time to initiation of MOM feeding (hours) and proportion of first-time MOM feeding (%), (2) duration of parenteral nutrition (days), (3) time to total gastrointestinal feeding (days), (4) hospitalization time and hospitalization cost, and (5) incidence of complications (necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, feeding intolerance, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity).

Results: Detectable anti-NP suggestive of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 15/142 (11%) of patients at baseline while only three patients had prior RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Two additional patients contracted COVID-19 after receiving two doses of vaccine. In patients receiving a single BNT162b2 dose, seroconversion occurred in 53/66 (80%) for anti-spike and 35/66 (55%) for anti-RBD by 28 days post dose, but only 15/66 (23%) and 4/66 (6%), respectively attained a robust response as defined by reaching the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD in convalescent serum from COVID-19 survivors. In patients receiving two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, seroconversion occurred in 69/72 (96%) for anti-spike and 63/72 (88%) for anti-RBD by 2 weeks following the second dose while 52/72 (72%) and 43/76 (41%) reached the median convalescent serum level of anti-spike and anti-RBD, respectively. In contrast, 35/35 (100%) of health care workers exceeded the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD found in convalescent serum 2-4 weeks after the second dose. Conclusions and Relevance: This study confirms poor immunogenicity 28 days following a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the hemodialysis population, supporting adherence to recommended vaccination schedules, and avoiding delay of the second dose in these at-risk individuals.","output":"The Humoral Response to the BNT162b2 Vaccine in Hemodialysis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To compare clinical and imaging features between patients with an initial negative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test and patients with an initial positive RT-PCR test.

We assessed these risks in patients with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the overall risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severe disease course, and potential population-level predictors of COVID-19 infection in PwMS, and to provide a context using a cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, the association of different MS DMTs with the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 was evaluated. Safety data from the Biogen Global Safety Database are also presented on reported cases of COVID-19 in patients treated with Biogen MS therapies. METHODS: The IBM? Explorys electronic health record database of > 72,000,000 patients from US healthcare networks identified patients with MS or SLE, with and without polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization, and deaths among DMT classes were compared using logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity). As a secondary data source to assess safety data, COVID-19 reports for Biogen MS therapies were extracted and described from Biogen's Global Safety Database. RESULTS: 30,478 PwMS with an open DMT prescription were identified within Explorys; 344 were COVID-19 positive. The most significant risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were comorbidity score &#8805; 1, body mass index &#8805; 30, and Black/African ancestry. Similar risk factors were also identified for patients with SLE. Patients with MS were less likely to develop COVID-19 when treated with interferons (0.61%) and glatiramer acetate (0.51%), vs all other MS DMTs (both p < 0.001); anti-CD20 therapy was associated with the highest risk (3.45%; p < 0.0001). In the Biogen Global Safety Database, we identified 1217 patients who were COVID-19 positive treated with intramuscular interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a, natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, or fampridine. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, obesity, and Black/African ancestry, but not age, were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PwMS. Interferons and glatiramer acetate were associated with a reduced COVID-19 risk, whereas anti-CD20 therapies were associated with an increased risk, within the treated MS cohort.

Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The factors affecting the learning flow of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic were their self-regulated learning ability ( = .24, p = .001); learning motivation ( = .23, p = .001); self-efficacy in clinical practice ( = .14, p = .014); and lecture type, or a mixture of recorded and real-time video lectures ( = .13, p = .022).

In particular, compared with East Asia, where the virus first emerged, SARS-CoV-2 has caused high rates of morbidity and mortality in Europe. This has not been experienced in past global viral infections, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and is unique to SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, we investigated the involvement of genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related genes, because ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ACE1 II genotype frequency in a population was significantly negatively correlated with the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Similarly, the ACE1 II genotype was negatively correlated with the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is predominantly a respiratory pathogen that also affects the gastrointestinal tract. The ACE 2 receptor is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, with evidence of its high presence in the intestine, colon and cholangiocytes, and, in smaller proportion, in hepatocytes. SARS-CoV-2 has a gastrointestinal tropism that explains digestive symptoms and viral spread in stools. The characteristics of this virus include the S (Spike) protein that binds very stably to the ACE-2 receptor and, at the same time, SARS-CoV-2 produces dysbiosis and alterations in the gut-lung axis. It produces a clear T-cell response and a cytokines storm in the intestine and liver that would produce inflammatory bowel damage. Intestinal manifestations by order of frequency are loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain, where the latter could be a severity marker. In children, diarrhea is the most frequent symptom, usually mild and self-limiting. In the liver, hypertransaminasemia occurs in severe patients ranging from 40 to 60%. SARS-CoV-2 can re main in stools longer than in respiratory secretions, which would influence the spread of disease.

The decomposition temperature of PP and apparent activation energy (Ea) were obtained from the TGA results at multiple heating rates, and a model-free kinetic analysis was performed using the FlynnCWallCOzawa model. TGA indicated that the maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax) of the PP was shifted from 464 C to 347 C with Al-MCM-41 and 348 C with bentonite, largely due to their strong acidity and large pore size. Although olivine had a large pore size, the Tmax of PP was only shifted to 456 C, because of its low acidity. The differential TG (DTG) curve of PP over NZ revealed a two-step mechanism. The Tmax of the first peak on the DTG curve of PP with NZ was 376 C due to the high acidity of NZ. On the other hand, that of the second peak was higher (474 C) than the non-catalytic reaction.

Objective To determine the local impact of community pharmacist-provided COVID-19 testing among a majority-Hispanic, lower income population during the early COVID-19 pandemic, as assessed via a patient satisfaction survey. Methods A 10-question Likert-type questionnaire was administered in English and Spanish to patients who received a pharmacist-provided POC COVID-19 test at a large-chain community pharmacy in Arizona between 5/1/20 and 6/14/20. Questions surrounded patient perceptions of the testing process and subsequent pharmacist counselling on their test results. Results At total of 622 patients completed the survey (94.1% participation rate among successful contacts, representing 28.3% of all eligible patients).

Research on HCQ is used as a case study in both papers. The authors explored biomedical databases, peer-reviewed journals, pre-print servers, and media articles to identify relevant literature on HCQ and COVID-19, and examined philosophical perspectives on medical research in the context of this pandemic and previous global health challenges. RESULTS: This paper demonstrates that a lack of prioritization among research questions and therapeutics was responsible for the duplication of clinical trials and the dispersion of precious resources. Study designs, aimed at minimising biases and increasing objectivity, were, instead, the subject of fruitless oppositions. The duplication of research works, combined with poor-quality research, has greatly contributed to slowing down the creation of novel scientific knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges in terms of (1) finding and prioritising relevant research questions and (2) choosing study designs that are appropriate for a time of emergency.","output":"COVID-19 and the generation of novel scientific knowledge: Research questions and study designs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 21-year-old male with no past medical history presented with a sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath after attending a party days earlier.

However, they have had to be stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To be able to offer these patients an online functional assessment, a proposal was put forward to design an adaptation of the Spanish version of the Fugl Meyer assessment scale and to test its viability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The adapted online scale, based on the Fugl Meyer assessment scale. The motor function, balance and pain domains were kept, and items requiring assistance for the patient were removed. This scale was administered to 13 patients with a chronic cerebrovascular accident from the Salamanca Acquired Brain Injury Association (Asociacion de Dano Cerebral Adquirido) via different web platforms. The procedure followed was the same as for the original scale and lasted from 30 to 45 minutes. RESULTS: All the patients completed the Fugl Meyer assessment scale, online version. The greatest difficulty was encountered in the assessment of the lower limbs. Patients and physiotherapists highlighted how easy it was to complete the items in the scale. On comparing the versions, statistically significant positive correlations were found with the original version (p < 0.001) and the correlation coefficients indicated a strong association. The difference between the equivalent sections of the scale in each instrument was no greater than 5%, except for balance. CONCLUSION: The Fugl Meyer assessment scale, online version, is a feasible, useful and easy to apply scale that allows assessment of the functional status of stroke patients and can help meet the current needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"[Adaptation and feasibility of the online version of the Fugl Meyer scale for the assessment of patients following cerebrovascular accidents]./ Adaptacin y viabilidad de la versin telemtica de la escala Fugl Meyer para la evaluacin de pacientes tras accidentes cerebrovasculares"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MRA assessment of parent artery patency after flow-diverter placement is complicated by imaging artifacts produced by these devices. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of liver acquisition with volume acceleration-flex technique (LAVA-Flex) MRA in combination with 3D-TOF with HyperSense MRA for the evaluation of parent vessel status after intracranial flow-diverter placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients treated by flow diversion and followed with both DSA and 3T MRA between November 2020 and August 2021 were included. All patients were evaluated for parent artery patency using the same imaging protocol (DSA, noncontrast MRA including 3D-TOF with HyperSense and LAVA-Flex, and contrast-enhanced MRA, including time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics MRA and delayed contrast-enhanced MRA). RESULTS: With DSA as a criterion standard to evaluate the patency of the parent vessel, noncontrast MRA had a good specificity (0.83) and positive predictive value (0.65), better than contrast-enhanced MRA (0.55 and 0.41, respectively). Both had excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value: noncontrast MRA, 0.93 and 0.97, respectively; contrast-enhanced MRA, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. Specificity and positive predictive value tended to be lower for patients treated with additional devices than for those treated with flow diverters exclusively and for patients treated with a specific type of flow diverter. CONCLUSIONS: Noncontrast MRA can be used for noninvasive follow-up of intracranial aneurysms treated by flow diverters. The combined use of LAVA-Flex and 3D-TOF with HyperSense sequences allows monitoring the status of the parent artery and aneurysm occlusion.","output":"Follow-up of Intracranial Aneurysms Treated by Flow Diverters: Evaluation of Parent Artery Patency Using 3D-T1 Gradient Recalled-Echo Imaging with 2-Point Dixon in Combination with 3D-TOF-MRA with Compressed Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines how structural racism amplified the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 for African American, Asian/Asian American, and Latino/a/x and Hispanic social work students during the unplanned transition to synchronous and asynchronous education at three social work programs across the United States, creating additional educational barriers.

Starting from January 2020, Humanitas University proposed to students digital instruction for continuing medical education, in particular, concerning practical activities. The latter, defined as Professionalizing activities, were transformed into complete online learning. From September 2020, in accordance to the imposed rules of social distancing, we modified the approach to Professionalizing activities. Despite following the new constrains, we came up with a blend online and face-to-face education program. The Kirkpatrick's evaluation model has been followed for validation of the project. Two ad hoc satisfaction questionnaires have been proposed to evaluate the project. Different approaches to blended learning have been described in literature;however, we propose a new method application, which fits to the post-pandemic era, with the purpose of sharing our experience in the field. Advantages and limitations are described. According to students, the overall satisfaction was rated 6.8, while tutors evaluated it with 7.4.

BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has provoked widespread disruption to clinical nurses work. It is important to understand clinical nurses processes of coping during disasters to support the nursing workforce during events such as global pandemics. DESIGN: We employed the Corbin and Strauss variant of grounded theory methodology, informed by symbolic interactionism, and applied the EQUATOR guidelines for qualitative research publication (COREQ). METHODS: Data collection entailed semi\\\\structured interviews with experienced clinical nurses (n =20) across diverse settings. We analysed data by identifying key points in the nurses coping processes inductively building concepts around these points. RESULTS: The predictor of nurses outcomes in this grounded theory was their confidence in their ability to cope during the pandemic. When nurses lacked confidence, they experienced working in the context of acute COVIDa state of chaos and anxiety, with negative consequences for nurses. However, when nurses were confident in their abilities to cope with the pandemic, they experienced working in the context of chronic COVID, a calmer state of acceptance. There were many workplace factors that influenced nurses confidence, including adequacy of personal protective equipment, clear information and guidance, supportive leadership, teamwork and adequate staffing. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding clinical nurses experience of coping during COVID\\\\19 is essential to maintain the nursing workforce during similar disasters. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurse leaders can target areas that support nurses confidence, such as adequate PPE and staffing. In turn, increased confidence enables clinical nurses to cope during disasters such as a global pandemic.","output":"A grounded theory of clinical nurses process of coping during COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Study of etiological structure of ARVI and evaluation of acute respiratory virus infection morbidity in 2010 - 2011 epidemic season taking into account the data of laboratory diagnostics by method of polymerase chain reaction with hybridization-fluorescent detection. MATERIALS AND METHODS By using reagent kits produced by Central Research Institute of Epidemiology for the detection of primary causative agents of influenza and ARVI 129 children and 94 adult patients monitored in an outpatient setting as well as 103 children hospitalized due to ARI were examined. RESULTS Etiological structure of ARVI was studied; proportion of influenza and other actual causative agents of ARVI in monthly dynamics were established. During epidemic rise of influenza (January-March 2011) the proportion of influenza A viruses was 24% (peak in January--31%), the proportion of influenza B viruses--5%, rhinoviruses--9%, metapneumovirus was detected in 6% of cases, parainfluenza viruses (1 - 4 type) and adenovirses--4% each, coronaviruses--in 3%, respiratory syncytial virus--in 2%, bocavirus--in 1% of the studied samples. In influenza structure A/H1N1pdm2009 virus, its proportion was 70%, influenza virus B (26.9%), influenza virus A/H3N2 (2.6%) predominated. Indexes for monthly morbidity caused by each of the ARVI causative agents were calculated. CONCLUSION The proposed approach allowed to evaluate ARVI morbidity taking into account laboratory-confirmed etiological factors. A 5 time increase in ARI morbidity in adults in February 2011 was shown to be mostly due to an increase in influenza A morbidity as well as involvement of influenza B virus, metapneumoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and rhinoviruses into the epidemic process. Increase of morbidity of children by 1.4 times was also seen during activization of influenza viruses and metapneumovirus.

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, and nucleic acids, etc. Herein, we report a modified version of MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin was also investigated. Results show that by using lower concentration/amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower concentrationresponse indicates the possibility of improved bioassay sensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.","output":"Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS) with One-stage Lock-in Implementation for Magnetic Bioassays with Improved Sensitivities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A three-phase PANI/BaFe12O19@Hal heterostructure was designed and fabricated in this paper as efficient lightweight electromagnetic wave absorbing material through the combination of citrate assisted sol-gel self-propagating combustion and in-situ oxidative polymerization of aniline.

The results show that when the weight ratio of PANI is 40%, the material has the best microwave absorption performance. The frequency bandwidth below -5 dB reached 9.60 GHz and the minimum absorption peak at 11.92 GHz was -14.77 dB. The combination of the PANI and BF@Hal nanosheets take advantage of the interfacial polarization, natural resonance, dielectric polarization and trapping of EM waves by internal reflection in PANI/BaFe12O19@Hal.

Although evidence on the positive effects of family-centered care on older adults and their families is accumulating, less is known about the providers beliefs, attitudes and practices related to family-centeredness, especially regarding community-based primary healthcare services for the rapidly-ageing Chinese population. METHODS: This study investigated Chinese primary care providers perceptions and experiences of family-centered care for older adults, using community-based diabetes management services as an example. Ten focus-group interviews involving 48 community health professionals were conducted. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that the providers acknowledged the importance of the family in older patients diabetes management, while their current scope of practice with the patients families was limited and informal. The barriers to implementing family-centered care were attributed to structural and environmental obstacles associated with the patients families and the community healthcare context and culture. To engage patients families more effectively, the providers suggested that family-centered values endorsed by their healthcare organizations and reinforced by policies, a trained interdisciplinary team of health professionals and community social workers, and also that the utilization of technology would be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Our study extends the evidence of family-centered care for older adults in Chinese community-based healthcare settings, contributing to the design of a tailored healthcare delivery model embodying ageing in place.

The aim of this study is to use the literature, researcher, and stakeholder opinion to explicate potential interventions for improving HH compliance in the ICU, and provide an indication of the suitability of these interventions. Methods: A four-phase co-design study was designed. First, data from a previously completed systematic literature review was used in order to identify unique components of existing interventions to improve HH in ICUs. Second, a workshop was held with a panel of 10 experts to identify additional intervention components. Third, the 91 intervention components resulting from the literature review and workshop were synthesised into a final list of 21 hand hygiene interventions. Finally, the affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability, side-effects/safety, and equity of each intervention was rated by 39 stakeholders (health services researchers, ICU staff, and the public). Results: Ensuring the availability of essential supplies for HH compliance was the intervention that received most approval from stakeholders. Interventions involving role models and peer-to-peer accountability and support were also well regarded by stakeholders. Education/training interventions were commonplace and popular. Punitive interventions were poorly regarded. Conclusions: Hospitals and regulators must make decisions regarding how to improve HH compliance in the absence of scientific consensus on effective methods.

Follow up scans on the index admission were excluded. Hinchey grade was assessed for all CT scans. Inflammatory markers were analysed, along with outcome measures including length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Acute diverticulitis was diagnosed in 52 CT scans in the acute pandemic period - a decrease of 51.4%. Average age at presentation was unchanged (63.3  14.3 vs. 62.8  13.8, P = .848).

Enterprises that made the best use of digital platforms through technology, digital marketing, and innovations secured the peak of success and profitability. The study also recommends a critical dynamic, resilient strategy model to adopt in the \\"new normal\\" for successful navigation of SME business in the future. The study is the first of its kind that integrates SLR and a case study on the hurdles of SME owners during the Covid 19 crisis. Thus, it helps advance the understanding of the subject matter and enables the formulation of resilient strategies by policymakers and SME owners to navigate the business in any potential crisis in the future. The study has significant methodological contribution as it presents how to merge both Scopus and web of science data to conduct bibliometric analysis through R programming. Besides, it also contributes to using R's clustering method to extract themes for SME and Covid -19 domain. Finally, the study presents an overview of SMEs in crisis such as Covid-19 and a case study of a rising economy and its response measures. The Case study has been designed to concentrate on Bangladesh's SME owners and practical implications potentially limited to emerging Asian Economies.","output":"SMEs in Covid-19 Crisis and Combating strategies: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and A Case from Emerging Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-2-CoV, most commonly involves the respiratory tract; however, more severe cases have been found to have multi-organ involvement, including the central nervous system.

Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose.

OSA affects daily life and poses a severe threat to human health. The standard clinical method for identifying and predicting OSA events is the use of Polysomnography signals. In this paper, a novel scheme based on an ensemble of recurrence plots (RPs) and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (RPCNNs) is proposed to improve the prediction rate of OSA. First, RPs were used to represent the dynamic behavior of single electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for 60 s before and during OSA events. Then, using RPs, three prompt CNNs named ResNet-50 were fine-tuned, and their classification results were fused via the Majority Voting (MV) method to produce a final result concerning prediction. Next, the subject-independent Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) and subject-dependent 10-fold Cross-Validation (10-fold CV) methods were used to validate the prediction rate from signals derived from the University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database. Finally, the highest achieved average accuracy for the fusion level was 91.74% and 89.45% at the 10-fold CV and LOSO-CV. Additionally, our results outperformed state-of-the-art findings and could be recommended to predict and detect other biomedical signals.

We aimed to investigate whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection. METHODS: A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12 months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status, depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection rates in the two cohorts. FINDINGS: From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913 were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11, 2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047 113 person-days of follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436 person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 76 reinfections per 100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 573 primary infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June, 2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0159 for all reinfections (95% CI 013-019) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than 200 days. INTERPRETATION: A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 84% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective immunity to future infections in most individuals.

The use of digital tools to enable more robust and expedited contact tracing and notification, while maintaining privacy and trust in the data generated, is viewed as key to identifying chains of transmission and close contacts, and, consequently, to enabling effective case investigations.

In this context, there is increasing attention on blockchain technology as a part of systems for enhanced digital algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. By analyzing the literature that has emerged from this trend, the common characteristics of the designs proposed become apparent. An archetypal system architecture can be derived, taking these characteristics into consideration. However, assessing the utility of this architecture using a recognized evaluation framework shows that the added benefits and features of blockchain technology do not provide significant advantages over conventional centralized systems for algorithmic contact tracing and reporting.

During the first pandemic wave in early-spring 2020, over 50% of devices remained completely at home and searches for economic stressors exceeded 60,000 per 10 million. We found large concurrent associations across analyses between declining mobility and increasing searches for economic stressor terms (national proportion of devices at home: cross-correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.6 (p-value <0.001)).

Methods: We identified patients with a positive RT-SARS-CoV-2 PCR receiving care at NYP/CUIMC from March 1 through April 15. Patient data was manually abstracted from the electronic medical record. Main outcome measures: We describe patient characteristics including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, outcomes, and disposition. Results: Among the first 1000 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 151 patients were discharged from or died in the ED, 618 were admitted to the floor, and 231 were admitted or transferred to the ICU; 195 remained hospitalized and 172 had died in the hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (62.9%). Compared to Chinese and Italian cohorts, hospitalized patients and ICU patients in particular had more baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity and higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and dialysis.

(1) There are no reports of lung transplantations to receipients with positive Covid-19-PCR at the time of the operation. Methods A 42-year-old woman without comorbidities was hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. After being intubated and tracheotomized, VV-ecmo support had to be initiated, no tendency of improvement ensued. Lung transplantation proceedings were made despite viral RNA test results from BAL being consistently positive (while negative culture growth suggested no active viral disease) since a small intracerebral bleeding had occurred after 45 days on ECMO. An adequate donor organ was found, double lung transplantation was performed. Two experienced anesthetists, two nurse anesthetists and a runner provided anesthesia. The OR was set to positive pressure and 26 air changes h-1, the team wore full PPE (multilayer gloves, gown/overall, FFP-3 masks, glasses, faceshield). Videolaryngoscopic intubation using a ViVaSight? (Ambu, Denmark) left double lumen tube with integrated camera was performed, TEE and bronchoscopy were avoided. We used near infrared spectropscopy and total intravenous anesthesia with Propofol 5,5mg kg-1 h-1 and Sufentanil 5mcg kg-1 h-1. Being on VV-Ecmo with 4,7l of blood and 5,5l O2 flow min-1 we used a second, centrally cannulated parallel ecmo circuit with 3l of blood and 2l of oxygen flow min-1, the VV circuit was reduced. The operation was prolonged due to adhesions, coagulopathy, rupture of the dilated right atrium. Transfusion of 30 units of packed red cells, 40 units of fresh frozen plasma, 5 units of platelets, 2000IE of PPSB, 30mcg of desmopressin acetate, 5 grams of fibrinogen concentrate guided by repetitive viscoelastic testing was performed. Bilateral pulmonary edema occurred, leading to an oxygenation index of 72 on 1l min-1 VV ecmo flow. We therefore switched to a femorally cannulated VA-ecmo circuit to minimize hemodynamic stress for the newly transplanted lungs. At the end of the operation the patient was stable with oxygenation index of 76 with 2,8l min-1 blood flow of ECMO support, sedated with Propofol 5,5mg kg-1 h-1 and Sufentanil 5mcg kg-1 h-1 and received Norepinephrine 0,06 mcg kg-1 min-1. We proned the patient immediately. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing was performed in all team members and was negative in all cases.

Under conditions, these relative efficiencies approximate the ratio of sample size needed to achieve a desired power. We consider two situations where the outcome is either fully or partially observed and several treatment effect estimands that are of particular interest in most trials. For each such estimand, we develop a semiparametrically efficient estimator of the relative efficiency that allows for the application of flexible statistical learning tools to estimate the nuisance functions and an analytic form of a corresponding Wald-type confidence interval. We also propose a double bootstrap scheme for constructing confidence intervals.

The correlation between ascending aortic calcification and BMD has never been reported. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to confirm the hypothesis that ascending aortic calcification can be used as a predictive factor for low BMD and to find a radiographic sign to show it. METHOD: Plain film and computed tomography (CT) images of the thorax were obtained from 91 patients with hip fractures. Using the images, the calcification line of the ascending aorta adjacent to the aortic arch was evaluated. A prominent calcification line confirmed by both plain film and CT was classified as +2. A line which was ambiguous on plain film but confirmed by CT was classified as +1. Cases with no calcification were categorized as 0 (control). We compared the classified score with the BMD and calculated the kappa coefficient to measure intraobserver reliabilities for this radiographic finding. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients showed a +2 line, twenty-four patients showed a +1 line, and thirty-nine patients showed 0 lines. The median BMD of each group was 0.37 for the +2 line, 0.45 for the +1 line, and 0.51 for the 0 line. The BMD for the +2 group was significantly lower than the others. The kappa coefficient was approximately 0.6 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The imaging finding of calcification of the ascending aorta might be considered as a potential surrogate marker of low BMD. In such subjects, BMD might be ordered for the confirmation of diagnosis of osteoporosis. Mini-Abstract.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study we included medical reports of 96 eyes (51 patients), who underwent VF testing with TED-CON in Ludwig-Maximilians-University (2008C2019). Two readers separately examined the VFs at the time of the TED-CON diagnosis, each offering two readings of the same VF in a time interval of 1 month. None of our patients were diagnosed with only VF testing. The visual field testing was only performed when the inclusion criteria for TED-CON were met. RESULTS: The most common VF defects upon TED-CON diagnosis were stage 1b defects in FT classification (34.4% for reader 1, 35.4% for reader 2), followed by stage 2b (10.4% for reader 1, 14.6% for reader 2), and stage 3 (10.4% for both readers). The overall interreader agreement between 2 examiners was substantial for the first reading (69.8% agreement, kappa 0.635 (95% CI [0.525C0.745])) and moderate for the second reading (66.7% agreement, kappa 0.598 (95% CI [0.488C0.708])). The intrareader reproducibility ranged from substantial to almost perfect (78.1% agreement) between readings (kappa 0.736 (95%CI [0.638C0.834])) for reader 1 and 90.6% agreement (kappa 0.885 (95%CI [0.814C0.956])) for reader 2. CONCLUSION: We found good BCVA (LogMAR  0.2), in nearly half of the cases (44 eyes, 45.8%) and also, strikingly near perfect visual acuity (BCVA LogMAR 0.1) in 22.9% of the cases (22 eyes) with TED-CON.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH. RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8  17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, ?3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, ?3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19Cpositive patients compared with a nonCCOVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19Cpositive patients without DVT/PE.

It is thought to be the etiological factor for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This virus is thought to have originated from bats and acquired ability of human-to-human transmission. While SARS-CoV-2 is relatively benign, it has infected more than half a million people (as of March 29th 2020) worldwide and the number of infected people continues to rise. More than 170 countries have reported COVID-19 positive cases. With a mortality rate of less than both the previous coronavirus outbreaks, COVID-19 has (conversely) caused the death of over 33,980 (as of 29th March, 2020 at 22.00 hours EDT) people worldwide and the number is increasing.

METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 69 793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until 8 April 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users, and 1577 patients were nonusers. In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (Pa? <a? .001). However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; Pa? =a? .60). No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.

AIM The primary aim was to describe EoL care for COVID-19 patients dying in an intensive care unit (ICU). The secondary aim was to explore whether making video calls and allowing visits was associated with lower death-related stress in family members. DESIGN Single centre cross-sectional study. The setting was the ICU of a COVID-19 center in northern Italy, during the first year of the pandemic. Data on patients who died in the ICU were collected; death-related stress on their family members was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The statistical association was tested by means of logistic regression. RESULTS The study sample included 70 patients and 56 family members. All patients died with mechanical ventilation, hydration, nutrition, analgesia and sedation ongoing. Resuscitation procedures were performed in 5/70 patients (7.1%). Only 6/56 (10.7%) of the family members interviewed had visited their loved ones in the ICU and 28/56 (50%) had made a video call. EoL video calls were judged useful by 53/56 family members (94.6%) but all (56/56, 100%) wished they could have visited the patient. High-stress levels were found in 38/56 family members (67.9%), regardless of whether they were allowed ICU access or made a video call.

Although neuroimaging has become an indispensable part of delineating the epileptogenic zone, no validated method uses neuroimaging of presurgical target area to predict an individual's post-surgery seizure outcome. We aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-powered approach incorporating multimodal neuroimaging of a presurgical target area to predict an individual's post-surgery seizure outcome in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty-one patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were classified either as having seizure-free (Engel class I) or seizure-recurrence (Engel class II through IV) at least 1 year after surgery. The presurgical magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and postsurgical magnetic resonance imaging were co-registered for surgical target volume of interest (VOI) segmentation; all VOIs were decomposed into nine fixed views, then were inputted into the deep residual network (DRN) that was pretrained on Tiny-ImageNet dataset to extract and transfer deep features. A multi-kernel support vector machine (MKSVM) was used to integrate multiple views of feature sets and to predict seizure outcomes of the targeted VOIs. Leave-one-out validation was applied to develop a model for verifying the prediction. In the end, performance using this approach was assessed by calculating accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and the optimal area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated as a metric for classifying outcomes. Results: Application of DRN-MKSVM model based on presurgical target area neuroimaging demonstrated good performance in predicting seizure outcomes. The AUC ranged from 0.799 to 0.952. Importantly, the classification performance DRN-MKSVM model using data from multiple neuroimaging showed an accuracy of 91.5%, a sensitivity of 96.2%, a specificity of 85.5%, and AUCs of 0.95, which were significantly better than any other single-modal neuroimaging (all p ? 0.05). Conclusion: DRN-MKSVM, using multimodal compared with unimodal neuroimaging from the surgical target area, accurately predicted postsurgical outcomes. The preoperative individualized prediction of seizure outcomes in patients who have been judged eligible for epilepsy surgery could be conveniently facilitated.

METHODS MRI images, before and after contrast enhancement, were analyzed in newly diagnosed cervical (n = 18) and endometrial cancer (n = 19) patients. Signal intensities (SIs) from tumor tissue and non-neoplastic myometrium were measured using imaging software. RESULTS The relative signal for cervical cancer was approximately 30% higher than that of endometrial cancer after contrast administration. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for SI, relative signal enhancement, and tumor to myometrium contrast ratio (as used to discriminate between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer) was 0.7807, 0.7456 and 0.7895, respectively. There was no difference in SI of the normal myometrium between endometrial and cervical cancer patients prior to and after contrast administration.

The impact of this program on the expected SNF 30-day HF readmission rate is unknown, particularly in the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether a virtual cardiovascular care program could reduce the 30-day hospital readmission rate for patients with HF discharged to SNF relative to the expected rate for this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case review of SNF patients who received a virtual cardiology consultation between August 2020 and February 2021. Virtual cardiologists conducted 1 or more telemedicine visit via smartphone, tablet, or laptop for cardiac patients identified by a SNF care team. Postconsult care plans were communicated to SNF clinical staff. Patients included in this analysis had a preceding index admission for HF. RESULTS: We observed lower hospital readmission among patients who received 1 or more virtual consultations compared with the expected readmission rate for both cardiac (3% vs 10%, respectively) and all-cause etiologies (18% vs 27%, respectively) in a population of 3510 patients admitted to SNF.

However, these effects may not fully account for the diversity in disease severity. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a broad range of patients laboratory and clinical assessments to investigate the genetic contributions to COVID-19 severity. By performing GWAS analysis, we discovered several concrete associations for laboratory features. Based on these findings, we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causality of laboratory traits on disease severity. From the MR study, we identified two causal traits, cholesterol levels and WBC counts. The functional gene related to cholesterol levels is ApoE and people with particular ApoE genotype are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels, facilitating the process that SARS-CoV-2 binds on its receptor ACE2 and aggravating COVID-19 disease. The functional gene related to WBC counts is MHC system that plays a central role in the immune system. The host immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection greatly affects the patients severity status and clinical outcome. Additionally, our gene-based and GSEA analysis revealed interferon pathways, including type I interferon receptor binding, regulation of IFNA signaling, and SARS coronavirus and innate immunity.

This study was to evaluate CO2 levels in dental operatories and determine the accuracy of using CO2 levels to assess ventilation rate in dental clinics. Mechanical ventilation rate in air change per hour (ACHVENT) was measured with an air velocity sensor and airflow balancing hood. CO2 levels were measured in these rooms to analyze factors that contributed to CO2 accumulation. Ventilation rates were estimated using natural steady-state CO2 levels during dental treatments and experimental CO2 concentration decays by dry ice or mixing baking soda and vinegar. We compared the differences and assessed the correlations between ACHVENT and ventilation rates estimated by the steady-state CO2 model with low (0.3 L/min, ACHSS30) or high (0.46 L/min, ACHSS46) CO2 generation rates, by CO2 decay constants using dry ice (ACHDI) or baking soda (ACHBV), and by time needed to remove 63% of excess CO2 generated by dry ice (ACHDI63%) or baking soda (ACHBV63%). We found that ACHVENT varied from 3.9 to 35.0 in dental operatories. CO2 accumulation occurred in rooms with low ventilation (ACHVENT &#8804;6) and overcrowding but not in those with higher ventilation. ACHSS30 and ACHSS46 correlated well with ACHVENT (r = 0.83, P = 0.003), but ACHSS30 was more accurate for rooms with low ACHVENT. Ventilation rates could be reliably estimated using CO2 released from dry ice or baking soda.

The organization of the occupational health department and the clinical laboratory was adapted in order to start the screening on August, 24, 2020. All HCWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 the week before and 4 weeks after the implementation of the screening were included. The mean number of tests was analyzed per working day and working week. Overall, 502 (31.4%) HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The mean number of HCWs tested per working day was 27.1. HCWs accounted for 36.9% (n = 167) and 11.2% (n = 84) of the tests performed in the 1st and the 4th week following the implementation of the guidelines. The number of tests performed each week in HCWs increased by at least 20-fold after the implementation of the guidelines. No asymptomatic HCW was tested positive.

We collected, assessed, and evaluated data on the development of Chinas health informatization from five perspectiveshealth information infrastructure, information technology (IT) applications, financial and intellectual investment, health resource allocation, and standard systemand discussed the status quo of the internet plus health care service pattern during COVID-19. The main data sources included Chinas policy documents and national plans on health informatization, commercial and public welfare sources and websites, public reports, institutional reports, and academic papers. In particular, we extracted data from the 2019 National Health Informatization Survey released by the National Health Commission in China. We found that China developed its health information infrastructure and IT applications, made significant financial and intellectual informatization investments, and improved health resource allocations. Tested during COVID-19, Chinas current health informatization system, especially the internet plus health care system, has played a crucial role in monitoring and controlling the pandemic and allocating medical resources. However, an uneven distribution of health resources and insufficient financial and intellectual investment continue to challenge Chinas health informatization. Chinas rapid development of health informatization played a crucial role during COVID-19, providing a reference point for global pandemic prevention and control.

Meanwhile, physical activity levels are declining despite the global evidence of its role in the prevention of chronic diseases. While there are a plethora of systematic reviews on the effects of physical activity on chronic diseases, there has not yet been a synthesis of the evidence concerning the nature of this relationship among people living in South Asian countries incorporating multiple chronic diseases and a focus on physical activity domains. The aim of this protocol is to describe the rationale and methods for a systematic review of published research to identify the association between physical activity and selected chronic diseases and their markers and analysis of the strength of association with a focus on physical activity domains among South Asian adults 40 years and older. METHODS Nine electronic databases including Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus, AgeLine, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and Web of Science will be systematically searched for papers reporting the association between physical activity and selected chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, vascular diseases and musculoskeletal diseases (osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, back and neck pain)) and their markers using predefined search terms. Searches will be limited to peer-reviewed, English language papers with a quantitative design. In addition, a manual search of references of relevant systematic reviews as well as citations and references of eligible studies will also be carried out. The methodological appraisal will be performed using the National Institutes of Health quality assessment checklist for observational studies and the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool for intervention studies. The overall quality of evidence for the study outcomes across the study designs will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The review results will be presented in the form of narrative synthesis, and a random effects meta-analysis is planned depending on the nature of included studies and available data. DISCUSSION This review will summarise the strength of the association between physical activity and selected chronic diseases and their markers among South Asian adults 40 years or older. The findings will provide an evidence base to guide public health policy and interventions in the South Asian region and to inform future research to address the rising burden of chronic diseases.

The CSS, a newly emerging internationally standardized measure of stress related to being exposed to or contracting COVID-19, was translated and validated for a Palestinian context to ensure that it can be used to measure COVID-19 stress. The sample of the study consisted of 860 Palestinian adults living in the West Bank of Palestine. Participants age ranged from 20 to 48 years old (M = 34.7, SD =13.46). They were all recruited from online advertisements, e-mail campaigns, blogs, social media, and SMS campaigns. The CSS was found to be valid in the Arabic language within a Palestinian context. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded six factors: (1) Fears about the dangerousness of COVID-19, (2) fears about the personal social, and economic consequences of COVID-19, fears of disruption in the supply chain, fears of looting or rioting, (3) COVID-19-xenophobia, fears that foreigners are sources of COVID-19, (4) fears about sources of COVID-19-related contamination,(5) traumatic stress symptoms related to COVID-19, and (6) COVID-19-related checking which is consisting with the ordinal structure the scale. The CSS demonstrated a high level of validity and reliability in a Palestinian context and therefore can be considered for future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. Further investigations using the Arabic Language of CSS may have far-reaching implications for measuring and combating the stress of COVID-19 at a personal and societal level for uniquely at-risk populations such as in the occupied territories of Palestine.","output":"Psychometric properties of the COVID stress scales (CSS) within Arabic language in a Palestinian context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We portray the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic during the crisis of March-April 2020 in the Paris area, by analyzing the medical emergency calls received by the EMS of the four central departments of this area (Centre 15 of SAMU 75, 92, 93 and 94).

METHODS: Study randomly allocated a total of 300 male broilers to a control and 4 treatment groups (5% WB, 5% FWB, 10% WB, and 10% FWB inclusion, respectively) with each pen having 20 broilers and 3 pens per treatment. RESULTS: The WB does not contain enzymes, but there are 152.8, 549.2, 289.5, and 147.1 U/g dry matter xylanase, protease, cellulase and -glucanase in FWB, respectively. Furthermore, FWB can decrease nitric oxide release of lipopolysaccharide stimulated chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells by about two times. Results show that 10% FWB inclusion had significantly the highest weight gain (WG) at 1 to 21 d; 5% FWB had the lowest feed conversion rate at 22 to 35 d; 10% WB and 10% FWB inclusion have the highest villus height and Lactobacillus spp. number in caecum; and both 5% and 10% FWB can increase ash content in femurs. Compared to control group, all treatments increase mucin 2, and tight junction (TJ), such as occludin, claudin-1, zonula occludens-1, and mRNA expression in ileum by at least 5 folds. In chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase-1 mRNA expression decreases from 2 to 5 times, and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit mRNA expression also increases in all treatment groups compared to control group. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor-B, and IL-1, decreases in 5% and 10% FWB groups compared to control group. CONCLUSION: To summarize, both WB and FWB inclusion in broilers diets increase TJ mRNA expression and anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation, but up to 10% FWB groups have better WG in different stages of broiler development.","output":"Effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and phytase co-fermentation of wheat bran on growth, antioxidation, immunity and intestinal morphology in broilers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID pandemic has given a massive boost to the use of digital options in the care of patients with diabetes.

Measures to mitigating the risks of transmitting COVID-19 are creating significant challenges to recommencement of all surgical services safely. We describe the development of a risk stratification tool to prioritise patients for cataract surgery and report the demographics and comorbidities of patients on the NHS Fife waiting list. Methods: : A prospective case review of electronic records was performed. A risk stratification tool was developed based on review of available literature on risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection. Scores derived from the tool were used to generate 6 risk profile groups to call in time order for surgery. Results: : There were 744 patients awaiting cataract surgery of which 66 (8.9%) patients were shielding. One hundred and thirty-two (19.5%) patients had no systemic comorbidities, 218 (32.1%) patients had 1 relevant systemic comorbidity and 316 (46.5%) patients had 2 or more comorbidities. Five hundred and ninety patients (88.7%) did not have any ocular comorbidities. Conclusions: : COVID-19 has presented every department an urgent challenge to deal with the mounting cataract surgery waiting list. We present a pragmatic method of risk stratifying patients on waiting lists, blending an evidence-based objective assessment of risk and patient need combined with an element of shared decision-making.

The viral spike protein binds the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and thus is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share this mechanism. Here we functionally analyzed the key amino acid residues located within receptor binding motif of RBD that may interact with human ACE2 and available neutralizing antibodies. The in vivo experiments showed that immunization with either the SARS-CoV RBD or SARS-CoV-2 RBD was able to induce strong clade-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice; however, the cross-neutralizing activity was much weaker, indicating that there are distinct antigenic features in the RBDs of the two viruses. This finding was confirmed with the available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 human antibody, HA001, was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but failed to recognize SARS-CoV. Moreover, the potential epitope residues of HA001 were identified as A475 and F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, representing new binding sites for neutralizing antibodies. Overall, our study has revealed the presence of different key epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which indicates the necessity to develop new prophylactic vaccine and antibody drugs for specific control of the COVID-19 pandemic although the available agents obtained from the SARS-CoV study are unneglectable.","output":"Key residues of the receptor binding motif in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that interact with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Young children are in danger of becoming collateral damage in the COVID-19 pandemic Institutions of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) are closed and so are playgrounds, libraries and museums Even play dates are out Thus, young children are deprived of necessary social interactions","output":"Early Childhood Education and Care in a Post-Pandemic World: The Possibility of Reimaging the Child as an Other"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to learn about the experiences of family medicine research assistants during COVID 19 pandemic and to obtain information about improvement activities that can be done in similar situations.

However, one of the variables in energy prediction models, occupant behavior, is crucial for prediction performance but hard-to-measure or time-consuming to collect from each building. This study proposes an approach that utilizes the search volume of topics (e.g., education} or Microsoft Excel) on the Google Trends platform as a proxy of occupant behavior and use of buildings. Linear correlations were first examined to explore the relationship between energy meter data and Google Trends search terms to infer building occupancy. Prediction errors before and after the inclusion of the trends of these terms were compared and analyzed based on the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) competition dataset. The results show that highly correlated Google Trends data can effectively reduce the overall RMSLE error for a subset of the buildings to the level of the GEPIII competition's top five winning teams' performance. In particular, the RMSLE error reduction during public holidays and days with site-specific schedules are respectively reduced by 20-30% and 2-5%.

A growing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We performed a systematic review of GI symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as of the serum levels of biomarkers related to liver function and lesion in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. METHODS: We surveyed relevant articles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to July, 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and BVS databases. Moreover, we surveyed potentially important articles in journals such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, Gut, and AJG. RESULTS: This systematic review included 43 studies, including 18,246 patients. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%). With regard to clinical severity, 17.5% of the patients were classified as severely ill, whereas 9.8% of them were considered to have a non-severe disease. Some studies showed increased aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels in a portion of the 209 analyzed patients and two studies.

The pandemic has led to an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing and the rapid emergence of an abundance of commercial assays on the market. Due to the nature of the pandemic and in the interest of health protection, many of these assays received provisional authorisation for emergency use without thorough validation. To limit false negative and false positive results, it is key to define common criteria that SARS-CoV-2 assays need to fulfil. VALCOR or VALidation of SARS-CORona Virus-2 assays is a protocol designed to set up a framework for test validation of SARS-CoV-2 virus assays. OBJECTIVES: VALCOR is a study protocol for the validation of assays used for confirmation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 disease or the screening of carriers of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the identification of viral RNA in oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal specimens or other specimens from the human respiratory tract. METHODS: The VALCOR panel of samples will contain clinical human specimens and standardised artificial specimens. The collection of clinical specimens will include nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens or other specimens from the respiratory tract obtained from COVID-19 patients and healthy carriers of SARS-CoV-2 as well as specimens from subjects not carrying SARS-CoV-2. Artificial specimens include calibrated amounts of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provided by established competent agencies that produce reference materials for the assessment of the limit of detection of each assay. The panel of samples are sent from a central reference laboratory (having access to biobanks of clinical specimens tested already for SARS-CoV-2 with a reference comparator assay) to participating laboratories for testing with a SARS-CoV-2 index assay that requires evaluation. DISCUSSION: VALCOR provides a harmonised and standard framework to benchmark the testing performance of SARS-CoV-2 assays that are rapidly evolving. As the pandemic incited an urgent need for testing capacity, there is a gap in the comprehensive validation of SARS-CoV-2 assays. This study will generate comprehensive validation data for assays used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and may serve as a basis for other validation protocols.

However, the disease often goes undiagnosed for a long time, especially in low- and middle-income countries where healthcare services are limited. This paper presents the results of a pilot programme, which integrated targeted glaucoma screenings of people aged 40 y in community-based eye care services in the Ganjam district of Odisha state, India. METHODS: Using routine programme data, descriptive statistics were produced for the characteristics of patients participating in the screening programme and the rate and uptake of glaucoma referrals. Bivariate analysis was used to examine associations between patient characteristics, clinical risk factors and glaucoma diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 23 356 individuals aged 40 y screened for glaucoma over a period of 18 mo, 2219 (9.5%) were referred and 2031 presented for further examination. Among them, almost half (n=968, 48%) were diagnosed with glaucoma, representing a screening to diagnosis conversion rate of 4.14% (95% CI 3.9 to 4.4%). A positive diagnosis of glaucoma among suspects was associated with female sex, age >60 y, visual impairment, vertical cap-to-disc ratio 0.6:1, intraocular pressure 30 mmHg and shallow anterior chamber (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The importance of targeted screening for glaucoma using simple referral criteria to identify patients at high risk of vision loss who can benefit from treatment is critical to slow the progression of the disease and the prevention of blindness. Further studies assessing costs of the targeted screening, the role of technology in improving programme effectiveness and efficiency and the longer term compliance with treatment are needed to support glaucoma policy frameworks, guidelines and clinical practice.","output":"Piloting targeted glaucoma screening: experiences of eye care services in Ganjam district, Odisha state, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In contrast to several other countries, smoking is not an integral part of treatment during admission to a psychiatric hospital in The Netherlands. AIM: Implementation of a smoking cessation program for patients and employees of a psychiatric ward of an academic medical center in The Netherlands. METHOD: Prospective, mixed-method study of implementation of a smoking cessation program for patients and employees of a psychiatric academic hospital in Amsterdam. The program consisted of 7 weekly group meetings by certified smoking cessation coaches. Nicotine replacement therapy was provided for free, if necessary. RESULTS: During 14 months, 65 individuals were seeking help to stop smoking: 39 patients and 26 employees. Of these, 29 patients and 16 employees participated in group meetings with an average of 2.6 times per person. There were 20 individuals who visited the group meetings or received individual coaching at least 3 times (6 patients and 14 employees). Fifty-five percent of these individuals reported to be smoke-free at 3 months after joining the first meeting. Employees were much more likely to quit than patients. From interviews with 20 participants, it was noticed that combining patients and employees in one group was perceived as a barrier due to a gap in processing speed. CONCLUSION: On the psychiatric ward of an academic hospital in The Netherlands, there was a positive experience with providing smoking cessation treatment. A small number of employees and patients participated in a smoking cessation program and quitting smoking was reached by only a few patients.

Peptide modification by altering the anchor residue facilitates increased binding affinity and may elicit T cells with increased functional avidity toward the native epitope (\\"heteroclitic\\"). This augmented MHC binding is likely to increase the half-life and surface density of the heteroclitic complex, but precisely how this enhanced T cell response occurs in vivo is not known. Furthermore, the ideal heteroclitic epitope will elicit T cell responses that completely cross-react with the native epitope, maximizing protection and minimizing undesirable off-target effects. Such epitopes have been difficult to identify. In this study, using mice infected with a murine coronavirus that encodes epitopes that elicit high (S510, CSLWNGPHL)- and low (S598, RCQIFANI)-functional avidity responses, we show that increased expression of peptide S598 but not S510 generated T cells with enhanced functional avidity. Thus, immune responses can be augmented toward T cell epitopes with low functional avidity by increasing Ag density. We also identified a heteroclitic epitope (RCVIFANI) that elicited a T cell response with nearly complete cross-reactivity with native epitope and demonstrated increased MHC/peptide abundance compared with native S598. Structural and thermal melt analyses indicated that the Q600V substitution enhanced stability of the peptide/MHC complex without greatly altering the antigenic surface, resulting in highly cross-reactive T cell responses. Our data highlight that increased peptide/MHC complex display contributes to heteroclitic epitope efficacy and describe parameters for maximizing immune responses that cross-react with the native epitope.","output":"Structural and functional correlates of enhanced antiviral immunity generated by heteroclitic CD8 T cell epitopes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The versatile and computationally attractive FATE&#8482; facility software package for analyzing the transient behavior of facilities during normal and off-normal conditions is applied to the problem of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission in single-and multi-room facilities.

Existing literature highlights three methodological challenges limiting the development of evidence-informed responses to migration and health: (1) lack of engagement with the process of migration; (2) exclusion of internal migrants; and (3) lack of methodologies that are able to capture real-time data about health needs and healthcare seeking experiences over both time and place. In this paper, we reflect on a four-month pilot project which explored the use of WhatsApp Messenger - a popular mobile phone application used widely in sub-Saharan Africa C and assessed its feasibility as a research tool with migrant and mobile populations in order to inform a larger study that would address these challenges. METHOD: A four-month pilot was undertaken with eleven participants between October 2019 and January 2020. Using Survey Node, an online platform that allows for the automatic administration of surveys through WhatsApp, monthly surveys were administered. The GPS coordinates of participants were also obtained. Recruited through civil society partners in Gauteng, participants were over the age of 18, comfortable engaging in English, and owned WhatsApp compatible cell phones. Enrolment involved an administered survey and training participants in the study protocol. Participants received reimbursement for their travel costs and monthly cell phone data. RESULTS: Out of a possible eighty eight survey and location responses, sixty one were received. In general, participants responded consistently to the monthly surveys and shared their location when prompted. Survey Node proved an efficient and effective way to administer surveys through WhatsApp. Location sharing via WhatsApp proved cumbersome and led to the development of a secure platform through which participants could share their location. Ethical concerns about data sharing over WhatsApp were addressed. CONCLUSIONS: The success of the pilot indicates that WhatsApp can be used as a tool for data collection with migrant and mobile populations, and has informed the finalisation of the main study.

This survey aims to evaluate demographic differences between those hospitalised patients who died of COVID during the first surge [until 31/08/2020] and those who died during the second [01/09/2020C15/03/2021]. Methods Data was obtained for all patients admitted with COVID during the two pandemic surges at two multi-ethnic,inner-city district general hospitals. Univariate and multivariable analyses [stepwise backward logistic regression] were conducted to evaluate mortality as per patient demographics, length of stay, and whether patients had been managed in critical care. Results 1013 [21.5%] of 4,707 patients died during this period. Mortality was significantly lower during the second wave,compared to first i.e. 18.5% [632/2784]vs29.5% [381/901];39% reduction [P < 0.001]. This reduction was observed across all ages, gender, ethnic subgroups, and both sites. Advancing age was associated with significant mortality at all times with no differences between the two waves. 77% of all deaths occurred in patient>70. There were fewer deaths among those<50 during the second wave compared to first [7vs12]. Reduction in mortality during second wave was noted across all ethnic sub-groups. However,significantly greater reduction was observed in Black African [54.6%],South-Asian [47.3%],Black Caribbean [44.4%],and East-Asian [44.2%] groups, compared to white subgroup [34.2%]. Majority of patients who died were managed on general medical wards during both waves [n = 824,81.3%]. For patients who spent time in critical care, there were no significant differences in mortality [30.6vs33.7%,p = ns]. There were no differences in terms of length of hospital stay between the two waves. Multivariable analyses showed that Black African [OR 0.47,95%CI 0.27C0.82] was independently associated with lesser mortality during second wave. Discussion This large survey has described demographic differences in mortality between the two surges. Lower mortality rates during second wave may be due to better treatment modalities, greater awareness of infection prevention and control,and possibly vaccination. This survey indicates greater psychological support may be required for healthcare workers on general medical wards who looked after greater proportion of COVID deaths.","output":"Demographic Variability in Mortality from Covid during the Two Surges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Border malaria remain as one of the greatest challenges facing elimination in China.

Each people were interviewed using the structured questionnaires. Blood samples were collected and sent to the PCR detection and sequenced.ResultsMalaria knowledge was poor with 19.4% on transmission, 23.2% on clinical symptoms, 7.4% on awareness of the risk of death, and 14.8% on awareness of prevention methods. No significant difference was found among occupations except for migrant workers, whose knowledge rate were higher than other occupations. Most of the participants (80.6%) had mosquito nets and 73.2% of them had 2 persons who were under the bed net at night. The usage rate of bed-nets accounted for over 49.1%.

The workshop will present a new concept to carry out resilience testing of health systems against potential future shocks and adverse scenarios based on the opinion of the European Commission's Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health. This will be followed by a discussion with experts on the practical development and implementation of this methodology. Format of the workshop: Pitch on the resilience testing concept by a member of the Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health (10 minutes). Responses by experts from three EU Member States and discussion (40 minutes). Concluding remarks by the OECD and the Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (10 minutes).

These enzymes inactivate or activate other soluble or membrane-expressed mediator molecules, which enables them to control developmental processes, tissue remodelling, inflammatory responses and proliferative signalling pathways. The dysregulation of MMPs and ADAMs has long been recognized in acute kidney injury and in chronic kidney disease, and genetic targeting of selected MMPs and ADAMs in different mouse models of kidney disease showed that they can have detrimental and protective roles. In particular, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 have been shown to have a mainly profibrotic effect and might therefore represent therapeutic targets. Each of these proteases has been associated with a different profibrotic pathway that involves tissue remodelling, Wnt--catenin signalling, stem cell factor-c-kit signalling, IL-6 trans-signalling or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling. Broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors have been used to treat fibrotic kidney diseases experimentally but more targeted approaches have since been developed, including inhibitory antibodies, to avoid the toxic side effects initially observed with broad-spectrum inhibitors. These advances not only provide a solid foundation for additional preclinical studies but also encourage further translation into clinical research.","output":"Key metalloproteinase-mediated pathways in the kidney."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections, especially Influenza (endemic) or SARS-CoV-2 (pandemic since 2020), cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite remarkable progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, they are clearly impacted by the rapid emergence of viral variants. The development of an off-the-shelf, effective, safe, and low-cost drug for prophylaxis against respiratory viral infections is a major unmet medical need. Here, we developed NanoSTING, a liposomally encapsulated formulation of the endogenous STING agonist, 2-3 cGAMP, to function as an immunoantiviral. NanoSTING rapidly activates the bodys innate immune system to facilitate a broad-spectrum antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza variants in hamsters and mice. We demonstrate that a single intranasal dose of NanoSTING can: (1) treat infections throughout the respiratory system and minimize clinical symptoms, (2) protect against highly pathogenic strains of SARS-CoV-2 (alpha and delta), (3) provide durable protection against reinfection from the same strains without the need for retreatment, (4) prevent transmission of the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strain, and (5) provide protection against both oseltamivir-sensitive and resistant strains of influenza. Mechanistically, administration of NanoSTING rapidly upregulated interferon-stimulated and antiviral pathways in both the nasal turbinates and lung. Our results support using NanoSTING as a thermostable, immunoantiviral with broad-spectrum antiviral properties making it appealing as a therapeutic for prophylactic or early post-exposure treatment.","output":"An intranasal nanoparticle STING agonist has broad protective immunity against respiratory viruses and variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex disease that causes illness ranging from mild to severe respiratory problems.

Prescreening, defined as identifying potentially eligible patients using select eligibility criteria, may streamline the process and increase study enrollment. We describe the real-world experience of implementing a standardized, universal clinical research prescreening protocol within a VA cancer center and its impact on research enrollment. Methods: An IRB approved prescreening protocol was implemented at the VACT Cancer Center in March 2017. All patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of cancer are identified through tumor boards, oncology consults, and clinic lists. Research coordinators perform chart review and manually enter patient demographics, cancer type and stage, and treatment history into a REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database. All clinical trials and their eligibility criteria are also entered into REDCap and updated regularly. REDCap generates real time lists of potential research studies for each patient based on his/her recorded data. The primary oncologist is alerted to a patient's potential eligibility prior to upcoming clinic visits and thus can plan to discuss clinical research enrollment as appropriate. Results: From March 2017 to December 2020, a total of 2548 unique patients were prescreened into REDCAP. The mean age was 71.5 years, 97.5% were male, and 15.5% were African American. 32.57 % patients had genitourinary cancer, 17.15% had lung cancer, and 46.15% were undergoing malignancy workup. 1412 patients were potentially eligible after prescreening and 556 patients were ultimately enrolled in studies. The number of patients enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials increased after the implementation of the prescreening protocol (35 in 2017, 64 in 2018, 78 in 2019, and 55 in 2020 despite the COVID19 pandemic). Biorepository study enrollment increased from 8 in 2019 to 15 in 2020. The prescreening protocol also enabled 200 patients to be enrolled onto a lung nodule liquid biopsy study from 2017 to 2019. Our prescreening process captured 98.57% of lung cancer patients entered into the cancer registry during the same time period. Conclusions: Universal prescreening streamlined research recruitment operations and was associated with yearly increases in clinical research enrollment at a VA cancer center. Our protocol identified most new lung cancer patients, suggesting that, at least for this malignancy, potential study patients were not missed. The protocol was integral in our program becoming the top accruing VA site for NCI's National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN) studies since 2019.","output":"Improving hematology/oncology clinical research recruitment via universal prescreening: The VA Connecticut (VACT) Cancer Center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic, with subsequent profound impact on the entire health care system.

Developed in 2000, there have been calls for greater academic involvement in development of SROI, which to date has been more typically implemented in-house or by consultants. This protocol describes a systematic review of SROI analysis conducted on health and social care programmes which represent a significant sector of social enterprise internationally. The aims of the systematic review are to (1) identify the extent to which academics have adopted SROI methodology, (2) how academics have interpreted, used and developed SROI methodology and (3) to assess the quality of studies published under peer review. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The systematic review will include peer-reviewed studies since 2000 published in English. Search terms will be 'social return on investment' or 'SROI'. Health and social care interventions will be identified in the initial screening given the proliferation of possible key words in these areas. Databases to be searched include Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, Social Care Online and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Two reviewers will independently conduct initial screening based on titles and abstracts against the inclusion criteria. Data extracted will include date of intervention, country, study design, aim of intervention/programme, participants and setting, health and social care measures used, and SROI ratio. The quality of studies will be assessed by two reviewers using a SROI quality framework designed for the purpose of this study.

However, lockdown measures used to mitigate transmission have affected human behavior and altered lifestyles, with a likely impact on chronic non-communicable diseases. More than a year into the pandemic, substantial peer-reviewed literature has emerged on altered lifestyles following the varying lockdown measures imposed globally to control the virus spread. Objective: To explore the impact of lockdown measures on the six lifestyle factors, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social connectedness, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Methods: We comprehensively searched PubMed and the World Health Organizations global literature database on COVID-19 and retrieved 649 relevant articles for the narrative review. A critical interpretative synthesis of the articles was performed. Results: Most of the articles included in the review identified the negative effect of lockdown measures on each of the lifestyle factors in many parts of the world. Interestingly, encouraging lifestyle trends were also highlighted in a few articles. Such trends can positively influence the outcome of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to better understand the negative impact of strict lockdown measures on lifestyles. At the same time, it helps us identify and initiate positive behavioral changes, which, if consolidated, could improve chronic disease outcomes. It is up to governments, communities, and healthcare/academic entities to derive benefit from lessons learned from the pandemic, with the ultimate objective of better educating and promoting healthy lifestyles among communities.","output":"COVID-19 Lockdown and Lifestyles C A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linfomas foliculares s?o uma rara forma de distrbio linfoproliferativo descrita em medicina veterinria.

METHOD: An exploratory mixed-methods study comprising a survey (n=77) and semistructured interviews (n=6) with Australian psychiatrists participating in a PRG in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: Qualitative findings indicate that PRGs address experiential learning through a focus on both breadth and specificity of work, as well as participants experiences. Participants described using PRGs as a forum to manage difficult and complex work (through critiquing work, learning from one another, considering theory and guidelines, benchmarking, validating, reflecting and generalising learning) and to manage stress and well-being associated with crises, everyday stress and professional isolation. Particular structural aspects of PRGs considered essential to achieve these functions were self-selection of members, self-direction of meeting content and provision of a safe environment. These findings were convergent with the quantitative findings from scale survey data. Difficulties experienced during PRG participation are also described. CONCLUSION: Qualitative and quantitative findings from psychiatry PRGs demonstrate how practice-based professional experience functions as both a source of learning and of collegial connection that contributes to well-being and reduction in professional stress.

The article was supported by research from Prof Henry J. Spooner, who had been researching and campaigning on the ill-effects of noise and its economic impact. The article sparked subsequent discussion and follow-up articles in the Daily Mail and its international partners. In an era of rapid technological change, that was on the cusp of implementing sound pressure measurements, the Daily Mail, in collaboration with the Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd, experimented with sound recording technology and commentary in the field to help communicate perceived loudness and identify the sources of \\"unnecessary noise\\". This resulted in the making of series of environmental sound recordings from five locations across central London during September 1928, the findings of which were documented and discussed in the Daily Mail at the time, and two recordings commercially released by Columbia on shellac gramophone disc. This was probably the first concerted anti-noise campaign of this type and scale, requiring huge technological efforts. The regulatory bodies and politicians of the time reviewed and improved the policies around urban noise shortly after the presentation of the recordings, which were also broadcast from the BBC both nationally and internationally, and many members of the public congratulated and thanked the Daily Mail for such an initiative.

One way of assessing cardiac resynchronization therapy is with ECG analysis. Artificial intelligence is increasing in terms of everyday usability due to the possibility of everyday workflow improvement and, as a result, shortens the time required for diagnosis.

However, the accumulation of fluids in the first days of PARDS is associated with adverse outcome. As such, early fluid restriction may prove beneficial, yet the effects of such a fluid strategy on the cardio-pulmonary physiology in PARDS is unclear. In this study, we compared the effect of a restrictive to a liberal fluid strategy on hemodynamic response and the formation of pulmonary edema in an animal model of PARDS. METHODS Sixteen mechanically ventilated lambs (2-6 weeks) received oleic acid infusion to induce PARDS and were randomized to a restrictive or liberal fluid strategy during a 6-hour period of mechanical ventilation. Transpulmonary thermodilution determined extravascular lung water (EVLW) and cardiac output (CO) Post-mortem lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were obtained by gravimetry. RESULTS Restricting fluids significantly reduced fluid intake, but increased use of vasopressors among animals with PARDS. Arterial blood pressure was similar between groups, yet CO declined significantly in animals receiving restrictive fluids (p=0.005). There was no difference in EVLW over time (p=0.111) and lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (6.1 IQR 6.0-7.3 vs. 7.1 IQR 6.6-9.4 restrictive vs. liberal, p=0.725) between fluid strategies. CONCLUSIONS Both fluid strategies stabilized blood pressure in this model, yet early fluid restriction abated CO.

A virus is a submicroscopic and intracellular parasite that can propagate only inside a living cell. The obligatory nature of a virus brought a debate on whether it is living or nonliving. Virology, as a discipline that studies the diverse aspects of viral infection of host cells and its consequence, became established during the early 20th century. Viruses are found in almost all living organisms on earth, ranging from bacteria, fungi, and amoeba, to plants and animals. Viruses are classified into seven groups, according to genomic features. This molecular classification, also called the Baltimore classification, allows us to predict precisely the mode of viral genome replication.","output":"Discovery and Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To explore the significance of coagulation and immune function indicators in clinical diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Nine countries have reported more than 20 000 infection cases in total and nearly 8000 lives have been lost. The actual death toll is likely much higher than this figure; the death rate is as high as 70%, considering confirmed cases. The Ebola virus launches its destruction by shutting down the hosts innate and adaptive immune systems. The virus then replicates itself out of control and causes a cytokine storm in the host. Consequently, the hosts overdriven immune system attacks its own endothelial cells and this leads to multiple organ hemorrhagic damage, the host dies of septic shock finally. Under current circumstances where no specific interventions have shown effectiveness against the virus, our opinions are justified in applying a non-specific anti-viral approach during the incubation period of virus infection as an essential protection to put the hosts immune system into an alert state and henceforth to slow down the viral replication. When the viral infection proceeds to the terminal stage, the key factor would be applying a non-specific immune modulation approach to suppress the cytokine storm that causes multiple organ failure, in an attempt to open a time window for the hosts immune system to recover.","output":"Against Ebola: type I interferon guard risk and mesenchymal stromal cell combat sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary cardiac tumors are rare, and myxoma is a rare benign primary cardiac tumor in adults, commonly found within the left atrium.

PfPMV is necessary for parasite viability and has become a novel promising target for antimalarial therapy. The first recombinant expression of soluble, active PfPMV as thioredoxin fusion proteins is reported herein. Two truncated forms of PfPMV were fused to thioredoxin (Trx) to generate Trx-PfPMVp37 and Trx-PfPMVm84. The fusion proteins were successfully purified using Ni(2+) affinity chromatography in combination with ATP treatment to eliminate Escherichia coli HSP60 contaminant. Trx-PfPMVm84 could hydrolyze the PEXEL-containing peptides more efficiently than Trx-PfPMVp37. Interestingly, both Trx-PfPMVs preferred to cleave PfEMP2 peptide over HRPII peptide. The replacement of Ser with Val or Glu at P1' position created a substrate with 75% reduction in the enzyme activity, whereas the substitution of Ile with Lys or Glu at P2 position reduced the cleavage efficiency by 30%. The activity of Trx-PfPMVm84 was inhibited by PMSF and nelfinavir but not by pepstatin A. After the removal of Trx domain, activities of both enzymes toward PfEMP2 and HRPII peptides were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten model to determine kinetic parameters. The Km values toward both peptides were apparently much lower than the previously reported data although with similar kcat values. Along with an improved PfPMV preparation protocol, these findings have provided insights into its substrate specificity at P2 and P1' positions as well as interactions among the enzyme, substrates, and inhibitors.","output":"Plasmodium falciparum Plasmepsin V (PfPMV): Insights into recombinant expression, substrate specificity and active site structure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intriguing aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the high rate of spread and rapid progression of pneumonitis. Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to quickly build the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage of past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor ?3? cells are in the first line of defense, activated by stress molecules and recognizing some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex-independent but still specific, eg, cytomegalovirus, as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism-both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2. Most deaths occur due to pneumonitis, in the course of which overwhelming inflammation impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails and, therefore, patients at risk, mostly the elderly, show higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and enhanced inflammation in the lungs. Apparently, there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype-associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, considering the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these 2 immunotherapeutic tools is understandable based on basic immunology and this knowledge may direct the efforts of the medical community aimed at combating the virus.","output":"Ability of the immune system to fight viruses highlighted by cytometry and T-cell receptor clonotype assessment: lessons taken before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Certified registered nurse anaesthetics (CRNAs) in Sweden were transferred at short notice to work with seriously ill patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, which is not part of the CRNAs specialist area. However, limited research has shed light on healthcare professionals experiences of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: This study illuminates CRNAs experiences of working in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study used a qualitative method with an inductive approach to interview nurse anaesthetists who worked in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: The participants experienced ambivalent feelings towards their work in the ICU. They also lacked information, which created feelings of uncertainty and resulted in expectations that did not correspond to the reality. They described that due to an inadequate introduction, they could only provide sufficient care, which in many cases caused ethical stress. Not being able to get to know their new colleagues well enough to create effective cooperation created frustration. Even though the participants experienced the work in the ICU as demanding and challenging, overall, they enjoyed their time in the ICU and were treated well by their colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: While CRNAs cannot replace intensive care nurses (ICNs), they are a useful resource in the ICU in the care of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare workers who are allocated from their ordinary units to the ICU need adequate information and support from their work managers to be able to provide the best possible care and to stay healthy themselves.","output":"The value of getting to know your colleaguesWho will do it if I dont?

Limited is known about the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). AIM: Evaluate clinical characteristics, course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who did not require RRT and those on dialysis. DESIGN: A two-center retrospective study. METHODS: A total of 836 adult patients with COVID-19 (24 CKD not on dialysis; 15 dialysis-dependent CKD) were included. The study includes no patients with renal transplantation. Risk factors were explored. RESULTS: CKD not requiring RRT is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.35 (95% CI 2.41-22.44)] and poor prognosis [aOR 3.01 (95% CI 1.23-7.33)]. Compared with COVID-19 cases without CKD, those with CKD not requiring RRT showed similar percentage of initial moderate cases (75.00% vs. 73.65%) but higher incidence of in-hospital neutrophilia (50.00% vs. 27.30%) or death (50.00% vs. 9.03%). The odds ratio of dialysis associated to mortality in CKD patients was 2.00 (95% CI 0.52-7.63), suggesting COVID-19 patients with dialysis-dependent CKD were at greater risk of in-hospital death. For COVID-19 patients with CKD not requiring RRT, statins reduced the risk of neutrophilia [OR 0.10 (95% CI 0.01-0.69)] while diuretics increased the risk of neutrophilia [OR 15.4 (95% CI 1.47-160.97)], although both showed no association to mortality.

Sugar-tong splinting has been shown to maintain acceptable reduction in pediatric distal radius fractures while potentially avoiding issues associated with circumferential casting. We hypothesized that the sugar-tong splint would be an acceptable method for initial immobilization to prevent LOR in distal, mid-shaft, and proximal pediatric forearm fractures. METHODS This is an IRB-approved, retrospective study. Inclusion criteria included pediatric patients age 4 to 16 years old, open growth plates, with a displaced forearm fracture (radius, ulna, or both bone) that underwent closed reduction. The clinical protocol involved closed reduction and application of a sugar-tong splint by an orthopaedic resident under conscious sedation in the emergency room. Clinical follow-up occurred at 1, 2, 4, and 6-week intervals with a long-arm cast overwrap applied at the initial clinic visit. Primary outcome was radiographic LOR which was defined as a change of >10 degrees of angulation on anterior posterior/lateral projections from initial postreduction radiograph or previous follow-up radiograph. The secondary outcome was the need for further intervention. RESULTS Sixty-four (38%) patients demonstrated radiographic LOR with 90% of LORs occurring in the first 2 weeks. LOR was significantly more common in distal radius fractures [48/110 (44%)] than with either proximal [2/14 (14%), P=0.04] or mid-shaft radius fractures [7/41 (17%), P=0.004]. There was no difference in LOR by location for ulna fractures [proximal=2/13 (15%), middle=4/38 (11%), distal=20/77 (26%), P>0.08]. There was no difference in radial LOR in patients with isolated radius fractures compared with both bone forearm fracture (17/40 vs. 40/125, P=0.22), or ulnar LOR between isolated ulna and both bone forearm fracture (0/3 vs. 26/125, P>0.99). CONCLUSION The sugar-tong splint is effective at maintaining reduction of pediatric forearm fractures similar to published rates for casting. While effective at all levels of the forearm, the sugar-tong splint performed best in proximal and mid-shaft forearm fractures.

Irinotecan and temozolomide (IT) is a frequently used therapy with an established toxicity profile. Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody with demonstrated activity in CNS tumors. Therefore, the combination of these agents has therapeutic potential in CNS tumors. The objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of escalating dose IT combined with a fixed dose of bevacizumab (BIT) in children with relapsed/refractory CNS tumors. METHODS A phase I trial was performed in a 3 + 3 design. Therapy toxicities and radiologic responses to treatment were described. RESULTS One hundred eighty cycles of therapy were administered to 26 patients. The MTD of BIT was dose level 1, (bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15, irinotecan 125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, and temozolomide 125 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of 28-day cycles).

However, environmental toxicology and lack of modifiability restrict their further development. In this study, a simple and economic method was established to fabricate lignin and silver hybrid nanoparticles (Lig-Ag NPs) with bactericidal ability. Afterwards, material characterization, bactericidal evaluation, and mechanism exploration were implemented to explore the properties of Lig-Ag NPs. The results indicated that Lig-Ag NPs not only demonstrated remarkable dispersity, uniformity, and encapsulation efficiency but also possessed approximated bactericidal ability on Escherichia coli and better durability compared with the same concentration of Ag NPs on E. coli. On the other hand, flow cytometry and transcriptomic analysis were used to further explore the bactericidal mechanism of Lig-Ag NPs. The results showed that oxidative stress was the possible leading bactericidal mechanism of Lig-Ag NPs. The formation approaches of reactive oxygen species production were various including the slow release of silver ion and generation of quinone/semi-quinone radicals on account of the combined effect of lignin and silver.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented healthcare crisis in recent times with effects reverberating in all spheres of human lives. India has registered the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. This paper aims to dwell in the religious and social background of Kumbh Mela massive gathering, as well as the ritualistic practices that could potentially entail public health risks in the current situation. It also aims to identify possible preparatory and interventional measures to evade such risks. Recent Findings: In recent years, the increase in the number of people attending the Kumbh Mela has been phenomenal. Congregants are put up at the holy sites for several days. The sheer number of people assembling at the religious venues poses a great challenge to manage the crowds, to cater to the requirements of basic amenities, and to meet their healthcare needs. Some of the ritualistic practices could heighten the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated over the past few months in India. The pandemic is expected to sustain its tempo in India throughout the foreseeable future. Organization of the forthcoming Kumbh Mela needs meticulous planning.

The World Health Organization recommends eyelid surgery to reduce the risk of visual impairment from trichiasis. Unfortunately, the number of cases operated has grown less than expected. An understanding of barriers is fundamental for instituting measures to increase surgical uptake. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore barriers of TT surgery implementation. METHODS: A qualitative study design was employed in December 2019. Purposive sampling technique was used to select three districts from Gamo zone, Southern Ethiopia. We conducted 9 FGDs and 12 in-depth interviews. Data was collected by audio tape recorder in Amharic and Gamogna languages and then transcribed to English language. The recorded interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed to verbatim (written text) and thematic analysis was done manually and reported accordingly. FINDINGS: we explored a number of barriers that hindered implementation of trichiasis surgery. The recurrence of trichiasis after surgery was the main challenges faced by operated individuals. The other barriers reported are negative perception towards trichiasis surgery, lack of logistic and supplies, transportation access problem for remote communities, inadequate trained health professional, less commitment from higher officials, lack of interest of integrated eye care workers due to incentive issues, believes of patients waiting supernatural power for healing service and carelessness of patients to undertake operation. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Post-surgical trichiasis, lack of commitment from government officials and negative perception of patients towards the disease were considered as the reported barriers for implementation of trachomatous trichiasis. Closely supervising the integrated eye care workers would be the first task for district health offices to increase the uptake and improve the quality of service.

If efficacy is demonstrated, the treatment of placebo volunteers becomes an issue. For COVID-19 vaccine trials, there is broad consensus that placebo volunteers should be offered a vaccine once efficacy has been established. This will likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine arm, thus complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the vaccine efficacy profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy profile. We only require that the vaccine efficacy profile applies to the newly vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards regression model and explore via simulation the implications of placebo crossover for estimation of vaccine efficacy under different efficacy dynamics and study designs.

BACKGROUND: Care homes provide long-term care to vulnerable, frail older people, as well as to young people with profound disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the residential care sector has been seriously affected in many parts of the world and has exposed major flaws and vulnerabilities in infection control and other processes that have resulted in considerable loss of life of residents of these facilities. DESIGN: Discursive paper informed by a systematic literature. Review was carried out in line with PRISMA reporting guidelines. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO on 2020 [CRD42020211847]. RESULTS: The review identified six papers meeting inclusion criteria across care residential facilities in different countries. Several prevention and mitigation strategies were identified to manage and reduce the spread and severity of viral respiratory infection pandemics. These strategies include isolation, restriction of movement, personal protective and hygienic measures, health education and information sharing, monitoring and coordination, and screening and treatment. Preparedness strategies identified were contingency planning such as reporting/communication, leadership, human resource, insurance, occupational health and resource availability. The prevention/mitigation and preparedness strategies helped to achieve decline in disease severity, reduced prevalence, reduced spread of the disease, improved readiness criteria, resource usefulness and increased intervention acceptability. This paper presents a conceptual framework exploring the interconnectedness of preparedness and prevention/ mitigation strategies and associated outcomes. We discuss areas of concern in the context of workforce employment patterns in the sector. Concerns related to the unintended consequences of strategies placed on aged care facilities, which may worsen mental health outcomes for residents, are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Persons in residential care settings are at greater risk of infection during a pandemic, and therefore, strict measures to protect their safety are warranted. However, they are also a group who already experience social isolation and so any measures involving restrictions to visiting and social interaction, particularly over the longer term, must be accompanied by strategies to mitigate potential loneliness and mental health sequelae arising from long-term pandemic restrictions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Though there was evidence of activity in preparedness for disasters within the residential care sector, various contextual factors affecting the sector were clearly not adequately considered or addressed in pre-pandemic disaster planning, particularly in the areas of staff movements between care homes and the length of time that social isolation and restriction measures would need to be in place. Future pandemic planning should consider the nature of the workforce model in the care home sector, and factor in strategies to better support the mobile and highly casualised workforce.","output":"Preparedness for viral respiratory infection pandemic in residential aged care facilities: A review of the literature to inform post-COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although obesity is a risk factor for infection, whether it has the same effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) need confirming.

The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications. MethodsCOVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [a?] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant. ResultsOf 276 patients (mean age 59 {+/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [a?] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [a?] 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [a?] 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [a?] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [a?]2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer [a?] 3000 ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint. ConclusionsAdmission MOCHA with [a?] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events.

Starting with a panel dataset of county observations over time, we used coarsened exact matching to create smaller but more similar sets of communities that differ primarily in social capital. Controlling for several factors, including politics and governance, health care quality, and demographic characteristics, we find that bonding and linking social capital reduce the toll of COVID-19 on communities.

For several diseases, the periodontium and gingiva are at the center of this oral-systemic link. Over 50 systemic conditions have been specifically associated with gingival and periodontal inflammation, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have recently been elevated from simple associations to elegant, mechanistic investigations. IBD and periodontitis have been reported to impact each others progression via a bidirectional relationship whereby chronic oral or intestinal inflammation can impact the other; however, the precise mechanisms for how this occurs remain unclear. Classically, the etiology of gingival inflammation (gingivitis) is oral microbial dysbiosis in the subgingival crevice that can lead to destructive periodontal disease (periodontitis); however, the current understanding of gingival involvement in IBD is that it may represent a separate disease entity from classical gingivitis, arising from mechanisms related to systemic inflammatory activation of niche-resident immune cells. Synthesizing available evidence, we hypothesize that once established, IBD can be driven by microbiomial and inflammatory changes originating specifically from the gingival niche through saliva, thereby worsening IBD outcomes and thus perpetuating a vicious cycle. In this review, we introduce the concept of the gumCgut axis as a framework for examining this reciprocal relationship between the periodontium and the gastrointestinal tract.

The results indicated that M. alba oil vapour &#8805; 450 L/L provided effective antifungal activity against natural moulds on brown rice for at least 90 days of storage at 25 C at 100% RH. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of M. alba oil vapour for enhancing consumer preference and acceptance of cooked brown rice was 300-600 L/L with a rejection threshold of 2,052 L/L. Moreover, it was found that linalool was the main key component and caryophyllene and ?-elemene were the minor components affecting the sensory quality enhancement. Interestingly, the EEG results showed that fragrant cooked brown rice could increase the power of alpha and beta waves in the human brain, indicating anti-stress effects and a relaxed mood. Therefore, M. alba oil vapour demonstrated good potential to enhance consumer acceptance and preference for cooked brown rice while controlling the significant growth of moulds in brown rice.","output":"The effects of Michelia alba oil against mould on brown rice and assessing the brain response using electroencephalogram (EEG)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Eating difficulties coupled with cardiorespiratory spells delay acquisition of feeding milestones in convalescing neonates, and the mechanisms are unclear Aims were to examine and compare the pharyngoesophageal-cardiorespiratory (PECR) response characteristics: (a) in control neonates and those with recurrent bradycardia spells;and (b) during pharyngeal stimulation when bradycardia occurs versus when no bradycardia occurs METHODS: Preterm infants (N = 40, 27  3 weeks gestation), underwent concurrent pharyngoesophageal manometry, electrocardiography, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and nasal airflow thermistor to evaluate pharyngoesophageal motility, heart rate (HR), and respiration during graded abrupt pharyngeal sterile water stimuli Infants with recurrent bradycardia (N = 28) and controls (N = 12) were evaluated at 38 (38-40) and 39 (38-40) weeks postmenstrual age, respectively Comparisons were performed (a) between study and control groups;and (b) among HR responses of &lt;80 BPM, 80-100 BPM, and &gt;100 BPM RESULTS: Overall, characteristics of PECR responses in infants with a history of recurrent bradycardia (vs controls) did not differ (p &gt; 05) However, when pharyngeal stimulus induced severe bradycardia (&lt;80 BPM): prolonged respiratory rhythm change, increased pharyngeal activity, increased esophageal dysmotility (as evidenced by prolonged esophageal inhibition and motor activity), and prolonged lower esophageal sphincter relaxation were noted (all p &lt; 05) CONCLUSIONS: In control infants and those with recurrent bradycardia, pharyngeal stimulation results in similar PECR response characteristics However, when severe bradycardia occurs, PECR response characteristics are distinct The mechanisms of severe bradycardia spells are related to abnormal prolongation of vagal inhibitory effects on cardiorespiratory rhythms in conjunction with prolonged esophageal inhibition and delays with terminal swallow","output":"Mechanisms of bradycardia in premature infants: Aerodigestive-cardiac regulatory-rhythm interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The introduction of newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiencies (NBS SCID) in 2010 was a significant public health milestone. While SCID was the primary target, several other conditions associated with severe T-cell lymphopenia (TCL) have subsequently been identified as secondary targets. The differential diagnosis in infants with an abnormal TREC result on NBS SCID who do not meet criteria for typical SCID is often broad, and often the evaluation of these conditions requires immunological and functional testing, in conjunction with genetic analysis, to obtain an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate management and treatment plan. OBJECTIVE We describe here three infants identified by NBS SCID, who required additional work-up as they did not have a typical SCID phenotype and meet the relevant diagnostic criteria. Genetic testing identified pathogenic variants in ATM in all 3 patients, and the pathogenicity of the variants was confirmed by a functional flow cytometry assay. METHODS The patients underwent immunological and genetic work-up to identify an underlying cause of their abnormal NBS SCID. AT was suspected based on clinical and family history, and immunological analyses. The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients with a rapid functional flow cytometric assay and genetic testing. RESULTS A rapid functional flow cytometry assay was used as a diagnostic and confirmatory tool, in conjunction with genetic testing, to make a diagnosis of AT. Experimental validation of the causal relationship between genotype and phenotype allowed for expeditious diagnosis, which facilitated early discussions with families regarding prognosis, treatment, and management. CONCLUSION Even with increased rapidity and access to genetic results, functional testing is required for clinical diagnosis in infants identified by NBS SCID who do not fit into the classic categories or have novel genetic variants to confirm the diagnosis. Consideration should be given to the use of functional assays as an essential component of an integrated evaluation to characterize the genetics and mechanisms of inborn errors of immunity.","output":"Functional Confirmation of DNA Repair Defect in Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) Infants Identified by Newborn Screening for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (NBS SCID)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using photo-epidemiology, we found extreme variation in COVID-19 related face covering use in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (97%); Lima, Peru (86%); Kerala, India (41%); Cuernavaca, Mexico (25%); Atlanta, USA (21%); and Kinshasa, DRC (4%) probably attributable to differences in population experience with face coverings and variations in timing and implementation of relevant advisories.","output":"Photo-epidemiology to estimate face covering use in select areas in Asia versus the Americas and Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is crucial for policymakers to understand the community prevalence of COVID-19 so combative resources can be effectively allocated and prioritized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditionally, community prevalence has been assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However, despite the increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been met in most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method for communities to determine disease prevalence. This is further complicated by the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and spread varies across different spatial, temporal, and demographics. In this study, we understand trends in the spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms surveys as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess community disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability. Using individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method predicts the likely percentage of the population that tested positive for COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 60.40\\\\% with 95\\\\% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67).

Systemic involvement in COVID-19 is due to the ubiquitous expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, responsible for the entry in the cells of SARS-CoV-2, Several reports in humans and animal models showed a significant ACE2 mRNA expression in hypothalamus and pituitary cells. Moreover, higher mortality and poorer outcomes have been widely described in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetes and vertebral fractures, which are all highly prevalent in subjects with pituitary dysfunctions. AIM: To review the main endocrine manifestations of COVID-19 with their possible implications for pituitary diseases, the possible direct and indirect involvement of the pituitary gland in COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of established pituitary diseases which can be already at increased risk for worse outcomes and on neurosurgical activities as well as vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our review underlines that there could be a specific involvement of the pituitary gland which fits into a progressively shaping endocrine phenotype of COVID-19. Moreover, the care for pituitary diseases need to continue despite the restrictions due to the emergency. Several pituitary diseases, such as hypopituitarism and Cushing disease, or due to frequent comorbidities such as diabetes may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in affected patients.

Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and other pathogens. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase a smaller fraction of cases contacts can be traced, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between increasing cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number R(t), and the implications for infection dynamics using deterministic and stochastic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2. We found that R(t) increased sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because R(t) initially increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing R(t) (but minimizing total infections may be more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy decreased sharply with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in R(t) can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also highlight the synergistic value of high capacity, easy access testing and rapid turn-around of testing results, and outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic cases to be tested immediately after symptom onset.","output":"Contact tracing efficiency, transmission heterogeneity, and accelerating COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The directional nature of the link between anxiety and tinnitus has not been verified. COVID-19 has added stress to involved residents and provided a good opportunity to discover if anxiety/stress plays a causative/promotive role to tinnitus. Methods: A retrospective research design was used to compare the tinnitus clinics between the patients in 2020 under COVID-19 and those from the matching period in 2019. While anxiety was quantified using the Zungs Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the test of minimum masking level (MML). The assessments were repeated after two months of therapy with sound therapy + educational counselling (STEC) or EC alone. Results: A large increase in anxiety was evident in 2020 in both case rate and SAS. The treatment of both methods was less effective in 2020. SAS, THI and MML were all deteriorated after the EC alone treatment in 2020, while an improvement was seen in 2019. Discussion: The differences between years and between treatment methods suggest that EC alone could not counteract the stress by COVID-19 at all, and the stress, if not managed well, can significantly increase the severity of tinnitus and associated anxiety. Conclusions: By using the EC subgroup in virtual control, we conclude that anxiety can serve as a promoting factor to tinnitus.

Those Sorting Units are composed of low-income workers that rely on the selling of the waste as their main revenue source. However, the trading of the sorted residues hinges on the commercial interest from buyers, therefore only a few materials of interest are potentially recyclable, while the rest ends up being discarded in landfills or open-air dumps all over the country. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has observed a significant increase in the consumption and generation of polymeric packaging waste throughout 2020 and 2021. Particularly, expanded polystyrene (EPS) packaging has its use risen mostly due to lockdown measures and the consequent increase in delivery services and takeout meals. Despite the low cost and practicability of single-use packaging in terms of food safety, some materials are considered problematic regarding their recyclability, such as the case of EPS. This chapter addresses the case study of EPS packaging waste in two cities of southern Brazil, over recyclability issues considering social, environmental, economic, and political spheres. The possibilities for increasing the recyclability of EPS in Brazil are discussed as well as the main challenges of making the waste more interesting for potential buyers. In general, being EPS a notable low-cost and lightweight commodity, its transport as a residue for reuse purposes often is hampered by logistics costs, as well as the low intrinsic value of the recycled material for application in different products. Finally, we propose a new application of chemically recycled EPS as a gemstone for application in contemporary jewelry, using silver recovered from scrap sources. The material recycling and the gemstone manufacturing processes are described using simplified techniques as a way to permit its replication by both jewelry professionals and untrained workers, aiming at valorizing the residue. Parting from an extremely inexpensive material with a low-quality perception, we discuss the opportunities of the trash-to-treasure transformation as a way to potentially increase the material value and consequently the revenue of the Sorting Units workers, while reducing its environmental impact. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Possibilities for the Recovery and Valorization of Single-Use EPS Packaging Waste Following Its Increasing Generation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSVI) is an acute medical and social problem in many countries globally.

Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. The economic and social impact is without precedent. Thus, it is important to quickly assess the situation and perception of the population. Large-scale online surveys have been shown to be an effective tool for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the situation and perception of the Spanish population in four key areas related to the COVID-19 pandemic: social contact behavior during confinement, personal economic impact, labor situation, and health status. METHODS: We obtained a large sample using an online survey with 24 questions related to COVID-19 in the week of March 28-April 2, 2020, during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 156,614 participants via social media posts that targeted the general adult population (age >18 years). Given such a large sample, the 95% CI was 0.843 for all reported proportions. RESULTS: Regarding social behavior during confinement, participants mainly left their homes to satisfy basic needs. We found several statistically significant differences in social behavior across genders and age groups. The population's willingness to comply with the confinement measures is evident. From the survey answers, we identified a significant adverse economic impact of the pandemic on those working in small businesses and a negative correlation between economic damage and willingness to stay in confinement. The survey revealed that close contacts play an important role in the transmission of the disease, and 28% of the participants lacked the necessary resources to properly isolate themselves. We also identified a significant lack of testing, with only 1% of the population tested and 6% of respondents unable to be tested despite their doctor's recommendation. We developed a generalized linear model to identify the variables that were correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Using this model, we estimated an average of 5% for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Spanish population during the time of the study. A seroprevalence study carried out later by the Spanish Ministry of Health reported a similar level of disease prevalence (5%).

However, the origins and global transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown. We aimed to characterize the origination and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on evolutionary dynamics. METHODS: Using the full-length sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with intact geographic, demographic, and temporal information worldwide from the GISAID database during 26 December 2019 and 30 November 2020, we constructed the transmission tree to depict the evolutionary process by the R package outbreaker. The affinity of the mutated receptor-binding region of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was predicted using mCSM-PPI2 software. Viral infectivity and antigenicity were tested in ACE2-transfected HEK293T cells by pseudovirus transfection and neutralizing antibody test. RESULTS: From 26 December 2019 to 8 March 2020, early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 strains identified worldwide were mainly composed of three clusters: the Europe-based cluster including two USA-based sub-clusters; the Asia-based cluster including isolates in China, Japan, the USA, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, and Italy; and the USA-based cluster. The SARS-CoV-2 strains identified in the USA formed four independent clades while those identified in China formed one clade. After 8 March 2020, the clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains tended to be independent and became pure in each of the major countries. Twenty-two of 60 mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were predicted to increase the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. Of all predicted mutants, the number of E484K was the largest one with 86 585 sequences, followed by S477N with 55 442 sequences worldwide. In more than ten countries, the frequencies of the isolates with E484K and S477N increased significantly. V367F and N354D mutations increased the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses (P < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 with V367F was more sensitive to the S1-targeting neutralizing antibody than the wild-type counterpart (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 strains might have originated in several countries simultaneously under certain evolutionary pressure. Travel restrictions might cause location-specific SARS-CoV-2 clustering. The SARS-CoV-2 evolution appears to facilitate its transmission via altering the affinity to ACE2 or immune evasion.

The predictions of these models can be tested by examining the geographic and seasonal variation in dietary diversity. Dietary diversity is a useful tool that allows dietary comparisons across differing sampling locations and time periods. Bonobos (Pan paniscus) are considered primarily frugivorous and consume fruits, leaves, insects, vertebrates, terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and flowers. Frugivores, like bonobos, are valuable for examining dietary diversity and testing foraging models because they eat a variety of species and are subject to seasonal shifts in fruit availability. Frugivorous primate species thus allow for tests of how variation in dietary diversity is correlated with variation in ecological factors. We investigated measures of dietary diversity in bonobos at two research camps across field seasons within the same protected area (N'dele and Iyema) in Lomako Forest, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We compared the results of behavioral observation (1984/1985, 1991, 1995, 2014, and 2017) and fecal washing analysis (2007 and 2009) between seasons and study period using three diversity indices (Shannon's, Simpson's, and SW evenness). The average yearly dietary diversity indices at N'dele were Shannon's H' = 2.04, Simpson's D = 0.82, and SW evenness = 0.88 while at Iyema, the indices were Shannon's H' = 2.02, Simpson's D = 0.82, and SW evenness = 0.88. Behavioral observation data sets yielded significantly higher dietary diversity indices than fecal washing data sets. We found that food item (fruit, leaf, and flower) consumption was not associated with seasonal food availability for the 2017 behavioral observation data set. Shannon's index was lower during periods when fewer bonobo dietary items were available to consume and higher when fruit was abundant. Finally, we found that optimal diet models best-explained patterns of seasonal food availability and dietary diversity. Dietary diversity is an essential factor to consider when understanding primate diets and can be a tool in understanding variation in primate diets, particularly among frugivores. Dietary diversity varies across populations of the same species and across time, and it is critical in establishing a complete understanding of how primate diets change over time.","output":"A Test of Foraging Models Using Dietary Diversity Indices for the Lomako Forest Bonobos."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is continuing uncertainty regarding the longevity of immunological responses to both SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and COVID-19 vaccines.

We compared SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody levels by age group, sex, presence of pre-existing medical conditions, type of mRNA vaccine received and number of doses received. We investigated the effect of time since infection or vaccination on antibody levels in naturally infected individuals and two- and three-dose vaccinees. Results After two vaccine doses, neutralising antibody responses were higher in Spikevax (Moderna) recipients, females, younger individuals and those with no underlying medical conditions. However, antibody levels waned to similar levels in all groups over time. A third dose boosted these to similarly high levels in all groups. Waning was apparent among two-dose but not three-dose recipients over a period of six months. Both two and three-dose vaccine recipients showed consistently higher neutralising antibody levels compared with naturally infected individuals over the 12-week period following infection or vaccination. Conclusions Our findings support the broad use of booster doses to improve population protection from COVID-19. However, recent increases in transmission of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, even in the presence of high levels of neutralising antibody in a highly vaccinated population, point to vaccine breakthrough as an important mechanism for maintaining SARS-CoV-2 circulation and indicate the need for variant-specific or universal COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody activity in a highly vaccinated population: Longitudinal serology studies in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we employed a segmented Poisson model to analyze the available daily new cases data of the COVID-19 outbreaks in the six Western countries of the Group of Seven, namely, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, UK and USA.

ECHILD links the Hospital Episode Statistics database with the National Pupil Database, to examine relationships between health and education for children and young people in England, with particular emphasis on understanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups. Objectives We planned a programme of child, young person, parent and public involvement and engagement throughout the duration of the project. Our objectives were to i) understand the diversity of views on linking these two datasets, ii) explore how definitions of 'vulnerability' might differ to those applied by Government Departments, and iii) identify priorities for research questions that can be answered by the linked dataset. Methods We accessed three standalone patient and public involvement groups comprising 30 children, young people and parents/carers through our partner, the National Children's Bureau (NCB). The groups were i) the Young Research Advisors, ii) the Family Research Advisory Group, and iii) FLARE, which is organised through the Council for Disabled Children and commissioned by the Department for Education.

Results Children, young people and parents were keen to discuss the ECHILD Covid-19 project and have further ongoing engagement with project. Young people emphasised a need to raise awareness about the data that is routinely collected about them, and how it should contribute to research. They supported the use of the linked data - when in de-identified form and with secure access - for research to improve the health and education of children and young people.

Because of the profound impact of the epidemic, interest in the weekly mortality publication and its underlying methodology increased sharply. From inquiries and from newspaper and tabloid publications on the matter it became abundantly evident that the principles of the mortality monitoring were not well understood in general; mortality monitoring was even regularly confused with cause of death statistics. The present article therefore aims at elucidating the methodology of national mortality monitoring in Switzerland and at putting it into its public health context.","output":"Mortality monitoring in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main type of liver cancer In the majority of cases, HCC is diagnosed at the advanced stage, leading to poor prognosis In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to investigating potential new and more effective drugs and, indeed, the treatment armamentarium for advanced HCC has broadened tremendously, with targeted- and immune-therapies, and probably the combination of both, playing pivotal roles Together with new established knowledge, many issues are emerging, with the role of neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings, the definition of the best transitioning time from loco-regional treatments to systemic therapy, the identification of potential predictive biomarkers, and radiomics being just some of the topics that will have to be further explored in the next future Clearly, the current COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the management of HCC patients and some considerations about this topic will be elucidated","output":"The Growing Skyline of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatment: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted work, economy, and way of life. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. Very low optical densities from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution are reported using this BU ELISA method. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70 years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","output":"Novel ELISA Protocol Links Pre-Existing SARS-CoV-2 Reactive Antibodies With Endemic Coronavirus Immunity and Age and Reveals Improved Serologic Identification of Acute COVID-19 via Multi-Parameter Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic wounds cause considerable morbidity and utilize significant health care resources. In addition to addressing wound etiology and treating infection, regular debridement is a key component of wound care with a proven ability to accelerate healing. In this regard, a significant innovation in wound care has been the development of ultrasound debridement technology. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence behind the technology with an emphasis on noncontact low-frequency (NCLF) ultrasound. A number of studies, especially those evaluating NCLF technology, have demonstrated the potential of ultrasound debridement to effectively remove devitalized tissue, control bioburden, alleviate pain, and expedite healing. However, most of the studies are underpowered, involve heterogeneous ulcer types, and demonstrate significant methodological limitations making comparison between studies difficult; there is a paucity of data on cost-effectiveness. Future clinical trials on ultrasound debridement technology must address the design issues prevalent in current studies, and report on clinically relevant endpoints before adoption into best-practice algorithms can be recommended.","output":"Ultrasound Devices to Treat Chronic Wounds: The Current Level of Evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with iatrogenic ureteral injury litigation and outcomes. METHODS: The Westlaw legal database was queried for all iatrogenic ureteral injury cases. Variables extracted included available clinical factors, method of settlement, and litigation outcomes. Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with award amount. RESULTS: A total of 522 cases from 1961-2019 were included in the study. The most common specialty named was gynecology (353/512, 68.9%), followed by urology (89/512, 17.4%). The most common claim was intraoperative negligence (474/522 cases, 90.8%). Fifty two cases were settled or arbitrated and 470 went to trial. Settlement or arbitration was more likely in cases involving institution-only defendant (15.4% vs 7.3%, p<0.01), academic institution (19.7% vs 7.1%, p<0.01) and patient death (42.9% vs 10.7%; p<0.001). Of cases that went to trial, the verdict favored the defendant in 339/470 cases (72.1%). The median award was $552,822.96 (IQR 187,007-1,063,603).

Due to its prolonged developmental course, the central nervous system (CNS) is susceptible to numerous genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences. During embryo implantation, the CNS is more vulnerable to external influences such as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), increasing the risk for delayed fetal growth, sudden infant death syndrome, and immune system abnormalities. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of in utero exposure to ETS on neuroinflammation in the offspring of pregnant mice challenged or not with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After the confirmation of mating by the presence of the vaginal plug until offspring birth, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either 3R4F cigarettes smoke (Kentucky University) or compressed air, twice a day (1h each), for 21 days. Enhanced glial cell and mixed cell cultures were prepared from 3-day-old mouse pups. After cell maturation, both cells were stimulated with LPS or saline. To inhibit microglia activation, minocycline was added to the mixed cell culture media 24 h before LPS challenge. To verify the influence of in utero exposure to ETS on the development of neuroinflammatory events in adulthood, a different set of 8-week-old animals was submitted to the Autoimmune Experimental Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. The results indicate that cells from LPS-challenged pups exposed to ETS in utero presented high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and decreased cell viability. Such a proinflammatory environment could modulate fetal programming by an increase in microglia and astrocytes miRNA155.

We aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic changed patient response, hospital treatment and mortality from AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Admission were classified as non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or STEMI at 99 hospitals in England through live feeding from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project between 1st January, 2019 and 22nd May, 2020. Time series plots were estimated using a 7-day simple moving average, adjusted for seasonality. From 23rd March, 2020 (UK lockdown) median daily hospitalisations decreased more for NSTEMI (69 to 35; IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47-0.54) than STEMI (35 to 25; IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.80) to a nadir on 19th April, 2020. During lockdown, patients were younger (mean age 68.7 years vs. 66.9 years), less frequently diabetic (24.6% vs. 28.1%) or had cerebrovascular disease (7.0% vs. 8.6%). STEMI more frequently received primary PCI (81.8% vs 78.8%%), thrombolysis was negligible (0.5% vs. 0.3%), median admission-to-coronary angiography duration for NSTEMI decreased (26.2 vs. 64.0 hours), median duration of hospitalisation decreased (4 to 2 days), secondary prevention pharmacotherapy prescription remained unchanged (each >94.7%). Mortality at 30 days increased for NSTEMI (from 5.4% to 7.5%; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08-1.80), but decreased for STEMI (from 10.2% to 7.7%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, there was a substantial decline in admissions with AMI. Those who presented to hospital were younger, less co-morbid and, for NSTEMI, had higher 30-day mortality.","output":"Patient response, treatments and mortality for acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces. Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant. Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 124 and 113 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on cotton was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 72 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days. The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values. Importance This study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.","output":"Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and viral RNA on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and investigating contamination concentration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Veterans have higher rates of PTSD and depression compared to the general population and experience substantial functional impairment.

Health care organizations have responded to the first phase of the pandemic by rapidly adopting digital solutions and advanced technology tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to describe the digital solutions that have been reported in the early scientific literature to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of early COVID-19Crelated literature (from January 1 to April 30, 2020) by searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with appropriate terms to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. We extracted study characteristics such as the paper title, journal, and publication date, and we categorized the retrieved papers by the type of technology and patient needs addressed. We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to health care system target, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas. RESULTS: The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. Most of the selected articles addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention. We report that most of these digital solutions and innovative technologies have been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles, we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)Cpowered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are also useful for prevention and surveillance measures, such as contact-tracing apps and monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and clinical data, appear to be promising. For surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness; however, problems related to privacy and usability remain. For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed, such as telemedicine or telehealth tools. These tools have long been available, but this historical moment may actually be favoring their definitive large-scale adoption. It is worth taking advantage of the impetus provided by the crisis; it is also important to keep track of the digital solutions currently being proposed to implement best practices and models of care in future and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in national health systems, which have proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition in recent years.","output":"Adoption of Digital Technologies in Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review of Early Scientific Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dissemination of COVID-19 around the globe has been followed by an increased consumption of antibiotics.

The anatomical and physiological characteristics of the Human Respiratory Tract model were considered for modeling the lung PM deposition during exercise. The Monte Carlo method was performed to randomly generate different values of PM concentrations (1.0, 2.5, and 10.0 m), minute ventilation, and duration of exercise at moderate, heavy, and severe exercise intensity domains. Compared to moderate and severe intensities, during heavy exercise (75C115 L?min-1, duration of 10.0C60.0 min) there is greater lung deposition in the bronchiolar region (p < 0.01). In turn, there is greater deposition per minute of exercise at the severe intensity domain (115.0C145.0 L?min(?1), duration of 10.0C20.0 min, p < 0.01). Considering that SARs-CoV-2 could be adsorbed on the particles, exercising under PM exposure, mainly at the severe domain, could be harmful concerning the virus. In conclusion, beyond the traditional minute ventilation assumption, there is a time vs intensity dependence for PM deposition, whereby the severe domain presents greater deposition per minute of exercise. The results observed for PM deposition are alarming since SARs-CoV-2 could be adsorbed by particles and carried into the deeper respiratory tract.","output":"Exercising under particulate matter exposure: Providing theoretical support for lung deposition and its relationship with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simple SummaryP-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), coded by the SELPLG gene, is the major ligand of selectins and plays a pivotal role in tethering, rolling and extravasation of immune cells. PSGL-1 involvement in core molecular programs, such as SYK, PLC2, PI3K or MAPK pathways, suggests additional functions beyond the modulation of cell trafficking. Recently, several studies identified a novel mechanism responsible for PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment and proved a novel concept of PSGL-1 as a critical checkpoint molecule for tumor immunotherapy. The immunotherapeutic approach has gained an ever-growing interest in the treatment of several hematological malignancies, and in particular, novel targets for immunotherapy are still highly sought-after in T-cell lymphomas. Based on our results obtained through gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical analysis, PSGL-1, already suggested as a potential target in multiple myeloma humoral immunotherapy, could be considered noteworthy among the candidates.AbstractDue to the high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in lymphoproliferative disorders and in multiple myeloma, it has been considered as a potential target for humoral immunotherapy, as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor in T-cells. By investigating the expression of SELPLG in 678 T- and B-cell samples by gene expression profiling (GEP), further supported by tissue microarray and immunohistochemical analysis, we identified anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL) as constitutively expressing SELPLG at high levels. Moreover, GEP analysis in CD30+ ALCLs highlighted a positive correlation of SELPLG with TNFRSF8 (CD30-coding gene) and T-cell receptor (TCR)-signaling genes (LCK, LAT, SYK and JUN), suggesting that the common dysregulation of TCR expression in ALCLs may be bypassed by the involvement of PSGL-1 in T-cell activation and survival. Finally, we evaluated the effects elicited by in vitro treatment with two anti-PSGL-1 antibodies (KPL-1 and TB5) on the activation of the complement system and induction of apoptosis in human ALCL cell lines. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that PSGL-1 is specifically enriched in ALCLs, altering cell motility and viability due to its involvement in CD30 and TCR signaling, and it might be considered as a promising candidate for novel immunotherapeutic approaches in ALCLs.","output":"Constitutive PSGL-1 Correlates with CD30 and TCR Pathways and Represents a Potential Target for Immunotherapy in Anaplastic Large T-Cell Lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time where social media allows increased conversations about it. These conversations have spread various conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to develop communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of public institutions on Twitter campaign #yomevacuno to deal with misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8th to 23rd, 2020. Tweets included content #yomevacuno hashtag. RESULTS A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82% were tweets. Data shows that public institutions generate 53.36% of traffic information, the most important was the Ministerio de Sanidad from Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48% of a sample of 50 Tweets the message was focused on vaccination as a social responsibility to defeat COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The communication strategy of #yomevacuno hashtag, has been led by the Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, by comparison to other campaigns in which there was no large presence of public institutions. This case represents the importance of social media as a way to spread information and prevention, even in public health and the need for them to be led by public organizations rather than by individual users.","output":"[COVID-19 and vaccination: analysis of public institution's role in information spread through Twitter.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary In vitro studies were undertaken to examine the effects of non-immune porcine peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) on a Coronavirus infection due to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The assay consisted of TGEV-infected epithelial cells expressing viral antigens on the cell surface and producing low amounts of interferon (IFN). Non-immune PBL were found to limit virus replication at an effector-to-target ratio of 100/1 even when effector cells were depleted of phagocytic cells. Neutralizing anti-IFN antibodies did not abrogate the effect. PBL from newborn animals were as effective as adult cells, whereas fibroepithelial cells, human and mouse lymphoid cells did not exert antiviral effects. Under similar conditions, PBL from adult animals could lyse TGEV-infected cells even in the presence of anti-IFN antibodies. However, newborn PBL were not cytotoxic. Moreover, depletion of NK cells by monoclonal antibodies plus complement did not alter the inhibitory effect. These latter observations suggest that virus multiplication-inhibition effects and cytotoxic (or NK) activities are unrelated.","output":"Inhibition of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) multiplication in vitro by non-immune lymphocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The cardiovascular complications of type 1 and 2 diabetes are major causes of morbidity and mortality.

Recognition of the prognostic role of imaging findings is important to improve the outcomes in patients. Accordingly, regarding the lack of studies in this era among Iranian patients, this study was done to determine the association between CT scan findings and mortality in Covid-19 cases. Methods: In this prognostic prospective cohort study, 192 consecutive patients with established Covid-19 disease by clinical findings, and laboratory results in Besat Hospital, Tehran, Iran in March and April 2020 were enrolled. The findings in CT scan were involved zone and lobe, ground glass, consolidation, ground glass with reticular, reverse hallo sign, microvascular dilation sign, fibrotic streaks, sub pleural line, air bronchogram, Bronchus distortion, broncheiectasis, pleural thickening, pleural reaction, and pleural effusion. According to involvement degree the points in CT scan were 0, 1, and 2 for lack of lung parenchyma involvement, less than 50 percent involvement, and more than 50 percent involvement. Results: The involved zones were significantly differed between survived and dead cases (P=0.001). As shown in Table 4, the scores of CT scan for lung involvement and also number of involved lobes were differed across the alive and dead cases (P=0.001) the mean hospital stay was 7.1 (5.6) and 5.7 (2.5) days that was same across the groups (P=0.325). There were significant differences between groups for consolidation, ground glass plus reticular pattern, fibrotic streaks, sub-pleural line, air bronchogram, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and pleural reaction (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Totally, according to the obtained results it may be concluded that CT scan is useful prognostic modality to predict the mortality among patients with Covid-19 disease.

Clinical implementation of remote video visits may benefit from an understanding of potential barriers to participation. Methods We enrolled one hundred and thirty participants from a university-based musculoskeletal clinic with a large uninsured population. We asked participants to complete a survey, including demographics and scaled perception questions about remote video visits. Data from these surveys were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with willingness to participate in video visits, as well as the situations in which patients would consider a video visit. Results Willingness to participate in video visits was associated with the perception of video visits being more convenient (OR 3.0) and a decreased perceived importance of physical exam (OR 0.36) but not age, technology comfort, or travel distance to the clinic. Additionally, those with prior video visit experience were more comfortable with technology, perceived video visits to be more convenient, and were more willing to have another video visit. Fifteen percent were willing to have a video visit for their first visit, while 78% would participate for a routine non-surgical follow-up.

Telemedicine could be a reasonable tool to manage people suffering from headaches, and it received a big push from the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective This review aims to propose a practical approach for the virtual management of these patients. Methods To do this, we conducted a literature search, including 32 articles relevant to the topic treated in this review. Results The most challenging step in telemedicine applied to practical neurology remains the clinical assessment, but through a careful headache history and a recently proposed entirely virtual neurological assessment, this hitch can be easily overcome. Electronic diary compilations and virtual administration of disability-measuring scales, conversely, are the key features of effective long-term follow-up although we do not have apps that met the criteria of scientific reliability. Furthermore, tele-rehabilitation seems to be effective and has demonstrated to be a solution to alternatively treat chronic patients at home, and can be considered part of the remote management of headache patients. Moreover, virtual management of headaches finds an application in specific communities of patients, as pediatric patients and for rural communities of low- and middle-income countries suffer from health disparities, with inadequate resources and knowledge gaps.

In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. METHODS: Here we develop a comprehensive probabilistic framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. RESULTS: As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open. CONCLUSIONS: While travel bans lowered the number of COVID-19 importations overall, the effectiveness of bans on individual countries varies widely and directly depends on the change in behaviour in returning residents and citizens. Authorities may consider the presented information when planning a phased re-opening of international borders.

Method C Among the patients with a history of breast cancer and recent COVID-19 vaccine administration, six patients who showed isolated axillary LAP were gathered. Radiologic features were reviewed from breast ultrasound, chest computed tomography, and breast magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and pathological information were obtained for analysis. Results C The interval between ultrasound detection of LAP and last COVID-19 vaccine administration ranged from 14 to 28 days (mean 21.67 days). Round shape of the lymph node and irregular cortex were noted in two and zero cases, respectively. Mean maximum cortical thickness, length to width ratio and interval aggravation in maximum cortical thickening were 4.2 mm, 1.34 and 2.81-fold with cut-off value of 3 mm, 1.5, 2.0-fold, respectively.

Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats imposes a narrow bottleneck"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently WHO has characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.

These activities and people's engagement in such activities are considered to have a significant impact on mental health. Thus, this study aimed to examine the relationship between two types of passion (harmonious passion and obsessive passion), fear of COVID-19, and mental distress. Thus, a total of 322 Japanese participants completed an online questionnaire. The results showed that harmonious passion (HP) was negatively related to mental distress.

Sales and rental figures for works of fiction about pandemics and other disease outbreaks surged in 2020, but what can pandemic science fiction tell us about disease? This article surveys the long history of science fiction's engagement with disease and demonstrates the ways in which these narratives, whether in literature or film, have always had more to say about other contemporary cultural concerns than the disease themselves. Nonetheless, the ideas demonstrated in these texts can be seen perpetuating through the science fiction genre, and in our current crisis, we have seen striking similarities between the behaviours of key individuals, and the manner in which certain events have played out. Not because science fiction predicts these things, but because it anticipates the social structures which produce them (while at the same time permeating the culture to the extent that they become the touchstones with which the media choose to analyse current events).

Studies have shown that access to green spaces is associated with better mental and physical health, yet green spaces can also be detrimental to health if they are not managed appropriately. Despite the increasing interest in urban green spaces, little research has so far been conducted into the links between green spaces and cancer. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this scoping review is therefore to map the literature available on the types of relationship between urban green spaces and cancer. METHOD AND ANALYSIS We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 guideline to report the protocol. To conduct this scoping review, we will use a structured search strategy based on controlled vocabulary and relevant key terms related to green space, urban space and cancer. We will search MEDLINE (PubMed), GreenFILE (EBSCOhost), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCOhost) and ScienceDirect as electronic database as well as hand-search publications for grey literature. This review will therefore provide evidence on this current topic, one which could have practical implications for policy-makers involved in choices which are more conducive to healthy living. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No primary data will be collected since all data that will be presented in this review are based on published articles and publicly available documents, and therefore ethics committee approval is not a requirement. The findings of this review will be presented at workshops and conferences, and will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","output":"Urban green spaces and cancer: a protocol for a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted weaknesses in global food systems, as well as opening windows of opportunity for innovation and transformation.

In the West, even with peri-operative chemotherapy, 5-year survival rate is approximately 40%. GC is a heterogeneous disease, well-characterized by different molecular classifications, all having in common the role of the immune system and a T-cell inflamed phenotype across all subtypes. The anti-PD-L1 avelumab (Av) antibody has demonstrated efficacy in GC with response rates of around 10% in the refractory setting. The addition of other immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in the metastatic setting. The combination of Av to perioperative chemotherapy may increase pathological responses by a synergistic effect, and then improving the survival (OS). Trial design: MONEO is an open-label, non-randomized, multicentric, phase II study that explores the combination of Av plus peri-operative FLOT (docetaxel, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin) in resectable GC pts.

Since this is a relatively new treatment approach, not all potential side effects are well described, and the underlying pathobiology is often not well defined. Here, we summarize current data on the incidence and the current management of CD19+ CAR T-cell complications. We discuss frequently occurring toxicities and we highlight evidence for the occurrence of rarer side effects affecting different organ systems. In addition, we highlight new findings that shed light on the pathophysiology of CAR T-cell-related complications. ABSTRACT: Clinical trials demonstrated that CD19+ chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells can be highly effective against a number of malignancies. However, the complete risk profile of CAR T-cells could not be defined in the initial trials. Currently, there is emerging evidence derived from post approval studies in CD19+ CAR T-cells demonstrating both short-term and medium-term effects, which were unknown at the time of regulatory approval. Here, we review the incidence and the current management of CD19+ CAR T-cell complications. We highlight frequently occurring events, such as cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, metabolic complications, secondary macrophage-activation syndrome, and prolonged cytopenia. Furthermore, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that CAR T-cell-mediated toxicities can involve any other organ system and we discuss the potential risk of long-term complications. Finally, we discuss recent pre-clinical and clinical data shedding new light on the pathophysiology of CAR T-cell-related complications.","output":"Complications after CD19+ CAR T-Cell Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death, and it is estimated that over 181 million new cases are diagnosed annually. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted almost every aspect of the provision and management of cancer care worldwide. The time-critical nature of COVID-19 diagnosis and the large number of patients requiring hospitalisation necessitated the rerouting of already limited resources available for cancer services and programmes to the care of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the stringent social distancing, restricted in-hospital visits and lockdown measures instituted by various governments resulted in the disruption of the oncologic continuum including screening, diagnostic and prevention programmes, treatments and follow-up services as well as research and clinical trial programmes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched several databases from October 2020 to January 2021 for relevant studies published in English between 2020 and 2021 and reporting on the impact of COVID-19 on the cancer care continuum. This narrative review paper describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cancer patient care continuum from screening and prevention to treatments and ongoing management of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted cancer care and the management of cancer services and patients. Nevertheless, the oncology healthcare communities worldwide have done phenomenal work with joint and collaborative efforts, utilising best available evidence-based guidelines to continue to give safe and effective treatments for cancer patients while maintaining the safety of patients, healthcare professionals and the general population. Nevertheless, several healthcare centres are now faced with significant challenges with the management of the backlog of screening, diagnosis and treatment cases. It is imperative that governments, leaders of healthcare centres and healthcare professionals take all necessary actions and policies focused on minimising further system-level delays to cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and clearing of all backlogs cases from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to mitigate the negative impact on cancer outcomes.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the oncologic care continuum: urgent need to restore patients care to pre-COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opinion polls on vaccine uptake clearly show that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy is increasing worldwide.

Like beta and gamma variants, C.1.2 possesses E484K and N501Y. The genomes are heterogenous and encode different subvariants. Like alpha variant, one such subvariant encodes the spike substitution P681H at the furin cleavage site. In a related genome, this substitution is replaced by P681R, which is present in delta variant. In addition, similar to this variant of concern, three C.1.2 subvariants also encode T478K. Mechanistically, spike Y449 recognizes two key residues of the cell-entry receptor ACE2 and Y449H is known to impair the binding to ACE2 receptor, so C.1.2 variant may show reduced affinity for this receptor. If so, this variant needs other mutations to compensate for such deficiency. These results raise the question whether C.1.2 variant is as virulent as suggested by its unexpected high number of mutations.","output":"SARS-COV-2 C.1.2 variant is highly mutated but may possess reduced affinity for ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The reallocation of health care resources to focus on the acute care needs of COVID-19 patients leads to a delay and deferral of outpatient surgical procedures such as Mohs surgery OBJECTIVE: Planning for the resumption of regular outpatient surgical care and preparing for future surges in COVID-19 cases requires identifying surrogate markers of health care demand MATERIALS AND METHODS: United States national and state-based Google search data for \\"Mohs surgery\\" and other common elective surgical and cosmetic procedures were evaluated These were compared with national and state-wide COVID-19 case number and death data from the Johns Hopkins University Pearson correlation coefficients were generated to assess the association between COVID-19 cases and deaths with Google search trends RESULTS: Search volume for \\"Mohs surgery\\" and other elective surgical and cosmetic procedures significantly decreased as the number of new deaths from COVID-19 increased Statistically significant inverse correlation was noted between \\"Mohs surgery\\" search volume and new COVID-19 deaths on a national and state-based level CONCLUSION: Search metric analysis may be used as part of a big data model to help predict health care demand during the reopening phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Evaluation of Public Interest in Mohs Surgery and Other Elective Surgical Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important public health problem in 2020.

Although specific parameters, including age, gender, chronic diseases, D-dimer, and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio play a curial role in COVID-19, the association between mortality and the extent of lung involvement in the initial computerized tomography (CT) scan of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 has not been well documented in the literature. Objectives: We compared two groups (CT-1 and CT-2) in terms of lung involvement in the initial CT of patients admitted to the emergency unit and then hospitallzed with COVID-19. Methods: Using the digital data system of zmir Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 were retrospectively screened. For each of the 90 patients, the initial CT scans on admission were evaluated for the extent of lung involvement and classified as CT-1 ( 5% of lung involvement, n: 45) and CT-2 (> 5% of lung involvement, n: 45). Results: There was not any statistical significance between two different CT groups regarding mortality and length of stay of patients in hospital with COVID-19 (P = 0.72 and P = 0.51, respectively). Neutrophil counts were found to be statistically significant and higher in CT-2 group than the CT-1 (P = 0.02) group. The length of stay in hospital was correlated with age, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophils, lymphocyte, and only the correlation between length of stay in hospital and age was significant (P = 0.01).

It is known that m6A function is largely mediated by cellular m6A binding proteins or readers, yet how m6A readers regulate viral gene expression in general, and HIV-1 gene expression in particular, has been controversial. Here, we confirm that m6A addition indeed regulates HIV-1 RNA expression and demonstrate that this effect is in large part mediated by the the nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 and the cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF2. Both YTHDC1 and YTHDF2 bind to multiple distinct and overlapping sites on the HIV-1 RNA genome, with YTHDC1 recruitment serving to regulate the alternative splicing of HIV-1 RNAs while YTHDF2 binding correlates with increased HIV-1 transcript stability. Author Summary This manuscript reports that the expression of mRNAs encoded by the pathogenic human retrovirus HIV-1 is regulated by the methylation of a small number of specific adenosine residues. These in turn recruit a nuclear RNA binding protein, called YTHDC1, which modulates the alternative splicing of HIV-1 transcripts, as well as a cytoplasmic RNA binding protein, called YTHDF2, which stabilizes viral mRNAs. The regulation of HIV-1 gene expression by adenosine methylation is therefore critical for the effective and ordered expression of HIV-1 mRNAs and could represent a novel target for antiviral development.","output":"Epitranscriptomic addition of m6A regulates HIV-1 RNA stability and alternative splicing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has become a planetary concern that affecting the sustenance of the human population all around the globe. The effective measured has been taken in Malaysia to control the virus transmission by limiting the human vitality which unsurprisingly propitious to the environment. A monitoring study was conducted to assess the water quality status of surface seawater along the Port Dickson coast based on the Malaysian Marine Water Quality Index (MMWQI) and Malaysian Marine Water Quality Standards (MMWQCS) with an interval period of a year (March 2020-March 2021). In situ, water quality parameters incorporate temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured at 14 sampling sites to evaluate the biochemical characteristics of water. Surface water samples were collected from the same sites and transported back to Universiti Putra Malaysia for nitrate (NO3-), ammonia (NH3), phosphate (PO4), biochemical oxygen demands (BOD), fecal coliform (Escherichia coli), and total suspended solids (TSS) analyses. The MMWQI showed the status of surface water from the Port Dickson coast was classified as moderate quality (50.41 - 64.05) for both sampling events. However, there are some indexes that showed significant decreases (p< 0.05) in the latter year.

Because of the limitations of RT-PCR, there is growing interest in the usability of the CT scan. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize the available data on the CT scan features of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in electronic databases to find eligible studies published between 1 December 2019 and 4 April 2020, which investigated the computed tomographic features of patients with COVID-19. All preprint and peer-reviewed articles were included. No language limitation was applied. For proportional data, pooled prevalence was calculated using a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Eighty-six studies were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. For 7956 patients, the most common CT findings were bilateral pattern of involvement (78%; 95% CI: 0.73-0.82; p < 0.001), involvement of more than 1 lobe (75%; 95% CI: 0.68-0.82; p < 0.001), ground-glass opacities (GGO) (73%; 95% CI: 0.67-0.78; p < 0.001), and peripheral distribution of signs (69%; 95% CI: 0.61-0.76; p < 0.001). Only 5% of patients had a normal CT scan (95% CI:0.03-0.07; p < 0.001). The proportion of paediatric patients (age < 18 years) with unremarkable CT findings was higher (40%; 95% CI: 0.27-0.55; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with the severe or critical type of COVID-19 were more likely to have pleural effusion (RR 7.77; 95% CI: 3.97-15.18; p < 0.001) and consolidation (RR 3.13; 95% CI: 1.57-6.23; p < 0.001). CT results in patients with COVID-19 were comparable with those of people having pneumonia from other causes, except for the lower incidence of consolidation (RR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71-0.91; p < 0.001) and higher risk of showing GGO (RR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.13-1.86; p < 0.001). The mortality rate was slightly higher in patients with bilateral involvement (RR 3.19; 95% CI: 1.07-9.49; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results show that COVID-19 shares some features with other viral types of pneumonia, despite some differences. They commonly present as GGO along with vascular thickening, air bronchogram and consolidations. Normal CT images, lymphadenopathies, and pleural effusions are not common. Consolidations and pleural effusions correlate with more severe disease. CT features are different between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia.

The patients have a dismal prognosis which has not improved in more than a decade suggesting that better understanding of this disease is required. In this study we analyze two previously published RNA sequencing datasets and gain further insights into the global transcriptome of two known sub-groups of this disease, which are characterized by the presence or absence of a homeobox gene expression signature. Specifically, we identify a remarkable mutually exclusive expression of the HOXA9/HOXA10 and IRX1 genes and have thus termed the two sub-groups iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1. This expression pattern is of critical importance as it suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the two sub-groups. Investigation of the transcriptome of the two sub-groups reveals a more aggressive nature of the iALL-IRX1 group, which is further supported by the fact that patients within this group have a worse prognosis and are also diagnosed at a younger age. This could be reflective of a developmentally earlier cell of origin for iALL-IRX1. Our analysis further uncovers critical differences between the two groups that may impact on treatment strategies for the two groups.

This trial examines the effectiveness of the STOP (Sevrage Tabagique  laide dOutils ddis selon la Prfrence: Smoking cessation using preference-based tools), a preference-based smoking cessation intervention for smokers with low SEP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The STOP study is a randomised, multicentre, controlled trial (RCT). Smokers with low SEP and wishing to quit will be randomised to either the intervention or the control group (standard care). Participants in the intervention group will be asked to choose between different types of nicotine substitutes (patches, inhalers, gum, tablets, etc) and/or an electronic cigarette which will be delivered free of charge to aid their smoking cessation attempt. The primary outcome will be smoking abstinence at 6 months after inclusion, defined as self-reported 7-day point prevalence of tobacco abstinence. Secondary outcomes include the total number of days of abstinence at 6 months after inclusion, 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 1 and 3 months after inclusion and number of relapses. The study will also include an economic evaluation, and a process evaluation using a mixed methods approach.

At this point, the cat was started on doxycycline and pradofloxacin and referred for further work-up. The culture of skin biopsy specimens obtained at the time of referral revealed a population of bacterial colonies with two distinctly different phenotypes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified both colonies as Mycobacterium goodii. A diagnosis of a cutaneous infection of rapidly growing mycobacteria was made, and treatment with oral pradofloxacin and doxycycline was initiated. The ulcerations resolved within 4 months, and the subcutaneous mass gradually decreased in size until it was no longer palpable, even 4 months after the cessation of antibiotics.

The organism was not visualized on histopathology but was successfully cultured from tissue obtained by skin punch biopsy. A phenotypic switching phenomenon affecting the susceptibility results was suspected, possibly explaining the presence of phenotypically different but genetically identical strains.

METHODS: Data of all deaths among residents in the three capitals in 2020 were provided by these municipalities' routine Mortality Information System (SIM). Mentions B34.2 with the markers U07.1 and U07.2 in the death certificate identified COVID-19 deaths. We used a multiple-cause-of-death approach better to understand the complexity of the morbid process of COVID-19. Conditions that appeared more frequently in the same line or above the COVID-19 mentions in the death certificate were considered a chain-of-event. Conditions that occurred more often after the codes for COVID-19 were considered as contributing. RESULTS: In 2020, 7,029 records from COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death were registered in SIM in the three capitals. Among these, 2,921 (41.6%) were deceased between 30 and 69 years old, representing 17.0% of deaths in this age group. As chain-of-events, the most frequent conditions mentioned were sepsis (33.4%), SARS (32.0%), acute respiratory failure (31.9%), unspecified lower respiratory infections (unspecified pneumonia) (20.1%), and other specified respiratory disorders (14.1%). Hypertension (33.3%), diabetes unspecified type (21.7%), renal failure (12.7%), obesity (9.8%), other chronic kidney diseases (4.9%), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (4.7%) were the most frequent contributing conditions. On average, 3.04 conditions were mentioned in the death certificate besides COVID-19. This average varied according to age, place of death, and capital.

OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers and facilitators to the consumption of traditional foods among adults aged 18C69 years in Zimbabwe. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults aged 18C69 years in Zimbabwe. The questionnaire was based on a socio-ecological model designed to assess barriers and facilitators at the individual, interpersonal, community, and national levels. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 20 software package. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (MRCZ/B/1931). RESULTS: The study enrolled 440 participants. Traditional food consumption was low in this population with only 9.3% consuming these foods daily. At the individual level, 44.4% of study participants mentioned their consumption of traditional foods is facilitated by generational factors, while the most important barrier at this level was the inconvenience in accessing and preparing traditional foods (33.2%). At the community and national levels, the most important facilitator was family members (26.2%) and lack of environmental contaminants (38.9%), respectively, while most important barrier at the community and national levels was their residential location or residence (31.8%) and aggressive marketing of processed foods (47.8%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of traditional foods was low in general. Generational factors, family contribution, and food safety impact the consumption of traditional foods among adults in Zimbabwe. The food environment, particularly commercial advertising of alternative foods, is a deterrent. Therefore, interventions to promote the consumption of traditional foods must take into account these factors at every stage of the socio-ecological model.","output":"Facilitators and barriers to the consumption of traditional foods among adults in Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been recently studied as an alternative method for cost-effective diagnostics in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

In the present study, we performed an integrated analysis of metabonomics, proteomics and lipidomics to establish a scientific research system on the underlying mechanism of TCMs, and Schisandra lignan extract (SLE) was selected as a model TCM. In metabonomics, several metabolic pathways were found to mediate the liver injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP), and SLE could regulate the disorder of lipid metabolism. The proteomic study further proved that the hepatoprotective effect of SLE was closely related to the regulation of lipid metabolism. Indeed, the results of lipidomics demonstrated that SLE-dosing has an obvious callback effect on APAP-induced lipidic profile shift. The contents of 25 diglycerides (DAGs) and 21 triglycerides (TAGs) were enhanced significantly by APAP-induced liver injury, which could further induce liver injury and inflammatory response by up-regulating protein kinase C (PKC, PKC, PKC and PKC). The up-regulated lipids and PKCs could be reversed to the normal level by SLE-dosing. More importantly, phosphatidic acid phosphatase (lipin1), fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were proved to be positively associated with the regulation of DAGs and TAGs. Significance Statement Integrated multi-omics was first used to reveal the mechanism of APAP-induced acute liver failure (ALF) and hepatoprotective role of SLE. The results showed that the ALF caused by APAP was closely related to lipid regulation and SLE-dosing could exert hepatoprotective role by reducing intrahepatic DAG and TAG levels.

Methods: The humoral immune response of all subjects was evaluated by chemiluminescence (CMIA); in 60 serum samples, a live virus-based neutralization assay was also tested. Moreover, 6 months after vaccination, B- and T-cell subsets from 20 subjects were observed by FACS analysis after restimulation with the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein as an antigen, thus mimicking reinfection in vitro. Results: A significant decrease of circulating IgG levels and neutralizing antibodies over time were observed. Moreover, six months after vaccination, a variable T-cell immune response after in vitro antigen stimulation of PBMC was observed. On the contrary, the analysis of B-cell response showed a shift from unswitched to switched memory B-cells and an increase of Th17 cells. Conclusions: Although the variability of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) immune response and an antibody decline was observed among vaccinated subjects, the increase of switched memory B-cells and Th17 cells, correlating with the presence of neutralizing antibodies, opened the debate on the correct timing of vaccination.","output":"Overview of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immune Response Six Months after BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an oncology advanced practice nurse, I find myself asking, \\"How can I continue to provide the same level of competent, quality care while meeting the unique, holistic needs of this population leveraged with self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic?\\" In talking with colleagues, we find ourselves torn between providing fluid oncology care that is compassionate and comprehensive while managing our uncertainties with our family since the beginning of this pandemic.

The management of UTIs usually is conservative medical antibiotic treatment. However, recurrent UTIs in the SCI patient population warrant further investigation. The method of urinary drainage (intermittent or indwelling urinary catheters, urinary diversion) and untreated complications of NLUTD (vesicoureteral reflux, stone formation, chronic incomplete emptying of the bladder) are risk factors for recurrent UTIs (rUTIs). Removal of these UTI risk factors and improving urinary drainage are goals of urologic management; however, when conservative interventions do not succeed, surgery may be a viable solution in select cases of rUTIs. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of complicated persisting rUTIs and associated urethral discharge in a middle-aged SCI male who manages his bladder with intermittent catheterization (IC). We detail the evaluation and management approach that leads to an eventual transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) as a final solution for his rUTIs. Fortunately, the surgical intervention was successful, and the patient is free of UTIs after 4 years of follow-up. DISCUSSION: In SCI male patients with rUTIs and suspected chronic prostatitis, TURP may be a valuable treatment option once all predisposing factors have been remediated.","output":"Chronic prostatitis effectively managed by transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) in a spinal cord injury male"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors draw on their knowledge of young children, early childhood programs, and understanding of the NAEYC Code of Ethical Conduct to provide a clear and thoughtful discussion of real-life experiences during the pandemic [ ]some of the changes recommended by health care experts and by local licensing agencies-coupled with people's conceptions and misconceptions-lead to ethical concerns as we try to meet the needs of different individuals and groups In this Focus on Ethics column, we (the authors) describe an ethical dilemma involving early childhood educators' interactions with each of the stakeholder groups identified in the NAEYC Code of Ethical Conduct (2011): children, families, colleagues, the community, and society Furthermore, there is an issue that is larger than the questions raised by this specific child: the teacher's reluctance to enter into a conversation related to race is an all too common occurrence in early childhood education (Baines, Tisdale, & Long 2018;Boutte & Muller 2018;Wynter-Hoyte et al 2019) [ ]this issue includes an ethical component, both in","output":"The Code and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM Clerkship grades contribute to a summative assessment culture in clerkships and can therefore interfere with students' learning. For example, by focusing on summative, tiered clerkship grades, students often discount accompanying feedback that could inform future learning. This case report seeks to explore whether an assessment system intervention which eliminated tiered grades and enhanced feedback was associated with changes in student perceptions of clerkship assessment and perceptions of the clinical learning environment. Intervention: In January 2019, our institution eliminated tiered clerkship grading (honors/pass/fail) for medical students during the core clerkship year and implemented pass/fail clerkship grading along with required twice weekly, work-based assessments for formative feedback. Context: In this single institution, cross-sectional survey study, we collected data from fourth-year medical students one year after an assessment system intervention. The intervention entailed changing from honors/pass/fail to pass/fail grading in all eight core clerkships and implementing an electronic system to record twice-weekly real-time formative work-based assessments. The survey queried student perceptions on the fairness and accuracy of grading and the clinical learning environment-including whether clerkships were mastery- or performance-oriented. We compared responses from students one year after the assessment intervention to those from the class one year before the intervention. Comparisons were made using unpaired, two-tailed t-tests or chi-squared tests as appropriate with Cohen's d for effect size estimation for score differences. Content analysis was used to analyze responses from two open-ended questions about feedback and grading. Impact: Survey response rates were similar before and after intervention (76% (127/168) vs. 72% (118/163), respectively) with no between-group differences in demographics. The after-intervention group showed statistically significant increases in the following factors: \\"grades are transparent and fair\\" (Cohen's d = 0.80), \\"students receive useful feedback\\" (d = 0.51), and \\"resident evaluation procedures are fair\\" (d = 0.40). After-intervention respondents perceived the clerkship learning environment to be more mastery-oriented (d = 0.52), less performance approach-oriented (d = 0.63), and less performance avoid-oriented (d = 0.49). There were no statistical differences in the factors \\"attending evaluation procedures are fair,\\" \\"evaluations are accurate,\\" \\"evaluations are biased,\\" or \\"perception of stereotype threat.\\" Open-ended questions revealed student recommendations to improve clerkship summary narratives, burden of work-based assessment, and in-person feedback. Lessons Learned: After an assessment system change to pass/fail grading with work-based assessments, we observed moderate to large improvements in student perceptions of clerkship grading and the mastery orientation of the learning environment. Our intervention did not improve perceptions around bias in assessment in clerkships. Other medical schools may consider similar interventions to begin to address student concerns with clerkship assessment and promote a more adaptive learning environment.","output":"Moving toward Mastery: Changes in Student Perceptions of Clerkship Assessment with Pass/Fail Grading and Enhanced Feedback."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quick, simple and accurate diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is very important for the screening and therapy of patients.

Setting: Medical ICU, University Hospital. Design: Prospective, observational study. Patients: Patients without any prior history of chronic lung disease, consecutively admitted to the ICU to receive NIPSV for ARF due to severe CAP. Measurements and results (means  SD): Twenty-four patients aged 4917 years, admission APACHE II 135, were included. Admission PaO(2)/FIO(2), alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (DA-aO(2)) and PaCO(2) were 10448, 447120 and 4010 mmHg, respectively. All patients were normotensive. During the initial NIPSV trial respiratory rate decreased from 348 to 2810 breaths/min (p<0.001) and arterial oxygenation improved (PaO(2)/FIO(2) 10448 vs 15349, DA-aO(2) 447120 vs 370180 mmHg, p<0.001) while PaCO(2) remained unchanged. There were no hemodynamic effects. Subsequently, a total of 133 NIPSV trials were performed (median duration 55 min, range 30C540 min) over 1C7 days. No complication occurred during NIPSV. Sixteen patients were intubated (66%) 1.31 days after inclusion. Upon inclusion, the patients who were subsequently intubated were older (5515 vs 3712 years) and more severely hypoxemic (6311 vs 8015 mmHg, p<0.05) than those not requiring intubation. Eight patients died (33%), all in the intubated group. Median lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital were longer in intubated patients (ICU 16 days, range 3C64 vs 6 days, range 3C7, p<0.05; hospital 23 days, range 9C77 vs 9.5 days, range 4C42, p<0.05). Mean daily total PRN points were stable throughout the NIPSV period and were not different between the groups. Only 14% of PRN points resulted from respiratory therapy interventions. PRN score was higher during the first 24 h following intubation than during the first 24 h of NIPSV (27855 vs 22824 points, p<0.05). Conclusion: Despite initial improvement in arterial oxygenation with NIPSV in patients with ARF due to severe CAP, the intubation rate is high. However, the more favorable outcome and shorter ICU and hospital stays when intubation is avoided, as well as the short delay required to assess the success or failure of NIPSV warrants a trial of NIPSV in this setting. The nursing workload remains stable during NIPSV and does not result predominantly from respiratory therapy interventions.","output":"Non-invasive pressure support ventilation in severe community-acquired pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continent of the Americas has the greatest number of people infected and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the world.

Therefore, an assessment of the pandemic's effect on the older Brazilian population is urgently needed. The study examines the prevalence of COVID-19 related symptoms, care-seeking, and cancellation of surgery or other scheduled medical care among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over derived from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey (the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative) between late May and early June 2020. About 10.4% of older adults reported any fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing in the 30 days prior to the interview, with the highest prevalence in the North region (50%). Among individuals with symptoms, only 33.6% sought care. Individuals living in the South or Southeast regions were significantly less likely to seek care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Nearly one in six participants had to cancel scheduled surgery or other medical care; this proportion was higher among women, those with more education, and people with multiple chronic conditions.

METHODS Nursing students were invited to complete an online questionnaire at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year using convenience sampling. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic factors, work, and life experiences in relation to COVID-19, habits and lifestyle using the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Generalized Anxiety disorder-7 scale. Variables related to anxiety were analysed using multiple lineal regression analysis, RESULTS: The prevalence of low psychological well-being in the 203 students was 44.3% and of anxiety 55.7%. In the multivariate analysis the variables associated with anxiety were having worked in the pandemic, having had symptoms of COVID-19 and having been afraid of getting infected. CONCLUSIONS The levels of anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing students have been high, and levels of psychological well-being have been low. The fact of having worked during the pandemic, having had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or being afraid of getting infected are associated with the highest scores for anxiety.

METHODS: On a two-wave online survey of 307 workers from high-risk enterprises in China, these relationships were tested by structural equations modeling and bootstrapping procedures. RESULTS: Findings show that safety-specific leader reward omission was negatively associated with followers' safety compliance through the mediating effects of safety-specific distributive justice and role ambiguity. Safety-specific leader punishment omission was also negatively associated with followers' safety compliance through the mediating effect of safety-specific role ambiguity, while safety-specific distributive justice was an insignificant mediator.

Design: A qualitative design, consisting of three online focus group discussions. Setting: This study was conducted among smaller, albeit substantial, migrant and minority ethnic populations in the Netherlands. Participants: A total of 25 participants (12 male; 13 female) of Ghanaian and Eritrean origin, purposively sampled to ensure diversity within groups, with regards to sex, age, educational level, occupation, household size and length of stay in the Netherlands. Focus group discussions were held online, therefore, experience in the use of video conferencing software was a prerequisite. Results: Participants awareness and knowledge of COVID-19 and COVID-19 preventive measures was shaped by migration-related factors, such as limited Dutch proficiency, by access to understandable information and interference of misinformation. Participants engagement by COVID-19 preventive measures was subject to COVID-19 threat appraisal and the ease with which complex behavioural messages could be translated to individual situations. Lastly, a strong social norm to keep with cultural and religious practices, and limited opportunity for preventive behaviour in the work and home context hinder the uptake of preventive behaviour following a decision to act according to measures. Conclusions: Migration-related, sociocultural, and socioeconomic factors shape uptake of COVID-19 preventive measures amongst persons of Ghanaian and Eritrean origin in The Netherlands. To ensure equitable uptake our results suggest the importance of timely spread of multilingual information tailored to literacy needs; as well as, education and modelling delivered through online platforms and by leading figures in respective communities; and, regulations to ensure continued access to financial and material resources to minimise negative spill-over effects and exacerbation of inequality.","output":"Contextual factors that shape uptake of COVID-19 preventive measures by persons of Ghanaian and Eritrean origin in The Netherlands: a focus group study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Numerous viruses are responsible for respiratory infections; however, both their distribution and genetic diversity, in a limited area and a population subgroup, have been studied only rarely during a sustained period of time. Methods A 2-year surveillance program of children presenting with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was carried out to characterize the viral etiology and to assess whether using gene amplification and sequencing could be a reliable approach to monitor virus introduction and spread in a population subgroup. Results Using multiplex RT-PCR, 15 different respiratory viruses were detected within the 486 nasopharyngeal positive samples collected among 817 children aged <9-year old who presented with ARI during October 2006 to September 2008. A single virus was detected in 373 patients (45.7%), and two to four viruses in 113 patients (13.8%). The most frequent causative viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24.7%), human bocavirus (24.5%), and human rhinovirus (HRV) (15%). RSV was more prevalent in winter and among young infants. Cases of seasonal influenza A and B viruses were reported mainly in January and August. An increase in adenovirus infection was observed during the spring of the second year of the study. Sequence analyses showed multiple introductions of different virus subtypes and identified a high prevalence of the newly defined HRV-C species. A higher viral incidence was observed during the winter of 2008, which was unusually cold. Conclusions This study supports the usefulness of multiplex RT-PCR for virus detection and co-infection, and for implementation of a molecular monitoring system for endemic and epidemic viral respiratory infections.","output":"Molecular monitoring of causative viruses in child acute respiratory infection in endemo-epidemic situations in Shanghai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Identifying those individuals requiring medical care is a basic tenet of the pandemic response. Here, we examine the COVID-19 community triage pathways employed by four nations, specifically comparing the safety and efficacy of national online 'symptom checkers' used within the triage pathway. METHODS: A simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led symptom checkers from four countries (Singapore, Japan, USA and UK). 52 cases were simulated to approximate typical COVID-19 presentations (mild, moderate, severe and critical) and COVID-19 mimickers (eg, sepsis and bacterial pneumonia). The same simulations were applied to each of the four country's symptom checkers, and the recommendations to refer on for medical care or to stay home were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The symptom checkers from Singapore and Japan advised onward healthcare contact for the majority of simulations (88% and 77%, respectively). The USA and UK symptom checkers triaged 38% and 44% of cases to healthcare contact, respectively. Both the US and UK symptom checkers consistently failed to identify severe COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia and sepsis, triaging such cases to stay home. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that whilst 'symptom checkers' may be of use to the healthcare COVID-19 response, there is the potential for such patient-led assessment tools to worsen outcomes by delaying appropriate clinical assessment.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes. METHODS: The ENCOVID multicentre study included patients with encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited from 13 centres in northern Italy. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis.

Majority of the work done on the inhibitor studies on the catalytically active dimeric SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), primarily focussed on the catalytic site of a single protomer, with a few targeting the dimeric site. In this study, we have exploited the FDA-approved drugs, for a computational drug repurposing study against the Mpro. A virtual screening approach was employed with docking and molecular dynamics (MD) methods. Out of 1576, FDA-approved compounds, our study suggests three compounds: netupitant, paliperidone and vilazodone as possible inhibitors with a potential to inhibit both sites (monomeric and dimeric) of the Mpro. These compounds were found to be stable during the MD simulations and their post simulation binding energies were also correlated for both the targeted sites, suggesting equal binding capacity.

Although TTF-1 inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by transforming growth factor- (TGF-) in lung adenocarcinoma cells, the mechanism through which TTF-1 inhibits the functions of TGF- is unknown. Here we show that TTF-1 disrupts the nuclear Smad3-Smad4 complex without affecting the nuclear localization of phospho-Smad3. Genome-wide analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that TTF-1 colocalizes with Smad3 on chromatin and alters Smad3-binding patterns throughout the genome, while TTF-1 generally inhibits Smad4 binding to chromatin. Moreover, Smad3 binds to chromatin together with TTF-1, but not with Smad4, at some Smad3-binding regions when TGF- signaling is absent, and knockdown of Smad4 expression does not attenuate Smad3 binding in these regions. Thus, TTF-1 may compete with Smad4 for interaction with Smad3, and in the presence of TTF-1, Smad3 regulates the transcription of certain genes independently of Smad4.

This disruption in individuals' daily routines likely altered food consumption habits. We examined how changes in food choice motives related to changes in nutritional quality during the lockdown compared to before. A convenience sample of 938 French adults completed online questionnaires on the Qualtrics platform at the end of April 2020. Participants were retrospectively asked about their food choice motives and food consumption during the month before and in the first month of the lockdown. The importance of nine food choice motives was assessed: health, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, ethical concern, weight control, mood, familiarity, and price, scoring from 1 to 4. Food intakes were recorded using a food frequency questionnaire including 110 foods, 12 non-alcoholic beverages and 4 alcoholic beverages. Adherence to the French dietary recommendations before and during the lockdown was estimated using the simplified PNNS-GS2, scoring from -17 to 11.5. The nutritional quality of diet was lower during the lockdown compared to before (-0.32, SD 2.28, p < 0.001). Food choice motives significantly changed and an increase in the importance of weight control was associated with increased nutritional quality (? = 0.89, p < 0.001, partial ?2 = 0.032), whereas an increase in the importance of mood was associated with decreased nutritional quality (? = -0.43, p = 0.021, partial ?2 = 0.006). The lockdown period in France was related to a decrease in nutritional quality of diet on average, which could be partly explained by changes in food choice motives. The lockdown was indeed related to modification of food choice motives, notably with an increase of mood as a food choice motive for 48% of the participants, but also with an increase of health (26%), ethical concern (21%) and natural content (19%) suggesting a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable food choices in some participants.","output":"Food choice motives and the nutritional quality of diet during the COVID-19 lockdown in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not only since SARS-CoV-2, have transmission routes of viruses been of interest Noroviruses e g , can be transmitted via smear infection, are relatively stable in the environment and very resistant to chemical disinfection Some studies determined the virucidal efficacy of laundering processes, but few studies focused on the virucidal efficacy of dishwashing processes Here, especially consumer related conditions are of interest Households for example are a hotspot of norovirus infection and thus a sufficient reduction of these and other viruses from dishes must be insured to avoid an infection via this route The likelihood of such an event should not be underestimated, since it was shown that the washing machine can be a reservoir for the transmission of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria in newborns Although viruses do not replicate in these devices a transmission via contaminated cutlery e g , cannot be excluded Using a consumer related approach to determine the virucidal efficacy of dishwashers, we found a combination of a bleach containing dishwasher detergent, a cleaning temperature of 45 C for 45 min and a rinsing temperature of 50 C, to be sufficient to reduces viral titer of bovine corona virus, murine norovirus and modified vaccinia virus by 4 8, 4 2 and 3 8 logarithmic stages respectively","output":"Virucidal Efficacy of Household Dishwashers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare a mathematical tool and time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) estimates to assess the COVID-19 pandemic progression in a Canadian context. METHODS: Total number of reported cases were plotted against total number of tests for COVID-19 performed over time, with and without smoothing, for Canada and some Canadian provinces individually. Changes in curvature profile were identified as either convex or concave as indicators of pandemic acceleration or deceleration, respectively. Rt estimates were calculated on an exponential growth rate. RESULTS: For Canada as a whole, the testing graphs had a slightly concave profile and a coincident decrease in Rt estimates. Saskatchewan more recently had a convex profile with a gradual shift to a concave profile and also demonstrated a gradual decline in Rt estimates. Curves and Rt estimates for Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec displayed a gradual shift towards concavity over time and an overall decrease in Rt estimates, which is suggestive of a positive impact of public health interventions implemented federally and provincially. CONCLUSION: The present analyses compared a mathematical tool to Rt estimates to ascertain the status of the pandemic in Canada.

Neighboring cities in Hubei Province followed suit with the government enforcing social distancing measures to restrict the spread of the disease throughout the province. Few studies have examined the emotional attitudes of citizens as expressed on social media toward the imposed social distancing measures and the factors that affected their emotions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to detect the emotional attitudes of different groups of users on Sina Weibo toward the social distancing measures imposed by the People's Government of Hubei Province. Second, the influencing factors of their emotions, as well as the impact of the imposed measures on users' emotions, was studied. METHODS: Sina Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, was chosen as the primary data source. The time span of selected data was from January 21, 2020, to March 24, 2020, while analysis was completed in late June 2020. Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) was used to analyze users' emotions, while logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the influence of explanatory variables on users' emotions, such as age and spatial location. Further, the moderating effects of social distancing measures on the relationship between user characteristics and users' emotions were assessed by observing the interaction effects between the measures and explanatory variables. RESULTS: Based on the 63,169 comments obtained, we identified six topics of discussion-(1) delaying the resumption of work and school, (2) travel restrictions, (3) traffic restrictions, (4) extending the Lunar New Year holiday, (5) closing public spaces, and (6) community containment. There was no multicollinearity in the data during statistical analysis; the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 0.24 (&#967;28=10.34, P>.24). The main emotions shown by citizens were negative, including anger and fear. Users located in Hubei Province showed the highest amount of negative emotions in Mainland China. There are statistically significant differences in the distribution of emotional polarity between social distancing measures (&#967;220=19,084.73, P<.001), as well as emotional polarity between genders (&#967;24=1784.59, P<.001) and emotional polarity between spatial locations (&#967;24=1659.67, P<.001).

At the same time, concerns are voiced that as a consequence of neoliberal regimes of research governance, innovative research becomes impeded. In this paper, I suggest that to gain a better understanding of these dynamics, it is indispensable to scrutinise current demands for innovativeness as a distinct way of ascribing worth to research. Drawing on interviews and focus groups produced in a close collaboration with three research groups from the crop and soil sciences, I develop the notion of a project-innovation regime of valuation that can be traced in the sphere of research. In this evaluative framework, it is considered valuable to constantly re-invent oneself and take first steps instead of just following up on previous findings. Subsequently, I describe how these demands for innovativeness relate to and often clash with other regimes of valuation that matter for researchers practices. I show that valuations of innovativeness are in many ways bound to those of productivity and competitiveness, but that these two regimes are nevertheless sometimes in tension with each other, creating a complicated double bind for researchers. Moreover, I highlight that also the project-innovation regime as such is not always in line with what researchers considered as a valuable progress of knowledge, especially because it entails a de-valuation of certain kinds of long-term epistemic agendas. I show that prevailing pushes for innovativeness seem to be based on a rather short-sighted temporal imaginary of scientific progress that is hardly grounded in the complex realities of research practices, and that they can reshape epistemic practices in potentially problematic ways.","output":"Re-invent Yourself!

Despite this, the layer-dependent properties of these tissues have yet to be mechanically characterised using human tissue. In this study, the ex vivo mechanical properties of the passive muscularis propia layer of the human oesophagus were extensively investigated. For this, a series of uniaxial tensile tests were conducted. The results displayed hyperelastic behaviour, while the differences between loading the tissue in both the longitudinal and circumferential directions showcased its anisotropy. The anisotropy of the muscular layer was present at different strain rates, with the longitudinal direction being consistently stiffer than the circumferential one. The circumferential direction was found to have little strain-rate dependency, while the longitudinal direction results suggest pronounced strain-rate-dependent behaviour. The repeated trials showed larger variation in terms of stress for a given strain in the longitudinal direction compared to the circumferential direction. The possible causes of variation between trials are discussed, and the experimental findings are linked to the histological analysis which was carried out via various staining methods. Finally, the direction-dependent experimental data was simulated using an anisotropic, hyperelastic model.","output":"Experimental investigations of the human oesophagus: anisotropic properties of the muscular layer in large deformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has completely transformed the accepted norms and approaches to cancer care delivery in the United States, we sought to understand the sources of medical information that oncology physicians seek and trust.

To preserve medical capacity and decrease adverse health effects, preventing the progression of COVID-19 to severe status is essential. Jing-Si Herbal Tea (JSHT), a novel traditional Chinese medicine formula was developed to treat COVID-19. This study examined the clinical efficacy and safety of JSHT in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 260 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The enrolled patients were divided into the JSHT (n = 117) and control (n = 143) groups. Both groups received standard management. The JSHT group was treated with JSHT as a complementary therapy. RESULTS: Compared with standard management alone, JSHT combined with standard management more effectively improved the reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction cycle threshold value, C-reactive protein level, and Brixia score in the adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, especially in the male and older patients (those aged 60 years). The results revealed that the patients treated with JSHT combined with standard management had 51, 70, and 100% lower risks of intubation, Medisave Care Unit admission, and mortality compared with those receiving standard management only. CONCLUSIONS: JSHT combined with standard management more effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and systemic inflammation and alleviated lung infiltrates in the patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, especially in the male and older patients (those aged 60 years). JSHT combined with standard management may prevent critical status and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

In this study, persistently infected MDCK cells were generated through culture passage of the CPV-2a-infected cells for ten generations. Our study showed that CPV-2a induces cell proliferation arrest and cell morphology alternation before the fourth generation, whereas, the cell morphology returns to normal after five times of passages. PCR detection of viral VP2 gene demonstrated that CPV-2a proliferate with cell passage. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that CPV-2a particles were mainly located in the cell nuclei of MDCK cell. Then transcriptome microarray revealed that gene expression pattern of MDCK with CPV-2a persistent infection is distinct compared with normal cells. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis demonstrated that CPV-2a infection induces a series of membrane-associated genes expression, including many MHC protein or MHC-related complexes. These genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virusChost interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graft-versus-host disease, and RIG-I-like helicases signaling pathway. In contrast, the suppressed genes mediated by CPV-2a showed low enrichment in any category, and were only involved in pathways linking to synthesis and metabolism of amino acids, which was confirmed by qPCR analysis.

A previous study reported that machaeriols did not show any cannabinoid receptor activity, even though these hexahydrodibenzopyran analogues mimic a privileged (+)-tetrahydrocannabinoid scaffold. To unravel structural requisites for modulation of cannabinoid receptors, a simple late-stage divergent approach was undertaken to functionalize the machaeriol scaffold using the Suzuki coupling reaction. Fourteen hexahydro analogues were synthesized and screened against both cannabinoid receptor isoforms, CB(1) and CB(2). Interestingly, many of the analogues showed a significant binding affinity for both receptors; however, two analogues, 11H and 11J, were identified as possessing CB(2) receptor-selective functional activity in the GTPS assay; they were found to be micromolar-range agonists, with EC(50) values of 5.7 and 16 M, respectively. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations between the CB(2) receptor and two novel analogues resulted in unique interaction profiles by tightly occupying the active ligand-binding domain of the CB(2) receptor and maintaining stable interactions with the critical residues Phe94, Phe281, and Ser285. For the first time, with the aid of structureCactivity relationships of (+)-hexahydrocannabinoids, CB(2) selective agonists were identified with late-stage diversification using palladium-mediated CCC bond formation.

METHODS: From January to March 2020, COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 7), with mild and ordinary cases as Group-1 and critical and severe cases as Group-2. The chest CT scan results, hs-CRP, D-dimmer levels of the two groups from admission to discharge were compared by the (2) test or Fishers exact test. The quantitative data were represented as mean  standard deviation ( x  s). Intergroup comparisons were performed by the independent samples t test, and the ineligible data were subjected to the nonparametric rank sum test. Binary logistic regression model was used for multivariate correlation analysis, using independent variables that were significant in univariate analysis. The correlations between the above indices were analyzed. RESULTS: In Group-1, there were two cases of normal chest CT scan results, one case of fibrosis, and 25 cases of abnormalities during the first diagnosis, mainly manifested as single or scattered ground-glass shadows. After treatment, the CT scan results became normal. The chest CT scan of Group-2 showed abnormalities, including 21 cases of multiple ground-glass shadows, and six cases of multiple consolidations accompanied by ground-glass shadows, who were critically ill and died. In addition, there were 16 cases of multiple ground glass shadows with partial consolidation, and the CRP and D-dimer levels of Group-2 were significantly higher than those of Group-1. Chest CT scan results were significantly positively correlated with CRP and D-dimer levels (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The chest CT scan results of COVID-19 patients are characteristic, being correlated with CRP and D-dimer levels. D-dimer and CRP levels significantly increase in most severe and critical patients, which are closely related to their prognosis. The indices may play predictive roles in clinical treatment and prognosis evaluation.","output":"Correlations of CT scan with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and D-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial properties, compressive strength and fluoride release capacities of high-viscous glass ionomer cements (GICs) after incorporation of cinnamon and thyme essential oils. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental-modified GICs were prepared by incorporation of thyme and cinnamon essential oils into the liquid phase of the cement at 5 and 10% v/v. Antimicrobial activity against selected microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans) was done using direct contact test. Compressive strength of the four new formulations and control group was tested using a universal testing machine while fluoride ion release was measured by ion-selective electrode at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. Data analysis and comparisons between groups were performed using factorial and one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests. RESULTS All newly formulated GICs exhibited significantly higher inhibitory effects against both Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans growth when compared to conventional GIC (p < 0.05). Compressive strength of 5% cinnamon-modified GIC (MPa = 160.32  6.66) showed no significant difference when compared with conventional GIC (MPa = 165.7  5.769) (p value > 0.05).

One specific approach to assessing AF is to measure force and limb position during a pneumatically applied increasing external force. Through this method, the highest (AF(max)), the maximal isometric (AFiso(max)) and the maximal eccentric Adaptive Force (AFecc(max)) can be determined. The main question of the study was whether the AFiso(max) is a specific and independent parameter of muscle function compared to other maximal forces. In 13 healthy subjects (9 male and 4 female), the maximal voluntary isometric contraction (pre- and post-MVIC), the three AF parameters and the MVIC with a prior concentric contraction (MVICpri-con) of the elbow extensors were measured 4 times on two days.

Regarding the reliability of the AF parameters between days, the mean changes were 0.31C1.98 Nm (0.61%C5.47%, p = 0.175C0.552), the standard errors of measurements (SEM) were 1.29C5.68 Nm (2.53%C15.70%) and the ICCs(3,1) = 0.896C0.996.

Effective treatment or prevention has not been established. The aim of this review was to create a systematic summary of the current evidence concerning clinical interventions during intensive care admission to reduce cognitive impairments after discharge. METHODS Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycInfo and Cinahl were searched. Inclusion criteria were studies assessing the effect of interventions during intensive care admission on cognitive function in adult patients. Studies were excluded if they were reviews or reported solely on survivors of cardiac arrest, stroke or traumatic brain injury. RESULTS Of 4877 records were identified. Seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The interventions described covered strategies for enteral nutrition, fluids, sedation, weaning, mobilization, cognitive activities, statins and sleep quality improvement. Data were synthesized to provide an overview of interventions, quality, follow-up assessments and neuropsychological outcomes. CONCLUSION None of the interventions had significant positive effects on cognitive impairments following critical illness. Quality was negatively affected by study limitations, imprecision and indirectness in evidence. Clinical research on cognition is feasible, but large, well designed trials with a specific aim at reducing cognitive impairments are needed.","output":"Interventions to reduce cognitive impairments following critical illness: a topical systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza is a major public health concern, infecting 5C15% of the global population annually. Influenza virus belongs to family Orthomyxoviridae, and has three types A, B and C. Infection by influenza virus A is most common and severe, generally found in humans. It spreads rapidly and affects human population across large geographical region within short period of time with varying degree of pathology from mild to severe. Wild aquatic birds and other animal species like birds, pigs, ferret, horses, seals, whales, mink, giant anteaters, cats and dogs are the reservoir for the influenza A virus. Influenza B and C viruses have very limited host range and appear predominantly in humans. Influenza virus gains pandemic potential through genetic reassortment called genetic shift with complete renewal of surface antigen and a small but gradual genetic change by mutations which make it to adapt efficiently in human population called genetic drift. Although, the epidemiology related to influenza infection has been studied from several years but some facts associated to disease transmission has poorly understood. This article reviews the important aspects of virological, epidemiological and clinical features related to influenza virus for better understanding of disease transmission and its pathogenesis.","output":"Influenza Virus: A Brief Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused major disruptions to the healthcare system and medical education.

This group rapidly compiles, appraises, and synthesizes literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 as it pertains to critical care, relevant clinical questions, and anecdotal reports. Daily, FLARE produces and disseminates highly curated scientific reviews and opinion pieces, which are distributed to readers using an online newsletter platform. Interest in our work has escalated rapidly. FLARE was quickly shared with colleagues outside our division, and, in a short time, our audience has grown to include more than 4,000 readers across the globe.

PURPOSE: To determine the utility of CXR in aiding clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, utilizing RT-PCR as the standard of comparison. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 presenting to our institution during the exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in New Orleans, USA (March 13 C 25, 2020). 376 in-hospital CXR exams for 366 individual patients were reviewed along with concurrent RT-PCR tests. Two experienced radiologists categorized each CXR as characteristic, nonspecific, or negative in appearance for COVID-19, utilizing well-documented COVID-19 imaging patterns. CXR categorization was compared against RT-PCR results to determine the utility of CXR in diagnosing COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 178/366 male (49%) and 188/366 female (51%) patients with a mean age of 52.7 years (range 17 to 98 years). 37/376 CXR exams (10%) exhibited the characteristic COVID-19 appearance; 215/376 (57%) exhibited the nonspecific appearance; and 124/376 (33%) were considered negative for a pulmonary abnormality. Of the 376 RT-PCR tests evaluated, 200/376 (53%) were positive and 176/376 (47%) were negative. RT-PCR tests took an average of 2.5  0.7 days to result.

This analysis reveals a series of subepidemics that peaked in early autumn 2020, followed by a jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7/Alpha lineage. The Alpha variant grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown suppressed the Alpha variant and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. Yet a series of variants (most of which contained the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. However, by accounting for sustained introductions, we found that the transmissibility of these variants is unlikely to have exceeded the transmissibility of the Alpha variant.

Cross-country comparison could indicate the relative efficacy of these approaches. We assess various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) over time, comparing the effects of self-imposed (i.e. voluntary) behavior change and of changes enforced via official regulations, by statistically examining their impacts on subsequent death rates in 13 European countries. Methods and findings: We examine two types of NPI: the introduction of government-enforced closure policies over time; and self-imposed alteration of individual behaviors in response to awareness of the epidemic, in the period prior to regulations. Our proxy for the latter is Google mobility data, which captures voluntary behavior change when disease salience is sufficiently high. The primary outcome variable is the rate of change in COVID-19 fatalities per day, 16-20 days after interventions take place. Linear multivariate regression analysis is used to evaluate impacts. Voluntarily reduced mobility, occurring prior to government policies, decreases the percent change in deaths per day by 9.2 percentage points (95% CI 4.5-14.0 pp). Government closure policies decrease the percent change in deaths per day by 14.0 percentage points (95% CI 10.8-17.2 pp). Disaggregating government policies, the most beneficial are intercity travel restrictions, cancelling public events, and closing non-essential workplaces. Other sub-components, such as closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show smaller and statistically insignificant impacts. Conclusions: This study shows that NPIs have substantially reduced fatalities arising from COVID-19. Importantly, the effect of voluntary behavior change is of the same order of magnitude as government-mandated regulations. These findings, including the substantial variation across dimensions of closure, have implications for the phased withdrawal of government policies as the epidemic recedes, and for the possible reimposition of regulations if a second wave occurs, especially given the substantial economic and human welfare consequences of maintaining lockdowns.","output":"Comparing the impact on COVID-19 mortality of self-imposed behavior change and of government regulations across 13 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed various manifestations.

In this paper, we explore the role of the epidemiologist and identify challenges they face during emergency response. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to learn more about epidemiologists who respond to public health emergencies. The online survey included open and closed-ended questions on challenges faced while responding, the roles of epidemiology responders, self-rating of skills, and support needed and received. We used purposive sampling to identify participants and a snowballing approach thereafter. We compared data by a number of characteristics, including national or international responder on their last response prior to the survey. We analysed the data using descriptive, content, and exploratory factor analysis. RESULTS: We received 166 responses from individuals with experience in emergency response. The most frequently reported challenge was navigating the political dynamics of a response, which was more common for international responders than national. National responders experienced fewer challenges related to culture, language, and communication. Epidemiology responders reported a lack of response role clarity, limited knowledge sharing, and communication issues during emergency response. Sixty-seven percent of participants reported they needed support to do their job well; males who requested support were statistically more likely to receive it than females who asked.

The genome engineering of single-copy baculovirus infectious clones (bacmids) in E. coli has been valuable in the study of baculovirus biology, but bacmids are not yet widely applied as expression vectors. An important limitation of first-generation bacmids for large-scale protein production is the rapid loss of gene of interest (GOI) expression. The instability is caused by the mini-F replicon in the bacmid backbone, which is non-essential for baculovirus replication in insect cells, and carries the adjacent GOI in between attTn7 transposition sites. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that relocation of the attTn7 transgene insertion site away from the mini-F replicon prevents deletion of the GOI, thereby resulting in higher and prolonged recombinant protein expression levels. We applied lambda red genome engineering combined with SacB counterselection to generate a series of bacmids with relocated attTn7 sites and tested their performance by comparing the relative expression levels of different GOIs. We conclude that GOI expression from the odv-e56 (pif-5) locus results in higher overall expression levels and is more stable over serial passages compared to the original bacmid.

However, there are gaps in care for patients with many chronic diseases, and programs to prevent the most common conditions are being prevented or stopped. This applies to diseases directly related to eating disorders. To solve the problem at the population level, it is critically necessary to adopt legislative acts regulating the universal iodization of table salt in the country. Currently, in Ukraine, potassium iodate is used for salt enrichment, which is a more stable compound than iodide that was used earlier. Potassium iodate allows you to store iodized salt for a year or more, does not change the taste and smell of food, and can be used for preserving and storing food. For the most vulnerable categories of the population (newborns, children, pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding), the use of iodine supplements remains relevant. The optimal tool for such preventive interventions is supplements containing the physiological dose of iodine. On the Ukrainian market, they are presented in the form of pills of potassium iodide with a content of 100 mcg and 200 mcg of iodine.

Participants who achieved the one-month abstinence challenge were lower drinkers and more likely to have registered on the campaign-related Internet communities. Both successful and unsuccessful participants frequently reported health benefits, including sleep improvement and weight loss. Successful participants were more likely to durably change their alcohol drinking habits.

Fear can cause a range of physical and psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, and panic. Leading to lower social isolation and adherence to security measures, consequently increasing infection risk. The objective was to validate an 11-item unidimensional fear scale to identify and assess the severity of the fear of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: : This was a cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey questionnaire. The sample included the Brazilian general population, randomly recruited by social networking platforms, during the pandemic. Participants aged 18 were included. A self-applicable fear scale named as the SARS-CoV-2 Fear Scale (SCoV-2-FS), comprising 11 questions addressing the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection in performing daily activities was validated. The reliability and validity of the SCoV-2-FS were psychometrically evaluated using reliability measures and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The sample comprised 1332 Brazilian participants. Results: : Cronbachs  was 0.9, indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the CFA showed that the unidimensional factor structure of the SCoV-2-FS fitted well with the data. Limitations: The sampling method could have introduced selection bias in terms of socio-demographics. Conclusion: The SCoV-2-FS is a valid and reliable tool with robust psychometric properties, useful for assessing the psychological impact of fear due to COVID-19.

Of these, MMPs and CAs are validated druggable targets that share some pivotal signaling pathways. The majority of MMPs or CAs inhibitors are designed as single-target agents. Despite their transient efficacy, these agents are often susceptible to resistance. This set the stage to introduce dual inhibitors of correlated MMPs and CAs. The next step is expected to target the common vital signaling nodes as well. In this regard, VEGFR-2 is central to various tumorigenesis events involving both families, especially MMP-2 and CA II. Herein, we report simultaneous inhibition of MMP-2, CA II, and VEGFR-2 via rationally designed hybrid 1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidinone acyclo C-nucleosides. The promising derivatives were nanomolar inhibitors of VEGFR-2 (8; IC(50) = 5.89 nM, 9; IC(50) = 10.52 nM) and MMP-2 (8; IC(50) = 17.44 nM, 9; IC(50) = 30.93 nM) and submicromolar inhibitors of CA II (8; IC(50) = 0.21 M, 9; IC(50) = 0.36 M). Docking studies predicted their binding modes into the enzyme active sites and the structural determinants of activity regarding substitution and regioselectivity.

The aims of this study were to develop clinical-grade radiolabeled trastuzumab for clinical HER2/neu immunoPET scintigraphy, to improve diagnostic imaging, to guide antibody-based therapy, and to support early antibody development. The PET radiopharmaceutical (89)Zr-trastuzumab was compared with the SPECT tracer (111)In-trastuzumab, which we have tested in the clinic already. METHODS Trastuzumab was labeled with (89)Zr and (for comparison) with (111)In. The minimal dose of trastuzumab required for optimal small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution was determined with human HER2/neu-positive or -negative tumor xenograft-bearing mice. RESULTS Trastuzumab was efficiently radiolabeled with (89)Zr at a high radiochemical purity and specific activity. The antigen-binding capacity was preserved, and the radiopharmaceutical proved to be stable for up to 7 d in solvent and human serum. Of the tested protein doses, the minimal dose of trastuzumab (100 microg) proved to be optimal for imaging. The comparative biodistribution study showed a higher level of (89)Zr-trastuzumab in HER2/neu-positive tumors than in HER2/neu-negative tumors, especially at day 6 (33.4 +/- 7.6 [mean +/- SEM] vs. 7.1 +/- 0.7 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue).

The onset of diabetes is associated with a moderate glycosuria and a non-fasting hyperglycemia. Previously, in non-obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice spontaneously developing type 1 diabetes, the possible involvement of decreased expression of LMP2/1i, an immunoproteasome  subunit, and associated decreased expression of NF-B1 (also called as p50) in the development of type 1 diabetes was argued between our research team and other research groups. In response to these arguments, we created NOD mice in which NF-B1 expression is not consistently observed. Unexpectedly, most NOD Nfb1 homozygote mice were found to die by the 8th week of age due to the development of severe myocarditis. Furthermore, in all NOD Nfb1 heterozygote mice, the onset of Insulitis was observed from 4 months of age. In addition, in NOD Nfb1 heterozygote mice, an increase in cTnT due to vaccination with influenza or HBV vaccine was observed without gender difference.

Though the efficacy of corticosteroids like methylprednisolone (MPS) in severe COVID-19 is proven now, its dose and duration are not precise. AIMS: Our study aimed to compare the effect of a standard dose (SD) of MPS (60C120 mg/day) to a high dose (HD) of MPS (>120 mg/day) on the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional study. Patients admitted to AIIMS, Bhopals intensive care unit (ICU) from July 2020 to March 2021 were enrolled in the study. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The patients medical records were extracted from the medical record section of the hospital. The primary endpoint was the all-cause mortality during the hospital stay. The secondary endpoints were the need for mechanical ventilation, the use of vasopressors, the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and secondary infections. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were entered in the MS Excel spreadsheet and coded appropriately. RESULTS: Our data showed that survival, the need for mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of AKI, and secondary bacterial infection are comparable among the two groups with no significant difference. The logistic regression analysis showed that there is a slightly higher risk of death for patients with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving HD of corticosteroids compared to SD, though these results were found to be statistically non-significant.

Antibiotics used to prevent and treat NF disrupt the gut microbiota; these disruptions predict higher post-transplant mortality.

METHODS: We searched a large gut microbiota database in allogeneic HCT recipients (12,546 stool samples, 1,278 patients) to find pairs with (cases) vs. without (controls) NF on the same day relative to transplantation and with a stool sample on the previous day. 179 such pairs were matched in the underlying disease and graft source. Several other important clinical variables were similar between the groups. RESULTS: The gut microbiota of cases on the day before NF had a lower abundance of Blautia than their matched controls on the same day post-transplant, suggesting a protective role for Blautia. Microbiota network analysis did not find any differences in community structure between the groups, suggesting a single-taxon effect. To identify putative mechanisms, we searched a gut microbiome and serum metabolome database of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy and identified 139 serum samples collected within 24a? hours after a stool sample from the same patient. Greater Blautia abundances predicted higher levels of next-day citrulline, a biomarker of total enterocyte mass.

Methods A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems. results The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively. The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively. Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems. In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems. Conclusions Psychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD) were characterized in terms of demographic information, including daily dose, latency, concomitant drugs known to be associated with ILD, and causality assessment (adapted WHO system). Disproportionality analyses were carried out by calculating reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), accounting for major confounders, including notoriety and competition biases. RESULTS: ILD reports (N = 161) represented 2.1% and 0.3% of all reports for abemaciclib and palbocilcib/ribociclib, respectively, with negligible proportion of concomitant pneumotoxic drugs. Increased reporting was found for CDK4/6 inhibitors when compared to other drugs (ROR = 1.50; 95%CI = 1.28C1.74), and abemaciclib vs other anticancer agents (4.70; 3.62C5.98). Sensitivity analyses confirmed a strong and consistent disproportionality for abemaciclib. Higher-than-expected reporting emerged for palbociclib (1.38; 1.07C1.77) and ribociclib (2.39; 1.34C3.92) only when removing Japan reports. ILD occurred at recommended daily doses, with median latency ranging from 50 (abemaciclib) to 253 (ribociclib) days. Causality was highly probable in 55% of abemaciclib cases, probable in 68% of palbociclib cases. CONCLUSIONS: Increased reporting of ILD with CDK4/6 inhibitors calls for further comparative population-based studies to characterize and quantify the actual risk, taking into account drug- and patient-related risk factors. These findings strengthen the role of (a) timely pharmacovigilance to detect post-marketing signals through FAERS and other real-world data, (b) clinicians to assess early, on a case-by-case basis, the potential responsibility of CDK4/6 inhibitors when diagnosing a lung injury.","output":"Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors and interstitial lung disease in the FDA adverse event reporting system: a pharmacovigilance assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool samples and gastrointestinal tissues during the convalescence phase of COVID-19 infection.

As little or no class II is expressed in the normal mouse CNS, the ability of astrocytes to express these proteins and present antigen to T cells from TMEV-infected mice was investigated here. It is shown that astrocytes are capable of presenting TMEV to virus-specific T cells in vitro, and that this ability is dependent on prior induction of MHC class II by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment. Unlike other viruses such as murine hepatitis virus-JHM (a coronavirus) and measles, TMEV is not capable of inducing class II on astrocytes directly. There is a correlation between the ease of class II induction on astrocytes from different mouse strains by IFN-gamma and mouse strain susceptibility to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. These results suggest that following viral infection and initial T-cell infiltration into the CNS, class II induction on astrocytes is a key step allowing local antigen presentation and amplification of immunopathological responses within the CNS and hence the development of demyelinating disease.","output":"Susceptibility to Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease correlates with astrocyte class II induction and antigen presentation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A public health emergency of international concern, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

In the present study we compared complement activation of synthetic and cellulose-based membranes, including the polysulfone membrane with -tocopherol-stabilized, PVP-enriched inner surface of the novel FX CorAL dialyzer, and linked the results to their physical characteristics. METHODS Eight synthetic and cellulose-based dialyzers (FX CorAL, FX CorDiax [Fresenius Medical Care]; Polyflux, THERANOVA [Baxter]; ELISIO, SUREFLUX [Nipro]; xevonta [B. Braun]; FDX [Nikkisio Medical]) were investigated in the present study. Complement activation (C3a, C5a, sC5b-9) was evaluated in a 3h ex vivo recirculation model with human blood. Albumin sieving coefficients were determined over a 4h ex vivo recirculation model with human plasma as a surrogate of secondary membrane formation. Zeta potential was measured as an indicator for the surface charge of the membranes. RESULTS The FX CorAL dialyzer induced the lowest activation of the three complement factors (C3a: -39.4%; C5a: -57.5%; sC5b-9: -58.9% compared to the reference). Highest complement activation was found for the cellulose-based SUREFLUX (C3a: +154.0%) and the FDX (C5a: +335.0%; sC5b-9: +287.9%) dialyzers. Moreover, the FX CorAL dialyzer had the nearest-to-neutral zeta potential (-2.38 mV) and the lowest albumin sieving coefficient decrease over time.

However, both statistical and epidemiological biases in the data could lead to an underestimation of the duration of infectiousness. We correct for these biases by curating data from the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China (when mitigation steps were still minimal), and find that the infectiousness profile is wider than previously thought.

The inferred generation interval distribution is sensitive to the definition of the period of unmitigated transmission, but estimates that rely on later periods are less reliable due to intervention effects. Nonetheless, the results are robust to other factors such as the model, the assumed growth rate and possible bias of the dataset.

Currently, incomplete understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 arrogates the host cell to establish its life cycle has led to slow progress in the development of effective drugs. Results In this study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host protein EWSR1 (Ewing Sarcoma breakpoint region 1/EWS RNA binding protein 1) to promote the activity of its helicase NSP13 to facilitate viral propagation. NSP13 is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is crucial for virus replication, providing chemical energy to unwind viral RNA replication intermediates. Treatment with different SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 inhibitors in multiple cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, the RNA binding protein EWSR1 was then identified as a potent host factor that physically associated with NSP13. Furthermore, silencing EWSR1 dramatically reduced virus replication at both viral RNA and protein levels. Mechanistically, EWSR1 was found to bind to the NTPase domain of NSP13 and potentially enhance its dsRNA unwinding ability.

We, therefore, designed a nationwide survey to determine the main features of BC recipients and obtain a picture of the clinical use of BC for the first time in Italy, in order to understand BC demands better and identify specific fields in which to apply Patient Blood Management (PBM). MATERIAL AND METHODS A nationwide survey of all Italian Blood Establishments working as Hospital Blood Banks (HBB) was performed. Data were collected through an online report form recording information on the number and geographic area of the responding HBB, year of birth and sex of the BC recipients, and clinical indications for every unit of RBC, platelets and plasma transfused in a 24-hour period. RESULTS On the survey date, 153/237 (64.5%) of the HBB returned 4,356 forms, reporting 7,523 transfusions. The median and mean ages of the recipients were 73 (range, 0-106) and 67.5 years, respectively; 33.0% were >80 years old and 64.9% >65 years old, with no relevant differences between males and females. Overall, 6,309 RBC units were transfused to 3,850 recipients, 66.7% of them for a medical indication and 32.4% for a surgical indication. The commonest medical indication was acquired, non-cancer-related anaemia and more than 30% of the transfusions occurred in the Emergency Department. Five hundred and sixty platelet transfusions were given to 520 recipients, 62.7% of them for prophylaxis and 28.6% for bleeding before or during an invasive procedure or surgery or for thrombocytopenia. One hundred and ninety-four patients received 654 units of plasma, 71.1% of which were for therapeutic purposes in bleeding patients. DISCUSSION We collected a picture of blood transfusion epidemiology in Italy. The data suggest that future PBM plans should be focused on medical anaemia especially in the setting of Emergency Departments.","output":"A nationwide survey of clinical use of blood in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Greater exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination among pregnant Black American women is associated with elevated prenatal depressive symptomatology, poorer prenatal sleep quality, and poorer child health outcomes. Given the transdiagnostic importance of early childhood sleep health, we examined associations between pregnant womens lifetime exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination and their two-year-old childrens sleep health. We also examined womens gendered racial stress as a predictor variable. In exploratory analyses, we examined prenatal sleep quality and prenatal depressive symptoms as potential mediators of the prior associations. We utilized data from a sample of Black American women and children (n = 205). Women self-reported their lifetime experiences of discrimination during early pregnancy, their sleep quality and depressive symptoms during mid-pregnancy, and their childrens sleep health at age two. Hierarchical linear multiple regression models were fit to examine direct associations between womens experiences of discrimination and childrens sleep health. We tested our mediation hypotheses using a parallel mediator model. Higher levels of gendered racial stress, but not racial/ethnic discrimination, were directly associated with poorer sleep health in children. Higher levels of racial/ethnic discrimination were indirectly associated with poorer sleep health in children, via womens prenatal depressive symptomatology, but not prenatal sleep quality.

N95 masks are amongst the most readily used PPE by healthcare professionals and it is highly recommended by OSHA that every make and model of N95 should go through a fit test at least once in a year. Method A total of 30 randomly selected healthcare professionals (who were a regular user of N95 respiratory masks) were subjected to assess in-house (saccharin sodium benzoate) reagent for use for standard qualitative fit testing in our hospital. Threshold testing with the in-house reagent at three different concentrations was performed prior to establish participants' sensitivity to the reagent. After successful completion of threshold testing, fit test was performed on participants wearing an N95 mask. Results All the participants included in the study passed the sensitivity testing with three concentrations of the reagents, while it was concluded that the concentration of the in-house reagent that was well suited for the sensitivity testing was a concentration of 1g/dl saccharin with 10g/dl sodium benzoate. For fit testing 12g/dl was found to be more appropriate.

Data suggest that SUB might prevent from the risk of cross contamination (i.e. multiresistant pathogens, SARS CoV-2) and save costs. We aimed to investigate visualization, ventilation, handling characteristics, changes in patients gas exchange, and costs associated with both types of bronchoscopes during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT). METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, noninferiority study, 46 patients undergoing PDT were randomized 1:1 to PDT with SUB (Ambu aScope) or reusable bronchoscopes (CONV, Olympus BF-P60). Visualization of tracheal structures rated on 4-point Likert scales was the primary end-point. Furthermore, quality of ventilation, device handling characteristics, changes in the patients gas exchange, pH values, and costs were assessed. RESULTS: Noninferiority for visualization (the primary endpoint) was demonstrated for the SUB group. Mean visualization scores (lower values better) were 4.1 (95% confidence intervals: 3.9;4.3) for SUB vs. 4.1 (4.0;4.2) for CONV. Noninferiority of ventilation (estimated by minute volume and SpO(2)) during the procedure could be shown as well. Mean score was 2.6 (2.0;3.1) for SUB vs. 2.4 (2.1;2.7) for CONV (lower values better). No significant differences regarding handling (SUB: 1.2 (1.0;1.4), CONV: 1.3 (1.1;1.6)), blood gas analyses and respiratory variables were found. Cost analysis in our institution revealed 93  per conventional bronchoscopy versus 232.50  with SUB, not considering an estimate for possible infection due to cross-contamination with the reusable device. CONCLUSION: In our study, visualization and overall performance of the SUB during PDT were noninferior to reusable bronchoscopes. Therefore, PDT with SUB is feasible and should be considered if favored by individual institutions cost analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03952247.

Given clinical reports that earlier detection is possible following infection from throat/nasal samples compared to fecal samples for COVID-19 patients, the utility of wastewater testing where robust individual testing is possible is less clear. The objective of this study was to compare the results of weekly required COVID-19 saliva tests to weekly wastewater monitoring for residential buildings (i.e., dormitories) located across three college campuses capturing wastewater from 80 to 441 occupants per sampling location. Sampling occurred during the spring semester of the 2021 academic year which captured the third wave of SARS-CoV-2 cases in the study region. Comparison of the saliva and wastewater testing results indicated that the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations had a strong linear correlation with the previous week's percentage of positive saliva test results and a weak linear correlation with the saliva testing results surrounding the wastewater sampling (four days before and 3 days after). Given that no correlation was observed between the wastewater and the saliva testing from the following week, the weekly saliva testing captured spikes in COVID-19 cases earlier than the weekly wastewater sampling. Interestingly, the N1 gene copy was observed in buildings on all campuses, but N2 was observed in wastewater on only one of the campuses. N1 and N2 were also observed in sewer biofilm. The campus-specific challenges associated with implementation of wastewater surveillance are discussed. Overall, these results can help inform design of surveillance for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 in residential settings informing mitigation strategies to slow or prevent the spread of the virus among residents in congregate living.","output":"Comparison of residential dormitory COVID-19 monitoring via weekly saliva testing and sewage monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 vaccine uptake was found to be especially low among young adults, the present study investigated COVID-19 risk perception as predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention and actual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among this age group.

In total, 680 students (65.9% female) between 17 and 28 years participated in this longitudinal online study.

The mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect effect of perceived severity at t1 on vaccine uptake at t3 via worry at t1 and vaccination intention at t2. Stronger perceptions of perceived severity of COVID-19 were related to more worry about COVID-19, which led to a higher vaccination intention, which, in turn, increased the chance of COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

The aim of this study was to examine how COVID-19 challenged the neurosurgical delivery of care in a busy tertiary unit serving a socio-economically diverse population. We also describe the strategies we adopted to meet these challenges. Methods: A prospective single centre cohort study including all patients referred to the acute neurosurgical service or the subspecialty multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) as well as all emergency and elective admissions during COVID-19 (18th March 2020-15th May 2020) compared to pre-COVID-19 (18th of January 2020-17th March 2020). Data on demographics, diagnosis, operation, and treatment recommendation/outcome were collected and analysed. Findings: Overall, there was a reduction in neurosurgical emergency referrals by 336% and operations by 556% during the course of COVID-19. There was a significant increase in the proportion of emergency operations performed during COVID-19 (752% of total, n=155) when compared to pre-COVID-19 (n=198, 437% of total, p<0.00001). The 30-day perioperative mortality remained low at 20% with the majority of patients who contracted post-operative COVID-19 infection (n=13) having underlying medical co-morbidities and/or suffering from post-operative complications. Interpretation: Despite the challenges, the capacity to safely treat patients requiring urgent or emergency neurosurgical care was maintained at all times. Strategies adopted to enable this included proactively approaching the referrers to maintain lines of communications, incorporating modern technology including telemedicine to run clinics and MDTs, restructuring patient pathways/facilities into COVID-19 positive and non-COVID-19, re-organising the staff rotas, and initiating the delivery of NHS care within private sector hospitals to increase operative capacity.

Many studies have investigated vaccine safety as a determinant for vaccine hesitancy; however, not much attention has been paid to vaccine production and quality control during the vaccine production process or whether knowledge about this topic may influence vaccine confidence. The aim of this study was to characterize the common knowledge about the vaccine production process. Methods: A freely accessible online questionnaire was developed on Google Modules and disseminated through social networks. A descriptive analysis of the collected answers was performed, and the chi-square test was used to assess significant differences for the sociodemographic characteristics of the study population (age, gender, work or education and training in the healthcare setting, minor offspring). A binary logistic regression model was performed considering these socio-demographic categories as independent variables. Results: The number of collected questionnaire was 135. Most of the participants (127/135, 94.1%) were aware that quality control measures are carried out during manufacturing, although some knowledge gaps emerged in specific aspects of the vaccine production process, without statistically significant differences between age groups.

The kernel fusion method is proposed to combine the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) kernel to figure out the drawbacks that the existing kernel functions are not sufficiently optimal in this scenario. Moreover, we further regularize exploration factor and greed factor, and the tactile sensor's moving distance and the robotic base link's rotation angle during the incision localization process are considered as new factors in the acquisition strategy. We conducted simulation and physical experiments to compare the newly proposed algorithm - Rescaling Acquisition Strategy with Energy Constraints (RASEC) in trachea detection with current palpation-based acquisition strategies. The result indicates that the proposed acquisition strategy with fusion kernel can successfully localize the incision with the highest algorithm performance (Average Precision 0.932, Average Recall 0.973, Average F1 score 0.952). During the robotic palpation process, the cumulative moving distance is reduced by 50%, and the cumulative rotation angle is reduced by 71.4% with no sacrifice in the comprehensive performance capabilities. Therefore, it proves that RASEC can efficiently suggest the incision zone in the laryngeal region and greatly reduced the energy loss.","output":"RASEC: Rescaling Acquisition Strategy with Energy Constraints under SE-OU Fusion Kernel for Active Trachea Palpation and Incision Recommendation in Laryngeal Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of 8 January 2021, there were 86,749,940 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 1,890,342 COVID?19-related deaths worldwide, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) In order to address the COVID?19 pandemic by limiting transmission, an intense global effort is underway to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 The development of a safe and effective vaccine usually requires several years of pre-clinical and clinical stages of evaluation and requires strict regulatory approvals before it can be manufactured in bulk and distributed Since the global impact of COVID?19 is unprecedented in the modern era, the development and testing of a new vaccine are being expedited Given the high-level of attrition during vaccine development, simultaneous testing of multiple candidates increases the probability of finding one that is effective Over 200 vaccines are currently in development, with over 60 candidate vaccines being tested in clinical trials These make use of various platforms and are at different stages of development This review discusses the different phases of vaccine development and the various platforms in use for candidate COVID?19 vaccines, including their progress to date The potential challenges once a vaccine becomes available are also addressed","output":"A COVID-19 Vaccine: Big Strides Come with Big Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed several challenges and strains at all levels of the educational system, especially as a consequence of lockdown and social distance measures.

The number of surgeries has decreased; thus, the surgery videos of all cases are important for both documentation and education. This study aimed to compare three kinds of cameras in recording digestive surgery. METHODS: We compared three cameras: Panasonic HV-770 Full HD Camcorder, Sony FDR-X3000 Action-cam, and Ordro EP7 Hands-Free FPV Camera. Each camera was used in several recording for superficial and visceral digestive surgeries and we compared the following: operation field, image focus, surgeon's comfort, practicality, and record settings. RESULTS: Camcorder needs 10C15 min to set up and longer dismounting time, has steady vantage view and focus, good image quality, can be zoomed, but the recording may be obstructed by the surgeon's head. Action camera needs 5C10 min to set up and the dismounting time was equal between Camcorder and Ordro. Action camera depicts surgeon's vision, however, zoom could not be applied while recording. Sony FDR-X3000 used in this study had good image quality, but the use of this camera in a long surgery may generate neck stiffness due to its weight. Ordro EP7 was comfortable in any surgery but it had inferior image quality compared to the others. CONCLUSIONS: Panasonic HC-V770 and Sony FDR X3000 had good image quality, where camcorder excelled in longer surgeries due to its comfort, action-cam excelled for shorter surgeries due to ease of use and settings.

Here, using the single B cell technology LIBRA-seq, we isolated a large panel of NTD-reactive and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from an individual who had recovered from COVID-19. We found that neutralizing antibodies to the NTD supersite commonly are encoded by the IGHV1-24 gene, forming a genetic cluster that represents a public B cell clonotype.

METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial in children between 1-24 months diagnosed with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis requiring oxygen therapy. Participants received LFO via face mask (6-10 L/min) or HFNCO (2 L*kg/min). Primary outcomes were the time that heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) return to their normal range for age and the time that baseline clinical respiratory score (CRS) regress to a lower severity score. Secondary outcomes were changes in HR, RR, and CRS over time, length of stay (LOS), duration of oxygen requirement, treatment failure, and adverse event (AE). RESULTS Eighty-seven children were enrolled (48 in LFO; 39 in HFNCO). The time that HR and RR baseline values reached their normal range for age was shorter in HFNCO therapy (2.0h [1.0-4.0] vs. 12.0h [2.0-24.0] and 4.0 h [2.0-12.0] vs. 24.0 h [4.0-48.0], respectively; P< .001); additionally, the improvement in CRS emerged more quickly in children treated with HFNCO (2.0 h [1.0-4.0] vs. 4.0 h [2.0-24.0]; P = .003). While the duration of oxygen requirement (19.0 h [4.0-30.0] vs. 29.5 h [14.0-45.7]; P = .009) and treatment failure (3% vs. 21%) was statistically lower in children who received HFNCO, there were no differences in LOS and AE between groups. CONCLUSION HFNCO may provide enhanced respiratory support with a notable improvement in HR, RR, and CRS than LFO. Comprehensive studies are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of HFNCO therapy.

Decontamination studies among ICU patients provide a unique opportunity to study the impacts of different diagnostic criteria, exposure to various decontamination interventions, and various other factors, on its incidence over three decades. Decontamination studies among ICU patients reporting CNS bacteremia incidence data were obtained mostly from recent systematic reviews. The CNS bacteremia incidence within component (control and intervention) groups of decontamination studies was benchmarked versus studies without intervention (observational groups). The impacts of antibiotic versus chlorhexidine decontamination interventions, control group concurrency, publication year, and diagnostic criteria were examined in meta-regression models. Among non-intervention (observational) studies which did versus did not specify stringent ( 2 positive blood cultures) diagnostic criteria, the mean CNS bacteremia incidence per 100 patients (and 95% CI; n) is 1.3 (0.9C2.0; n = 23) versus 3.6 (1.8C6.9; n = 8), respectively, giving an overall benchmark of 1.8 (1.2C2.4; n = 31).

Previous history of neurological disease was classified by severity (major or minor). Neurological manifestations during disease course were also grouped into major and minor manifestations. Encephalopathy, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures were defined as major manifestations, whereas minor neurological manifestations included headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, dizziness or vertigo, and myalgias. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine significant predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.

To achieve the research objectives, bibliometric analysis, information extraction, and network analysis were applied to analyze e-mental health research data. METHODS: E-mental health research data were obtained from 3663 bibliographic records from the Web of Science (WoS) and 3172 full-text articles from PubMed Central (PMC). The text mining techniques used for this study included bibliometric analysis, information extraction, and visualization. RESULTS: The e-mental health research topic trends primarily involved e-health care services and medical informatics research. The clusters of research comprised 16 clusters, which refer to mental sickness, e-health, diseases, information technology (IT), and self-management. The information extraction analysis revealed a triple relation with IT and biomedical domains. Betweenness centrality was used as a measure of network graph centrality, based on the shortest path to rank the important entities and triple relation; nodes with higher betweenness centrality had greater control over the network because more information passes through that node. The IT entity-relations of mobile had the highest score at 0.043466. The top pairs were related to depression, mobile health, and text message.

Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias. RESULTS: In total, 2665 patients with complete clinical outcomes were analyzed. The impacts of age, sex, and comorbidities were evaluated separately using binary logistic regression analysis. The results showed that age, sex, and cancer history are independent risk factors for mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with cancer exhibited a significant increase in mortality rate (29.4% vs. 10.2%, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the clinical outcomes of patients with hematological malignancies were worse, with a mortality rate twice that of patients with solid tumors (50% vs. 26.1%). Importantly, cancer patients with complications had a significantly higher risk of poor outcomes. One hundred nine cancer patients were matched to noncancer controls in a 1:3 ratio by propensity score matching. After propensity score matching, the cancer patients still had a higher risk of mortality than the matched noncancer patients (odds ratio (OR) 2.98, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.76-5.06).

The Covid-19 crisis has put the processes of social structures to the test. Communication and marketing are examples of these processes that face an unprecedented and unforeseen situation. In this sense, it is intended to reflect on how the pandemic affects and will condition the practice of university communication, both internal communication and its link with society. Finally, emphasis is placed on the importance of the universities assuming that reputation is a risk, and that this risk must be managed with the techniques and tools of communication, since the pandemic demonstrated higher education institutions the importance of managing relationships of trust with their teachers and students.","output":"University Communication in Times of Covid-19: The Ecuadorian Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a high rate of mortality in patients with end stage renal disease and vaccination is hoped to prevent infection. Methods. Between January 18, and February 24, 2021, 225 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and 45 hemodialysis patients (HDP) received two injections of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. The post-vaccinal humoral and cellular response was explored in the first 45 KTR and 10 HDP. Results. After the second dose, 8 HDP (88.9%) and 8 KTR (17.8%) developed anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (p<0.0001). Median titer of antibodies in responders was 1052 AU/mL (IQR: 515-2689) in HDP and 671 AU/mL (IQR: 172-1523) in KTR (p=0.4). Nine HDP (100%) and 26 KTR (57.8%) showed a specific T cell response (p=0.06) after the second injection. In responders, median numbers of spike-reactive T cells were 305 SFC/106 CD3+ T cells (IQR: 95-947) in HDP and 212 SFC/106 CD3+ T cells (IQR: 61-330) in KTR (p=0.4). In KTR, the immune response to BNT162b2 seemed influenced by the immunosuppressive regimen, particularly tacrolimus or belatacept. Conclusion. Immunization with BNT162b2 seems more efficient in HDP, indicating that vaccination should be highly recommended in these patients awaiting a transplant. However, the current vaccinal strategy for KTR may not provide effective protection against COVID-19 and will likely need to be improved.","output":"Antibody and T Cell Response to SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA BNT162b2 Vaccine in Kidney Transplant Recipients and Hemodialysis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coordinates viral RNA synthesis as part of an assembly known as the replication-transcription complex (RTC)1. Accordingly, the RTC is a target for clinically approved antiviral nucleoside analogs, including remdesivir2. Faithful synthesis of viral RNAs by the RTC requires recognition of the correct nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) for incorporation into the nascent RNA. To be effective inhibitors, antiviral nucleoside analogs must compete with the natural NTPs for incorporation. How the SARS-CoV-2 RTC discriminates between the natural NTPs, and how antiviral nucleoside analogs compete, has not been discerned in detail. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the RTC bound to each of the natural NTPs in states poised for incorporation. Furthermore, we investigate the RTC with the active metabolite of remdesivir, remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP), highlighting the structural basis for the selective incorporation of RDV-TP over its natural counterpart ATP3,4. Our results elucidate the suite of interactions required for NTP recognition, informing the rational design of antivirals.

Thirty-six brains from XDP individuals have been collected over an initial 4 years period. Tissue quality was assessed based on histologic staining of cortex, RNA integrity scores, detection of neuronal transcripts in situ by fluorescent hybridization chain reaction, and western blotting of neuronal and glial proteins. The results indicate that this pipeline preserves tissue integrity to an extent compatible with a range of morphologic, molecular, and biochemical analyses.

It is also the cause of wellbeing disorders and the source of various diseases. The wellbeing and health of nurses has a direct impact on the quality of care and health outcomes for patients. An appropriate stress coping strategy can reduce the impact of stress and mitigate its negative consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic, especially in its initial period, was a source of enormous additional stress for nurses. In Poland and Belarus: two neighboring countries with common history and similar culture, the authorities took a completely different approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare how nurses in Poland and Belarus cope with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The cross-sectional study was conducted among 284 nurses working in hospital in Bialystok, Poland (158) and in Grodno, Belarus (126). Mini-Cope inventory - the polish adaptation of Carver's BriefCope was used for measuring coping with stress. RESULTS: Only 17.5% of Belarusian nurses were tested for the presence of the virus and only 4.8% were infected, while in Poland it was 50.6 and 31.0%, respectively. The most frequent used coping strategies were active strategies (active coping, planning) and the least-used were avoidance strategies (behavioral disengagement, substance use) in both countries. Polish nurses significantly more often than Belorussian used support-seeking/emotion-oriented strategies, as well as avoidance strategies. No differences were found for active coping strategies between the both groups. Contact with a patient infected with the SARS-CoV2 virus did not influence the choice of stress coping strategies by nurses in both countries. Staying in quarantine or home isolation favored more active coping strategies, especially in the case of Belarusian nurses. Taking a SARS-CoV-2 test did not statistically differentiate the choice of coping strategies in the Belarusian group. In the Polish group, nurses with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result used both use of instrumental support and use of emotional support strategies less frequently. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection did not statistically differentiated how stressful situations were handled in Polish group. CONCLUSIONS: Polish and Belorussian nurses used similar strategies to cope with stress in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The social and demographic differences between Polish and Belorussian nurses differentiated the choice of coping strategies among the respondents to a greater extent than the completely different approach of the media and authorities to the COVID-19 pandemic in the two countries. The threat of the COVID-19 pandemic does not affect the choice of stress coping strategies by nurses in Poland and Belarus. Being in quarantine or home isolation favored the use of active coping strategies among Belorussian nurses. Polish nurses, on the other hand, were more likely to turn to religion after being quarantined.","output":"Strategies for Coping With Stress Used by Nurses in Poland and Belarus During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is commonly used in asymptomatic screening testing, but is suboptimal for this purpose as it will identify many old persistent positives that are no longer infectious. This can result in placement of individuals that are not infectious to others into isolation. This results in substantial adverse impact to military manning and operations, without any benefit to public health. Antigen testing does not have this same drawback. Antigen testing, while less sensitive than PCR, will identify the vast majority of infectious positives, especially those with higher viral loads that are more likely to transmit to others. Importantly, use of antigen testing will also greatly increase the certainty of benefit from isolation, reducing the risk of isolating those individuals who are beyond their infectious period and pose no threat to public health. The literature on this topic is reviewed, with particular focus on studies that perform viral culture in addition to PCR and antigen testing. This allows for determination of sensitivity for infectious virus. Also, Navy Region Japan's experience with a comprehensive antigen testing strategy is described.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize clinical correlates associated with HR change in the subacute period among patients recovering from AMI. METHODS: HR measurements were collected from 91 patients (4447 HR recordings) enrolled in the MiCORE study using the Apple Watch and Corrie smartphone application. Mixed regression models were used to estimate the associations of patient-level characteristics during hospital admission with HR changes over 30 days postdischarge. RESULTS: The mean daily HR at admission was 78.0 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval 76.1 to 79.8), declining 0.2 bpm/day (-0.3 to -0.1) under a linear model of HR change. History of coronary artery bypass graft, history of depression, or being discharged on anticoagulants was associated with a higher admission HR. Having a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or hyperlipidemia was associated with a slower decrease in HR over time, but not with HR during admission. CONCLUSION: While a declining HR was observed in AMI patients over 30 days postdischarge, patients with hypertension, T2DM, or hyperlipidemia showed a slower decrease in HR relative to their counterparts.

The goal of this study was to ascertain the antiviral activity of Larifan against the novel SARS-CoV-2. MethodsThe antiviral activity of Larifan against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro was measured in human lung adenocarcinoma (Calu3) and primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC) using cytopathic effect assay, viral RNA copy number detection by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and infectious virus titration in cells supernatants in Vero E6 cells by end-point titration method. The antiviral effect of Larifan in vivo was detected in SARS-CoV-2 infection model in Golden Syrian hamsters. Larifan (5 mg/kg) was administered either subcutaneously or intranasally twice before and after virus infection with a 24-hour interval between doses. The viral RNA copies and infectious virus titre were detected in animal lungs at day three and five post-infection using ddPCR and end-point titration in Vero E6 cells, respectively. Histopathology of lungs was analysed as well. ResultsLarifan inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu3 cells both after the drug addition pre- and pot-infection with a substantial drop in the supernatant viral RNA copy numbers from eight (p = 0.0013) to twenty (p = 0.0042) times, respectively. Similarly, infectious virus titre in Vero E6 cells dropped by 3.6log10 and 2.8log10 after the drug addition pre- and pot-infection, respectively. In HSAEC, Larifan inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication at the similar level. Larifan also markedly reduced virus numbers in the lungs of infected hamsters (p = 0.0032) both at day three and five post-infection with a more pronounced effect after intranasal administration reaching a drop by 2.7log10 at day three and 2.0log10 at day five. The administration of Larifan also reduced the amount of infections virus titer in lungs (p = 0.0039) by 4.3log10 and 2.8log10 at day three and five post-infection, respectively. Improvements in the infection-induced pathological lesion severity in the lungs of animals treated with Larifan were also demonstrated by histological analyses. ConclusionsThe inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and the reduction of the viral load in the lungs of infected hamsters treated with Larifan alongside the improved lung histopathology, suggests a potential use of Larifan in controlling the COVID-19 disease in humans.","output":"Bacteriophage-derived dsRNA exerts anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and in Golden Syrian hamsters in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The catastrophe of the coronavirus continues from one part of the world to another, and hardly a country is left without its devastations.

We hypothesized that dysregulation of LMs may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19. By examining LMs and polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor lipids in serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we demonstrate that moderate and severe disease are separated by specific differences in abundance of immune-regulatory and proinflammatory LMs. This difference in LM balance corresponded with decreased LM products of ALOX12 and COX2 and an increase LMs products of ALOX5 and cytochrome p450.

In this study, we aim at investigating novel ideas to recycle wasted facemasks in order to lower the environmental impact. An experimental study has been carried out to investigate the possibility of using discarded masks for thermal insulation and sound absorption. The wasted masks are simulated by new masks, which stripped off the nose clips, elastic ear loops and are heated to 120 C for one hour to kill any biological contaminants. The masks are also melted to investigate their thermal insulation and sound absorption properties. Results show that the thermal conductivity coefficients of the loose and melted masks are 0.03555 and 0.08683 W/m K, respectively, at room temperature of about 25 C. Results show also that the sound absorption coefficient for loose masks is above 0.6 for the frequency range 600C5000 Hz. The loose facemasks are found to be thermally stable up to 295 C, elastic ear loops at 304.7 C, and the composite (melted) facemasks at 330.0 C using the thermo-gravimetric analysis. Characterization of the facemasks three-layer fibers and the composite (melted) samples is obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The three-point bending test is obtained for the composite specimens showing good values of flexural stress, flexural strain, and flexural elastic modulus. These results are promising about using such discarded masks as new thermal insulation and sound-absorbing materials for buildings replacing the synthetic or petrochemical insulation materials.","output":"New novel thermal insulation and sound-absorbing materials from discarded facemasks of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using daily infection data for Hong Kong we explore the validity of a variety of models of disease propagation when applied to the SARS epidemic. Surrogate data methods show that simple random models are insufficient and that the standard epidemic susceptible-infected-removed model does not fully account for the underlying variability in the observed data. As an alternative, we consider a more complex small world network model and show that such a structure can be applied to reliably produce simulations quantitative similar to the true data. The small world network model not only captures the apparently random fluctuation in the reported data, but can also reproduces mini-outbreaks such as those caused by so-called \`\`super-spreaders'' and in the Hong Kong housing estate Amoy Gardens.","output":"Plausible models for propagation of the SARS virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improving the menstrual health literacy of girls and boys is a key strategy within a holistic framework of Save the Children's school health and comprehensive sexuality education programming. As menstrual health is an emerging area of study and programming, Save the Children continues to learn and adjust its interventions using program evaluations and rigorous monitoring. This paper will examine program-monitoring data from three cohorts, representing 47 public schools in Mexico City, Puebla, and Mrida, Mexico. The study focuses on female students in 5th and 6th grade who participated in We See Equal, a school-based program centered on gender equality and puberty education, between September 2018 and December 2019. This study used a cross-sectional quantitative cohort approach to document changes in girls' experiences and perceptions around managing menstruation in school. The analysis compares girls' knowledge and experiences before and after participation in We See Equal to understand how knowledge changes over the program and how those changes may contribute to menstruation-related school engagement, stress, and self-efficacy (MENSES) outcomes. Multivariate regression models explored relationships between MENSES outcomes, knowledge and socioeconomic status (SES). Overall, results show that the more knowledge girls acquired, the higher their self-efficacy score and the lower their stress score, however, certain MHH knowledge was more predictive of MENSES outcomes and varied by SES. Among girls from lower SES, we observed significant relationships between knowing what their period was prior to menarche and the three MENSES outcomes. Decreases in menstruation-related stress were driven by items related to the practical knowledge of how to dispose of sanitary pads and reduced feelings of nervousness on days they had their period at school. Increases in self-efficacy were primarily driven by girls' confidence in their ability to track their period from month to month, feelings that they could still do well on an exam if they had their period at school, and security that they could ask a friend to lend them a pad if they needed one. Implications for future menstrual health literacy programming and targeting populations for menstrual health education, as well as priorities for future research will be discussed.","output":"The More You Know, the Less You Stress: Menstrual Health Literacy in Schools Reduces Menstruation-Related Stress and Increases Self-Efficacy for Very Young Adolescent Girls in Mexico."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Curcuma longa constitutes an important source of secondary metabolites that have been associated with multiple health benefits. For instance, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, have been found to perform important biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, antihypertensive and anticoagulant. These promising results prompted this research to evaluate the polyphenols of C. longa rhizomes in Costa Rica. The present work reports a comprehensive study on the polyphenolic profile and the contents of the three main curcuminoids as well as the antioxidant activity of extracts from C. longa rhizomes (n = 12) produced in Costa Rica. Through UPLC-QTOF-ESI MS, a total of 33 polyphenols were identified, grouped in eight types of structures. In addition, our findings on the main curcuminoids using UPLC-DAD show all rhizomes complying with total curcuminoids (TC) content established by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). At an individual level, samples NW-3 and NE-1 show the higher contents (118.7 and 125.0 mg/g dry material), representing more than twice the average values of the lowest samples. These samples also exhibit the highest FolinCCiocalteu (FC) reducing capacity results as well as the best DPPH (IC(50) 15.21 and 16.07 g extract/mL) and NO (IC(50) between 52.5 and 54.3 g extract/mL) antioxidant values. Further, Pearson correlation analysis findings indicated positive correlation (p < 0.05) between TC, CUR with FC results (r = 0.833 and r = 0.867 respectively) and negative correlation (p < 0.05) between CUR, TC and FC with DPPH results (r = ?0.898, r = ?0.911, and r = ?0.890, respectively) and between NO results and DPPH (r = ?0.805, p < 0.05). Finally, results for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed composition variability associated with their region of origin with products from the Northeastern (NE) region exhibiting higher average values for FC, TC and antioxidant activities. Further, PCA confirmed that two samples, namely NE-1 and NW-3, stand out by presenting the highest PC1 due to their particularly high TC, CUR and antioxidant activities. Consequently, our findings agree with previous results indicating the importance of C. longa extracts to elaborate products with potential benefits for health, while delivering extracts with higher levels of curcuminoids than previous reports and exhibiting high antioxidant activity.","output":"Polyphenolic HRMS Characterization, Contents and Antioxidant Activity of Curcuma longa Rhizomes from Costa Rica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent developments in a variety of sectors, including health care, research and the direct-to-consumer industry, have led to a dramatic increase in the amount of genomic data that are collected, used and shared.

The lung is considered a usual anatomical location of KS, despite being infrequent, often in association with extensive mucocutaneous lesions and very uncommonly as an isolated event. We report a case of a pulmonary KS (pKS) in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) na?ve patient, which was atypical due to a lack of cutaneous involvement and an absence of respiratory symptoms. The pKS was initially identified as a tumoral suspected nodular lesion and only after immunohistochemical analysis was it characterized as KS. Furthermore, the diagnosis of pKS led to the discovery of the HIV-seropositive status of the patient, previously unknown. Our report underlines the importance of considering pKS even without skin lesions and as a first manifestation of HIV infection. We also reviewed literature on the current knowledge about pKS in people living with HIV (PLWH) to underline how one of the most common HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated tumors can have a challenging localization and be difficult to recognize.","output":"Pulmonary Kaposi Sarcoma without Respiratory Symptoms and Skin Lesions in an HIV-Na?ve Patient: A Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2019, it has remained a significant global threat, especially with the newly evolved variants. Despite the presence of different COVID-19 vaccines, the discovery of proper antiviral therapeutics is an urgent necessity. Nature is considered as a historical trove for drug discovery, especially in global crises. During our efforts to discover potential anti-SARS CoV-2 natural therapeutics, screening our in-house natural products and plant crude extracts library led to the identification of C. benedictus extract as a promising candidate. To find out the main chemical constituents responsible for the extracts antiviral activity, we utilized recently reported SARS CoV-2 structural information in comprehensive in silico investigations (e.g., ensemble docking and physics-based molecular modeling). As a result, we constructed proteinCprotein and proteinCcompound interaction networks that suggest cnicin as the most promising anti-SARS CoV-2 hit that might inhibit viral multi-targets. The subsequent in vitro validation confirmed that cnicin could impede the viral replication of SARS CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 1.18 g/mL. Furthermore, drug-like property calculations strongly recommended cnicin for further in vivo and clinical experiments. The present investigation highlighted natural products as crucial and readily available sources for developing antiviral therapeutics. Additionally, it revealed the key contributions of bioinformatics and computer-aided modeling tools in accelerating the discovery rate of potential therapeutics, particularly in emergency times like the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Cnicin as an Anti-SARS-CoV-2: An Integrated In Silico and In Vitro Approach for the Rapid Identification of Potential COVID-19 Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound changes to healthcare systems as well as had deleterious repercussions on the care of cancer patients. In this comparative study, we sought to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical management of breast cancer in a breast unit in an Italian region with a low incidence of COVID-19 infection. Eighty-three patients were included, of whom 41 received surgery during the height of the pandemic (Group A, operated on between March and April 2020), and 42 during the same period of the year in 2019 (Group B). Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups with regard to age (p = 0.62), tumour size (p = 0.25), grade (p = 0.27), histology (p = 0.43), positive lymph node status (p = 0.35), and ER positive status (0.35). Waiting time for surgery was slightly longer in Group A (49.11 vs. 46.39 days, p = 0.38). Patients receiving immediate breast reconstruction were significantly less in Group A (p < 0.001). The use of sentinel node biopsy was similar in the two groups (p = 0.84). Hospital stay was longer in patients of Group B (p = 0.008). The use of regional nerve blocks was lower in Group A (p < 0.001). Patients operated on during the height of the pandemic were less likely to receive immediate reconstruction and regional nerve blocks during surgery. These features configure a situation of reduced level of care for patients with breast cancer. Efforts should be taken by the healthcare systems to maintain standard of care, even in case of a new peak in the coronavirus outbreak.","output":"The COVID-19 Outbreak May Be Associated to a Reduced Level of Care for Breast Cancer.

Materials and methods: Two hundred fifty-two human subjects were enrolled in our study, such as patients with CAE, patients with CAD, and Controls. All the subjects were diagnosed by coronary angiography. Plasma metabolomic profiles of FAs were determined by an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometric (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). Results: Ninety-nine plasma metabolites were profiled in the discovery sets (n = 72), such as 35 metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 10 FAs, and 54 phospholipids. Among these metabolites, 36 metabolites of AA, EPA, and DHA showed the largest difference between CAE and Controls or CAD. 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 17(S)-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDoHE), EPA, AA, and 5-HETE were defined as a biomarker panel in peripheral blood to distinguish CAE from CAD and Controls in a discovery set (n = 72) and a validation set (n = 180). This biomarker panel had a better diagnostic performance than metabolite alone in differentiating CAE from Controls and CAD. The areas under the ROC curve of the biomarker panel were 0.991 and 0.836 for CAE versus Controls and 1.00 and 0.904 for CAE versus CAD in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that the metabolic profiles of FAs in the plasma from patients with CAE can be distinguished from those of Controls and CAD. Differences in FAs metabolites may help to interpret pathological mechanisms of CAE.","output":"Metabolomic Characterization of Fatty Acids in Patients With Coronary Artery Ectasias"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/28.md","filePath":"doctor/28.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/28.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
