A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a 'playable model' in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is also analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in both maximizing productivity and minimizing overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed for how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.","output":"The benefits of peer transparency in safe workplace operation post pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Our pilot study suggested that coexisting cerebrovascular diseases on admission with respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths per min, and LDH greater than 245U/L may be risk factors for death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Henan province, China.

Background: To explore risk factors associated with severe cases in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Henan province, China Methods: : This study was a multicenter retrospective cohort study. A total of 112 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Anyang Infectious Disease Hospital from February 3 to March 31, 2020. These patients were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data, imaging changes, and definite severity typing of illness (severe cases or non-severe cases) were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between severe cases and non-severe cases. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital severe cases. Results: A total of 104 patients (55 from Henan Provincial People's Hospital and 57 from Anyang Infectious Disease Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 62 (59.6%) were non-severe cases and 42 (40.4%) were severe cases.

Methods: A total of 1,115 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at Tongji hospital from February to April 2020 and classified into fatal (n = 129) and recovered (n = 986) groups according to the patient's outcome. Prealbumin and other routine laboratory indicators were measured simultaneously. Results: The level of prealbumin on admission was significantly lower in fatal patients than in recovered patients. For predicting the prognosis of COVID-19, the performance of prealbumin was better than most routine laboratory indicators, such as albumin, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I. When a threshold of 126 mg/L was used to discriminate between fatal and recovered patients, the sensitivity and specificity of prealbumin were, respectively, 78.29 and 90.06%. Furthermore, a model based on the combination of nine indexes showed an improved performance in predicting the death of patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: We identified SARS-CoV-2 positive cases by polymerase chain reaction performed at our center within an updated RMDs database in our clinic. Additional RMDs patients were identified when they contacted the clinic because of a positive infection. Data extraction included diagnosis, demographics, immunosuppressive treatment, comorbidities, and laboratory tests. Comparisons between patients with or without hospitalization were performed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze associations between baseline variables and need for hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients with COVID-19 and underlying RMDs were identified by April 24, 2020. Median age was 60.9 years, and 42% men. Forty-two patients required hospitalization; these were more frequently men, older and with comorbidities. There were no statistically significant between-group differences for rheumatologic diagnosis and for baseline use of immunosuppressive therapy except for glucocorticoids that were more frequent in hospitalized patients.

We propose a new methodological approach based on the Estrada communicability for identifying communities on a multiplex network, based on a two-step optimization. At first, we determine the optimal inter-layer intensity between levels by minimizing a distance function. Hence, the optimal inter-layer intensity is used to detect communities on each layer. Our findings show that the community detection on this multiplex network has greater information power than classical methods for single-layer networks. Our approach better reveals clusters on each layer with respect to the application of the same approach on each single-layer. Moreover, detected groups in the multiplex case benefit of a higher cohesion, leading to identifying on each layer a lower number of communities with respect to the ones obtained in the single-layer cases.","output":"The effect of the pandemic on complex socio-economic systems: community detection induced by communicability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prior research has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccination in the United States. Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites). METHODS: Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare. RESULTS: Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations. DISCUSSION: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.","output":"Black-white disparities in 2009 H1N1 vaccination among adults in the United States: A cautionary tale for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anti-tumor modality which employs three individually non-toxic substances, including photosensitizer, light and oxygen, to produce a toxic effect.

To understand more about the immune effect, the biochemical actions of BAM-SiPc-PDT on CT26 cells were studied in the in vitro system. It was confirmed that the PDT treatment could induce immunogenic necroptosis in the tumor cells. Upon treatment, different damage-associated molecular patterns were exposed onto the cell surface or released from the cells. Among them, calreticulin was found to translocate to the cell membrane through a pathway similar to that in chemotherapy.

Molecular-level understanding of interactions between spike proteins and hACE2 can aid strategies for blocking attachment of SARS-CoV-1, a potentially reemerging health threat, to human cells.

It begins as a respiratory infection that, mainly in men with diabetes or renal impairment, evolves into a systemic disease, with SARDS, progressive endothelial cell damage, abnormal clotting and impaired cardiovascular and liver function. Some clinical trials are testing biological drugs to limit the immune system dysregulation, \\"cytokines storm,\\" that causes the systemic complications of COVID-19. The contraindications of these drugs and their cost raise concerns over the implications of their widespread availability. OBJECTIVES: Numerous clinical and experimental studies have revealed a role for the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) pathway in modulating low-grade inflammation in patients with metabolic diseases, offering cardiovascular protection. PDE5 inhibition favors an anti-inflammatory response by modulating activated T cells, reducing cytokine release, lowering fibrosis, increasing oxygen diffusion, stimulating vascular repair. PDE5 is highly expressed in the lungs, where its inhibition improves pulmonary fibrosis, a complication of severe COVID-19 disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all evidence documenting any involvement of the NO-cGMP-PDE5 axis in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, presenting the ongoing clinical trials aimed at modulating this axis, including our own \\"silDEnafil administration in DiAbetic and dysmetaboLic patients with COVID-19 (DEDALO trial).\\" RESULTS: The reviewed evidence suggests that PDE5 inhibitors could offer a new strategy in managing COVID-19 by (i) counteracting the Ang-II-mediated downregulation of AT-1 receptor; (ii) acting on monocyte switching, thus reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, interstitial infiltration and the vessel damage responsible for alveolar hemorrhage-necrosis; (iii) inhibiting the transition of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to mesenchymal cells in the pulmonary artery, preventing clotting and thrombotic complications. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: If the ongoing trials presented herein should provide positive findings, the low cost, wide availability and temperature stability of PDE5 inhibitors could make them a major resource to combat COVID-19 in developing countries.","output":"Targeting the NO-cGMP-PDE5 pathway in COVID-19 infection.

Most of the existing literature has targeted mothers low educational level, living in underserved districts and/or remote rural areas and economic poverty that are correlated with low immunization coverage but the supply- and demand-side constraints to immunization in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) are not well understood. The reliability of claimed administrative immunization coverage in these contexts is questionable. To address these barriers within the present Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the difficulties related to inadequate vaccination uptake must be addressed in more depth. Building on already produced literature, this study aims to determine the extent of immunization coverage among children in LMICs, as well as to fill in the gaps in awareness about system-level obstacles that currently hinder the effective delivery and uptake of immunization services through EPI. By two reviewers, a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar along with targeted grey literature was conducted on the 2nd of June 2021 by following PRISMA guidelines. The search techniques for electronic databases used both Medical Subject Headings (Mesh) and free-text words were tailored to each database's specific needs using a controlled vocabulary that was limited to the English language from 2000 and 2020. Of the 689 records, eleven articles were included in this review meeting the inclusion criteria. In total, five articles related to vaccination coverage, four studies on components of the routine immunization system, one article on the implementation of new and under-utilized vaccines and one were on vaccines financing.

Review findings suggest that specific strategies to reduce inequality may be required. Vaccine procurement and pricing strategies, as well as vaccine customization to meet the needs of LMICs, are all critical components in strengthening immunization systems. Our findings could be used to establish practical strategies for countries and development partners to address coverage gaps and improve vaccination system effectiveness.

Many of those recommendations were implemented in buildings across the world even before the presence of field data validated their effectiveness. However, as the pandemic raised awareness of the risks present in the air quality of everyday built environments, little is known about how occupants perceive these interventions or how they will perceive buildings when activities resume with an in-person requirement. This paper presents results from an online survey, conducted from April 23rd to May 8th, 2021, and offers a window into the perceptions of university students on a variety of physical intervention strategies that have been promoted for the return to classrooms. Our analysis explores differences in these perceptions between students from Colombia and the United States, where the vaccination rates of the population as of May 2021 differed substantially. An anonymous online survey was disseminated to students of higher academic institutions using images portraying 3D models of classrooms and written prompts to assess perceptions. Health risk and health promotion perceptions were evaluated using four categories: visual connection to the outdoors, occupant density, additional furnishings, ventilation system type, and number of operable windows. While the effectiveness of these strategies from an epidemiological standpoint was not considered, this survey aimed to measure the perceived effectiveness of these strategies as students prepare to return to in-person education in the classroom. Our analysis found a significant effect of different degrees of connection to the outdoors and occupant density on both perceived health risk and health promotion in both countries. Respondents ranked strategies like mask-wearing and natural ventilation as important interventions when considering a return to the classroom. Perceptions of health risk and health promotion between students taking classes in the United States and Colombia were significantly different regarding the presence of additional furnishings, and ventilation systems and number of windows in a classroom. The results presented here may shed light on how aspects of the built environment help shape perceptions of healthy environments during the pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study within the Italian CF Society. CF centers collected baseline and follow-up data of patients with virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and June 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) for severe SARS-CoV-2 (as defined by hospital admission) were estimated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: The study included 236 patients with positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. Six patients died, 43 patients were admitted to hospital, 4 admitted to intensive care unit. Pancreatic insufficiency was associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 4.04, 95% CI 1.52; 10.8). After adjusting for age and pancreatic insufficiency, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEVp) < 40% (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.56; 13.2), oxygen therapy (OR 12.3, 95% CI 2.91C51.7), underweight (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.12; 7.57), organ transplantation (OR 7.31, 95% CI 2.59; 20.7), diabetes (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.23; 5.80) and liver disease (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.77; 7.59) were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19, while use of dornase alfa was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13C0.88).

Intervention comprises school health promotion council involving staff and students coordinating delivery; student survey to inform local tailoring; teacher-delivered classroom curriculum; student-run campaigns; parent information; and review of sexual/reproductive health services to inform improvements. This trial builds on an optimisation/pilot RCT study which met progression criteria, plus findings from another pilot RCT of the Project Respect school-based intervention to prevent dating and relationship violence which concluded such work should be integrated within Positive Choices. Young people carry a disproportionate burden of adverse sexual health; most do not report competence at first sex. Relationships and sex education in schools can contribute to promoting sexual health but effects are small, inconsistent and not sustained. Such work needs to be supplemented by whole-school (e.g. student campaigns, sexual health services) and social marketing (harnessing commercial marketing to social ends) approaches for which there is good review-level evidence but not from the UK. METHODS: We will conduct a cluster RCT across 50 schools (minimum 6440, maximum 8500 students) allocated 1:1 to intervention/control assessing outcomes at 33 months. Our primary outcome is non-competent first sex. Secondary outcomes are non-competent last sex, age at sexual debut, non-use of contraception at first and last sex among those reporting heterosexual intercourse, number of sexual partners, dating and relationship violence, sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy and unintended pregnancy for girls and initiation of pregnancy for boys. We will recruit 50 school and undertake baseline surveys by March 2022; implement the intervention over the 2022C2024 school years and conduct the economic and process evaluations by July 2024; undertake follow-up surveys by December 2024; complete analyses, all patient and policy involvement and draft the study report by March 2025; and engage in knowledge exchange from December 2024. DISCUSSION: This trial is one of a growing number focused on whole-school approaches to public health in schools. The key scientific output will be evidence about the effectiveness, costs and potential scalability and transferability of Positive Choices. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN No: ISRCTN16723909.

Yet, there is a paucity of information on contributing factors and causes of neonatal deaths, particularly at the sub-national level. This study describes care-seeking during neonates' fatal illnesses and their causes of death. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional community-based study to identify all neonatal deaths in Serang and Jember Districts, Indonesia. Follow-up interviews were conducted with the families of deceased neonates using an adapted verbal and social autopsy instrument. Cause of death was determined using the InSilicoVA algorithm. RESULTS: The main causes of death of 259 neonates were prematurity (44%) and intrapartum-related events (IPRE)-mainly birth asphyxia (39%). About 83% and 74% of the 259 neonates were born and died at a health facility, respectively; 79% died within the first week after birth. Of 70 neonates whose fatal illness began at home, 59 (84%) sought care during the fatal illness. Forty-eight of those 59 neonates went to a formal care provider; 36 of those 48 neonates (75%) were moderately or severely ill when the family decided to seek care. One hundred fifteen of 189 neonates (61%) whose fatal illnesses began at health facilities were born at a hospital. Among those 115, only 24 (21%) left the hospital alive-of whom 16 (67%) were referred by the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of deaths due to prematurity and IPRE suggests the need for improved management of small and asphyxiated newborns. The moderate to severe condition of neonates at the time when care was sought from home highlights the importance of early illness recognition and appropriate management for sick neonates. Among deceased neonates whose fatal illness began at their delivery hospital, the high proportion of referrals may indicate issues with hospital capability, capacity, and/or cost.","output":"Neonatal mortality in two districts in Indonesia: Findings from Neonatal Verbal and Social Autopsy (VASA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an appealing therapeutic option for a range of clinical applications, their potential to induce clotting when used systemically remains a safety concern, particularly in hypercoagulable conditions, such as in patients with severe COVID-19, trauma, or cancers. Here, we tested a novel ex vivo approach aimed at improving the safety of MSC systemic administration by use of a bioreactor. In this device, MSCs are seeded on the outside of a hollow-fiber filter, sequestering them behind a hemocompatible membrane, while still maintaining cross talk with blood cells and circulating signaling molecules. The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in coagulable plasma was compared against free MSCs, as a model of systemic administration, which were directly injected into the circuit. Our results showed that physical isolation of the MSCs via a bioreactor extends the time necessary for clot formation to occur when compared to free MSCs. Measurement of cell surface data indicates the presence of known clot inducing factors, namely tissue factor and phosphatidylserine. Results also showed that recovering cells and flushing the bioreactor prior to use further prolonged clot formation time. Further, application of this technology in two in vivo models did not require additional heparin to maintain target ACT levels relative to the acellular device. Taken together, the use of hollow fiber filters to house MSCs, if adopted clinically, could offer a novel method to control systemic MSC exposure and prolong clot formation time.","output":"Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Delivery via an Ex Vivo Bioreactor Preclinical Test System Attenuates Clot Formation for Intravascular Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: An online survey of 1577 private kindergarten teachers was conducted during the pandemic, and their career situation and its influencing factors were described and analyzed.

One of the primary challenges in this field is the immobilization of biomolecular probes atop a solid substrate material with adequate stability, storage lifetime, and reproducibility. This review summarizes the current state of the art for covalent bonding of biomolecules onto solid substrate materials. Early research focused on the use of Au electrodes, with immobilization of biomolecules through -functionalized Au-thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), but stability is usually inadequate due to the weak AuCS bond strength. Other noble substrates such as C, Pt, and Si have also been studied. While their nobility has the advantage of ensuring biocompatibility, it also has the disadvantage of making them relatively unreactive towards covalent bond formation. With the exception of Sn-doped In(2)O(3) (indium tin oxide, ITO), most metal oxides are not electrically conductive enough for use within electrochemical biosensors. Recent research has focused on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS(2) and on electrically conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene.

METHODS: We examined temporal changes in urologic care delivery in the United States from February 2020 to July 2020 based on patient, practice, and local/regional demographic and pandemic response features using real-world data from the American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry, which is a Qualified Clinical Data Registry. Data are collected via automated extraction from practices' electronic health record systems. RESULTS: There were 2,750,001 unique patients represented in our study cohort, accounting for 8,953,832 total outpatient visits and 1,570,161 procedures;data represented 157 outpatient urologic practices and 3,165 providers across 48 US states and territories. We found large (>40%) declines in outpatient visits from March 2020 to April 2020 across all patient demographic groups and across states, regardless of timing of state stay-at-home orders. Visits recovered through May and early June, but began falling again by early July. Non-urgent outpatient visits decreased more across various non-urgent procedures (39e47%) than for procedures performed for urgent diagnoses (29e43%);surgical procedures for non-urgent conditions also decreased more (37e53%) than those for potentially urgent conditions (13e21%) (Table). African American and Hispanic patients had smaller decreases in outpatient visits compared with Asian and Caucasian patients, but also slower recoveries back to baseline. Medicare-insured patients had the steepest declines (50%) while those on Medicaid had among the lowest percentage of recovery to baseline (84.4%). Practices in zip codes with lower median incomes, higher poverty levels, and lower urologist to population ratios had smaller decreases in outpatient visits.

The patients journey to manage HS is often complex and unsuccessful, which motivates the aim of this research to gain insight into unmet needs and relevant treatment considerations from the perspective of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and HCPs experienced in treating HS to understand the perceived unmet care needs and to identify important treatment attributes. Prioritization of the five most important treatment attributes allowed elicitation of their relative importance. RESULTS: Interviews with 12 patients and 16 HCPs revealed 16 areas of unmet needs either related to treatment outcomes or the care process and 13 important treatment attributes. The most frequently reported unmet needs by patients and HCPs were lacking quality-of-life improvement, low treatment effectiveness, inadequate pain control, low disease awareness, and delayed diagnosis. Patients expressed unique concerns relating to pain management, access to HS specialists, and wound care guidance and costs, which HCPs did not. Treatment attributes related to effectiveness were considered most important by patients and HCPs. Patients additionally emphasized a strong preference for improved pain management. CONCLUSIONS: Current HS treatments and care processes leave patients and HCPs with a high level of unmet need. It is critical to consider patients and HCPs perspectives when designing appropriate HS care as perceived unmet needs differ.

The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies. Key findings: Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting. However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus. Implications for practice: The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.","output":"Point of care and intensive care lung ultrasound: A reference guide for practitioners during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, encompass mutations facilitating immune evasion.

Due to concerns for potential adverse pharmacologic effects, balancing appropriate pain management is a challenge among NH residents. The challenges encompass but are not limited to medical complexities, functional disabilities, and physical frailty. Barriers to the successful implementation of a comprehensive chronic pain management at the NH may include ambiguous directions on specific therapeutic interventions, insufficient guidance on treatment duration, and limited available treatment options. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' reporting requirement of adequate pain control among NH residents coupled with widely variable clinician-prescribing habits highlights the difficulties in overcoming the preceding challenges and barriers. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated pain management due to its negative consequences on well-being of residents of NHs. Associated symptoms of psychosocial stress, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain symptoms can exacerbate during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased requirement for pain medications including but not limited to opioids. Pain is a multidimensional symptom and requires a strategic multimodal approach for its management. Nonpharmacologic modalities are underutilized in the NH setting and are the preferred first steps for mild pain, and nonopioid pharmacological agents can be added as a second step for a synergistic effect for moderate to severe pain. Opioids should be used as a last resort. Short-acting opioids are preferred over extended-release/long-acting opioids for chronic pain. Clinicians are encouraged to engage residents in proactive strategies in managing their pain, and to set realistic expectations toward improving their quality of life, as complete elimination of pain is not feasible in most cases. This review article provides the interdisciplinary team with a contemporary perspective of the multitude of changes and challenges influencing the prescribing as well as deprescribing of various pain medications.","output":"Management of Chronic Pain in Nursing Homes: Navigating Challenges to Improve Person-Centered Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Duck tembusu virus (DTMUV) was firstly identified in 2010 in China; since then, it has caused enormous economic loss to breeding industry. Great efforts have been made to develop drugs and vaccines against DTMUV. However, current available vaccines or anti-DTMUV drugs are consistently inefficient. Hence, various more broadly effective drugs have become important for the treatment of DTMUV infection; among these, lycorine, one of the important sources of active alkaloids, is a promising example. Nevertheless, it is not known whether lycorine has any antiviral activities against DTMUV. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the anti-DTMUV abilities of lycorine. The cytotoxicity of lycorine was evaluated on BHK-21 cells by CCK-8 assay, and its antiviral effect against DTMUV was examined by real-time PCR assays, virus titer determination, Western blot and immunofluorescence (IFA) assays, respectively. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the anti-DTMUV effects of lycorine were also investigated. The results indicated that the highest nontoxicity concentration of lycorine on BHK-21 cells was 5 M. Lycorine possessed the antiviral ability against DTMUV on BHK-21 cells, as demonstrated by the reduction of virus titers and copy numbers in vitro. Western blot and IFA analysis showed the inhibitory effect of lycorine on DTMUV envelope (E) protein expression. Moreover, using time-of-addition assays, we found that lycorine displays its antivirus and virucidal activities through blocking viral internalization and entry in vitro. Taken together, our findings firstly demonstrate the antiviral activities of lycorine against DTMUV, suggesting that lycorine can be a potential drug for the treatment of DTMUV infection.","output":"Antiviral and virucidal activities of lycorine on duck tembusu virus in vitro by blocking viral internalization and entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously we reported that viramidine is a prodrug of ribavirin and that adenosine deaminase catalyses viramidine deamination to ribavirin in vivo.

Such stressful events trigger a complex physiological reaction - the fight-or-flight response - that can hamper flexible decision-making and learning. Inspired by key neural and peripheral characteristics of the fight-or-flight response, here, we ask whether acute stress changes how humans learn about costs and benefits. METHODS Healthy adults were randomly exposed to an acute stress (age mean=23.48, 21/40 female) or no-stress control (age mean=23.80, 22/40 female) condition, after which they completed a reinforcement learning task in which they minimize cost (physical effort) and maximize benefits (monetary rewards). During the task pupillometry data were collected. A computational model of cost-benefit reinforcement learning was employed to investigate the effect of acute stress on cost and benefit learning and decision-making. RESULTS Acute stress improved learning to maximize rewards relative to minimizing physical effort (Condition-by-Trial Type interaction: F(1,78)= 6.53, p = 0.01, n2G= 0.04; reward > effort in stress condition: t(39) = 5.40, p < 0.01). Computational modelling revealed that asymmetric learning could be explained by changes in the learning rates of reward value and action cost [condition-by-learning rate (R, E) interaction: F(1,78)= 6.42, p = 0.01, n2G= 0.03; E> R in control condition: t(39) = -4.75, p < 0.001]. This process was associated with distinct alterations in pupil size fluctuations. Data and scripts are available (https://osf.io/ydv2q/). CONCLUSIONS Here we demonstrate that acute stress is associated with asymmetric learning about reward value versus action cost, thereby providing new insights into learning strategies under acute stress, which, depending on the context, may be maladaptive or beneficial. Our pupillometry and physiological results tentatively link asymmetric cost and benefit learning to stress-related changes in catecholamine activity.","output":"Asymmetric effects of acute stress on cost and benefit learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Participation of Religious Leaders in Helping the Success of the Governments COVID-19 Vaccination Program. The basic idea of this paper departs from observations in the virtual and real world where certain people or groups are found who disagree with the need to be vaccinated. If the countrys people reject the mandatory mass vaccination which the government is discussing, it will take a long time to restore normal activities. This paper uses a descriptive qualitative method with a literature study approach. The description in this paper found some people's rejection of vaccines because their views or perceptions about COVID-19 influenced it. The government's hope to immediately carry out mass vaccinations for all Indonesian people must be balanced with maximum efforts to make it happen. This substantial effort can be made by providing massive education in the media conducting public campaigns and providing guarantees to vaccine recipients. On the other hand, the success of this vaccination program does not only depend on the government;all elements of society are expected to contribute to this regard, especially religious leaders. The manifestation of the involvement of religious leaders is by educating the congregation through the pulpit about vaccines. In addition, religious leaders must also set an example by participating in vaccinations and actively countering hoax news.

The aim of this study was to provide estimates of the size of vulnerable populations at high risk for a severe COVID-19 course in Germany based on the currently available risk factor data. METHODS: We used nationwide outpatient claims data from the years 2010 to 2019 collected according to  295 of the Code of Social Law V, covering data for all statutory health insurees (SHI) which is nearly 87% of the entire German population. We considered 15 chronic disorders based on the current state of knowledge about clinically relevant risk factors. Three risk groups for a severe COVID-19 course were defined: 1. individuals in the age group 15 to 59 years with at least two comorbid disorders; 2. individuals aged 60 to 79 years with at least one disorder and 3. all individuals 80 years and older irrespective of the presence of chronic conditions. Regional analysis was conducted at the level of administrative districts (n = 401). RESULTS: Overall, 26% of individuals over 15 years were at high risk for a severe COVID-19 course in 2019 amounting to a total number of nearly 18.5 million individuals in Germany. This included 3.8 million individuals in risk group 1, 9.2 million in risk group 2, and 5.4 million in risk group 3, corresponding to 8, 50 and 100% of German inhabitants in the respective age groups. On the level of the 17 administrative regions formed by the Association of SHI Physicians (ASHIP regions), the proportion of individuals at high risk ranged between 21% in Hamburg and 35% in Saxony-Anhalt.

METHODS: The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size. RESULTS: Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices).

The aim of this study was to explore the adequacy of ABHR solution production practice in response to COVID-19 in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was applied using assessment checklist for evaluation of the adequacy of ABHR production practice in compounding units of public hospitals. The evaluation was done with regard to the standard requirements as per the checklist. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 was used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics was employed for analyses of data and categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: Out of the 13 public hospitals observed in the study, 11 facilities had dedicated premises for compounding of ABHR solution. Seven facilities determined the concentration of ethanol in ABHR solution using alcoholmeters. Only one health facility had a titration kit and performed a strength test for the hydrogen peroxide raw material.

Eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH were retrospectively investigated in this study. All patients presented with jaundice, persistent high-grade fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, evidence of hemophagocytes in the bone marrow and laboratory abnormalities indicating HLH.

The engagement of students has been essential for their good academic performance which can be ensured by the active participation of the students and this is a real challenge for the teachers. However, sometimes in online and physical teaching, teachers are also involved in rationalized knowledge hiding, which leads to the disengagement of the students, and this ultimately affects their academic performance. Therefore, the present study aims at measuring the students disengagement in the teaching classes, both physical and online. The population of the present study is the students from the universities of China belonging to different fields of study. The sample size for this study is 246. The data are obtained through the Questionnaire surveys. The existing study has assessed the role of teachers rationalized knowledge hiding behaviors in the disengagement of students and their lesser grades. It has been found that rationalized knowledge hiding in online teaching does not affect students performance;however, it makes students disengage from their studies in physical classes. Interestingly, the rationalized knowledge hiding in physical teaching has negatively affected the performance of the students. Furthermore, the mediating role of the students disengagement has been found significant in this study. Organizations, especially universities, can ensure maximum knowledge sharing by motivating the instructors through positive reinforcements. This study will be useful for the curriculum coordinators of different departments in ensuring the maximum outcome of the teaching classes, workshops, and seminars conducted either physically or online to avoid the rationalized knowledge hiding of the teachers.","output":"Effects of Knowledge Hiding in Dual Teaching Methods on Students PerformanceEvidence From Physical Education Department Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multivariate statistical techniques, including cluster analysis (CA), discriminant analysis (DA), principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA), were used to evaluate temporal and spatial variations in and to interpret large and complex water quality datasets collected from the Shuangji River Basin.

Fibroblasts are key regulators of tissue mechanics in the lungs and other organs. However, the effects of IL-1 on fibroblast mechanics and functions remain unclear. Here we treated human pulmonary fibroblasts from control donors with IL-1 and used Atomic Force Microscopy to unveil that IL-1 significantly reduces the stiffness of fibroblasts concomitantly with a downregulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and alpha-smooth muscle (-SMA). Likewise, COL1A1 mRNA was reduced, whereas that of collagenases MMP1 and MMP2 were upregulated, favoring a reduction of type-I collagen. These mechanobiology changes were functionally associated with reduced proliferation and enhanced migration upon IL-1 stimulation, which could facilitate lung repair by drawing fibroblasts to sites of tissue damage. Our observations reveal that IL-1 may reduce local tissue rigidity by acting both intracellularly and extracellularly through the downregulation of fibroblast contractility and type I collagen deposition, respectively. These IL-1-dependent mechanical effects may enhance lung repair further by locally increasing pulmonary tissue compliance to preserve normal lung distension and function. Moreover, our results support that IL-1 provides innate anti-fibrotic protection that may be relevant during the early stages of lung repair.","output":"Interleukin-1 Modulation of the Mechanobiology of Primary Human Pulmonary Fibroblasts: Potential Implications in Lung Repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first study to examine the differential impact of Croatian and European economic policy uncertainty indices while controlling for the real effective exchange rate and industrial production on international tourist arrivals for the seven coastal counties of Croatia and the country as a whole.

However, our knowledge on disease recovery is sparse and concerns about long-term pulmonary impairments are increasing. Causing a broad spectrum of symptoms, COVID-19 can manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severely affected patients. Notably, pulmonary infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of COVID-19, induces diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) followed by fibrotic remodeling and persistent reduced oxygenation in some patients. It is currently not known whether tissue scaring fully resolves or progresses to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The most aggressive form of pulmonary fibrosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a fatal disease that progressively destroys alveolar architecture by uncontrolled fibroblast proliferation and the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is assumed that micro-injuries to the alveolar epithelium may be induced by inhalation of micro-particles, pathophysiological mechanical stress or viral infections, which can result in abnormal wound healing response. However, the exact underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of lung fibrosis are poorly understood due to the limited availability of clinically relevant models. Recently, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 with the urgent need to investigate its pathogenesis and address drug options, has led to the broad application of in vivo and in vitro models to study lung diseases. In particular, advanced in vitro models including precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), lung organoids, 3D in vitro tissues and lung-on-chip (LOC) models have been successfully employed for drug screens. In order to gain a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and ultimately alveolar tissue regeneration, it will be crucial to optimize the available models for SARS-CoV-2 infection in multicellular systems that recapitulate tissue regeneration and fibrotic remodeling. Current evidence for SARS-CoV-2 mediated pulmonary fibrosis and a selection of classical and novel lung models will be discussed in this review.","output":"Human-Based Advanced in vitro Approaches to Investigate Lung Fibrosis and Pulmonary Effects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Garlic (Allium sativa L.) is a bulbous flowering plant belongs to the family of Amaryllidaceae and is a predominant horticultural crop originating from central Asia.

Based on findings of different studies across the globe, the disease is characterized by poor outcomes in specific sociodemographic categories such as age, gender and presence of symptoms. METHODS: In this study, we carried out a multivariable logistic regression analysis on a national database (HESN+) of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia to determine predictors of hospitalization and mortality for these patients. RESULTS: Data was extracted for 328,301 confirmed COVID- 19 patients (mean age (SD) = 37.79 (1.68)) with 34.92% females and 65.08% males. Of these, 59.87% were Saudi Arabian citizens and 40.13% were non-Saudi. 68.91% of cases were discovered in Riyadh (n = 67,384), Makkah (n = 72,590) and the Eastern Province (n = 79,666). 72.2% of all cases were diagnosed and treated by the Ministry of Health (MOH). Of all confirmed cases, 95.28% showed one or more symptoms associated with COVID-19. 5.48% of these were hospitalized and 1.11% died.

Porphyromonas gingivalis is considered to be the keystone periodontopathogen. Indeed, periodontitis, as a highly common inflammatory disease, is the major cause of severe tooth loss and edentulism in adults globally, and yet it is crucially involved in various systemic comorbidities like diabetes. We have recently revealed P. gingivalis persisters-induced perturbation of immuno-inflammatory responses and effective suppression of this key pathogen by bismuth drugs. This study further explored novel approaches to eradicating P. gingivalis persisters through synergistic combination of colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) with traditional antibiotics. P. gingivalis (ATCC 33277) cells in planktonic and biofilm states were cultured to stationary phase, and then treated with metronidazole (100 mg/L), amoxicillin (100 mg/L), CBS, (100 M) and combinations of these medications, respectively. Persister survival rate was calculated by colony-forming unit. Cell viability and cytotoxicity of CBS were assessed in human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs). Notably, CBS combined with metronidazole enabled the effective eradication of P. gingivalis persisters in planktonic mode, and nearly eliminated their existence in biofilm mode. Importantly, CBS exhibited no effects on the viability of HGECs, along with minimal cytotoxicity (<5%) even at a high concentration (400 M). This pioneering study shows that P. gingivalis persisters could be well eliminated via the synergistic combination of CBS with metronidazole.

After fixation with formalin at scheduled intervals (1week, 2weeks, 4weeks, and 8weeks; 4 rats in each group), the vein segment with the catheter in situ was harvested. Histological changes in the vein wall were studied and serially compared with light microscopy; standard hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson's trichrome staining, van Gieson's elastin stain, and immunohistochemical stain against -actin. RESULTS Pericatheter sleeve formation, circumferential smooth muscle cell proliferation and infiltration into the pericatheter sleeve by direct contact were noted in all 4 rats of 1-week model; this indicated the initiation of neointimal hyperplasia. The neointimal hyperplasia was located inside the elastin layer. At 2weeks, the SMCs stained faintly but the components of the vein wall were largely replaced by collagen. The proliferation and infiltration of SMCs stabilized at 4weeks and no SMCs were stained around the catheter. At 8weeks, luminal narrowing was noted and the venous wall was composed mainly of collagen.

Restriction rules such as quarantine and city lockdown have been implemented to mitigate the spread of infection, leading to significant economic impacts. Fortunately, development and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines are being conducted on an unprecedented scale. The effectiveness of vaccines raises a hope that city lockdown might not be necessary in the presence of ongoing vaccination, thereby minimizing economic loss. The question, however, is how fast and what type of vaccines should be inoculated to control the disease without limiting economic activity. Here, we set up a simulation scenario of COVID-19 outbreak in a modest city with a population of 2.5 million. The basic reproduction number (R(0)) was ranging from 1.0 to 5.5. Vaccination rates at 1000/day, 10,000/day and 100,000/day with two types of vaccine (effectiveness v = 51% and 89%) were given. The results indicated that R(0) was a critical factor. Neither high vaccination rate (10,000 persons/day) nor high-end vaccine (v = 89%) could control the disease when the scenario was at R(0) = 5.5. Unless an extremely high vaccination rate was given (>4% of the entire population/per day), no significant difference was found between two types of vaccine. With the population scaled to 25 million, the required vaccination rate was >1,000,000/day, a quite unrealistic number. Nevertheless, with a slight reduction of R(0) from 5 to 3.5, a significant impact of vaccine inoculation on disease control was observed.

COVID-19 indicators through December 20, 2020, from N=31,142,582 responses representing N=114 countries, weighted for nonresponse and adjusted to basic demographics, were benchmarked with government data. COVID-19-related signals showed similar concordance with reported benchmark case and test positivity. Bonferroni significance and minimal Spearman correlation strength thresholds were met in the majority. Light Gradient Boost machine learning trained on national and pooled global data verified known symptom indicators, and predicted COVID-19 trends similar to other signals.

METHODS One hundred and nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody who exhibited abnormal findings on initial CT were retrospectively analyzed. Thereafter, changes in the number, distribution, shape, and density of the lesions were observed. Further, the epidemiological, clinical, and CT imaging findings (+/-) were correlated. Following univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for significant factors, and models were established to evaluate the diagnostic ability of CT for COVID-19. RESULTS Our results showed significant differences between patients with COVID-19 in epidemiological history (first, second, and third generation), clinical type (moderate, severe, and critical), and abnormal CT imaging characteristics (+/-) (P<0.05). Moreover, significant differences in abnormal CT imaging characteristics, including region, extent, and focus, were observed between the first generation and the other generations (P<0.05).

The Global Influenza Strategy 2019-2030 provides a framework to strengthen these advances. Against the backdrop of this new framework, the University of Colorado convened in October 2020 its Immunization Advisory Group of Experts to review and discuss current surveillance, prevention, and control strategies for seasonal influenza in Latin America and the Caribbean, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review identified five areas for action and made recommendations specific to each area. The Region should continue its efforts to strengthen surveillance and impact evaluations. Existing data on disease burden, seasonality patterns, and vaccination effectiveness should be used to inform decision-making at the country level as well as advocacy efforts for programmatic resources. Regional and country strategic plans should be prepared and include specific targets for 2030. Existing investments in influenza prevention and control, including for immunization programs, should be optimized. Finally, regional partnerships, such as the regional networks for syndromic surveillance and vaccine effectiveness evaluation (SARInet and REVELAC-i), should continue to play a critical role in continuous learning and standardization by sharing experiences and best practices among countries.","output":"Seasonal Influenza Prevention and Control Progress in Latin America and the Caribbean in the Context of the Global Influenza Strategy and the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is a highly effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke due to large arterial occlusion (LAO). To support decisions about service provision, we previously estimated the annual UK population eligible for EVT as 10% of stroke admissions. Since then, several trials have produced evidence that could alter these figures. We update our estimates considering information from studies and trials reporting 2018C2021 on incidence, presentation time and stroke severity and consider the possible impact of predicted demographic changes in the next 10C20 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We produce an updated decision tree describing the EVT eligible population for UK stroke admissions. One-way sensitivity analyses (using upper and lower confidence intervals for estimates at each branch of our decision tree) were used to identify where further research evidence is necessary to increase certainty around estimates for numbers of EVT eligible patients. RESULTS: The updated estimate for the number of UK stroke patients eligible for EVT annually was between 10,020 (no advanced imaging in early presenting patients) and 9,580 (advanced imaging in all early presenting patients), which compared with our estimates in 2017 is a minimal reduction. One-way sensitivity analyses established that enhanced evidence about eligibility for milder strokes, ASPECTS scores and pre-stroke disability are offset by evidence regarding a lower incidence of LAO. Importantly, predicted increases in life expectancy by 2040 may increase thrombectomy need by 40%. DISCUSSION: Information from additional randomised trials published during 2018C2020 with updated estimates of LAO prevalence had a minimal impact on overall estimates of stroke patients eligible for EVT in the UK. Ongoing research into the benefits of EVT for patients with mild stroke or European Stroke Journal For Peer Review lower ASPECTS scores has the potential to increase the estimates of the eligible population; future need for EVT will increase with the ageing population. CONCLUSION: Our updated analyses show overall numbers eligible little changed, but evidence from ongoing trials and demographic changes have the potential to increase the need for EVT significantly.","output":"Updating estimates of the number of UK stroke patients eligible for endovascular thrombectomy: incorporating recent evidence to facilitate service planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of logic-based methods for comparing entities heavily depends on the axioms that have been described for them in the Knowledge Base (KB). Due to the incompleteness of even large and well engineered KBs, such methods suffer from low recall when applied in real-world use cases. To address this, we designed a reasoning framework that combines logic-based subsumption with statistical methods for on-the-fly knowledge extraction. Statistical methods extract additional (missing) axioms for the compared entities with the goal of tackling the incompleteness of KBs and thus improving recall. Although this can be beneficial, it can also introduce noise (false positives or false negatives). Hence, our framework uses heuristics to assess whether knowledge extraction is likely to be advantageous and only activates the statistical components if this is the case. We instantiate our framework by combining lightweight logic-based reasoning implemented on top of existing triple-stores with an axiom extraction method that is based on the labels of concepts. Our work was motivated by industrial use cases over which we evaluate our instantiated framework, showing that it outperforms approaches that are only based on textual information.

Comparing treatments for these genitourinary symptoms are restricted by the use of different outcome measures in clinical trials and the omission of outcomes, which may be relevant to women. The aim of this project was to develop a Core Outcome Set (COS) to be reported in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause. METHODS We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause and extracted their outcomes. This list was refined and entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey, which was open to clinicians, researchers, and postmenopausal women from November 2019 to March 2020. Outcomes were scored on a nine-point scale from \\"not important\\" to \\"critically important.\\" The final COS was determined following two international consensus meetings. RESULTS A total of 26 unique outcomes were included in the Delphi process, which was completed by 227 participants of whom 58% were postmenopausal women, 34% clinicians, and 8% researchers. Predefined thresholds were applied to the Delphi scores to categorize outcomes by importance, which informed the e consensus meetings, attended by 43 participants from 21 countries. The final COS includes eight outcomes: (1) pain with sex, (2) vulvovaginal dryness, (3) vulvovaginal discomfort or irritation, (4) discomfort or pain when urinating, (5) change in most bothersome symptom, (6) distress, bother or interference of genitourinary symptoms, (7) satisfaction with treatment, (8) side effects of treatment. CONCLUSION These eight core outcomes reflect the joint priorities of postmenopausal women, clinicians, and researchers internationally. Standardized collection and reporting of these outcomes in clinical trials will facilitate the comparison of different treatments for genitourinary symptoms, advance clinical practice, and ultimately improve outcomes for symptomatic women.

The diagnosis was assisted by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Han Chinese inmate was transferred to the emergency department because of dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The patients body temperature rose to 39.3 C following empirical cephalosporin treatment for 1 week. The blood CD4+/CD8+ ratio was 0.7, suggesting immunodeficiency. Routine microbiological tests were performed, and tuberculosis interferon gamma release assays were positive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction was also positive. Chest computed tomography scan revealed miliary nodules and ground-glass opacifications, which were in accordance with tuberculosis. To fully examine the etiology, we performed routine laboratory tests and metagenomic sequencing, the results of which indicated the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tropheryma whipplei. We administered anti-tuberculosis regimen in combination with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient recovered, with chest computed tomography scan showing absorption of lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional diagnostic methods such as culture and serology, metagenomic next-generation sequencing has the advantage of detecting a wide array of microorganisms in a single test and therefore can be used for clinical diagnosis of rare pathogens and microbial coinfections.

The aim of this study was to investigate genome variation of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reconstruct phylogeographic and transmission patterns in Spain. Phylogeographic analysis suggested at least 34 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Spain at the beginning of the outbreak. Six lineages spread very successfully in the country, probably favored by super-spreaders, namely, A2a4 (7.8%), A2a5 (38.4%), A2a10 (2.8%), B3a (30.1%), and B9 (8.7%), which accounted for 87.9% of all genomes in the Spanish database. One distinct feature of the Spanish SARS-CoV-2 genomes was the higher frequency of B lineages (39.3%, mainly B3a+B9) than found in any other European country. While B3a, B9, (and an important sub-lineage of A2a5, namely, A2a5c) most likely originated in Spain, the other three haplogroups were imported from other European locations. The B3a strain may have originated in the Basque Country from a B3 ancestor of uncertain geographic origin, whereas B9 likely emerged in Madrid. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the first coronavirus entered the country around 11 February 2020, as estimated from the TMRCA of B3a, the first lineage detected in the country. Moreover, earlier claims that the D614G mutation is associated to higher transmissibility is not consistent with the very high prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain when compared to other countries with lower disease incidence but much higher frequency of this mutation (56.4% in Spain vs. 82.4% in rest of Europe).

Plasma macrophage-related proteins were determined using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-scan plasma protein measurement at baseline (control and OT2D subjects) and after 1-h of insulin clamp (OT2D subjects only). Basal M1 macrophage activation was characterized by elevated levels of M1 macrophage-specific surface proteins, CD80 and CD38, and cytokines or chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, RANTES) released by activated M1 macrophages. Two potent M1 macrophage activation markers, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were decreased in OT2D. Activated M2 macrophages were characterized by elevated levels of plasma CD163, TFG?-1, MMP7 and MMP9 in OT2D.

For example, advanced age is a risk factor for heightened morbidity and mortality following infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. This increased vulnerability is due, at least in part, to age-related dysregulation of the immune response, a phenomenon termed immunosenescence. However, our understanding of the mechanisms influencing the immunosenescent state and its effects on the innate immune response to pneumonia remain incomplete. Recently, a role for the gut microbiome in age-specific alterations in immunity has been described. Here, we utilized a murine model of intranasal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection to investigate the effects of age on both the innate immune response and the intestinal microbial populations after infection. In aged mice, compared to their younger counterparts, infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae led to increased mortality, impaired lung function and inadequate bacterial control. This poor response to infection was associated with increased influx of neutrophils into the lungs of aged mice 24 h after infection. The exacerbated pulmonary immune response was not associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung compared to young mice but instead heightened expression of immune cell recruiting chemokines by lung neutrophils. Bacterial 16S-rRNA gene sequencing of the fecal microbiome of aged and young-infected mice revealed expansion of Enterobacteriaceae in the feces of aged, but not young mice, after infection. We also saw elevated levels of gut-derived bacteria in the lung of aged-infected mice, including the potentially pathogenic symbiote Escherichia coli. Taken together, these results reveal that, when compared to young mice, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in age leads to increased lung neutrophilia along with potentially pathogenic alterations in commensal bacteria and highlight potential mechanistic targets contributing to the increased morbidity and mortality observed in infections in age.","output":"Age-Related Intestinal Dysbiosis and Enrichment of Gut-specific Bacteria in the Lung Are Associated With Increased Susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human body is a complex system maintained in homeostasis thanks to the interactions between multiple physiological regulation systems.

The inconsistency between policies and scientific evidence was significantly related to high perception of stress associated with COVID-19 (OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.32-4.20), after adjusting for gender. We concluded that the study group presented the prevalence of perceived stress associated with COVID-19 at high levels, arising from the inconsistent strategies developed by health authorities in view of scientific recommendations.

The study aim was to describe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and cut-offs for defining long COVID in primary care follow-up patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study in primary care in Madrid, Spain, was conducted. Data was collected during 6 months (April to September) in 2020, during COVID-19 first wave, from patients  18 years with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed. Variables: sociodemographic, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and complications, laboratory test and chest X-ray. Descriptive statistics were used, mean (standard deviation (SD)) and medians (interquartile range (IQR)) respectively. Differences were detected applying X(2) test, Students T-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis depending on variable characteristics. RESULTS: 155 patients presented pneumonia in day 7.8 from the onset (79.4% were hospitalized, median length of 7.0 days (IQR: 3.0, 13.0)). After discharge, the follow-up lasted 54.0 median days (IQR 42.0, 88.0) and 12.2 mean (SD 6.4) phone calls were registered per patient. The main symptoms and their duration were: cough (41.9%, 12 days), dyspnoea (31.0%, 15 days), asthenia (26.5%, 21 days). Different cut-off points were applied for long COVID and week 4 was considered the best milestone (28.3% of the sample still had symptoms after week 4) versus week 12 (8.3%). Patients who still had symptoms >4 weeks follow-up took place over 81.0 days (IQR: 50.5, 103.0), their symptoms were more prevalent and lasted longer than those  4 weeks: cough (63.6% 30 days), dyspnoea (54.6%, 46 days), and asthenia (56.8%, 29 days). Embolism was more frequent in patients who still had symptoms >4 weeks than those with symptoms 4 weeks (9.1% vs 1.8%, p value 0.034). CONCLUSION: Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia recovered during the first 4 weeks from the beginning of the infection. The cut-off point to define long COVID, as persisting symptoms, should be between 4 to 12 weeks from the onset of the symptoms.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia follow-up and long COVID in primary care: A retrospective observational study in Madrid city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Under usual circumstances, sleep timing is strongly influenced by societal imperatives. The sweeping whole-of-society measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may represent a unique opportunity to examine the impact of large-scale changes in work practices on sleep timing. As such, we examined the impact of the travel restrictions and work from home orders imposed in Ireland in March 2020 on sleep timing and quality. METHODS: We utilized a cross-sectional survey deployed shortly after the imposition of restrictions which assessed current and retrospective ratings of sleep timing and quality; the final response set analysed was from 797 adults. Participants completed the ultra-short Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and answered questions pertaining to work status such as working from home during the period of restrictions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was a significant shift to later sleep start and end times, as well as delayed time of midsleep on both work and free days, during the period of restrictions. Sleep duration was longer for work days, while free day sleep duration was shorter and there was a reduction in social jetlag during the restrictions. Those who worked from home during restrictions had longer sleep duration on work day and had a significantly larger difference in sleep end on work day than \\"essential\\" workers who continued to attend their normal place of work.","output":"Effects of societal-level COVID-19 mitigation measures on the timing and quality of sleep in Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) led to distancing measures which acutely affected healthcare infrastructure, leading to limited in-person clinical visits and an increased number of virtual appointments.

While HRV infections are restricted to the respiratory tract, HEV infections may spread to secondary target organs. The method of choice for sensitive specific detection of these viruses is reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with primers targeting the conserved 5' noncoding region of the viral RNA. On the other hand, sequence similarities between HRVs and HEVs complicate their differential detection. In this study, we describe the use of locked nucleic acid (LNA) analogues in short double-dye probes which contained only two selectively HRV- or HEV-specific bases. The double-stranded DNA dye BOXTO (4-[6-(benzoxazole-2-yl-(3-methyl-)-2,3-dihydro-(benzo-1,3-thiazole)-2-methylidene)]-1-methyl-quinolinium chloride) was used with the LNA probes in a tricolor real-time PCR assay to allow specific detection of HRVs (probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM] [green]) and HEVs (Cy5 [red]) with additional melting curve analysis (BOXTO [yellow]). The functionality of the probes was validated in PCR and RT-PCR assays using plasmids containing viral cDNA, quantified viral RNA transcripts, cultivated rhino- and enterovirus prototypes, and clinical specimens. Of 100 HRV and 63 HEV prototypes, the probes correctly identified all HEVs except one that produced only a BOXTO signal. Among 118 clinical specimens with sequencing results, concordant results were obtained for 116 specimens. Two specimens were reactive with both probes, but sequencing yielded only a single virus. Real-time PCR with LNA probes allowed sensitive group-specific identification of HRVs and HEVs and would enable relative copy number determination. The assay is suitable for rapid and accurate differential detection of HRVs and HEVs in a diagnostic laboratory setting.","output":"Simultaneous detection and differentiation of human rhino- and enteroviruses in clinical specimens by real-time PCR with locked nucleic Acid probes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Hypovitaminosis D is a highly spread condition correlated with increased risk of respiratory tract infections.

In consideration of the role of vitamin D in the immune system, aim of this study was to analyse vitamin D levels in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and to assess any correlations with disease severity and prognosis. Methods: : In this retrospective, observational study, we analysed demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 42 patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, treated in Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) of the Policlinic of Bari from March, 11 to April 30, 2020. Results: : Eighty one percent of patients had hypovitaminosis D. Based on vitamin D levels, the population was stratified into four groups: no hypovitaminosis D, insufficiency, moderate deficiency, and severe deficiency. No differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were found. A survival analysis highlighted that, after 10 days of hospitalization, severe vitamin D deficiency patients had a 50% mortality probability, while those with vitamin D 10 had a 5% mortality risk (p=0.019). Conclusions: : High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was found in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, treated in a RICU. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher mortality risk.

To date, the SARS-CoV-2 spread has already become a global pandemic with a considerable death toll. The associated symptoms of the COVID-19 infection varied with increased inflammation as an everyday pathological basis. Among various other symptoms such as fever, cough, lethargy, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms included diarrhea and IBD with colitis, have been reported. Currently, there is no sole cure for COVID-19, and researchers are actively engaged to search out appropriate treatment and develop a vaccine for its prevention. Antiviral for controlling viral load and corticosteroid therapy for reducing inflammation seems to be inadequate to control the fatality rate. Based on the available related literature, which documented GI symptoms with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with colitis, and increased deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU), conclude that dysbiosis occurs during SARS-COV-2 infection as the gut-lung axis cannot be ignored. As probiotics play a therapeutic role for GI, IBD, colitis, and even in viral infection. So, we assume that the inclusion of studies to investigate gut microbiome and subsequent therapies such as probiotics might help decrease the inflammatory response of viral pathogenesis and respiratory symptoms by strengthening the host immune system, amelioration of gut microbiome, and improvement of gut barrier function.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 microbiome dysbiosis linked disorders and possible probiotics role"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is regarded as a primary respiratory and vascular disease leading to acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and endothelial dysfunction (ED) in severe cases. The causative virus of Covid-19 is SARS-CoV-2, which binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for its entry. It has been shown that ED is linked to various Covid-19 complications since endothelial cells are regarded as the chief barrier against SARS-CoV-2 invasion. SARS-CoV-2-indued ED leads to endotheliitis and thrombosis due to endothelial nitric oxide (NO) inhibition with subsequent vasoconstriction and tissue hypoxia. Loss of vasodilator NO and anti-thrombin factor from endothelial SARS-CoV-2 infection contribute to the progression of vascular dysfunction and coagulopathy. Therefore, NO restoration improves pulmonary function and hinders viral replication during respiratory viral infections, including Covid-19. L-arginine is a semiessential amino acid that has antiviral and immunomodulatory effects as well as it improves the biosynthesis of NO in endothelial cells. L-arginine may reduce risk of ALI through inhibition generation of peroxynitrite and suppression release of proinflammatory cytokines from alveolar macrophages. Of interest, restoration of NO by L-arginine may attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection through different mechanisms, including reduction binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, inhibition of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) a critical for activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and cellular entry, inhibition proliferation and replication of SARS-CoV-2, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2-induced coagulopathy.

This interdisciplinary review highlights the effect of dietary compounds on phages and puts this into perspective with putative contributions of phages to gastrointestinal diseases, specifically inflammation, infection, and cancer. The review discusses novel fields of opportunities in this context. These include, but are not limited to, perspectives how a better understanding of modulating the activity of specific phages by particular nutritional components may contribute to reorganizing the microbial network, thus supporting in the combat, or even prevention, of inflammation or even cancer in the gut. ABSTRACT: Natural compounds such as essential oils and tea have been used successfully in naturopathy and folk medicine for hundreds of years. Current research is unveiling the molecular role of their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Nevertheless, the effect of these compounds on bacteriophages is still poorly understood. The application of bacteriophages against bacteria has gained a particular interest in recent years due to, e.g., the constant rise of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics, or an increasing awareness of different types of microbiota and their potential contribution to gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory and malignant conditions. Thus, a better knowledge of how dietary products can affect bacteriophages and, in turn, the whole gut microbiome can help maintain healthy homeostasis, reducing the risk of developing diseases such as diverse types of gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or even cancer. The present review summarizes the effect of dietary compounds on the physiology of bacteriophages. In a majority of works, the substance class of polyphenols showed a particular activity against bacteriophages, and the primary mechanism of action involved structural damage of the capsid, inhibiting bacteriophage activity and infectivity. Some further dietary compounds such as caffeine, salt or oregano have been shown to induce or suppress prophages, whereas others, such as the natural sweeter stevia, promoted species-specific phage responses. A better understanding of how dietary compounds could selectively, and specifically, modulate the activity of individual phages opens the possibility to reorganize the microbial network as an additional strategy to support in the combat, or in prevention, of gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammation and cancer.","output":"Dietary Modulation of Bacteriophages as an Additional Player in Inflammation and Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose the design of a ventilator which can be easily manufactured and integrated into the hospital environment to support COVID-19 patients.

We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR. RESULTS: We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNACPR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%).

A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT.

Yet, scarce information is available regarding the morphological and functional features of cardiac impairments in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective and serial echocardiographic study to investigate the structural and functional cardiac changes among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). From January 21 to April 8, 2020, a total of 51 ICU patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were monitored by serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations. Outcomes were followed up until April 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of 51 ICU patients, 33 (64.7%) had cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevations of levels of cardiac biomarkers including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide were observed in 62.7% and 86.3% of patients, respectively. Forty-two (82.3%) had at least one left-heart and/or right-heart echocardiographic abnormality. The overall median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65.0% (IQR 58.0-69.0%), with most (44,86.3%) having preserved LVEF. Sixteen patients (31.4%) had increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and 14 (27.5%) had right-ventricle (RV) enlargement. During the study period, 12 (23.5%) patients died. LVEF was comparable between survivors and non-survivors, while non-survivors had more often pulmonary hypertension (58.3% vs. 23.1%; P=0.028) and RV enlargement (58.3% vs. 17.9%, P=0.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated similar survival curves between patients with vs. without echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities (P=0.450 by log-rank test), while right-heart abnormalities had adverse impact on mortality (P=0.012 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Typical cardiac abnormality in ICU patients with COVID-19 was right-heart dysfunction with preserved LVEF.

Previous research has quantified the costs of stunting to national economies however beyond a few single-country datasets there has been a limited number of which have used diverse datasets and have had a dedicated focus on the private sector, which employs nearly 90% of the workforce in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to examine (i) the impact of childhood stunting on income loss of private sector workforce in LMICs; (ii) to quantify losses in sales to private firms in LMICs due to childhood stunting; and (iii) to estimate potential gains (benefit-cost ratios) if stunting levels are reduced in select high prevalence countries. METHODS: This multiple-methods study engaged multi-disciplinary technical advisers, executed several literature reviews, used innovative statistical methods, and implemented health and labor economic models. We analyzed data from seven longitudinal datasets (up to 30+ years of follow-up; 1982C2016; Peru, Ethiopia, India, Vietnam, Philippines, Tanzania, Brazil), 108 private firm datasets (spanning 2008C2020), and many global datasets including Joint Malnutrition Estimates, and World Development Indicators to produce estimates for 120+ LMICs (with estimates up to 2021). We studied the impact of childhood stunting on adult cognition, education, and height as pathways to wages/productivity in adulthood. We employed cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, and conducted comparative analyses using three analytic approaches: traditional frequentist statistics, Bayesian inferential statistics and machine learning. We employed labour and health economic models to estimate wage losses to the private sector worker and firm revenue losses due to stunting. We also estimated benefit-cost ratios for countries investing in nutrition-specific interventions to prevent stunting. FINDINGS: Across 95 LMICs, childhood stunting costs the private sector at least US$135.4 billion in sales annually. Firms from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific regions had the greatest losses. Totals sales losses to the private sector accumulated to 0.01% to 1.2% of national GDP across countries. Sectors most affected by childhood stunting were manufacturing (non-metallic mineral, fabricated metal, other), garments and food sectors. Sale losses were highest for larger sized private firms. Across regions (representing 123 LMICs), US$700 million (Middle East and North Africa) to US$16.5 billion (East Asia and Pacific) monthly income was lost among private sector workers. Investing in stunting reduction interventions yields gains from US$2 to US$81 per $1 invested annually (or 100% to 8000% across countries). Across sectors, the highest returns were in elementary occupations (US$46) and the lowest were among agricultural workers (US$8). By gender, women incurred a higher income penalty from childhood stunting and earned less than men; due to their relatively higher earnings, the returns for investing in stunting reduction were consistently higher for men across most countries studied. INTERPRETATION: Childhood stunting costs the private sector in LMICs billions of dollars in sales and earnings for the workforce annually. Returns to nutrition interventions show that there is an economic case to be made for investing in childhood nutrition, alongside a moral one for both the public and private sector. This research could be used to motivate strong public-private sector partnerships to invest in childhood undernutrition for benefits in the short and long-term.","output":"Economic costs of childhood stunting to the private sector in low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease including steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The aim of this study was to determine the rate of IMC eradication when using RFAEMR and to identify clinical and pathologic predictors of treatment failure. A retrospective review of medical records and a central review of index histologic parameters were performed for 78 patients who underwent RFAEMR as the primary treatment for biopsy-proven IMC at 4 academic tertiary medical centers. Complete eradication (CE) (absence of IMC/DYS on first follow-up endoscopy) was achieved in 86% of patients, and durable eradication (DE) (CE with no recurrence of IMC/DYS until last follow-up) was achieved in 78% of patients, with significant variation between the 4 study sites (P=0.03 and 0.09 by analysis of variance for DE and CE, respectively). Use of EMR before RFA significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure for IMC/DYS (hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.48; P=0.001), whereas IMC involving 50% of the columnar metaplastic area on index examination significantly increased the risk for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-11.7; P=0.005).

CV risk-prediction models are used to identify and treat high risk populations and to communicate risk effectively. These tools are unexplored in Covid-19. The main objective is to evaluate the association between CV scoring systems and chest X ray (CXR) examination (in terms of severity of lung involvement) in 50 Italian Covid-19 patients. Results only the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was applicable to all patients. The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Score (ASCVD) was applicable to half. 62% of patients were classified as high risk according to FRS and 41% according to ASCVD. Patients who died had all a higher FRS compared to survivors. They were all hypertensive. FRS&#8805;30 patients had a 9.7 higher probability of dying compared to patients with a lower FRS. We found a strong correlation between CXR severity and FRS and ASCVD (P < 0.001). High CV risk patients had consolidations more frequently. CXR severity was significantly associated with hypertension and diabetes. 71% of hypertensive patients' CXR and 88% of diabetic patients' CXR had consolidations. Patients with diabetes or hypertension had 8 times greater risk of having consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: High CV risk correlates with more severe CXR pattern and death. Diabetes and hypertension are associated with more severe CXR. FRS offers more predictive utility and fits best to our cohort.

A QSAR model is developed by correlating the information obtained from chemical structures (numerical descriptors/independent variables) with the experimental response values (the dependent variable). METHODS: In the current study, we have developed a QSAR model to predict inhibitory activity of small molecule carboxamides against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro enzyme. Due to the structural similarity of this enzyme with that of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism of the recent pandemic, the former may be used for development of therapies against corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19). RESULTS: The final multiple linear regression (MLR) model was based on four two-dimensional descriptors with definite physicochemical meaning. The model was strictly validated using different internal and external quality metrics. The model showed significant statistical quality in terms of determination cofficient (R20.748, adjusted R2(R2adj 0.700), cross-validated leave-one-out Q2(Q20.628 and external predicted variance (R2pred 0.723).

CONCLUSION: The derived model may be useful to predict the inhibitory activity of small molecules within the applicability domain of the model only based on the chemical structure information prior to their synthesis and testing.","output":"In silico modeling of small molecule carboxamides as inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease: An approach towards combating COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health has faced unprecedented pressures from the dual demands of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining delivery of essential public health services such as screening and vaccinations. At the beginning of the pandemic, public health efforts turned towards implementing appropriate preventative health measures to control or mitigate transmission, while the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has started since late 2020. Preventative public health measures to control or mitigate transmission include observing hygiene guidelines; using personal protective equipment (such as masks); limiting contact through physical distancing measures, curfews, bans on non-essential persons' movement and closing schools, businesses, as well as regional and national borders. All these measures have been supported, with Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support (FTTIS) services, but many countries have struggled to implement these successfully, even months into the pandemic. While organisations such as the ECDC have issued guidance on implementing such interventions depending on the epidemiological situation, national strategies have ultimately depended on the countries' priorities, political realities and weighing the benefits against the potential adverse effects (such as mental health, economic and social impacts) and there has been little coordination among the countries. International coordination in the area of vaccines has also not always worked effectively.

We aimed to develop and validate a two-step score system for patient triage, and to identify patients at a relatively low level of mortality risk using easy-to-collect individual information. DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Four health centers from Virginia Commonwealth University, Georgetown University, the University of Florida, and the University of California, Los Angeles. PATIENTS: Coronavirus Disease 2019-confirmed and hospitalized adult patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 1,673 participants from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) as the derivation cohort. Risk factors for in-hospital death were identified using a multivariable logistic model with variable selection procedures after repeated missing data imputation. A two-step risk score was developed to identify patients at lower, moderate, and higher mortality risk. The first step selected increasing age, more than one pre-existing comorbidities, heart rate >100 beats/min, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, and SpO(2) <93% into the predictive model. Besides age and SpO(2), the second step used blood urea nitrogen, absolute neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, platelet count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as predictors. C-statistics reflected very good discrimination with internal validation at VCU (0.83, 95% CI 0.79C0.88) and external validation at the other three health systems (range, 0.79C0.85). A one-step model was also derived for comparison. Overall, the two-step risk score had better performance than the one-step score.

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice.

Acute lung allograft rejection is defined as perivascular or peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammation. Although histopathologic signs of rejection often resolve with treatment, the frequency and severity of acute rejections represent the most important risk factor for the subsequent development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a condition of progressive airflow obstruction that limits survival to only 50% at 5 years after lung transplantation. Recent evidence demonstrates that peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammation (also known as lymphocytic bronchiolitis) or even a single episode of minimal perivascular inflammation significantly increase the risk for BOS. We comprehensively review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, histopathologic features, and mechanisms of acute cellular lung rejection.

Toona sinensis showed potent antiproliferation effect on lung, melatonin, ovary, colon, and liver cancers. However, the effects of the species on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated. Results: In this study, we found fraction 1 of Toona sinensis leaf (TSL-1) resulted in inhibition of cell viability in MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines, while it only caused a moderate suppressive effect on normal osteoblasts. In addition, TSL-1 significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase leakage and induced apoptosis and necrosis in Saos-2 cells. TSL-1 increased mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bad. Most important, TSL-1 significantly suppressed Saos-2 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice by increasing caspase-3. The IC-50 of TSL-1 for the 3 tested osteosarcoma cells is around 1/9 of that for lung cancer cells. Conclusion: We demonstrated that TSL-1, a fractionated extract from TSL, caused significant cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells due to apoptosis. In vivo xenograft study showed that TSL-1 suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells at least in part by inducing apoptosis. Our results indicate that TSL-1 has potential to be a promising anti-osteosarcoma adjuvant functional plant extract.","output":"The Fractionated Toona sinensis Leaf Extract Induces Apoptosis of Human Osteosarcoma Cells and Inhibits Tumor Growth in a Murine Xenograft Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the wide application of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, the foundations of the education system have been shaken;education has entered a new era of teaching and learning on digitalized platforms.

Since then, this disease has spread rapidly across the world, and as of September 17, 2021, there are 226,844,344 cases of COVID-19 worldwide with 4,666,334 deaths related to COVID-19. While most COVID-19 cases are mild, some cases are severe with patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The pathophysiology of ARDS includes damage to the alveolar epithelium that leads to increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barrier causing hyaline membrane formation, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema that results in severe hypoxia. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS are supported by non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation with an aim to improve oxygenation and maintain adequate blood oxygen levels. Increased intra-alveolar pressure while on mechanical ventilation may lead to alveolar rupture and thus barotrauma-related injuries such as lung tension cysts, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and pneumothorax. Recent studies have shown that the rate of barotrauma-related events is higher in patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to patients with ARDS secondary to other etiologies. Radiologists should be aware of the imaging features of COVID-19 ARDS as well as the complications of mechanical ventilation.

The theoretical model of the study was based on Martin Seligmans positive psychology and PERMA theory and Paul Wongs Existential Positive Psychology 2.0 Theory, which postulates that negative experiences contribute to well-being and personal growth. The static approach was complemented by exploring the mediating role of psychological flexibility (defined as acceptance and action in the current situation) in the relationship between negative emotions and well-being. The data were collected during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from 277 participants (221 women), aged M = 33.83, SD = 12.77. The results confirmed that negative emotions correlated negatively with various domains of well-being (PERM), except for accomplishment (completing tasks and fulfill daily responsibilities). Moreover, negative emotions were related to the general well-being through psychological flexibility in that higher depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower psychological flexibility, which decreased general well-being. Finally, negative emotions were shown to be beneficial, having an adaptive effect that allows individuals to maintain their ability to cope with the situation, reach goals, and fulfill daily duties and responsibilities despite critical, stressful situation (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that limit their psychological flexibility.

It is of positive significance to urge people to wear masks with computer vision technology. However, the existing detection methods are mainly for simple scenes, and facial missing detection is prone to occur in dense crowds with different scales and occlusions. Moreover, the data obtained by surveillance cameras in public places are difficult to be collected for centralized training, due to the privacy of individuals. In order to solve these problems, a cascaded network is proposed: the first level is the Dilation RetinaNet Face Location (DRFL) Network, which contains Enhanced Receptive Field Context (ERFC) module with the dilation convolution, aiming to reduce network parameters and locate faces of different scales. In order to adapt to embedded camera devices, the second level is the SRNet20 network, which is created by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Due to privacy protection, it is difficult for surveillance video to share in practice, so our SRNet20 network is trained in federated learning. Meanwhile, we have made a masked face dataset containing about 20,000 images. Finally, the experiments highlight that the detection mAP of the face location is 90.6% on the Wider Face dataset, and the classification mAP of the masked face classification is 98.5% on the dataset we made, which means our cascaded network can detect masked faces in dense crowd scenes well.","output":"Masked Face Detection Algorithm in the Dense Crowd Based on Federated Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the catering sector has increasingly contributed to population-level salt intake, many countries have begun developing salt-reduction strategies for restaurants.

The binding mode of Z93 was extensively analyzed through molecular docking, followed by MD simulations, and molecular interactions were compared with SARS-CoV-2. The relative binding poses of Z93 fitted well in the binding site of both proteases and showed consensus - stacking and H-bond interactions with histidine and aspartate/asparagine residues of the catalytic triad.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and preventive practices of Iranians toward the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 925 people who completed an online questionnaire in March 2020. The study used 21 and 14 questions, respectively, to assess the knowledge and preventive practices of the population in regard to COVID-19. Cronbach's alpha was 0.75 for the knowledge scale and 0.71 for the practice scale. To determine the importance of each independent variable in explaining the participant's practice, a multiple regression model was applied. KEY RESULTS: The results indicated a moderate level of knowledge and preventive practices in regard to COVID-19 in most of the respondents (56.8% and 56.5%, respectively). According to the multiple regression analysis, knowledge showed the highest effect on the practice of the participants (? = 0.479).

To diminish the short-term and long-term impacts of coronavirus (CoV), we investigated CoV differences at the nucleotide and protein level and CoV genomic variation associated with epidemiological variation and geography. We divided the CoV genome into 29 constituent regions for this analysis. Our results highlight the variation of CoV variants of lineage and show that nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) and Spike protein (S) have the highest variation and greatest correlation with the viral whole-genome variation, which makes these two proteins potential targets for treatments. S protein variation is highly correlated with nsp3, nsp6, and 3'?to?5' exonuclease. Country of origin and time since the start of the pandemic were the most influential metadata in these differences. Host sex and age are the lowest in terms of explaining the virus genome variation. We quantified variation explained by regions of the CoV genome across different CoV viruses including, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV (SARS-related), and bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (Bat-SL-CoV). We found that Spike protein and nsp3 explain most of the variation among these viruses;they are also among the genomic regions with the highest number of sites under natural selection.

On March 13, 2020, the patient developed an itchy, erythematous papular rash (sparing only her face, scalp, and abdomen), which lasted for 10 days. The rash was accompanied by a feeling of general fatigue that gradually worsened over the following days and has continued for 5 months (until the end of July 2020).

In the Netherlands, the national screening programs, including for breast cancer, were halted temporarily. This posed a challenge to breast cancer care, because a40% of cases are detected through national screening. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical care of patients with breast cancer in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present multicenter retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of COVID-19 on patients with breast cancer who had undergone surgery from March 9 to May 17, 2020. The primary endpoints were the number of surgical procedures performed during the study period, tumor characteristics, surgery type, and route of referral. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 217 consecutive patients with breast cancer requiring surgery were included. We found an overall decrease in the number of patients with breast cancer who were undergoing surgery. The most significant decline was seen in surgery for T1-T2 and N0 tumors. A decline in the number of referrals from both the national screening program and general practitioners was observed. The incidence of postoperative complications remained stable during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The temporary halt of the national screening program for breast cancer resulted in fewer surgical procedures during the study period and a pronounced decrease in surgery of the lower tumor stages.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Breast Cancer Care in the Netherlands: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two Rheumatology Departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49  11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogrens syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks. Five patients completed the second vaccine dose without other adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster.","output":"Herpes zoster following BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Health Service (NHS) Pathways triage system collates data on enquiries to 111 and 999 services in England.

Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission.

The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID-19. SETTING AND METHODS: This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID-19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28th - June 17th 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31st , 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over three weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID-19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID-19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post-disease.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients treated with acute bailout stenting after failed MT in three large neurointerventional centers using exclusively the Acclino (Flex) Stent and the NeuroSpeed Balloon Catheter. Functional outcome was assessed by the rate of major early neurological recovery (mENR) at 24 hours and at 90 days with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Safety evaluation included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), mortality, and intervention-related serious adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS 50 patients with a median age of 71 years met the inclusion criteria and 52% (26/50) of the occluded vessels were located within the anterior circulation. mENR was observed in 38.8% and 90-day favorable outcome (mRS 2) was 40.6% (13/32). Higher NIH Stroke Scale scores on admission were significantly associated with poor functional outcome (mRS 3) at 90 days (adjusted OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.53; p=0.007). sICH occurred in two cases of the study population.

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800 mg day on day 1 followed by 600 mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear, indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19.

Under the Compacts of Free Association (COFA), citizens from three Remote Oceania countries can travel to the United States to live and work without restriction. Given the special status of COFA migrants, there is a growing interest among policymakers and researchers to better understand this population, which has often been overlooked. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has recently spotlighted this community due to their exceedingly high rates of infection, hospitalization, and morbidity. This study examines how migration is experienced during a pandemic via a case study of first-generation Micronesians living in Oregons Willamette Valley, one of the largest Micronesian communities in the United States. Interviews reveal how social determinants of health C such as economic stability, non-discrimination and equal treatment, access to healthcare, employment, and housing C may contribute to unequal health outcomes between Pacific Islander immigrants and other racial and ethnic populations. These determinants also contribute to human dignity. Using the emergent Migration with Dignity framework, this study assesses how the pandemic has challenged the six dimensions of dignity and disrupted the migration experience, including the push-pull factors for deciding to emigrate to and stay in the United States.

Among them are challenges to the educational system where college administrators are struggling with the questions of how to reopen in-person activities while prioritizing student safety. To help address this challenge, we developed a flexible computational framework to model the spread and control of COVID-19 on a residential college campus. The modeling framework accounts for heterogeneity in social interactions, activities, disease progression, and control interventions. The relative contribution of classroom, dorm, and social activities to disease transmission were explored. We observed that the dorm has the highest contribution to disease transmission followed by classroom and social activities. Without vaccination, frequent (weekly) random testing coupled with risk reduction measures (e.g. facial mask,) in classroom, dorm, and social activities is the most effective control strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. Moreover, since random screening testing allows for the successful and early detection of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, it successfully reduces the transmission rate such that the maximum quarantine capacity is far lower than expected to further reduce the economic burden caused from quarantine. With vaccination, herd immunity is estimated to be achievable by 50% to 80% immunity coverage. In the absence of herd immunity, simulations indicate that it is optimal to keep some level of transmission risk reduction measures in classroom, dorm, and social activities, while testing at a lower frequency.

Herein we investigated whether SARS-CoV2 can stimulate extracellular neutrophils traps (NETs) in a process called NETosis. We demonstrated for the first time that SARS-CoV2 in fact is able to activate NETosis in human neutrophils.

Three quarters of tourists travel to and from Austria by car and approximately 10% by plane, contributing significantly to the sector's GHG emissions. Should pre-COVID 19 trends continue, an expansion of further distant home markets and an increase of guests arriving by plane can be expected. Low-carbon technologies, intelligent mobility management and societal trends towards shared mobility solutions can improve the environmental performance of tourist travel but will not suffice to achieve the Paris Agreement's climate targets. Further strong incentives will be necessary to avoid these unsustainable forms of mobility and shift trips to climate-friendly modes of transport and the number and distance of tourism trips can be reduced by focussing marketing on closer rather than long-distance home markets and promotion of longer stays. Local tourism stakeholders in Austria can contribute by awareness-raising campaigns and promoting sustainable mobility solutions at the destinations. Politics need enable this shift by setting framework conditions such as full incorporation of climate costs for all modes of travel. Management implications: To reduce travel related GHG emissions significantly, tourism cannot only rely on technological solutions (electric vehicles) and trends (sharing) but must also initiate a shift from air and private road transport to rail and public transport. This requires measures that offer incentives (fast and direct train and bus connections, climate-friendly local transport, luggage services, attractive all-in packages, etc.), but also a focus on closer rather than long-distance home markets, promotion of longer stays and awareness-raising campaigns for local stakeholders and tourists. The awareness created by the COVID-19 and climate crises can be seen as an opportunity to take these measures.","output":"Tourism mobility and climate change - A review of the situation in Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the tourism and hospitality industry, ensuring the well-being of visitors is essential to achieving a competitive tourist destination. This objective is even more pressing in the gastronomy sector. Surprisingly, the scientific literature on this topic is scarce and relies on questionnaire surveys and interviews as a data source. After scrutinizing the 13 articles on gastronomy tourism and well-being indexed in the Web of Science or in Scopus, this study proposes two new lines of research interrelated by the concept of gastronomic image. These exploit the content shared online by consumers in order to assess subjective well-being derived from quality gastronomic experiences. The first is a framework for the customer-perceived image based on Gr?nrooss service quality model, and the second is a conceptual model based on Morriss semiotics to measure gastronomic image. Through mixed methodologies, i.e., qualitative in the first research line and quantitative in the second, the study applies the theoretical framework to Michelin-starred restaurants in two tourist regions with similar features but with different gastronomic culturesTaiwan (Asia) and Catalonia (Europe)using as a data source all the online travel reviews (OTRs) written in English about these restaurants shared on the TripAdvisor portal. Comparing the three categories of restaurants in both regions, the results show branding and marketing problems and significant differences in the popularity of restaurants and the satisfaction and well-being of diners. There is a positive relationship between the category of restaurants according to the number of Michelin stars and their popularity according to the number of OTRs, as well as with the satisfaction and well-being of diners, except for a 3-star restaurant that is the worst-rated.

However, the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virion release remain poorly understood. In the present study, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) screening and identified the E3 ligase RNF5, which mediates the ubiquitination of SARS-CoV-2 M at residue K15 to enhance the interaction of the viral envelope protein (E) with M, whereas the deubiquitinating enzyme POH1 negatively regulates this process. The M-E complex ensures the uniform size of viral particles for viral maturation and mediates virion release. Moreover, M traffics from the Golgi apparatus to autophagosomes and uses autophagosomes for virion release, and this process is dependent on RNF5-mediated ubiquitin modification and M-E interaction. These results demonstrate that ubiquitin modification of SARS-CoV-2 M stabilizes the M-E complex and uses autophagosomes for virion release.","output":"The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase RNF5 Facilitates SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Protein-Mediated Virion Release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) continues to be a major global public health concern, particularly during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite new social distancing guidelines and enhanced infection control procedures (e.g., masking, hand hygiene) being implemented since the beginning of COVID-19, little evidence indicates whether these changes have influenced the prevalence of CDI hospitalizations. This study aims to measure CDI prevalence before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a local cohort of U.S. Veterans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of all Veterans presenting to the South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, Texas from Jan 1, 2019 to Apr 30, 2021. Monthly laboratory confirmed CDI events were collected overall and categorized as the following: hospital-onset, healthcare facility-associated (HO-HCFA-CDI), community-onset, healthcare facility-associated CDI (CO-HCFA-CDI), and community-associated CDI (CA-CDI). Monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases were also collected. CDI prevalence was calculated as CDI events per 10,000 bed days of care (BDOC) and was compared between pre-pandemic (Jan 2019-Feb 2020) and pandemic (Mar 2020-Apr 2021) periods. Results A total of 285 CDI events, 920 COVID-19 cases, and 104,220 BDOC were included in this study. The overall CDI rate increased from 20.33 per 10,000 BDOC pre-pandemic to 34.51 per 10,000 during the pandemic (p< 0.0001). This was driven primarily by a rise in CO-HCFA-CDI rates (0.95 vs 2.52 per 10,000 BDOC;p< 0.0001) during the pandemic, followed by increases in CA-CDI (15.58 vs. 18.61 per 10,000 BDOC;p< 0.0001) and HO-HCFA-CDI (2.66 vs. 5.43 per 10,000 BDOC;p< 0.0001). Lastly, CDI rates have tripled since the start of the pandemic (March-Apr 2020) compared to the current year (March-Apr 2021) (14.69 vs. 43.76 per 10,000 BDOC). Conclusion Overall, CDI prevalence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven mostly by an increase in CO-HCFA-CDI. As COVID-19 rates increased, CDI rates also increased, likely due to greater healthcare exposures and antibiotic use.

However, the exact mechanisms of their association have not been established. This study is aimed at constructing miRNA-mRNA networks to elucidate on the potential link between dementia and hernia. Methods Gene expression profiles for dementia, herniation, and skeletal muscle were downloaded from the GEO database after which differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs were obtained. In addition, fascia tissue samples were obtained during surgery. A total of 41 patients were recruited in this study, and expression levels of candidate genes were examined using quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase reporter gene assays were used to identify potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways. Results Differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs were screened. A potential miRNA-mRNA network revealing the crosstalk mechanism between herniation and dementia was identified. Single cell analysis revealed that PI16 was highly enriched in adipose tissues, skeletal muscles, and in the skin. GSEA enrichment analysis showed that PI16 is involved in adipose metabolism, muscle functions, and energy metabolism. In clinical samples, PI16 was found to be upregulated in hernia, while miR-4451 was found to be downregulated. The luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that downregulation of circulating miR-4451 may be responsible for the upregulated PI16 expression in hernia sacs.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Optometrists measured intraocular pressure (IOP) with Goldmann Tonometry, graded the optic disc with the Disc Damage Likelihood Score (DDLS) and graded visual field tests with the enhanced Glaucoma Staging Score (eGSS). A scoring system from these tests was applied, and patients were either seen routinely 6 months later within the scheme or returned non-routinely to secondary care. Appointments within the scheme were 6-monthly with the pattern of three community optometrist visits then one hospital clinic visit. RESULTS: Community optometrists conducted 529 appointments for 285 patients. A total of 114 patients were seen after non-routine return to secondary care, with 61 true positives (53.5%) and 53 false positives (46.5%). Forty-one patients (14.4%) developed glaucoma progression, and 18 patients (6.3%) developed new non-glaucomatous ophthalmic diseases.

The questionnaire survey data were obtained from a sample of 300 employees at two private international universities, and the partial least squares structural equation model was used for data analysis. The results significantly confirm that supervisor support has a negative effect on the perceived uncertainties of employees. Perceived uncertainties also significantly mediate the negative effect of supervisor support on the employees' emotional exhaustion. More importantly, the moderating effect analysis shows that the negative effect of supervisor support on the perceived uncertainties of employees presents only for employees who work in a workplace climate where there is low intransigence; in a workplace climate where there is high intransigence, supervisor support does not lower the perceived uncertainties of employees.","output":"The effectiveness of supervisor support in lessening perceived uncertainties and emotional exhaustion of university employees during the COVID-19 crisis: the constraining role of organizational intransigence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine-mediated immune-cell recruitment and inflammation contribute to protection in respiratory virus infection.

Currently, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are finally upon us carrying the hope of herd immunity once a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated or infected, as a new horizon. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants brought concerns since, as the virus is exposed to environmental selection pressures, it can mutate and evolve, generating variants that may possess enhanced virulence. Codon usage analysis is a strategy to elucidate the evolutionary pressure of the viral genome suffered by different hosts, as possible cause of the emergence of new variants. Therefore, to get a better picture of the SARS-CoV-2 codon bias, we first identified the relative codon usage rate of all Betacoronaviruses lineages. Subsequently, we correlated putative cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAs) to reveal how those viruses adapt to hosts in relation to their preferred codon usage. Our analysis revealed seven preferred codons located in three different open reading frame which appear preferentially used by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the tRNA adaptation analysis indicates a wide strategy of competition between the virus and mammalian as principal hosts highlighting the importance to reinforce the genomic monitoring to prompt identify any potential adaptation of the virus into new potential hosts which appear to be crucial to prevent and mitigate the pandemic.","output":"Betacoronaviruses genome analysis reveals evolution toward specific codons usage: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine astrovirus (PAstV) belongs to genetically divergent lineages within the genus Mamastrovirus.

As yet there are no reports on duration and recovery rates. We set out to characterise patients reporting new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on early recovery rates. METHODS: Online Survey of patients reporting self-diagnosed new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 week follow-up. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-two patents completed bot an initial and follow-up survey. 86.4% reported complete anosmia and a further 11.5% a very severe loss of smell at the time of completing the first survey. At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4 weeks. This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection. While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic.

This study aimed to evaluate position-specific match running performance (MRP) to determine the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on the physical performance of professional football players. Players MRPs (n = 124) were observed in matches before and after the COVID-19 lockdown in the 2019/2020 season of the highest level of national competition in Croatia and were classified according to player position: central defenders (CD; n = 42), fullbacks (FB; n = 20), midfielders (MF; n = 46), and forwards (FW; n = 16). The MRPs were measured using Global Positioning System, and included the total distance covered, low-intensity running (14.3 km/h), running (14.4C19.7 km/h), high-intensity running (19.8 km/h), total accelerations (>0.5 m/s(2)), high-intensity accelerations (>3 m/s(2)), total decelerations (less than C0.5 m/s(2)), and high-intensity decelerations (less than C3 m/s(2)). The results indicated that, in matches after the COVID-19 lockdown, (i) CDs and FBs featured lower running and high-intensity running (t-value: from 2.05 to 3.51; all p < 0.05; moderate to large effect sizes), (ii) MFs covered a greater distance in low-intensity running and achieved a lower number of total accelerations, and total and high-intensity decelerations (t-value: from C3.54 to 2.46; all p < 0.05, moderate to large effect sizes), and (iii) FWs featured lower high-intensity running (t-value = 2.66, p = 0.02, large effect size).

This novel pandemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions of lockdown and confinement implemented citywide, regionally or nationally are affecting virus transmission, peoples travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies have been conducted to predict the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease, assess the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility and on air quality, and assess the impacts of lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This literature review aims to analyze the results from past research to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates that urban form, peoples socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19 viral transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed that COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by reducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic. This study also explores the spatio-temporal aspects of lockdown and confinement measures on coronavirus diffusion, human mobility, and air quality.

Specifically, we generated forward-in time simulations to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). ANN received as input multiple summary statistics calculated on the locus of interest, while CNN was applied directly on the matrix of haplotypes. We found that both architectures have high accuracy to identify loci under recent selection. CNN generally outperformed ANN to distinguish between signals of balancing selection and incomplete sweep and was 18 less affected by incorrect training data. We deployed both trained network son neutral genomic regions in European populations and demonstrated a lower false positive rate for CNN than ANN. We finally deployed CNN within the MEFV gene region and identified several common variants predicted to be under incomplete sweep in a European population. Notably, two of these variants are functional changes and could modulate susceptibility to Familial Mediterranean Fever, possibly as a consequence of past adaptation to pathogens.

It is important to describe and evaluate the impact of this care delivery change on patients, providers and the healthcare system in order to improve the quality of virtual care in the future. Aims As part of a larger quality improvement initiative, the aim of this project was to better understand the health system impact of the shift from in-person to virtual care delivery in the Division of Digestive Care & Endoscopy in Halifax, NS. Methods Using a before-and-after observational study design, outpatient encounters from January-March 2020 (Pre-COVID) were compared to encounters after the pandemic restrictions began April-June 2020 (COVID-Impacted). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of synchronous clinic encounters in the gastroenterology ambulatory space conducted virtually before versus after pandemic restrictions were implemented. Secondary objectives were to determine whether patient, disease, or provider-specific factors were associated with virtual care visits or changed with the implementation of pandemic restrictions. Endoscopic encounters were excluded. Descriptive statistics were used to compare patient and encounter characteristics in the Pre-COVID and COVID-Impacted periods. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between patient and provider characteristics and use of virtual care delivery. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio with associated 95% CI were estimated. Results A total of 4,923 unique patients (60.1% Pre-COVID and 39.9% in the COVID-Impacted period) and 6,659 encounters were identified. The proportion of synchronous clinical visits conducted virtually increased after February 2020, increasing from 25% (Pre-COVID) to 91% (COVID-Impacted). The Pre-COVID versus COVID-Impacted periods also differed with respect to median patient age (56 vs. 59, P = 0.000), mean proximity to the hospital (40km vs. 48km, P = 0.007) and proportion of new consults deemed urgent (9.8% vs. 20.0%, P = 0.000). Patients with family physicians, return visits, and patient age greater than 65 years were associated with the use of synchronous virtual care visits.

Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (e.g., atherosclerosis, lung diseases) and tumor diseases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via the tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization.

Multivariate regression analyses and (2) tests were used. RESULTS: We obtained 367 answers, 246 before and 121 during the pandemic. RTTs before and during the pandemic showed high EE and DP, intermediate PA. Median EE index was 37 (interquartile range [IQR] 31C46] before and 37 (IQR 30C43) during the pandemic, median DP index was 16 (IQR 13C21) and 15 (IQR 12C20), respectively. PA index was 31 (IQR 28C34) and 32 (IQR 28C34), respectively. At multivariate analysis, being female, having children, led to higher EE scores before and during the pandemic (p0.026).

This essay argues that in order to fully understand the politics arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to focus on the individual and collective experiences of death, loss, and grief. While the emerging scholarly discourse on the pandemic, particularly in political science and international relations, typically considers death only in terms of its effects on formal state-level politics and as a policy objective for mitigation, we argue that focusing on the particularities of the experience of death resulting from COVID-19 can help us fully understand the ways in which the pandemic is reordering our worlds. Examining the ambiguous sociopolitical meaning of death by COVID-19 can provide broader analytical comparisons with other mass death events. Ultimately, the essay argues that centering the impact of the pandemic on the experience of death and loss directly poses the question of how politics should value human lives in the post-pandemic world, helping us better formulate the normative questions necessary for a more ethical future.

With the aid of substituent groups a scenario can be created where the crucial role of weak interactions towards the stabilization of the overall molecular packing, in the absence of any strong interaction can be evaluated more reliably. In this context, we have studied the supramolecular features of three new phosphoric triamides 1 C 3, with [NH]P(O)[N]2, [C(O)N]2P(O)[N] and [C(O)N]2P(O)[NH] segments, respectively. The compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space groups P21/c for 1 and 2 with one phosphoric triamide molecule and in P21 for 3 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The intermolecular interactions and their energies are evaluated using Hirshfeld surface and energy framework analyses revealing that the presence or absence of substituent groups such as 2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl may serve as a crucial cohesive factor in the supramolecular assembly. The substituent alters the intermolecular interaction contributions, with subsequent changes in the formation of different weak interactions and molecular assemblies. The structure of 2 bearing this substituent displays the highest energy interaction without any strong interaction. The crystal packing is stabilized by a variety of interactions involving the weak hydrogen bonds with the PO and CO acceptor sites. The effects of substituent groups on the molecular frameworks formed by various intermolecular interactions are analyzed in detail via energy framework diagrams. Finally, a biological study by the molecular docking method indicates that the studied here compounds could be appropriate candidates as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","output":"Energy frameworks and Hirshfeld surface analysis of supramolecular features in three new phosphoric triamides: tuning the intermolecular interactions via the substituent effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV.

METHODS: We conducted a single-site, cross-sectional, observational, instrument validation study. Non-mydriatic fundus photographs centred at the optic disc were obtained from 276 eyes of 68 glaucoma and 70 normal patients, using a portable fundus camera (Smartscope, Optomed, Oulu, Finland). A senior Glaucoma consultant, masked to the patients study participation, performed a gold standard dilated fundus examination to make the diagnosis of glaucoma. Following this, a mydriatic photograph was taken by a standard table-top fundus camera. All the images were digitalized and de-identified by an independent investigator and presented to two remote graders, masked to the patients, their diagnoses, and photographic modality. Based on individual disc characteristics, a diagnosis of screening positive or negative for glaucoma was made. In the end, the independent investigator re-identified the images. Sensitivity and specificity to detect glaucoma with the undilated Smartscope camera was calculated compared to dilated fundus examination. RESULTS: Grading remote images taken with the portable non-mydriatic fundus camera showed a sensitivity of 96.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.6C98.8%) and 94.8% (95% CI: 89.7C97.9%) and a specificity of 98.5% (95% CI: 94.9C99.8%) and 97.8% (95% CI: 93.9C99.6%) for the two graders respectively as compared to gold standard dilated fundus examination.

In the present paper, it is proposed that OSCC, by the virtue of upregulation of EMMPRIN expression, increases the susceptibility to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In turn, COVID-19 in OSCC patients causes exhaustion of EMMPRIN receptor due to binding with 'S' receptor leading to a downregulation of related carcinogenesis events. We proposed that in the ACE-2 depleted situation in OSCC, EMMPRIN receptor might get high jacked by the COVID-19 virus for the entry into the host cells. Apart from the anti-monoclonal antibody, it is recommended to explore the use of grape seed and skin containing mouthwash as an adjunct, which could also have anti EMMPRIN effects in patients with OSCC and OPMDs.","output":"EMMPRIN/BASIGIN as a biological modulator of oral cancer and COVID-19 interaction: Novel propositions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a global impact on healthcare.

OBJECTIVE To systematically analyze stroke preventability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We evaluated medical records of 274 consecutive patients discharged with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke between December 2, 2010, and June 11, 2012, at the University of California Irvine Medical Center. Mean (SE) patient age was 67.2 (0.8) years. Data analysis was conducted from July 3, 2014, to August 4, 2015. EXPOSURES Medical records were systematically examined for demographic information, stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and acute stroke treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We defined stroke preventability as the degree to which the patient's presenting stroke was preventable. Using variables easily determined at onset of stroke, we developed a 10-point scale (0, not preventable; 10, most preventable) to classify the degree of stroke preventability. Our focus was effectiveness of treatment of hypertension (0-2 points), hyperlipidemia (0-2 points), and atrial fibrillation (0-4 points), as well as use of antithrombotic treatment for known prior cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease (0-2 points). RESULTS Total risk scores ranged from 0 to 8 (mean [SE], 2.2 [0.1]), with 207 patients (75.5%) exhibiting some degree of preventability (score of 1 or higher). Seventy-one patients (25.9%) had scores of 4 or higher, indicating that the stroke was highly preventable. Severity of stroke as determined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was not related to preventability of stroke. However, 21 of 71 patients (29.6%) whose stroke was highly preventable were treated with intravenous or intra-arterial acute stroke therapy while these treatments were provided for only 13 of 67 patients (19.4%) with scores of 0 (no preventability) and 19 of 136 patients (14.0%) with scores of 1 to 3 (low preventability) (P = .03).

This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein, yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated, in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX. Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) SOX homolog, we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity. Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover. Unexpectedly, the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung. Instead, the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment. Specifically, mice intranasally infected with the host shutoff mutant accumulated to lower levels at 10 days post infection in the lymph nodes, failed to develop splenomegaly, and exhibited reduced viral DNA levels and a lower frequency of latently infected splenocytes. Decreased latency establishment was also observed upon infection via the intraperitoneal route.

The murine IFN- gene was cloned into the DI vector under the control of an MHV transcriptional promoter and transfected into MHV-infected cells. IFN- was secreted into culture medium as early as 6 hr posttransfection and reached a peak level (up to 180 U/ml) at 12 hr posttransfection. The DI-expressed IFN- (DE-IFN-) exhibited an antiviral activity comparable to that of recombinant IFN- and was blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IFN-. Treatment of macrophages with DE-IFN- selectively induced the expression of the cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase and the IFN--inducing factor (IGIF) but did not affect the amounts of the MHV receptor mRNA. Antiviral activity was detected only when cells were pretreated with IFN- for 24 hr prior to infection; no inhibition of virus replication was detected when cells were treated with IFN- during or after infection. Furthermore, addition of IFN- together with MHV did not prevent infection, but appeared to prevent subsequent viral spread. MHV variants with different degrees of neurovirulence in mice had correspondingly different levels of sensitivities to IFN- treatmentin vitro,with the most virulent strain being most resistant to IFN- treatment. Infection of susceptible mice with DE-IFN--containing virus caused significantly milder disease, accompanied by more pronounced mononuclear cell infiltrates into the CNS and less virus replication, than that caused by virus containing a control DI vector. This study thus demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of this MHV DI vector for expressing cytokines and may provide a model for studying the role of cytokines in MHV pathogenesis.","output":"Expression of Interferon- by a Coronavirus Defective-Interfering RNA Vector and Its Effect on Viral Replication, Spread, and Pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last months of 2019, an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to other parts of the world.

SOT recipients may be at high risk from COVID-19 disease due to chronic immunosuppressive treatment and other medical comorbidities. Mortality rates reported between 13 to over 30% in SOT recipients. In addition to high rates of complications and mortality attributable to COVID-19 infections, the pandemic has also led to additional complexities in transplantation including new questions regarding screening of donors and recipients, decision making to accept a patient for kidney transplant or wait after pandemic. The clinical implications of COVID-19 infection may also differ depending on the type of the transplanted organ and recipient comorbidities which further impacts decisions on continuing transplantation during the pandemic.

A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points, or any coronavirus strains belonging to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera.IMPORTANCE The prediction of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites is essential in investigating the importance of contact transmission. This study collects available information on inactivation kinetics of coronaviruses in both solid and liquid fomites and creates a mathematical model for the impact of temperature and relative humidity on virus persistence. The predictions of the model can support more robust decision-making and could be useful in various public health contexts. A calculator for the natural clearance of SARS-CoV-2 depending on temperature and relative humidity could be a valuable operational tool for public authorities.","output":"Modeling the Inactivation of Viruses from the Coronaviridae Family in Response to Temperature and Relative Humidity in Suspensions or on Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay illustrates how Donald Trump engaged in what I call ?populist crisis rhetoric? throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and coinciding 2020 U.S. presidential campaign cycle.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between media exposure to COVID-19 and acute stress, and less is known about the mechanisms that translate media exposure to COVID-19 into acute stress. The current study explored the impact of media exposure to COVID-19 on acute stress, and examined the mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and the moderating role of perceived social support (PSS). Methods: A total of 1,483 Chinese participants (M(age) = 27.93 years, SD = 8.45) completed anonymous online questionnaires regarding media exposure to COVID-19, IU, PSS, and acute stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Results: Media exposure to COVID-19 was positively related to acute stress, and IU partially mediated this relationship. The direct effect of media exposure to COVID-19 on acute stress, and the relationship between IU and acute stress, were both moderated by PSS. The impacts of both media exposure to COVID-19 and IU on acute stress were stronger for individuals with low PSS. Limitations: This study collected data in a shorter timeframe, and no assessments occurred during the follow-up, which may prevent us from detecting the changes of the relationships between variables over time. Meanwhile, the self-report method limited the validity of the data due to subjective reporting bias. Conclusions: These findings contribute to a better understanding of how and when pandemic-related media exposure affects acute stress, and provide new perspectives for the prevention to reduce psychological problems following traumatic events.","output":"Media Exposure to COVID-19 Predicted Acute Stress: A Moderated Mediation Model of Intolerance of Uncertainty and Perceived Social Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the 11 (th) of March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) This was one month after Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO declared that we are also fighting an 'infodemic' The WHO has described an infodemic as an \\"over-abundance of information - some accurate and some not - that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it\\" iHealthFacts ie is an Irish resource where the public can quickly and easily check the credibility and reliability of health claims circulating on social media Unreliable claims can lead to poorly informed health choices iHealthFacts is an initiative that supports the public to think critically about health claims and make well-informed choices Here, we describe the role iHealthFacts plays in providing reliable information to the public and offer reflections from those involved in launching this initiative during a pandemic","output":"Battling the COVID-19 infodemic in an Irish context: the role of iHealthFacts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to determine and analyze the role of the Police in tackling crimes by convicts who received assimilation and parole due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and the obstacles and solutions of the Police in overcoming crimes by inmates who received assimilation and parole due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.

Indeed, following the emergence of this new virus, despite the existence of a few approved and known effective vaccines at the time of writing this original study, a sense of urgency has emerged worldwide to discover new technical tools and new drugs as soon as possible. In this context, many studies and researches are currently underway to develop new tools and therapies against SARS CoV-2 and other viruses, using different approaches. The 3-chymotrypsin (3CL) protease, which is directly involved in the cotranslational and posttranslational modifications of viral polyproteins essential for the existence and replication of the virus in the host, is one of the coronavirus target proteins that has been the subject of these extensive studies. Currently, the majority of these studies are aimed at repurposing already known and clinically approved drugs against this new virus, but this approach is not really successful. Recently, different studies have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based techniques to understand existing chemical spaces and generate new small molecules that are both effective and efficient. In this framework and for our study, we combined a generative recurrent neural network model with transfer learning methods and active learning-based algorithms to design novel small molecules capable of effectively inhibiting the 3CL protease in human cells. We then analyze these small molecules to find the correct binding site that matches the structure of the 3CL protease of our target virus as well as other analyses performed in this study. Based on these screening results, some molecules have achieved a good binding score close to -18 kcal/mol, which we can consider as good potential candidates for further synthesis and testing against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Active Learning and the Potential of Neural Networks Accelerate Molecular Screening for the Design of a New Molecule Effective against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short treatise addresses a philosophical question concerning the place of homeopathy in our modern world.

OBJECTIVE: This research work primarily focuses on exploring the prevalence of burnout syndrome among IT professionals who work-from-home and to determine the impact of burnout in different gender and age-groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using snowball sampling method 934 IT professionals were selected based on selection criteria, explained about the study processes, and instructed to submit an online survey consist of Maslach Burnout Inventory scale (MBI) through mail, social media, or through a researcher by direct interview. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics were used to interpret the data. In 25-30 years age-group, men were affected (93%) less than women (94%) and also in 31-35 years age-group, men were affected (96%) less than women (98%). Overall burnout scores of men were 94% and women were 96%. Results indicate female IT professionals were more prone experience burnout syndrome than Male population. CONCLUSIONS: From the results, it is concluded that 95% of the IT professionals are suffering from burnout, where women are more prevalent to burnout when compared to male.

By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched micellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low salt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are linear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2  Tdiff0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2  Tdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in branched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of differentiating various types of micellar microstructures. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing the existing restricted diffusion models and are shown to be much slower than the diffusion of proton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second viscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination of micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.","output":"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Diffusometry of Linear and Branched Wormlike Micelles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a great global threat to public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 disease as a pandemic, affecting the human respiratory and other body systems, which urgently demands for better understanding of COVID-19 histopathogenesis. OBJECTIVE Data on pathological changes in different organs are still scarce, thus we aim to review and summarise the latest histopathological changes in different organs observed after autopsy of COVID-19 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Over the period of 3 months, authors performed vast review of the articles. The search engines included were PubMed, Medline (EBSCO & Ovid), Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus and Bio-Medical. Search terms used were 'Histopathology in COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Pathological changes in different organs in COVID-19' or 'SARS-CoV-2'. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines were used for review writing. RESULT We identified various articles related to the histopathology of various organs in COVID-19 positive patients. Overall, 45 articles were identified as full articles to be included in our study. Histopathological findings observed are summarised according to the systems involved. CONCLUSION Although COVID-19 mainly affects respiratory and immune systems, but other systems like cardiovascular, urinary, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system, nervous system and integumentary system are not spared, especially in elderly cases and those with comorbidity.

The traditional model of bedside clinical teaching in required advanced clerkships was upended on March 17, 2020, when the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended removing medical students from direct patient care to prevent further spread of the disease and also to help conserve scarce personal protective equipment (PPE). This created unique challenges for delivering a robust, advanced emergency medicine (EM) clerkship since the emergency department is ground zero for the undifferentiated and potentially infected patient and has high demand for PPE. Here, we describe the development, application, and program evaluation of an online-based, virtual advanced EM curriculum developed rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting March 23, 2020, we began rotating fourth-year medical students through a four-week rotation. We completed a total of four virtual clerkship experiences comprised of 56 students through July 27, 2020. Through analysis of the students performance on a national standardized EM shelf exam, students participating in this virtual clerkship demonstrated a fund of knowledge that was not significantly different from that of their peers who completed a traditional clerkship in the specialty prior to the pandemic interruptions. Additionally, the critical review of the traditional course created the opportunity to make improvements and enrich the medical student educational experience in a virtual environment and upon resumption of the traditional course when students returned to the in-person environment.

Endovascular techniques have become the standard option for treating IAs in adults. More recently, flow diverters, such as the Pipeline embolization device (PED), are being widely adopted for unruptured IAs, with proven safety and efficacy in adults; however, their use in the pediatric population is not well defined. Here we report a pediatric patient with a ruptured posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysm successfully treated with a PED, and provide a review of the literature on the current status of PED use in this subset of patients. CASE DESCRIPTION A previously healthy 4-year old boy presented to the emergency department with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) suggested a ruptured dissecting aneurysm in the right PCA. After discussing treatment options with the child's parents, off-label use of the PED device was chosen. A single PED device was successfully deployed within 24 hours of onset. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient was fully recovered, with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0, and MRA showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and patency of the parent vessel. CONCLUSIONS Even though the PED has not received Food and Drug Administration approval to treat IAs in children, the literature reports favorable outcomes with this application. Thus, the PED may be a feasible option for treating challenging cases occurring more frequently in the pediatric population. Further studies in pediatric populations are needed to determine whether this technology is a viable and durable option for treating aneurysms in children.","output":"Pipeline Embolization Device Flow Diversion for a Dissecting Ruptured Posterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysm in a Pediatric Patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are commonly causing respiratory disease.

Clinical/laboratory features based on the genotypes of respiratory HAdV infection were reviewed for comparative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled, and HAdV types were identified from 82 patients. Species B (HAdV-7, 44%; HAdV-3, 43%, and HAdV-14, 5%) was the most common, followed by C (HAdV-2, 4% and HAdV-1, 1%) and E (HAdV-4, 1%). Severe HAdV infection and HAdV-7 infection groups were associated with significantly longer duration of fever and hospitalized days, higher morbidity of tachypnea/dyspnea, more pleural effusion, more respiratory rales, more frequently required mechanical ventilation, and significantly higher fatality rate. The elevated procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly associated with severe HAdV infection.

Barely a year after the cyclonic event, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged, leading to the declaration of a nationwide lockdown that paralysed socio-economic systems. This article examines how social capital was autonomously cultivated and eventually utilised by the Cyclone Idai disaster survivors in Eastern Chimanimani to face the fresh socio-economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, a qualitative method embedded in a case study design was used. Data was collected using 30 purposively selected key respondents who interacted with victim communities from March to July 2020. A thematic content analysis approach was applied to obtain opinion patterns and subsequent inferences. The study results revealed a lack of immediate external disaster intervention during the Cyclone Idai disaster in Chimanimani. Accordingly, a strong sense of collective action developed between victim communities, thus enabling them to perform hasty operations meant to salvage lives and property. The enhanced social capital helped the Cyclone Idai victims to face the new COVID-19 lockdown challenges. This article recommends pro-active and well-coordinated government and private sector disaster response strategies supporting local area initiatives to minimise loss of lives and property during disaster situations.","output":"From the Cyclone Idai disaster to the COVID-19 pandemic: An account of inadvertent social capital enhancement in Eastern Chimanimani, Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunosenescence and comorbidities increase the susceptibility of older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) to vaccine-preventable diseases, hospitalization, disability, or death.

METHODS We searched national and international journals and the grey literature for relevant papers and reports published from January 1999 to December 2003. The final set of documents provided broad coverage of the topic, with emphasis on national and international representation and a special focus on disease surveillance, health promotion, accident and illness prevention and chronic diseases. RESULTS Three main findings emerged from this study. First, there is a need to understand and clearly articulate the roles and functions of public health and primary care in Canada. Second, the main areas of overlap between these sectors are health surveillance, health promotion and prevention of disease and injury. Third, based on an international literature search, we identified 10 models that demonstrate how these sectors can be integrated; five of them were developed in Canada. CONCLUSIONS National and international evidence and a variety of working models support the integration of public health functions in primary care. Canada has been a leader in developing models of integrated health systems that combine individualized approaches to influence personal health behaviour and community approaches to influence the health of the population.

In addition, the cytoplasmic AHR protein may act as an adaptor of E3 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, the physiological functions of AHR that regulate cell proliferation were explored using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The doubling-time of the AHR-KO clones of A549 and BEAS-2B was observed to be prolonged. The attenuation of proliferation potential was strongly associated with either the induction of p27(Kip1) or the impairment in mitogenic signal transduction driven by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF receptor (EGFR). We found that the leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1), a repressor of EGFR, was induced in the absence of AHR in vitro and in vivo. The LRIG1 tends to degrade via a proteasome dependent manner by interacting with AHR in wild-type cells. Either LRIG1 or a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) were accumulated in AHR-defective cells, consequently accelerating the degradation of EGFR, and attenuating the response to mitogenic stimulation. We also affirmed low AHR but high LRIG1 levels in lung tissues of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.

Abnormal coagulation profiles were reported to be associated with poor outcomes. In this study, we assessed the prognostic values of antithrombin (AT) activity levels and the impact of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) treatment on outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional coagulation parameters as well as AT activity levels and outcomes of 104 consecutive critically ill acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with AT activity below 75% were treated with FFP. Maximum AT activity levels achieved in those patients were recorded. RESULTS: AT activity levels at admission were significantly lower in nonsurvivors than survivors (73% vs. 81%). The cutoff level for admission AT activity was 79% and 58% was the lowest AT for survival. The outcome in those patients who had AT activity levels above 75% after FFP treatment was better than that of the nonresponding group. As well as AT, admission values of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were coagulation and inflammatory parameters among the mortality risk factors. CONCLUSION: AT activity could be used as a prognostic marker for survival and organ failure in COVID-19-associated ARDS patients.

The objective of this study is to examine the current status of the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka. The present study also examines the economic viability of potential heavy mineral placer deposits, based on geochemical data. Field investigations suggested the occurrence of heavy minerals as beach-placers, and inland/raised beach deposits along the coastline of Sri Lanka. Geochemical results showed the enrichment of TiO(2), Fe(2)O(3), Al(2)O(3), and trace elements, and depletion of other major oxides such as Na(2)O, K(2)O, MnO, MgO, CaO, and P(2)O(5). Consequently, it suggests the abundance of ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, sillimanite, garnet, and rare earth element (REE)-bearing heavy minerals in potential placer deposits. In contrast, this study illustrates the exported quantity (in the weight ratio of 35:3:1) of ilmenite, rutile, and zircon minerals during the last decade. Ilmenite is the dominant heavy mineral in Sri Lanka, and thus, its production and price volatilisations are essential to understand the current status and predict the future behaviour of the heavy mineral industry. Statistical observations suggest that the global production and unit price variations of ilmenite have increased gradually from 1950 to 2015. Besides, the forecasted variations in annual global production and unit price changes of ilmenite indicate healthy compound annual growth rates of 1.27% and 1.43%, respectively. However, Sri Lanka has less contribution (< 1%) to global ilmenite production. Consequently, the value addition of ilmenite must be highly encouraged with at least an immediate stage (e.g. synthetic rutile). The present study also highlights possible value addition stages of available heavy mineral resources (low-, intermediate-, or high-level value addition), and discusses action plans to improve the quality of the heavy mineral industry of Sri Lanka.

METHODS In accordance with Cochrane guidelines, we searched three online databases (OVID [Medline], Embase and Cochrane Library) for all studies published from 1 January 2000 to 6 September 2020. We evaluated the number of studies that reported the absolute or relative threshold values for defining blood pressure. Secondary aims included evaluation of the threshold values for defining IOH, the methodology for accounting for the severity of hypotension, whether the type of surgical procedure influenced the definition of IOH, and whether a study whose definition of IOH aligned with the Perioperative Quality Initiative-3 workgroup (POQI) consensus statement for defining was more likely to be associated with determining an adverse postoperative outcome. RESULTS A total of 318 studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Most studies (n = 249; 78.3%) used an absolute threshold to define hypotension; 150 (60.5%) reported SBP, 117 (47.2%) reported MAP, and 12 (4.8%) reported diastolic blood pressure (DBP). 126 (39.6%) used a relative threshold to define hypotension. Of the included studies, 153 (48.1%) did not include any duration variable in their definition of hypotension. Among the selected 318 studies 148 (46.5%) studies defined IOH according to the POQI statement. When studies used a \\"relative blood pressure change\\" to define IOH, there was a weaker association in detecting adverse postoperative outcomes compared to studies who reported \\"absolute blood pressure change\\" (2(2) = 10.508, P = 0.005, Cramr's V = 0.182). When studies used the POQI statement definition of hypotension or defined IOH by values higher than the POQI statement definition there were statistical differences observed between IOH and adverse postoperative outcomes (2(1) = 6.581, P = 0.037, Cramr's V = 0.144). When both the duration of IOH or the numbers of hypotensive epochs were evaluated, we observed a significantly stronger relationship between the definition of IOH use the development of adverse postoperative outcomes. (2(1) = 4.860, P = 0.027, Cramr's V = 0.124). CONCLUSIONS Most studies defined IOH by absolute or relative changes from baseline values. There are substantial inconsistencies in how IOH was reported. Further, definitions differed across different surgical specialities. Our findings further suggest that IOH should be defined using the absolute values stated in the POQI statement i.e., MAP < 60-70 mmHg or SBP < 100 mmHg. Finally, the number of hypotensive epochs or time-weighted duration of IOH should also be reported.","output":"Reported definitions of intraoperative hypotension in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To identify evidences regarding infection by SARS-CoV-2 and deaths of healthcare workers and related-risk factors Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching the following databases SCOPUS, VHL Regional Portal, PubMed and Embase We included studies on infection and death of healthcare workers who delivery care for COVID-19 patients There were no restriction on date of publication, idiom, or type of study The search was conducted until April 14, 2020 Results: A total of 28 articles were selected Most mentioned risk factors were: scarcity, inadequate use or non-usage of personal protective equipment, work overload, close contact with potentially infected patients and/or coworkers, risk for aerosol-generating procedures, late diagnosis and inadequate air renovation According to each country, the number of infected workers ranged from 1,716 to 17,306 Concerning deaths, there are data of up to 605 healthcare workers who died of COVID-19 all over the world Evidences found were editorials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies Conclusion: Studies identifi ed showed high number of infection and deaths among healthcare workers Overload of health system was a significant factor Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Identificar as evidencias quanto a infec?ao pelo SARS-CoV-2 e bitos dos profissionais de sade e fatores de risco relacionados Mtodos: Realizou-se uma revisao sistemtica buscando-se artigos nas bases de dados Scopus, Portal Regional da BVS, Pubmed e Embase, relacionados a infec?ao e bito de profissionais da sade envolvidos no tratamento de pacientes com a COVID-19 Nao houve restri?ao quanto a data de publica?ao, idioma ou tipo de estudo Para a busca foi considerado publicaes at 14 de abril de 2020 Resultados: Foram incluidos 28 artigos Os fatores de risco mais citados foram: escassez, uso inadequado ou nao uso de equipamentos de prote?ao individual, sobrecarga de trabalho, contato prximo com pacientes e/ou colegas de trabalho potencialmente contaminados, procedimento com risco de gera?ao de aerossol, diagnstico tardo e renova?ao de ar ambiente inadequado De acordo com cada pas, o nmero de profissionais infectados variou de 1 716 a 17 306 Quanto aos bitos, existem dados de at 605 profissionais falecidos no mundo inteiro As evidencias encontradas sao editoriais, estudos transversais e de coorte Conclusao: As evidencias identificadas demonstram um alto nmero de profissionais infectados e que foram a bito, sendo a sobrecarga do sistema de sade um fator significativo Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Identificar evidencias sobre la infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 y muerte de profesionales de la salud y factores de riesgo relacionados Mtodos: Se realiz una revisin sistemtica en busca de artculos en las bases de datos Scopus, Portal Regional de la BVS, Pubmed y Embase, relacionados con la infeccin y muerte de profesionales de la salud involucrados en el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19 No hubo restriccin respecto a la fecha de publicacin, idioma ni tipo de estudio Para la bsqueda se consideraron publicaciones hasta el 14 de abril de 2020 Resultados: Se incluyeron 28 artculos Los factores de riesgo ms mencionados fueron: escasez, uso inadecuado o falta de uso de equipos de proteccin individual;sobrecarga de trabajo;contacto cercano con pacientes o compa?eros de trabajo potencialmente contaminados;procedimientos con riesgo generador de aerosoles;diagnstico tardo y renovacin inadecuada del aire interior El nmero de profesionales infectados vari de 1 716 a 17 306, de acuerdo con cada pas Respecto a las muertes, hay datos de 605 profesionales fallecidos en todo el mundo La evidencia se encontr en editoriales, estudios transversales y de cohorte Conclusin: Las evidencias identificadas demuestran un alto nmero de profesionales infectados y fallecidos, y la sobrecarga del sistema de salud es un factor significativo","output":"Infection and death in healthcare workers due to COVID-19: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses when the World Health Organization will announce the end of Covid-19.

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results: Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of admitted pandemic DKA/COVID-19+ patients comparing prevalence/outcomes to pre-pandemic DKA patients that takes place in Eleven hospitals of New York City Health & Hospitals. Our included participants during the pandemic period were admitted COVID-19+ patients (>18 years) and during the pre-pandemic period were admissions (>18 years) selected through the medical record. We excluded transfers during both periods. The intervention was COVID-19+ by PCR testing. The main outcome measured was mortality during the index hospitalization and secondary outcomes were demographics, medical histories and triage vital signs, and laboratory tests. Definition of DKA: Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) (>0.4 mmol/L) and bicarbonate (<15 mmol/L) or pH (<7.3). RESULTS: Demographics and past medical histories were similar during the pre-pandemic (n = 6938) vs. pandemic (n = 7962) periods. DKA prevalence was greater during pandemic (3.14%, 2.66C3.68) vs. pre-pandemic period (0.72%, 0.54C0.95) (p > 0.001).

We describe the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and characteristics of COVID-19 cases and clusters before the characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic. METHODS: Cases of COVID-19 reported between Dec 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, the prepandemic period), were identified daily from official websites, press releases, press conference transcripts, and social media feeds of national ministries of health or other government agencies. Case characteristics, travel history, and exposures to other cases were abstracted. Countries with at least one case were classified as affected. Early cases were defined as those among the first 100 cases reported from each country. Later cases were defined as those after the first 100 cases. We analysed reported travel to affected countries among the first case reported from each country outside mainland China, demographic and exposure characteristics among cases with age or sex information, and cluster frequencies and sizes by transmission settings. FINDINGS: Among the first case reported from each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries; 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Among 1200 cases with age or sex information, 874 (73%) were early cases. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35-63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years. Overall, 21 (2%) of 1200 cases were in health-care workers and none were in pregnant women. 101 clusters were identified, of which the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 26 cases per cluster [range 2-7]), followed by non-health-care occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 43 cases per cluster [2-14]), and community gatherings (11 [11%]; mean 142 cases per cluster [4-36]). INTERPRETATION: Cases with travel links to China, Italy, or Iran accounted for almost two-thirds of the first reported COVID-19 cases from affected countries. Among cases with age information available, most were among adults aged 18 years and older. Although there were many clusters of household transmission among early cases, clusters in occupational or community settings tended to be larger, supporting a possible role for physical distancing to slow the progression of SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Methods All 500 MR CLEAN patients were included. We estimated the effect of intra-arterial treatment with ordinal logistic regression analysis, and tested for interaction of antiplatelet treatment with intra-arterial treatment on outcome. Furthermore, safety parameters and serious adverse events were analyzed. Results The 144 patients (29%) on antiplatelet treatment were older, more often male, and had more vascular comorbidity.

Here we used a severe TBI model to examine the effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin, Enoxaparin on inflammasome activation and lung injury damage. We investigated whether Enoxaparin inhibits ALI and inflammasome signaling protein expression in the brain and lungs after TBI in mice. C57/BL6 mice were subjected to severe TBI and were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg Enoxaparin 30 minutes after injury. Lung and brain tissue were collected 24 hours post-TBI and were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression of the inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1?. In addition, lung tissue was collected for histological analysis to determine ALI scoring and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration post-injury. Our data show that severe TBI induces increased expression of inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1? in the brain and lungs of mice after injury. Treatment with enoxaparin attenuated inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs 24 hours after injury. Enoxaparin significantly decreased the ALI score as well as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the lungs at 24 hours after injury.

This manifested recently in the intensity of societal controversies in which, for example, the coal phase-out was negotiated. At the same time, local conflicts over specific energy projects are on the rise. Energy conflicts are particularly acute, among other reasons, because they often form focal points for disputes over the recognition of certain interests as legitimate common good interests. These conflicts are first and foremost a reaction to the design of the energy transition and, at the same time, have an impact on it. In addition, these conflicts are in a reciprocal relationship with the political culture of a society. They are both an effect and a co-producer of the ideas of democracy negotiated in society. This article makes a twofold contribution to the analysis of common good conflicts in the German energy transition. First, empirical results of energy transition research are interpreted with regard to the struggles over the definition and prioritization of common good goals of the energy transition. A key observation is that energy conflicts reveal phenomena of a crisis of democracy that cannot be adequately addressed in negotiations over concrete energy projects. Second, the findings on common good conflicts in the energy transition are discussed in the light of democratic theory. It is argued that the lack of willingness (on the part of government policy actors) to engage in conflicts over the prioritization of common good goals of the energy transition is a central deficit. In combination with a one-sided orientation towards the deliberative model of democracy (in the processes of implementing energy projects), this exacerbates the tendencies of a crisis of democracy. From a radical democratic perspective, there is a need for agonistic arenas of dispute in which political opponents compete to implement their respective energy transition visions.","output":"Energiekonflikte und Demokratiekrise.

Serologic assays for antibody detection aid patient diagnosis and seroepidemiologic investigations. METHODS: An indirect IgG ELISA was developed indigenously using -propiolactone (BPL) inactivated SARS-CoV-2. This assay was used for screening 200 healthy donor sera collected prior to COVID-19 emergence (2017C2019), 185 serum/plasma samples of confirmed COVID-19 patients (n = 137) and 57 samples of viral RNA positive asymptomatic contacts (n = 51). The IgG response was studied in relation to duration and severity of illness. RESULTS: The ELISA demonstrated 97 % specificity and IgG detection in >50 %, 80 %, 93.8 % and 100 % of the patients respectively during the first, second, third and fourth week of illness. IgG detection rate was higher in patients with severe disease (SD, 90.9 %) than those with mild disease (MD, 68.8 %) during the second week of illness (P = 0.027). IgG seropositivity among asymptomatic contacts was 64.7 %. IgG ELISA absorbance values were higher in SD than MD patients during the first 2 weeks of illness (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the absorbance values of asymptomatic subjects and MD patients (P = 0.94). CONCLUSION: The BPL inactivated virus-based ELISA could detect IgG antibodies early and in a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients suggesting its potential utility as a supplement to the currently used viral RNA detection tests in patient diagnosis and contact screening algorithms.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response among Indian COVID-19 patients using -propiolactone-inactivated, whole virus-based indirect ELISA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to guide researchers in the COVID-19 pandemic by evaluating the 100 most cited articles of COVID-19 in terms of bibliometric analysis, Altmetric scores, and dimension badges. METHODS: COVID-19 was entered as the search term in Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. The 100 most cited articles (T100) were analyzed bibliometrically. Altmetric attention scores (AASs) and dimension badge scores of the articles were evaluated. RESULTS: T100 articles were published from January to September 2020. The average citation of the top 100 articles on COVID-19 was 320  344.3 (143C2676). The language of all articles was English. The average Altmetric value of T100 is 3246  3795 (85C16,548) and the mean dimension badge value was 670  541.6 (176C4232). Epidemiological features (n = 22) and treatment (n = 21) were at the top of the main topics of T100 articles. CONCLUSION: The more citations an article is made, the more it indicates the contribution of that article to science. However, the number of citations is not always the only indicator of article quality.

With this study we aimed to assess glucose, glycemic gap (GlyG) and insulin secretion/sensitivity measures in patients with Covid-19. Materials and Methods: We studied, upon admission, 157 patients with Covid-19 (84: in wards and 73: in intensive care units; ICU); 135 had no history of diabetes. We measured blood glucose upon admission as well as glycated hemoglobin (A1c), plasma insulin and C-peptide. We calculated the GlyG and the Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2) estimates of steady state beta cell function (HOMA2%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S). Statistical assessment was done with analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Compared to patients in the wards without diabetes, patients with diabetes in the wards, as well as patients in the ICU (without or with diabetes) had higher admission glycemia. The GlyG was significantly higher in patients without diabetes in the ICU compared to patients without diabetes in the wards, while HOMA2%B based on glucose and insulin was significantly higher in the ICU patients compared to patients in the wards. Of all the parameters, HOMA2%S based on C-peptide/glucose was higher in survivors (n = 133). Conclusions: In our series of patients with Covid-19, a substantial number of patients with and without diabetes had admission hyperglycemia and those who were critically ill may have had compromised insulin secretion and lowered sensitivity to insulin. These findings lend credence to reports of association between Covid-19 and hyperglycemia/secondary diabetes.","output":"Glycemia, Beta-Cell Function and Sensitivity to Insulin in Mildly to Critically Ill Covid-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sensing technologies demonstrate promising potential in providing the construction industry with a safe, productive, and high-quality process.

Second, contributions and limitations of sensing technologies are elaborated to understand the current status. Third, key factors influencing the adoption of sensing technologies are extracted from construction stakeholders experience. Demand towards sensing technologies, benefits and suitability of them, and barriers to their adoption are reviewed. Lastly, the governance framework is determined as the research tendency facilitating sensing technologies adoption. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the governance framework development.

However, extremity ischemia with acrocyanosis and digital gangrene has not been commonly reported with COVID-19.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are adjuncts to education and support self-management optimisation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess which first line technology is most effective. METHODS Electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Web of Science) were systematically searched from 1999 to September 2020. Randomised controlled trials comparing either CSII with MDI or CGM with SMBG in adults with type 1 diabetes were included. Data were extracted in duplicate by two reviewers, and were analysed to assess individual and overall treatment effect measures. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020149915). RESULTS HbA1c was significantly reduced for CGM when compared with SMBG (Cohen's d -0.62 (95% CI -0.79 to -0.45)) and for CSII when compared with MDI (Cohen's d -0.44 (95% CI -0.67 to -0.22)). Rates of severe hypoglycaemia were significantly reduced with CGM compared with SMBG, but did not change for CSII when compared with MDI. Episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis were more likely to occur with CSII than MDI. Both CSII and CGM reduced glucose standard deviation, compared to MDI and SMBG respectively. CONCLUSIONS Both CGM and CSII remain impactful interventions compared to SMBG and MDI but, in adults with type 1 diabetes and in the contexts in which they have been studied, CGM might have a greater positive impact on glycaemic variability and severe hypoglycaemia than CSII, when added to MDI and SMBG.

We sought to validate prospectively the clinical utility of one such proteomic profile, the Mass Restricted (MR) score. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 169 consecutive women with singleton pregnancies admitted with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. All women had a clinically indicated amniocentesis to rule out intra-amniotic infection. A proteomic fingerprint (MR score) was generated from fresh samples of amniotic fluid using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. Presence or absence of the biomarkers of the MR score was interpreted in relationship to the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval, placental inflammation, and early-onset neonatal sepsis for all neonates admitted to the Newborn Special Care Unit (n = 104). Women with severe amniotic fluid inflammation (MR score of 3 or 4) had shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery intervals than women with no (MR score of 0) inflammation or even minimal (MR score of 1 or 2) inflammation (median [range] MR 3C4: 0.4 d [0.0C49.6 d] versus MR 1C2: 3.8 d [0.0C151.2 d] versus MR 0: 17.0 d [0.1C94.3 d], p < 0.001). Nonetheless, a minimal degree of inflammation was also associated with preterm birth regardless of membrane status. There was a significant association between the MR score and severity of histological chorioamnionitis (r = 0.599, p < 0.001). Furthermore, neonatal hematological indices and early-onset sepsis significantly correlated with the MR score even after adjusting for gestational age at birth (OR for MR 3C4: 3.3 [95% CI, 1.1 to 9.2], p = 0.03). When compared with other laboratory tests routinely used to diagnose amniotic fluid inflammation and infection, the MR score had the highest accuracy to detect inflammation (white blood cell count > 100 cells/mm(3)), whereas the combination of Gram stain and MR score was best for rapid prediction of intra-amniotic infection (positive amniotic fluid culture). CONCLUSIONS: High MR scores are associated with preterm delivery, histological chorioamnionitis, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. In this study, proteomic analysis of amniotic fluid was shown to be the most accurate test for diagnosis of intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas addition of the MR score to the Gram stain provides the best combination of tests to rapidly predict infection.","output":"Proteomic Profiling of the Amniotic Fluid to Detect Inflammation, Infection, and Neonatal Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhenium (Re) is an extremely rare and precious element that is mainly used in the construction of aerospace components and satellite stations.

We assigned the infrared (IR) absorption and Raman scattering spectra for NH4ReO4 using a dynamic process analysis of optical branch normal modes. We examined the IR-active peaks of Re-related vibrational modes in detail and found that the typical IR peak at approximately 914 cm-1 is due to the Re-O bond stretching. Thus, we posit that strong terahertz laser irradiation of NH4ReO4 at 914 cm-1 will lead to sufficient resonance absorption to cleave its Re-O bonds. This method could potentially be used to efficiently separate Re from its oxides.","output":"Theoretical Prediction of Rhenium Separation from Ammonium Perrhenate by Phonon-Photon Resonance Absorption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan has been on the forefront of efforts to manage and mitigate the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since 20th January 2020.

Prior studies, while advancing the field rapidly, have so far lacked the needed selectivity: when hydrogenating lignin-derived methoxylated monomers to methoxylated cyclohexanes, the desired methoxy group (-OCH3) has also been reduced. The ternary PtRhAu electrocatalysts developed herein selectively hydrogenate lignin monomers to methoxylated cyclohexanes-molecules with uses in pharmaceutics. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy, we find that Rh and Au modulate the electronic structure of Pt and that this modulating steers intermediate energetics on the electrocatalyst surface to facilitate the hydrogenation of lignin monomers and suppress C-OCH3 bond cleavage. As a result, PtRhAu electrocatalysts achieve a record 58% faradaic efficiency (FE) toward 2-methoxycyclohexanol from the lignin monomer guaiacol at 200 mA cm-2, representing a 1.9 advance in FE and a 4 increase in partial current density compared to the highest productivity prior reports. We demonstrate an integrated lignin biorefinery where wood-derived lignin monomers are selectively hydrogenated and funneled to methoxylated 2-methoxy-4-propylcyclohexanol using PtRhAu electrocatalysts.

Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long.

There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks. This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19.

In this article, we analyse whether the level of compliance with social distancing measures is associated with political, economic, and demographic factors. In particular, our interests lie in two areas. First, as lockdowns have dragged on, many countries see some political resistance, often, though not always, from populist movements: are localities that support populist movements more likely to ignore social distancing measures? Secondly, economic security: do localities with higher levels of income and wealth have higher levels of social distancing? We combine anonymised movement data from people's mobile phones drawn from the Google Community Mobility surveys with subnational economic and demographic data to answer these questions. It is found that across Europe, social distancing patterns correlate strongly with populist attitudes and economic security.

The study examined the association between body mass index (BMI), stratified by category, and severe form of COVID-19, and to explore the influence of demographic characteristics and other known risk factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis based on COVID-19 data from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health. Data were collected for all patients admitted to three main hospitals in Riyadh region between March 1st and July 30, 2020. The effects of BMI, demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and comorbidities on infection severity were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 950 patients were included in the study (70% male, 85% aged younger than 60 years old). A total of 55 (5.8%) patients were underweight, 263 (27.7%) were normal weight, 351 (37%) were overweight, 161 (17%) were obese class I, 76 (8%) were obese class II, and 44 (4.6%) were obese class III. Cough, fever, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms among overweight patients. According to the findings of a bivariate logistic regression study, class III obesity was significantly associated with a more severe form of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 2.874; 95% confidence interval, 1.344C6.149). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that patients with a BMI 40 kg/m(2) had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 than those with normal weight.

Common therapies include restoration of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis, wound care and pain control. Although soft tissue calcification is a known complication in children with advanced renal disease, the incidence of CUA in pediatrics remains unknown. Additionally, current literature regarding its management in pediatric patients is lacking. We report the case of a 17-year-old AfricanCAmerican male patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to Wegeners granulomatosis who developed CUA after 3 years on peritoneal dialysis. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate (STS) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy alone was ineffective, forcing the patient to undergo bilateral below the-knee-amputation (BKA) 5 months after presentation. It was not until peritoneal dialysis had been changed to daily hemodialysis, while continuing STS and HBO therapy, that the patient demonstrated complete resolution of CUA on repeat bone scan. Based on these findings, and the extremely high mortality rate associated with this disease, CUA management requires early and aggressive intervention with multi-faceted therapy, including prompt conversion from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis, STS infusions and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.","output":"Successful treatment of calcific uremic arteriolopathy in a pediatric dialysis patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with abnormal inflammatory and coagulation markers, potentially mediating thrombotic events. Our objective was to investigate the incidence, time course, laboratory features, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had undergone ultrasound imaging for suspected VTE from March 13 to May 18, 2020. The medical records of the included patients were reviewed for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-sensitivity troponin T at admission and at up to seven time points before and after ultrasound examination. The clinical outcomes included superficial venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, intubation, and death. Mixed effects logistic, linear, and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate the relationships between the laboratory markers and VTE and other in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Of 138 patients who had undergone imaging studies, 44 (31.9%) had evidence of VTE. On univariable analysis, an elevated admission CRP (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09; P = .02; per 10-U increase in CRP), platelet count (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-2.12; P = .03; per 1000-U increase in platelet count), and male sex (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.19-5.84; P = .02), were associated with VTE. However only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.01-5.56; P = .048). The independent predictors of death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07; P = .04), active malignancy (HR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.39-13.91; P = .01), elevated admission D-dimer (HR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.003-1.029; P = .02), and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.81; 95% CI, 1.76-13.10; P = .002).

A three-step decision tree using the intensities of four spectrometry peaks correlating to unidentified volatile organic compounds allowed the correct classification of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus-NL63, and influenza A virus H1N1 without misassignment when the calculation was performed with data 3 days post infection. The forward selection assignment model allowed the identification of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity, with only one of 231 measurements (0.43%) being misclassified.

The mortality and morbidity associated with epidemic and pandemic influenza puts a heavy burden on health care system. Most patients with influenza can be treated on an outpatient basis but some required critical care. It is crucial for frontline physicians to stratify influenza patients by level of risk. Therefore, this study aimed to create a prediction model for critical care and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study extracted data from the Chang Gung Research Database. This study included the patients who were diagnosed with influenza between 2010 and 2016. The primary outcome of this study was critical illness. The secondary analysis was to predict in-hospital mortality. A two-stage-modeling method was developed to predict hospital mortality. We constructed a multiple logistic regression model to predict the outcome of critical illness in the first stage, then S1 score were calculated. In the second stage, we used the S1 score and other data to construct a backward multiple logistic regression model. The area under the receiver operating curve was used to assess the predictive value of the model. RESULTS: In the present study, 1680 patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall ICU admission and in-hospital mortality was 10.36% (174 patients) and 4.29% (72 patients), respectively. In stage I analysis, hypothermia (OR = 1.92), tachypnea (OR = 4.94), lower systolic blood pressure (OR = 2.35), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.87), leukocytosis (OR = 2.22), leukopenia (OR = 2.70), and a high percentage of segmented neutrophils (OR = 2.10) were associated with ICU admission. Bandemia had the highest odds ratio in the Stage I model (OR = 5.43). In stage II analysis, C-reactive protein (OR = 1.01), blood urea nitrogen (OR = 1.02) and stage I models S1 score were assocaited with in-hospital mortality. The area under the curve for the stage I and II model was 0.889 and 0.766, respectively.

STUDY SELECTION Of 4,076 references screened, 47 studies with 6,583 patients were included in final analyses. Studies with fewer than 10 patients were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Relevant data, including demographics, comorbidities, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cannulation characteristics, occurrence rates of early and late vascular complications, patient outcomes, and use of distal perfusion cannula, were extracted from selected articles into an excel sheet specifically designed for this review. DATA SYNTHESIS Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were undertaken. Overall pooled estimate of vascular complications in our meta-analysis was 29.5% (95% CI, 23.6-35.9%). Two-thousand three-hundred forty-seven vascular complications in 6,124 venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients compared with 95 in 459 venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.87-2.96; p < 0.0001) were analyzed. Successful weaning off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation occurred in 60.6% of pooled patients; 46.2% were eventually discharged. Pooled prevalences of vascular complications like significant bleeding, limb ischemia, and cannula site bleeding were 15.4% (95% CI, 8.6-23.7%), 12.6% (95% CI, 10.0-15.5%), and 12.6% (95% CI, 9.6-18.5%), respectively.

Infection of respiratory epithelium by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), dysregulate the immune response, trigger both innate and acquired immunity that led to the immune system's hyper-activation, excessive cytokine secretion known as cytokine storm, and finally acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality.

CD4 T cell differentiation is a key determinant of protective immunity against Mtb, but it is not fully understood how host-pathogen interactions shape individual antigen-specific T cell populations and their protective capacity. Here, we investigated the immunodominant Mtb antigen, MPT70, which is upregulated in response to IFN- or nutrient/oxygen deprivation of in vitro infected macrophages. Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analysed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine-protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1+CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination and, against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred similar protection as ESAT-6. Together our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells towards terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less-differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune-balance in favor of the host. Importance Tuberculosis, caused by Mtb, constitutes a global health crisis of massive proportions and the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic is expected to cause a rise in tuberculosis-related deaths. Improved vaccines are therefore needed more than ever, but a lack of knowledge on protective immunity hampers their development. The present study shows that constitutively expressed antigens with high availability drive highly differentiated CD4 T cells with diminished protective capacity, which could be a survival strategy by Mtb to evade T cell immunity against key antigens. We demonstrate that immunisation with such antigens can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining antigen-specific T cells in a state of low differentiation. Future vaccine strategies should therefore explore combinations of multiple highly expressed antigens and we suggest that T cell differentiation could be used as a readily measurable parameter to identify these in both preclinical and clinical studies.","output":"In vivo antigen expression regulates CD4 T cell differentiation and vaccine efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV envelope (E) protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics exist. CoVs assemble by budding into the lumen of the early Golgi prior to exocytosis. The small CoV E protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which requires residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E during infection results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV S protein on the plasma membrane when compared IBV WT infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on the surface of virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with a rise in the pH of the Golgi lumen. We demonstrate that infection with IBV induces neutralization of Golgi luminal pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cells factors, protecting IBV spike protein (S) from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells.","output":"The Infectious Bronchitis Virus Coronavirus Envelope Protein Alters Golgi pH to Protect Spike Protein and Promote Release of Infectious Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has generally destroyed the global tourism industry and threatened the recovery of destinations in developing countries facing more challenges from increasingly serious waves of the pandemic.

The study recruited 40 representatives of tourism-related organizations for in-depth interviews, while 280 questionnaires were distributed to participants from different tourism organizations. The findings indicate that the majority of tourism businesses in the examined case study seriously suffered from the pandemic, and very few tourism-related enterprises were able to recover after the first wave of infection. Unfortunately, the tourism business sectors were found to be on the brink of bankruptcy or facing permanent shutdown after the third wave. All tourism enterprises generally appeared to experience a sharp drop in the number of customers, tourism revenue, service facilities and exploitation, as well as employee downsizing, but the degree of downturn differed among the examined enterprises.

The heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as a cellular receptor. Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an 1,2-fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies. The model indicated that the ABO polymorphism could contribute to substantially reduce the virus transmission, affecting both the number of infected individuals and the kinetics of the epidemic.","output":"Inhibition of the interaction between the SARS-CoV Spike protein and its cellular receptor by anti-histo-blood group antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor (CCCM) is a valuable tool to measure and compare European cities cultural and creative vitality. It addresses three dimensions: the presence of cultural venues and facilities (i.e., Cultural Vibrancy);the jobs and innovations connected to the so-called creative industries (i.e., the Creative Economy);and the enabling conditions for culture and creativity diffusion: human capital, diversity, trust and openness, international accessibility, and connectivity (i.e., an Enabling Environment). Comparing and ranking cities on these different dimensions offer policymakers the possibility of developing strategies related to their development (Montalto et al. 2019). However, as is recognized in the report presenting the CCCM, significant methodological limitations exist. They are related to both the tool and the potential behavioral implications it generates (JRC-OECD Handbook, 2008) and to the difficulties with addressing a multifaceted phenomenon with scant data, which offer limited opportunities to adequately measure cultural and creative cities (Van Puyenbroeck et al. 2021). In this paper, we integrate the CCCM framework to propose a spatially contextualized application at the city level as a tool to support policymakers understanding of the potential role of cultural and creative organizations in city development (Soini and Dessein, 2016). We, therefore, build our arguments on a recent stream of research showing the importance of the spatial dimension to understand the relevance of cultural and creative industries within a context and inform decision-makers (Boal-San Miguel and Herrero-Prieto, 2020). This spatial dimension is even more important at the city level, where public, private, and non-profit organizations interact to execute culture-led policies (Bonet and Ngrier, 2018). In this case, the location of specific organizations may be critical in offering opportunities at the neighborhood level, paving the way to space-driven local level policies (e.g., the 15 min walking strategy;see e.g., Pisano, 2020).","output":"Bringing Back in the Spatial Dimension in the Assessment of Cultural and Creative Industries and Its Relationship with a Citys Sustainability: The Case of Milan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered family life, but whether family exposures to and worries about the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted child conduct problems (CP) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits is unknown.

Physical activity (PA) improves functional performance, reduces various symptoms in PD and MS, in stroke- reduced neurological impairment of patients and provides a chance for independence. One of the main obstacles in successful rehabilitation is patients' movement passivity. The reason might be the psychological aspects, in particular fear of movement-kinesiophobia. Aim: To determine how many patients with S, MS, and PD suffer from kinsiophobia and what factors influence this process. METHODS Fifty patients after stroke, eighty one MS patients and sixty one PD patients were consecutively recruited from hospital and outpatients clinics. The sociodemographic data, self- assesment of fitness, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) and The Modified Baecke Questionnarie for Older Adults for physical activity were collected. A score >37 was considered to indicate a high level of kinesiophobia according to the TSK. RESULTS High level of kinesiophobia was shown in 66.67% of the subjects. TSK medians in particular illnesses were above the cut-off score and amounted: S-42.50 points; MS-38 points; PD-42.00 points. Regression showed 15% of fluctuation of variance (R2 = 0.1498; p < 0.0001), where regression factor showed: for mobility self-assessment: b = -0.2137 and for the age b = 0.0065.

Case DescriptionA 31-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of asthma, gastric sleeve surgery, and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy presented in March 2020 with subjective fever, dry cough, headache, and fatigue for 5 days. Vitals were significant for oxygen saturation of 96% on room air and BMI 44.4 kg/m2. Physical examination was normal. Labs and chest radiograph were normal. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. The patient was discharged and was advised to quarantine herself and monitor her oxygen saturation. She was re-tested again in July 2020 and September 2020 and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative both times. The patient came to the hospital again in November 2020 with subjective fevers, chills, shortness of breath, body ache, and malaise for 1 week. Vitals were significant for a heart rate of 112/min, temperature 99.6 F, respiratory rate of 20/min, hypoxia requiring 5L nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 95%, and BMI 44.7 kg/m2. Physical exam revealed decreased air entry in the lungs bilaterally. Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were within normal limits. Inflammatory markers were elevated. Computed tomography (CT) thorax showed bilateral, predominantly peripheral, and subpleural ill-defined ground-glass opacities consistent with pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. The patient was treated with intravenous remdesivir for 5 days and oral dexamethasone 6mg for 10 days. She improved clinically and was discharged on home oxygen. DiscussionAlthough the risk of COVID reinfection is low, cases of possible reinfection have been reported. Our patient was not immunocompromised, tested negative after 4 months and 6 months but presented again after 8 months with severe symptoms as compared to the first time. There have been case reports where the reinfection was more severe, however, there is not sufficient data to support that. There is not enough data demonstrating degree and duration of protection after the primary infection either. Reinfection could be due to infection with a more virulent strain or evolution of the previous viral strain in the body. The absence of genomic sequencing limits our ability to diagnose that.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on peoples movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. METHODS. We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","output":"Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masks continue to be a necessity until a large proportion of the population, including children, receive immunizations for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between parental attitudes and beliefs about masks and parent-for-child mask behavior using the Theory of Planned Behavior. We administered a survey in August 2020 to parents of school-aged children residing in the United States and Canada. Measures included sociodemographic variables for the parent and child, attitudes, norms, perceived control over childrens mask use, intentions and enforcement of mask wearing among children (also titled parent-for-child mask behavior). Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling. We collected data from 866 parents and 43.5% had children with pre-existing conditions (e.g., allergies, anxiety, impulsivity, skin sensitivity, asthma) that made extended mask wearing difficult, as per parents report. Among the full sample, negative attitudes ( = -0.20, p = .006), norms ( = 0.41, p = .002), and perceived control ( = 0.33, p = .006) predicted intentions. Norms ( = 0.50, p = .004) and intentions ( = 0.28, p = .003) also predicted parent-for-child mask use, while attitudes and perceived control did not. Intentions mediated the associations between attitudes, norms, perceived control, respectively, and mask behavior. Subgroup analyses revealed intentions as the key predictor of parent-for-child mask use among children with pre-conditions and norms as the key predictor among children without pre-conditions (i.e. healthy). Future public health messaging should target parental intentions, attitudes, norms, and perceived control about childrens masks wearing.","output":"Parent-for-child mask behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and the United States: An investigation of attitudes, norms, and perceived control using the theory of planned behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hysteroscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of endometrial polyps.

RECENT FINDINGS: Guidance to date has relied on data from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to guide practices on patient isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Although a face mask and eye protection are likely adequate for most clinical scenarios, published guidelines for PPE can be confusing and conflicting. Consensus for what constitutes a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) is lacking, but most agree providers performing procedures such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation would likely benefit from the use of an N95 respirator and eye protection.

METHODS: A retrospective review of adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between 9 February and 10 May 2020. Demographics, critical care unit (CCU) admission, antibiotic prescribing and microbiology results within 10 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 1155 patients were identified; 32.9% (380) died during admission and 12.4% (143) had positive microbiology. After excluding likely contaminants, 6.9% (80) had evidence of coinfection. The most common organisms isolated from blood cultures were Escherichia coli 9.5% (7), Klebsiella pneumoniae 4.0% (3), and MSSA 2.7% (2). Organisms isolated from lower respiratory tract samples included Candida albicans 44.4% (12), Staphylococcus aureus 22.2% (6), Klebsiella species 11.0% (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 11.0% (3) and Citrobacter species 11% (3).

We consider the environmental viral concentration in the model to better study the disease incidence in a community. Initially, the model is constructed with the derivative of integer-order. The classical epidemic model is then reconstructed with the fractional order operator in the form of Atangana-Baleanu derivative with the nonsingular and nonlocal kernel in order to analyze the dynamics of Coronavirus infection in a better way. A well-known estimation approach is used to estimate model parameters from the COVID-19 cases reported in Saudi Arabia from March 1 till August 20, 2020. After the procedure of parameters estimation, we explore some basic mathematical analysis of the fractional model. The stability results are provided for the disease free case using fractional stability concepts. Further, the uniqueness and existence results will be shown using the Picard-Lendelof approach. Moreover, an efficient numerical scheme has been proposed to obtain the solution of the model numerically. Finally, using the real fitted parameters, we depict many simulation results in order to demonstrate the importance of various model parameters and the memory index on disease dynamics and possible eradication.","output":"Mathematical modeling and analysis of the novel Coronavirus using Atangana-Baleanu derivative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States and has a cost burden over $120 billion per year. Readmissions following hospitalization for diabetes are common, particularly in minority patients, who experience greater rates of complications and lower quality healthcare compared to white patients. This study examines disparities in diabetes-related readmissions in the Military Health System, a universally insured, population of 9.5 million beneficiaries, who may receive care from military (direct care) or civilian (purchased care) facilities. METHODS The study identified a population of 7,605 adult diabetic patients admitted to the hospital in 2014. Diagnostic codes were used to identify hospital readmissions, and logistic regression was used to analyze associations among race, beneficiary status, patient or sponsor's rank, and readmissions at 30, 60, and 90 days. RESULTS A total of 239 direct care patients and 545 purchased care patients were included in our analyses. After adjusting for age and sex, we found no significant difference in readmission rates for black versus white patients; however, we found a statistically significant increase in the likelihood for readmission of Native American/Alaskan Native patients compared to white patients, which persisted in direct care at 60 days (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 11.51, 95% CI 1.11-119.41) and 90 days (AOR 18.42, 95% CI 1.78-190.73), and in purchased care at 90 days (AOR 4.54, 95% CI 1.31-15.74). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that universal access to healthcare alleviates disparities for black patients, while Native America/Alaskan Native populations may still be at risk of disparities associated with readmissions among diabetic patients in both the closed direct care system and the civilian fee for service purchased care system.","output":"Examining Racial Disparities in Diabetes Readmissions in the United States Military Health System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes a sample of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the region of Madrid (Spain).

However, due to quality problems, the lack of standards, and the diversity of dosage forms, adverse reactions to TCMs often occur. Moreover, the composition of TCMs makes them extremely challenging to extract and isolate, complicating studies of toxicity mechanisms. Aim of the review: The aim of this paper is therefore to summarize the advanced applications of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technology in the quality control, safety evaluations, and determination of toxicity mechanisms of TCMs. Materials and methods Relevant studies from the literature have been collected from scientific databases, such as PubMed, Scifinder, Elsevier, Google Scholar using the keywords MSI, traditional Chinese medicines, quality control, metabolomics, and mechanism. Results MSI is a new analytical imaging technology that can detect and image the metabolic changes of multiple components of TCMs in plants and animals in a high throughput manner. Compared to other chemical analysis methods, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), this method does not require the complex extraction and separation of TCMs, and is fast, has high sensitivity, is label-free, and can be performed in high-throughput. Combined with chemometrics methods, MSI can be quickly and easily used for quality screening of TCMs. In addition, this technology can be used to further focus on potential biomarkers and explore the therapeutic/toxic mechanisms of TCMs. Conclusions As a new type of analysis method, MSI has unique advantages to metabolic analysis, quality control, and mechanisms of action explorations of TCMs, and contributes to the establishment of quality standards to explore the safety and toxicology of TCMs.","output":"Advanced applications of mass spectrometry imaging technology in quality control and safety assessments of traditional Chinese medicines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Whether the provision of online health care referral systems by the Indonesia National Health Insurance Agency has ensured healthcare referral compliance raises much concern due to the continuing deficit. This study examines the pattern of healthcare referral process, regional and referral compliance from 2015 to 2016. To provide comprehensive analysis on how people seek treatment, this study also aims to understand health-seeking behavior in Indonesia, the utilization of alternative treatment, and health informationCseeking behavior on social media. METHOD: The data come from three data files, namely the National Health Insurance membership master data, the First Level Health Facilities transaction data and the Advanced Referral Health Facilities transaction data of 1,697,452 individuals. The regional compliance applies a logit regression model, while referral compliance applies descriptive statistics of the referral pathway. This study also follows a quantitative approach using an online questionnaire, with 463 respondents who have National Health Insurance which applies an ordered logit model. RESULT: We found that several demographic variables and regional health facility availability affect regional compliance. Moreover, we found 19.3% of the transactions did not comply with the prescribed referral sequence. The prescribed referral sequence was mostly followed for patients with malignant diseases. We also found men who perceive that their health condition is healthy will less likely seek health services compared to women. Further, the tendency of alternative treatment increases health-seeking behavior, and the tendency of seeking health information on social media increases the frequency seeking health services. CONCLUSION: We recommend the prescribed referral sequence to be re-evaluated especially for patients with malignant disease; the referral process should not be based on hospital classes but on the competency of the healthcare facility which may indirectly address the deficit issue. It is imperative that the government evaluate health promotion approaches to men and women, both direct and indirect through their significant others.","output":"The regional and referral compliance of online healthcare systems by Indonesia National Health Insurance agency and health-seeking behavior in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide the latest evidence for delivering safe and effective anesthesia care for pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to highlight continuing gaps in the literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Safe and efficient care of pediatric patients with COVID-19 can be delivered with the proper planning, coordination, supplies, and staff preparation. From the start of the pandemic, pediatric anesthesiologists from around the world contributed important insights and shared experience as to how best to adapt anesthesia care for children with COVID-19 requiring general anesthesia and sedation. Although initial efforts focused on creating safe airway management processes, the role of anesthesiologists as perioperative leaders quickly extended to ensuring well-coordinated management of COVID-19 patients throughout the hospital for procedures, including preprocedure testing, patient transport, operating room setup, and ensuring the safety of staff. Several important areas remain not well studied including, the timing of rescheduling elective procedures following COVID-19 infection, the perioperative implications of re-infection, and future considerations of managing vaccinated children.

In this pandemic situation, researchers all around the world are trying their level best to find suitable therapeutics from various sources to combat against the SARS-CoV-2. To date, numerous bioactive compounds from different sources have been tested to control many viral diseases. However, microbial metabolites are advantageous for drug development over metabolites from other sources. We herein retrieved and reviewed literatures from PubMed, Scopus and Google relevant to antiviral microbial metabolites by searching with the keywords antiviral microbial metabolites, microbial metabolite against virus, microorganism with antiviral activity, antiviral medicine from microbial metabolite, antiviral bacterial metabolites, antiviral fungal metabolites, antiviral metabolites from microscopic algae and so on. For the same purpose, the keywords microbial metabolites against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 and plant metabolites against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were used. Only the full text literatures available in English and pertinent to the topic have been included and those which are not available as full text in English and pertinent to antiviral or anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity were excluded. In this review, we have accumulated microbial metabolites that can be used as antiviral agents against a broad range of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Based on this concept, we have included 330 antiviral microbial metabolites so far available to date in the data bases and were previously isolated from fungi, bacteria and microalgae. The microbial source, chemical nature, targeted viruses, mechanism of actions and IC(50)/EC(50) values of these metabolites are discussed although mechanisms of actions of many of them are not yet elucidated. Among these antiviral microbial metabolites, some compounds might be very potential against many other viruses including coronaviruses. However, these potential microbial metabolites need further research to be developed as effective antiviral drugs. This paper may provide the scientific community with the possible secret of microbial metabolites that could be an effective source of novel antiviral drugs to fight against many viruses including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the future viral pandemics.","output":"Microbial Metabolites: The Emerging Hotspot of Antiviral Compounds as Potential Candidates to Avert Viral Pandemic Alike COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the universities responded to the call of suspension of classes without suspension of schooling positively Under the condition that they cannot return to school, teachers and students study at home and know about the campus real-time news through various school medias In this context, the News Center of Capital University of Economics and Business, with the help of new media technology, has transformed several traditional video programs into live network programs, and achieved good publicity effects After a short period of researching and exploration, the author groped out a set of live broadcast system that suitable for the news publicity work of our school gradually Through the analysis of several live broadcast activities completed by the school news center in the first half of 2020, this paper tries to summarize the solutions suitable for college network live broadcast from two aspects of technology and application","output":"Application and Practice of Network Broadcast Technology in Propaganda work in Universities - A Case study of Capital University of Economics and Business"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: A large number of new molecular or virology laboratories have been established to increase the testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2. Due to heavy workload, there is delay in testing of samples. In order to avoid the negative effect of delayed testing on RTPCR results guidelines are issued from WHO and CDC to transport samples in cold chain. However, in pandemic situations the recommended guidelines for transport and storage conditions are often compromised. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sample storage conditions at different temperatures on the results of RT PCR test. METHODS: Total 275 samples were included in this study, among these 126 samples tested positive and 149 samples tested negative. All samples were aliquoted into two and the aliquotes stored in duplicate at 4 ?C and room temperature. All aliquots stored at both the temperatures were tested by RTPCR every 24 hours up to 5 days. RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy decreased from day1 to day 5 at both the storage temperatures i,e 4 ?C and room temperature in comparison to the initial day results. Positivity decreased on an average of 9.02% at 4 ?C and at 9.27% at room temperature per day. Among total 126 positive samples on an average false negative and failure of internal control at 4 ?C and room temperature was 8.86%, 8.22% and 3.64%, and 4.12%, respectively. All the samples with CT value ?< ?30 remained positive at both temperatures up to 5 days. Few samples with >30 CT value showed variable results i.e. positive, negative or internal control failure from day 1 (2nd day after sample collection) onwards. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between RT PCR results of samples stored at 4 ?C and room temperature up to 5 days of collection. However internal control failure was more in samples stored at room temperature.

A primary diagnosis of a gastroenteritis-related disorder was noted in 9.8% of children aged below 5 years, and a primary or secondary diagnosis in 11.8%. Any CMS diagnosis of rotavirus (ICD 008.61) was initially used to derive incidence estimates of rotavirus by age group. Rotavirus was recorded as any primary or any secondary diagnosis in 1.6% of children below 5 years of age. The unadjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years based on any CMS diagnosis of rotavirus were: 249 (0 to <1m); 612 (1 to <2m); 1066 (2 to <6m); 1383 (6 to <11m); 959 (1 to <2y); 406 (2 to <3y); 233 (3 to <4y); 124 (4 to <5y). Overall the rotavirus incidence was 1071 in children below 2 years and 542 in children below 5 years of age, with the incidence rates trending up during the time period (p = 0.001). A similar but less marked upward trend (p = 0.046) was noted for the incidence of all-cause gastroenteritis. Laboratory results from a single surveillance hospital (1 July 2000 to 31 March 2011) were then linked to these CMS codes to derive adjustment factors for possible over- and under-diagnosis of rotavirus based on CMS codes alone. This analysis suggested that a CMS diagnosis of rotavirus alone likely under-reported true incidence by a factor of between 1.59 and 2.02 in children below 5 years of age.

The majority of cases usually have a mild or moderate form, characterized by fever, cough, intense asthenia and multiple symptoms derived from the initial replicative effect and subsequent hyperimmune effect. Severe cases present with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), due to pneumonia with bilateral involvement, which lead to hospital admission of patients and the need for admission to intensive care units (ICU) of approximately 10?20%.

Methods: Monthly telephone surveys in January-April 2020 and then weekly surveys from May through December 2020 were conducted to monitor changes in public risk perception of COVID-19, personal efficacy in self-protection, confidence in the governments ability to control the pandemic, precautionary behaviours, perceived impact of precautionary behaviours, psychological fatigue and distress in Hong Kong, and examine their inter-relationships. Results: While worry about contracting COVID-19 increased, personal efficacy and confidence in the government declined as the community incidence of COVID-19 increased. The public maintained high compliance with most precautionary behaviours throughout but relaxed behaviours that were more challenging when disease incidence declined. Public confidence in the government was persistently low throughout, of which, a lower level was associated with more psychological fatigue, lower compliance with precautionary behaviours and greater psychological distress. Perceived greater negative impact of precautionary behaviours was also associated with more psychological fatigue which in turn was associated with relaxation of precautionary behaviours. Female, younger and unemployed individuals reported greater psychological distress throughout different stages of the pandemic. Conclusions: Risk communication should focus on promoting confidence in self-protection and pandemic control to avoid helplessness to act when the pandemic resurges.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in paclitaxel-induced neuronal damage and in the onset of peripheral neuropathy. We have previously shown that the expression of PINK1, a key mediator of mitochondrial quality control, ameliorated the paclitaxel-induced thermal hyperalgesia phenotype and restored mitochondrial homeostasis in Drosophila larvae. In this study, we show that the small-molecule PINK1 activator niclosamide exhibits therapeutic potential for paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. Specifically, niclosamide cotreatment significantly ameliorated the paclitaxel-induced thermal hyperalgesia phenotype in Drosophila larvae in a PINK1-dependent manner. Paclitaxel-induced alteration of the dendrite structure of class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons was not reduced upon niclosamide treatment. In contrast, paclitaxel treatment-induced increases in both mitochondrial ROS and aberrant mitophagy levels in C4da neurons were significantly suppressed by niclosamide. In addition, niclosamide suppressed paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in human SH-SY5Y cells in a PINK1-dependent manner. These results suggest that niclosamide alleviates thermal hyperalgesia by attenuating paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection.

We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN- production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN- levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection.

Furthermore, the need of an educational programme for parents and the need of regular parents-athlete-teacher/coach engagement were considered crucial to facilitate successful parental interventions at academic and/or sports levels and to limit the potential negative effects of DC parenting.","output":"Parents About Parenting Dual Career Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic covid-19 has forced SMEs entrepreneurs to transform their business from offline to online purchases Social media such as Instagram is a digital platform that uses widely It gives a wide opportunity to SMEs entrepreneurs to survive and to grow But it provides many challenges One of the challenges is the capacity of entrepreneurs to transfer the knowledge of the product and influence the customer to buy Celebrity involvement in supporting SMEs entrepreneurs by endorsing the product in value will be a good way for SMEs entrepreneurs to influence customers This research aims to portray of celebrity endorser in supporting SMEs Entrepreneurs to survive through Instagram (Social Media) in the Pandemic Covid-19 condition The study observes and records endorsement activities carried out by 65 celebrities through their Instagram account and to survey 809 SMEs entrepreneurs that the product endorsed by the celebrity ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Celebrity Endorser in Supporting SMEs through Social Media in Pandemic Situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Telemedicine is a resource to help limit in-person contacts, which has become increasingly utilized during the Coronavirus pandemic In the last year, most health care systems have attempted to limit in-person visits in order to help decrease Coronavirus transmission A retrospective analysis was conducted to determine if the use of telemedicine resulted in an increase in cancellation rates The data on cancellation rates of a burn clinic using telemedicine was collected for a seven-month period in 2020 The increased rate of cancellations for telemedicine visits compared to in-person visits was found to be statistically significant Methods A retrospective analysis of patient cancellation rates for 2,463 burn outpatient visits seen in a burn clinic associated with a large tertiary referral burn center was performed covering the time period between April 1st and August 30th of 2020 Cancellations of initial visits for new or recently discharged patients were not included as telemedicine visits were only offered for established burn outpatients Rescheduling rates for both groups were calculated to assess a potential impact on cancellations Telemedicine visits consisted of patient encounters conducted by phone or by live video chat Statistical significance was determined using chi-square test with an accepted p &lt; 0 05 Results The study included 2,463 scheduled outpatient visits comprising 511 telemedicine visits and 1,952 in-person visits A cancellation rate of 47% occurred for telemedicine visits and a cancellation rate of 40% was observed with in-person visits Patient visits conducted using telemedicine were associated with a higher cancellation rate (p=0 013) The reschedule rate for telemedicine visits was 22% while in-person visits had a rate of 25% showing no significant association (p = 0 45) Conclusions Telemedicine follow-up visits were found to have an increased rate of cancellations compared to in-person visits Rates of rescheduling showed no significant difference between groups","output":"584 Increase in Cancellation Rates with Follow-Up Telemedicine Visits in a Burn Clinic Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Neonatal sepsis causes morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Clinicians need a predictive tool for the onset of neonatal infection to expedite treatment and prevent morbidity. Abnormal thermal gradients, a central-peripheral temperature difference (CPtd) of > 2C or < 0C, and elevated heart rate characteristic (HRC) scores are associated with infection. OBJECTIVE This article presents the protocol for the Predictive Analysis using Temperature and Heart Rate (PATH) study. METHODS This observational trial will enroll 440 very preterm infants to measure abdominal temperature (AT) and foot temperature (FT) every minute and HRC scores hourly for 28 days to compare to infection data. Time with abnormal thermal gradients (Model 1) and elevated HRC scores (Model 2) will be compared to the onset of infections. For data analysis, CPtd (AT-FT) will be investigated as two derived variables high CPtd (number/percentage of minutes with CPtd > 2C) and low CPtd (number/percentage of minutes with CPtd < 0C). In the infant-level model, the outcome yi will be an indicator of whether the infant was diagnosed with an infection in the first 28 days of life and the high CPtd and low CPtd variables will be the average over the entire observation period; logit(yi) = 0 + xi1 + zi. For the day-level model, the outcome yit will be an indicator of whether the ith infant was diagnosed with an infection on the tth day from t = 4 through t = 28 or the day that infection is diagnosed (25 possible repeated measures) logit(yit) = 0 + xit1 + zit. It will be determined whether a model with only high CPtd or only low CPtd is superior in predicting infection. Also, the correlation of abnormal HRC scores with high CPtd and low CPtd values will be assessed.

In cancer cachexia, the tumor tissues interact with other tissues and organs using secretory factors. Differentiated immune cells from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow contribute to the systemic inflammation and may be affected by these intertissue interactions. However, the significant changes that occur in the bone marrow and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of cancer cachexia on bone and stem cells that reside in the bone marrow using a lung cancer cachexia animal model. Cancer cachexia induces bone loss and impairs the properties of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via JAK/STAT and glucocorticoid signaling. Our findings provide new insights for developing a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer cachexia. ABSTRACT: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial systemic inflammation disease caused by complex interactions between the tumor and host tissues via soluble factors. However, whether cancer cachexia affects the bone marrow, in particular the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), remains unclear. Here, we investigated the bone marrow and bone in a cancer cachexia animal model generated by transplanting Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The number of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) started to significantly decrease in the cancer cachectic animal model prior to the discernable loss of muscle and fat. This decrease in BM-MNCs was associated with myeloid skewing in the circulation and the expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Bone loss occurred in the cancer cachexia animal model and accompanied the decrease in the bone marrow MSCs that play important roles in both supporting HSCs and maintaining bone homeostasis. Glucocorticoid signaling mediated the decrease in bone marrow MSCs in the cancer cachectic environment. The cancer cachexia environment also skewed the differentiation of the bone marrow MSCs toward adipogenic fate via JAK/STAT as well as glucocorticoid signaling. Our results suggest that the bone loss induced in cancer cachexia is associated with the depletion and the impaired differentiation capacity of the bone marrow MSCs.","output":"Bone Marrow Homeostasis Is Impaired via JAK/STAT and Glucocorticoid Signaling in Cancer Cachexia Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused and is still causing tremendous damage to the global economy and human health. Qualitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) is the golden standard for COVID-19 test. However, the SARS-CoV-2 variants may not only make vaccine less effective but also evade RT-qPCR test. Here we suggest an innovative primer design strategy for the RT-qPCR test of SARS-CoV-2. The principle is that the primers should be designed based on both the nucleic acid sequence and the structure of the protein encoded. The three nucleotides closest to the 3 end of the primer should be the codon which encodes the tryptophan in the structure core. Based on this principle, we designed a pair of primers targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Since tryptophan is encoded by only one codon, any mutation that occurs at this position would change the amino acid residue, resulting in an unstable N protein. This means that this kind of SARS-CoV-2 variant could not survive. In addition, both our data and previous reports all indicate that the mutations occurring at other places in the primers do not significantly affect the RT-qPCR result. Consequently, no SARS-CoV-2 variant can escape detection by the RT-qPCR kit containing the primers designed based on our strategy.","output":"Structure-Based Primer Design Minimizes the Risk of PCR Failure Caused by SARS-CoV-2 Mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the ARISTOTLE trial, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have a high risk of stroke. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in prespecified subgroups of patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. METHODS Between Dec 19, 2006, and April 2, 2010, patients were enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial at 1034 clinical sites in 39 countries. 18,201 patients with AF or atrial flutter were randomly assigned to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 20-30). The median duration of follow-up was 18 years (IQR 14-23). The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, analysed by intention to treat. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding in the on-treatment population. All participants, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignments. In this subgroup analysis, we estimated event rates and used Cox models to compare outcomes in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. The ARISTOTLE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC00412984. FINDINGS Of the trial population, 3436 (19%) had a previous stroke or TIA. In the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 246 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the apixaban group and 324 in the warfarin group (hazard ratio [HR] 076, 95% CI 056 to 103); in the subgroup of patients without previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 101 per 100 patient-years of follow-up with apixaban and 123 with warfarin (HR 082, 95% CI 065 to 103; p for interaction=071). The absolute reduction in the rate of stroke and systemic embolism with apixaban versus warfarin was 077 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI -008 to 163) in patients with and 022 (-003 to 047) in those without previous stroke or TIA. The difference in major bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin was 107 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 009-204) in patients with and 093 (054-132) in those without previous stroke or TIA. INTERPRETATION The effects of apixaban versus warfarin were consistent in patients with AF with and without previous stroke or TIA. Owing to the higher risk of these outcomes in patients with previous stroke or TIA, the absolute benefits of apixaban might be greater in this population.

Australian agricultural industries are amongst the nations most dangerous workplaces with joint, ligament, muscle and tendon injuries being commonplace along with wounds, lacerations and musculoskeletal diseases. It is therefore important to try and minimise the risk of injuries to workers. The aims of this study were to (1) identify whether lower limb problems occur in the Australian wine industry and (2) identify the types of safety footwear worn. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Australian wine industry. The study was a cross-sectional anonymous survey of 82 questions with n = 207 respondents. Questions related to job role performed, types of lower limb problems experienced, level of pain, restriction of activities, types of footwear worn, general health and physical health. RESULTS: The main working roles were winery (73.4%), vineyard (52.2%), laboratory (39.6%), cellar door (32.4%) and office (8.2%), with 63.3% of participants working in more than one role. Lower back pain was the most commonly reported problem at 56% followed by foot pain (36.7%), knee pain (24.6%), leg pain (21.3%), ankle pain (17.9%), hip pain (15.5%), toe pain (13%) and heel pain (11.1%). The most popular footwear used by participants were elastic sided safety boots, followed by high cut lace up safety boots with side zip. Overall, although the pain experienced was moderate, it did not impact the workers ability to perform their duties and the majority self-reported as being in very good general and physical health. CONCLUSION: To date no data have been published on the types of lower limb problems or the types of safety footwear worn in the Australian wine industry. This study is the first to demonstrate that elastic sided safety boots were the most popular amongst respondents and that lower limb problems occur with workers. Therefore, further research into the safety footwear used in the Australian wine industry is needed to better support workers health while working in their varied roles and conditions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide, online survey of adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408) was conducted in April 2020. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were undertaken. Differences in the everyday challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS: Girls were significantly more likely than boys to perceive the limitations in contacts with others (friends and family) and the concerns about the health of relatives as a big difficulty. Among the youngest students (11-12 years of age), the lack of contact with friends and family and worries about their health and the fear of infection ranked higher than for other students. For the oldest (17-18) the lack of private time and space and not being able to meet one's boyfriend/ girlfriend were the most troublesome. The necessity to stay at home and the inconvenience resulting from the lack of outdoor exercise were ranked higher by urban students than by students living in rural areas.

To monitor the antibody level duration of vaccine-induced immune responses in vaccinated population, cost-effective and easily implementable antibody testing methodologies are urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using a single drop of fingerstick blood collected with flocked swabs for a high-throughput and quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) IgG antibody immunoassay. A total of 50 voluntary subjects participated and donated fingerstick blood samples before and after receiving the Moderna mRNA vaccine. Among all individuals tested, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody was detected before vaccination and on day 7 after receiving the first vaccine dose. On day 14 after the first dose, a significant amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody was detected in all participants samples. By the end the third week from the first dose, the median anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG concentration increased to 44.9 ug/mL. No anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG antibody was detected in any of the participants during the study period, indicating that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay is specific for the mRNA vaccine induced antibodies. Comaprison of venous blood plasma and fingerstick blood for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG shown a higher correlation. Furthermore, the fingerstick blood dried swab samples are stable for at least 4 days.

Vonoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker and has been shown to have several advantages over conventional proton pump inhibitors, including a long duration of gastric acid suppression. Methods To investigate the efficacy of vonoprazan for treating proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux esophagitis in patients with systemic sclerosis, 10 patients with proton pump inhibitor-refractory reflux esophagitis who were switched to vonoprazan were selected from our systemic sclerosis database. Reflux esophagitis was evaluated by endoscopy, and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related symptoms were assessed by the frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire before and after switching from proton pump inhibitor to vonoprazan at an average interval of 3.5 [2-5.5] months. Results After switching patients to vonoprazan, the endoscopic findings of reflux esophagitis were significantly improved (p = .033), and six patients (60%) achieved mucosal healing. The total frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease score was also significantly decreased (p = .043), mainly by improving the acid reflux score. Vonoprazan was well tolerated and was continued for 15.5 [11.25-23.75] months in all patients.

HABs are often found in waterways near residences, therefore, aerosolized HAB toxins can potentially affect both indoor and outdoor air quality. Given that HABs are predicted to increase worldwide, effective mitigation strategies are needed to prevent the inhalation of aerosolized HAB toxins. In this work, we characterized both the particle filtration efficiency using particle sizing instruments as well as the mass concentration of different congeners of aerosolized microcystin (MC) toxins that penetrate through commercially available face masks and air conditioner (AC) filters. Particles were generated from cultures of the toxin-producing cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. Hydrophobic congeners of microcystin including MC-LF and MC-LW were enriched in aerosols compared to water, with MC-LR being the most abundant, which has implications for the toxicity of inhalable particles generated from HAB-contaminated waters. Particle transmission efficiencies and toxin filtration efficiencies scaled with the manufacturer-provided filter performance ratings. Up to 80% of small, microcystin-containing aerosols were transmitted through AC filters with low filter performance ratings. In contrast, both face masks as well as AC filters with high filter performance ratings efficiently removed toxin-containing particles to below limits of quantification. Our findings suggest that face masks and commercially available AC filters with high filtration efficiency ratings are suitable mitigation strategies to avoid indoor and outdoor air exposure to aerosolized HAB toxins. This work also has relevance for reducing airborne exposure to other HAB toxins, non-HAB toxins, pathogens, and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Filtration Efficiency of Air Conditioner Filters and Face Masks to Limit Exposure to Aerosolized Algal Toxins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to control the spread of COVID-19, China had implemented strict lockdown measures. The closure of cities had had a huge impact on human production and consumption activities, which had greatly reduced population mobility. This article used air pollutant data from 341 cities in mainland China and divided these cities into seven major regions based on geographic conditions and climatic environment. The impact of urban blockade on air quality during COVID-19 was studied from the perspectives of time, space, and season. In addition, this article used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to systematically analyze the characteristics of air pollution in the country and used the Pearson correlation coefficient to explore the relationship between NDVI and the air pollutant concentrations during the COVID-19 period. Then, linear regression was used to find the quantitative relationship between NDVI and AQI, and the fitting effect of the model was found to be significant through t test. Finally, some countermeasures were proposed based on the analysis results, and suggestions were provided for improving air quality. This paper has drawn the following conclusions: (1) the concentration of pollutants varied greatly in different regions, and the causes of their pollution sources were also different. The region with the largest decline in AQI was the Northeast China (60.01%), while the AQI in the southwest China had the smallest change range, and its value had increased by 1.72%. In addition, after the implementation of the city blockade, the concentration of NO(2) in different regions dropped the most, but the increase in O(3) was more obvious. (2) Higher vegetation coverage would have a beneficial impact on the atmospheric environment. Areas with higher NDVI values have relatively low AQI. There is a negative correlation between NDVI and AQI, and an average increase of 0.1 in NDVI will reduce AQI by 3.75 (95% confidence interval). In the case of less human intervention, the higher the vegetation coverage, the lower the local pollutant concentration will be. Therefore, the degree of vegetation coverage would have a direct or indirect impact on air pollution.","output":"Changes in the concentration of air pollutants before and after the COVID-19 blockade period and their correlation with vegetation coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To describe the 9-year journey of a group of language and literacy researchers in establishing and cultivating Research-Practice Partnerships (RPPs).

Most states allowed medical and/or non-medical adult-use cannabis retailers to remain open. This study assesses changes in cannabis sales across Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Pre-tax sales data from cannabis marketplaces in four states were analyzed to identify trends from January 2018-December 2020. Mean monthly sales and relative percent change in mean monthly sales were compared by state from April-December (coinciding with the pandemic) in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Differences were assessed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test. RESULTS: Mean monthly cannabis sales in all four states were higher during the pandemic period in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Sales reached a three-year peak in Washington in May 2020 and in Alaska, Colorado, and Oregon in July 2020. From April-December, the percent change in mean monthly sales from 2019 to 2020 was significantly higher than 2018-2019 in all four states, though Alaska saw similar increases between 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. CONCLUSION: To date, cannabis sales in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have increased more during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the previous two years. In light of these increases, data monitoring by states and CDC is warranted to understand how patterns of use are changing, which populations are demonstrating changes in use, and how such changes may affect substance use and related public health outcomes.","output":"Cannabis sales increases during COVID-19: Findings from Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In present times, the adoption and adaption of technology have become empirical.

The content of pitcher fluids has been the focus of many fluid protein profiling studies. These studies suggest an evolutionary convergence of a conserved group of similar enzymes in diverse families of pitcher plants. A recent study showed that endogenous proteins were replenished in the pitcher fluid, which indicates a feedback mechanism in protein secretion. This poses an interesting question on the physiological effect of plant protein loss. However, there is no study to date that describes the pitcher response to endogenous protein depletion. To address this gap of knowledge, we previously performed a comparative RNA-sequencing experiment of newly opened pitchers (D0) against pitchers after 3 days of opening (D3C) and pitchers with filtered endogenous proteins (>10 kDa) upon pitcher opening (D3L). Nepenthes ampullaria was chosen as a model study species due to their abundance and unique feeding behaviour on leaf litters. The analysis of unigenes with top 1% abundance found protein translation and stress response to be overrepresented in D0, compared to cell wall related, transport, and signalling for D3L. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis identified DEGs with functional enrichment in protein regulation, secondary metabolism, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport. The transcriptomic landscape of the pitcher dramatically shifted towards intracellular transport and defence response at the expense of energy metabolism and photosynthesis upon endogenous protein depletion. This is supported by secretome, transportome, and transcription factor analysis with RT-qPCR validation based on independent samples. This study provides the first glimpse into the molecular responses of pitchers to protein loss with implications to future cost/benefit analysis of carnivorous pitcher plant energetics and resource allocation for adaptation in stochastic environments.","output":"Transcriptome-wide shift from photosynthesis and energy metabolism upon endogenous fluid protein depletion in young Nepenthes ampullaria pitchers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has required measures to contain the contagion, including social isolation.

However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used. The first patient symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.","output":"Estimating the reproductive number and the outbreak size of COVID-19 in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an unprecedented time for healthcare and has substantially changed resource availability in surgeons' work practices and routines. Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? METHODS: The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of &#8804; 7 , 8 to 10, and &#8805; 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean  SD age was 30  3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p < 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

This tool, Multi-document Cohesion Network Analysis (MD-CNA), expands the structure of a CNA graph with lexical overlap links of multiple types, together with coreference links to highlight dependencies between text fragments of different granularities. We introduce two visualizations of the CNA graph that support the visual exploration of intratextual and intertextual links. First, a hierarchical view displays a tree-structure of discourse as a visual illustration of CNA links within a document. Second, a grid view available at paragraph or sentence levels displays links both within and between documents, thus ensuring ease of visualization for links spanning across multiple documents. Two use cases are provided to evaluate key functionalities and insights for each type of visualization.","output":"Multi-document Cohesion Network Analysis: Visualizing Intratextual and Intertextual Links"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak negatively impacted the mental health and emotions of many individuals. The study presented here explores the mental health and emotion regulation experienced by undergraduate nursing students in China during the pandemic. Potential risk factors related to negative mental health symptoms were identified in this study. An online cross-sectional study including 342 respondents was performed from March 6, 2020, to April 1, 2020, at a University in China. A Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were used to evaluate mental health and emotions. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, or comorbid anxiety and depression were 55.0%, 56.4%, and 31.6%, respectively. The mean score of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression was 29.36  8.00 and 15.55  5.14. Lower scores for cognitive reappraisal and higher scores for expressive suppression were susceptible to symptoms of anxiety, depression, or comorbid anxiety and depression. Issues with mental health occurred in nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study provide a better understanding of the association between mental health and emotion regulation, which will help direct psychological intervention that relieves these issues during the pandemic.","output":"An evaluation of mental health and emotion regulation experienced by undergraduate nursing students in China during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause recurrent and severe respiratory tract infections. Cytoskeletal proteins are often involved during viral infections, either for cell entry or the initiation of the immune response. The importance of actin and clathrin dynamics for cell entry and the initiation of the cellular immune response against RSV in human immune cells is not known yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry of RSV and the subsequent effect on T cell activation and interferon gamma release in human immune cells. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes were isolated from healthy adults and stimulated in vitro with RSV. Actin and clathrin dynamics were inhibited with respectively cytochalasin D and chlorpromazine. T cell receptor signaling was inhibited with cyclosporin A. Flow cytometry was used to determine the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry and T cell activation by RSV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate the contribution of actin and clathrin on the release of interferon gamma. RESULTS: Cell entry, virus gene transcription and interferon gamma release are actin-dependent. Post-endocytic processes like the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II on monocytes , T cell activation and the release of interferon gamma are clathrin-dependent. Finally, T cell receptor signaling affects T cell activation, whereas soluble interleukin 18 is dispensable. CONCLUSION: Analysis of cell entry and interferon gamma release after infection with RSV reveals the importance of actin- and clathrin-dependent signaling in human immune cells. Insights into the cellular biology of the human immune response against respiratory syncytial virus will provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and may prove useful in the development of preventive strategies.","output":"Actin- and clathrin-dependent mechanisms regulate interferon gamma release after stimulation of human immune cells with respiratory syncytial virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persons with serious mental illnesses experience high rates of medical comorbidity, especially diabetes. This study examined initial implementation feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of a new 6-month Multicomponent Intervention for Diabetes risk reduction in Adults with Serious mental illnesses (MIDAS) among persons in residential care facilities (RCFs). We conducted a mixed-methods study using four types of quantitative and qualitative data sources (administrative data; structured facility-level observations; resident assessments including blood-based biomarkers, 24-h dietary recalls, and self-report physical activity; and focus groups/interviews with staff and participants), to assess evidence of and factors affecting intervention feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness. It was feasible to provide a high percentage of MIDAS class sessions (mean 50 of 52 intended sessions delivered) and make nutrition-related RCF changes (substitutions for healthier food items and reduced portion sizes). Class attendance rates and positive feedback from residents and staff provided evidence of MIDAS acceptability and appropriateness for addressing identified health needs. The residents who attended  85% of the sessions had greater improvement in several desired outcomes compared to others. Implementing a fully integrated MIDAS model with more extensive changes to facilities and more fundamental health changes among residents was more challenging. While the study found evidence to support feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of individual MIDAS components, some challenges for full implementation and success in obtaining immediate health benefits were also apparent. The study results highlight the need for improving health among RCF populations and will inform MIDAS adaptations designed to improve intervention fit and effectiveness outcomes.","output":"Improving Healthy Living in Residential Care Facilities: Feasibility, Acceptability, and Appropriateness of Implementing a Multicomponent Intervention for Diabetes Risk Reduction in Adults with Serious Mental Illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic remains a threat to public health.

The literature has shown significant interactions with health disorders, in response to the crisis situation that affects the spouses. However, processes are still unclear, in particular regarding the timing of the affection. This study explored whether different health disorders are observed shortly after dissolution or are delayed, and whether they are short- or long-lasting. We used data from the two waves (2006 and 2010) of the French Health and Professional Lives Survey (SIP) among 8349 individuals aged 25-64 years. Based on three health disorders, we studied 1) their levels in relation to the retrospective histories of union dissolutions; 2) health changes associated with a dissolution occurring between the two waves. We found that individuals who experienced one or multiple union dissolutions had worse self-rated health, more depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. The two latter were more related with a recent dissolution than with distant ones, suggesting an immediate association, yet long-lasting. Self-rated health was related with distant dissolutions only, suggesting a lagged, however also long-lasting association. Experiencing union dissolution between the two waves was linked to a higher probability of the onset of sleep disorders and depressive mood, and of deterioration of self-rated health if it was not the first dissolution. Our study shows that union dissolutions are highly correlated with different poor health measures, in the short and the long run, depending on the health disorder, with cumulative and durable effects.","output":"Health after union dissolution(s): Cumulative and temporal dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Combining non-contrast CT (NCCT), CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP) imaging (referred to as a CT stroke study, CTSS) provides a rapid evaluation of the cerebrovascular axis during acute ischemic stroke. Iodinated contrast-enhanced CT imaging is not without risk, which includes renal injury. If a patient's CTSS identifies vascular pathology, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is often performed within 24-48 h. Such patients may receive multiple administrations of iodinated contrast material over a short time period. OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients who underwent a CTSS and DSA for evaluation of acute ischemic symptoms or for stroke intervention within a 48 h period between August 2012 and December 2014. METHODS We identified 84 patients for inclusion in the analysis. Patients fell into one of two cohorts: AKI, defined as a rise in the serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline, or non-AKI. Clinical parameters included pre- and post-imaging serum creatinine level, time between CTSS and DSA, and type of angiographic procedure (diagnostic vs intervention) performed. RESULTS Four patients (4.7%) experienced AKI, one of whom had baseline renal dysfunction (defined as baseline serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL). The mean difference between baseline and peak creatinine values was found to be significantly greater in patients with AKI than in non-AKI patients (1.65 vs -0.09, respectively; p=0.0008).

Socially isolated older adults were more likely to have more depressive symptoms and higher level of cognitive function. There was also an interaction effect between Internet use and social isolation on depression/cognitive function. The negative effect of social isolation was stronger for older adults who used the Internet less. The moderating effect of Internet use was significant for both males and females. However, among those who used the Internet more, the depression levels of socially isolated male participants were much lower than female participants.

Social media disseminates information and misinformation regarding vaccination. Tracking and analyzing social media vaccine sentiment could better prepare health professionals for vaccination conversations and campaigns. METHODS A real-time big data analytics framework was developed using natural language processing sentiment analysis, a form of artificial intelligence. The framework ingests, processes, and analyzes tweets for sentiment and content themes, such as natural health or personal freedom, in real time. A later dataset evaluated the relationship between Twitter sentiment scores and vaccination rates in the United States. RESULTS The real-time analytics framework showed a widening gap in sentiment with more negative sentiment after vaccine rollout. After rollout, using a static dataset, an increase in positive sentiment was followed by an increase in vaccination. Lag cross-correlation analysis across US regions showed evidence that once all adults were eligible for vaccination, the sentiment score consistently correlated with vaccination rate with a lag of around 1 week. The Granger causality test further demonstrated that tweet sentiment scores may help predict vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS Social media has influenced the COVID-19 response through valuable information and misinformation and distrust. This tool was used to collect and analyze tweets at scale in real time to study sentiment and key terms of interest. Separate tweet analysis showed that vaccination rates tracked regionally with Twitter vaccine sentiment and might forecast changes in vaccine uptake and/or guide targeted social media and vaccination strategies.

Administration of nebulizer therapy has been affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Thus, we also investigated the difference in the prevalence of nebulizer use before and during the pandemic. Methods: Between February and September 2016 and in January 2021, we administered questionnaire surveys on nebulizer treatment for rhinosinusitis to otorhinolaryngologists, who were members of the Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, in Aomori, Saitama, Mie, Fukui, Shiga, Okayama, and Kagoshima prefectures. Results: More than 90% of the otorhinolaryngologists performed nebulizer treatment for rhinosinusitis in 2016. In April 2020 (the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic), the use rate decreased to 20%, but in January 2021, the use rate increased to 60%. Jet nebulizers were the most frequently used type.

RESULTS: All assays performed with a high level of specificity ranging from 96.7% to 99.3%. Sensitivity differed more between the assays, Roche exhibiting the highest sensitivity of 98.7%. The corresponding figures for Abbott, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology were 80.9%, 89.0% and 72.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 assays vary considerably, as well as their ability to fulfil the performance criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction into clinical use in low-prevalent settings, should, therefore, be made with caution.","output":"High-throughput immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 C considerable differences in performance when comparing three methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 has attracted extensive drug searching interets for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although currently several of clinically used old drugs have been repurposed to this new disease for the urgent clinical investigation, there is still great demand for more effective therapies for the anti-infections. Here we report the discovery that an old drug Emetine could potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and displayed virus entry blocking effect in Vero cells at low dose. In addition, Emetine could significantly reduce the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein level and moderately reduce the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) protein level in the M1 polarized THP-1 macrophages. In vivo animal pharmacokinetics (PK) study revealed that Emetine was enriched in the lung tissue and had a long retention time (over 12 h). With 1 mg/kg single oral dose, the effective concentration of Emetine in lung was up to 1.8 M (mice) and 1.6 M (rats) at 12 h, which is over 200-fold higher than the EC(50) of the drug. The potent in vitro antiviral replication efficacy and the high enrichment in target tissue, combining with the well documented safety profiles in human indicate that low dose of Emetine might be a potentially effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection therapy.

Its diagnosis might be challenging. We present two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who presented acutely altered mental status as the main manifestation of multiple strokes. Methods: : Clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of the patients. Results: : Two patients in their sixties were hospitalized with a bilateral pneumonia COVID-19. They developed respiratory failure and were admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and intense medical treatment. They were started on low-molecular-weight heparin since admission. Their laboratory results showed lymphopenia and increased levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Case 1 developed hypofibrinogenemia and presented several cutaneous lesions with biopsy features of thrombotic vasculopathy. Case 2 was performed a CT pulmonary angiogram at ICU showing a bilateral pulmonary embolism. When waking up, both patients were conscious but with a remarkable global altered mental status without focal neurological deficits. A brain MRI revealed multiple acute bilateral ischemic lesions with areas of hemorrhagic transformation in both patients (Case 1: affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes and both occipital lobes;Case 2: affecting both frontal and left occipital lobes). Cardioembolic source and acquired antiphospholipid syndrome were ruled out. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy was suspected as the possible main etiology of the strokes. Conclusion: Acutely altered mental status might be the main manifestation of multiple brain infarctions in critically ill COVID-19 patients. It should be specially considered in those with suspected COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.

Questions included changes made to the trauma service in preparation for the pandemic, modification to clinical practice and expected lasting modifications after the pandemic. RESULTS The response rate was 68.4%. All trauma centres modified their treatment and investigation protocols for the pandemic. Most respondents adopted online platforms for meetings and educational activities and used simulation to prepare for COVID-19-infected trauma patients. The approach to who would intubate trauma patients, which trauma patients should be tested for COVID-19 and who should use N95 ventilators, varied among the sites surveyed.

Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus.

Typical complications not only jeopardise the successful outcome of treatment modalities as a whole; they may result in amputation or even become life-threatening. Polihexanide is an antimicrobial substance which is highly appropriate for use in critically colonised or infected acute and chronic wounds. This finding is based primarily on the broad antimicrobial spectrum and good cell and tissue compatibility of polihexanide, its capability of binding to organic matrix, the low risk of contact sensitisation, and the fact that it promotes wound healing. Furthermore, there has been no conclusive evidence to date of any pathogens developing resistances under the use of polihexanide. SUMMARY Wound infections are special and challenging situations in therapy of acute and chronic wounds. Typical complications are risky not only for therapeutic process but also for amputation and viability of patients. Polihexanide is an exceedingly appropriate antimicrobial substance for using in critical colonised and local infected acute and chronic wounds.

Assessment and treatment of COVID-19 associated hyperinflammation may be key to improve outcomes. It was speculated that in subgroups of patients secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with features of macrophage activation syndrome might drive severe disease trajectories. If confirmed, profound immunosuppressive therapy would be a rationale treatment approach. Over a median observation period of 11 (IQR: 8; 16) days, 19 consecutive confirmed severe COVID-19-patients admitted to our intensive-care-unit were tested for presence of sHLH by two independent experts. HScores and 2004-HLH diagnostic criteria were assessed. Patients were grouped according to short-term clinical courses: discharge from ICU versus ongoing ARDS or death at time of analysis. The median HScore at admission was 157 (IQR: 98;180), without the key clinical triad of HLH, i.e. progressive cytopenia, persistent fever and organomegaly. Independent expert chart review revealed the absence of sHLH in all cases. No patient reached more than 3/6 of modified HLH 2004 criteria. Nevertheless, patients presented hyperinflammation with peripheral neutrophilic signatures (neutrophil/lymphocyte-ratio > 3.5). The latter best paralleled their short-term clinical courses, with declining relative neutrophil numbers prior to extubation (4.4, [IQR: 2.5;6.3]; n = 8) versus those with unfavourable courses (7.6, [IQR: 5.2;31], n = 9).

Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed. The final date of follow-up was March 19, 2020. RESULTS The median age of 101 patients was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-72). All patients were local residents of Wuhan. In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]). Lymphocyte counts were decreased (0.8109/L [patients on hemodialysis] versus 0.9109/L [controls], P=0.02). Comparing patients on hemodialysis with controls, creatine kinase-muscle and brain type, myoglobin, hypersensitive troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin were increased, and the percentage of abnormalities in bilateral lung was higher in computed tomographic scan (82% versus 69%, P=0.15) and unilateral lung was lower (10% versus 27%, P=0.03).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent dog bites and aggression. METHODS: Online databases were searched (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Google Scholar), using the search terms: dog/s, canine, canis, kuri, bite/s, bitten, aggression, attack, death, fatal, mortality, injury/ies, prevention, intervention, for studies between 1960 and 2021. All study designs were considered. Outcomes of interest were the incidence of dog bites or dog aggression. Non-English studies, and those without full-text access were excluded. RESULTS: Forty-three studies met the review criteria, including 15 observational and 27 interventional studies. Fifteen studies investigating dog-control legislation, including leash laws, stray dog control and infringements indicated this can reduce dog bite rates. Breed-specific legislation had less of an effect. Six studies investigating sterilisation, showed while this may reduce dog bites through a reduction in the dog population, the effect on dog aggression was unclear. An alcohol reduction programme showed a significant reduction in dog bite rates in one study. Seven studies assessing educational approaches found that intensive adult-directed education may be effective, with one study showing child-directed education was not effective. Eight studies on dog training (two police-dog related), and six evaluating dog medication or diet were generally low quality and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple strategies including effective engagement with indigenous communities and organisations will be required to reduce dog-bites and other incidents involving dog aggression. This review provides some evidence that legislated dog control strategies reduce dog bite rates. Available evidence suggests greater restrictions should be made for all dogs, rather than based on breed alone. Due to a burden of child injury, protection of children should be a focus of legislation and further investigations. Prevention strategies in children require redirection away from a focus on child-directed education and future research should investigate the effectiveness of engineering barriers and reporting strategies.","output":"Systematic review of dog bite prevention strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic causative SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is still rapid in progression and transmission even after a year. Understanding the viral transmission and impeding the replication process within human cells are considered as the vital point to control and overcome COVID-19 infection. Non-structural Protein 1, one among the proteins initially produced upon viral entry into human cells, instantly binds with the human ribosome and inhibit the host translation process by preventing the mRNA attachment. However, the formation of NSP1 bound Ribosome complex does not affect the viral replication process. NSP1 plays an indispensable role in modulating the host gene expression and completely steals the host cellular machinery. The full-length structure of NSP1 is essential for the activity in the host cell and importantly the loop connecting N and C-terminal domains are reported to play a role in ribosome binding. Due to the unavailability of the experimentally determined full-length structure of NSP1, we have modelled the complete structure using comparative modelling and the stability and conformational behaviour of the modelled structure was evaluated through molecular dynamics simulation. Interestingly, the present study reveals the significance of the inter motif loop to serves as a potential binding site for drug discovery experiments. Further, we have screened the phytochemicals from medicinal plant sources since they were used for several hundred years that minimizes the traditional drug development time. Among the 5638 phytochemicals screened against the functionally associated binding site of NSP1, the best five phytochemicals shown high docking score of -9.63 to -8.75 kcal/mol were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations to understand the binding affinity and stability of the complex. Prime MM-GBSA analysis gave the relative binding free energies for the top five compounds (dihydromyricetin, 10-demethylcephaeline, dihydroquercetin, pseudolycorine and tricetin) in the range of -45.17 kcal/mol to -37.23 kcal/mol, indicating its binding efficacy in the predicted binding site of NSP1. The density functional theory calculations were performed for the selected five phytochemicals to determine the complex stability and chemical reactivity. Thus, the identified phytochemicals could further be used as effective anti-viral agents to overcome COVID-19 and as well as several other viral infections.","output":"Modelling studies reveal the importance of the C-terminal inter motif loop of NSP1 as a promising target site for drug discovery and screening of potential phytochemicals to combat SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has been gaining recognition as a symptom of COVID-19, but its clinical utility has not been well defined. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the clinical utility of identifying OD in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and determine an estimate of the frequency of OD amongst these patients. METHODS: PubMed was searched up to 1 August 2020. Meta-analysis A included studies if they compared the frequency of OD in COVID-19 positive patients (proven by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) to COVID-19 negative controls. Meta-analysis B included studies if they described the frequency of OD in COVID-19 positive patients and if OD symptoms were explicitly asked in questionnaires or interviews or if smell tests were performed. RESULTS: The pooled frequency of OD in COVID-19 positive patients (17,401 patients, 60 studies) was 0.56 (0.47-0.64) but differs between detection via smell testing (0.76 [0.51-0.91]) and survey/questionnaire report (0.53 [0.45-0.62]), although not reaching statistical significance (p = 0.089).

Omics-based studies suggest gut dysbiosis and reduced microbiome diversity in critical conditions. However, the landscape of gut microbial metabolites is still to be outlined, not to mention the interplay correlation between the metabolome and gut microbiome in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between serum and fecal levels of AMM and compare them with the composition of gut microbiota in critically ill patients in the acute and chronic stages. METHODS: In this prospective observational pilot study, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome and the AMM spectrum across two distinct subgroupsacute critical ill (ACI) patients with nosocomial pneumonia and chronically critically ill (CCI) patients (9 subjects each group)as well as performed comparison with 23 healthy volunteers. The AMM levels for each patient were measured using GC-MS in simultaneously taken serum and fecal samples (SFS). These parameters were compared with 16S rRNA fecal microbiome profiles. RESULTS: The observed proportions of bacterial taxa suggest a significant gut dysbiosis in the ACI and the CCI patients. Stronger imbalance in microbiome composition and dynamics observed in the ACI patients compared to the CCI ones resonates with a higher severity in the former group. The total levels of AMM in serum samples were higher for the ACI patients than for the CCI patients (3.7 (1.4C6.3) and 1.1 (1.0C1.6) M, respectively; p = 0.0003). The qualitative composition of the SFS was also altered.

Our aim is to provide evaluation of a virtual platform for a fully integrated curriculum to provide future guidance in teaching methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used summative assessments and course evaluations from pre- and post-transition from in-person to virtual delivery of educational content to measure the impacts of this transition on student performance and perceptions. Additionally, we surveyed students about their in-person versus online educational preferences. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in student knowledge acquisition as assessed by weighted averages of summative assessments when comparing an in-person to a virtual educational platform. While the transition to virtual learning was initially well-received by students, our studied cohorts gave lower scores for the overall learning experience after prolonged virtual learning (p < 0.001). Students had a strong preference that anatomy and other group sessions should be delivered in-person. There was no strong preference whether other learning modalities should be given in-person or virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Although student knowledge acquisition remained stable on a virtual platform, the student learning experience varied. We recommend that when returning to a new normal after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, sessions that require 3-dimensional or group learning should remain in-person, while other educational activities may be offered on a virtual platform and that, whenever virtual learning is employed, attention be paid to ensuring ongoing social and academic engagement between learners and faculty.","output":"A New Normal: Assessment Outcomes and Recommendations for Virtual Versus In-Person Curricula in Post-COVID-19 Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The physiological and prognostical significance of accessory and expiratory muscles activation is unknown during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). We hypothesized that, in patients experiencing weaning failure, accessory and expiratory muscles are activated to cope with an increased respiratory workload. Purpose To describe accessory and expiratory muscle activation non-invasively by surface electromyography (sEMG) during an SBT and to assess differences in electrical activity (EA) of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles in successful vs. failing weaning patients. Methods Intubated patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h undergoing an SBT were enrolled in a medical and surgical third-level ICU of the University Teaching Hospital. Baseline characteristics and physiological variables were recorded in a crossover physiologic prospective clinical study. Results Of 37 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, 29 (78%) patients successfully passed the SBT. Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) was higher in patients who failed SBT compared with the successfully weaned patients at baseline and over time (group-by-time interaction p < 0.001). EA of both the diaphragm (EAdisurf) and of accessory muscles (ACCsurf) was higher in failure patients compared with success (group-by-time interaction p = 0.0174 and p < 0.001, respectively). EA of expiratory muscles (ESPsurf) during SBT increased more in failure than in weaned patients (group-by-time interaction p < 0.0001). Conclusion Non-invasive respiratory muscle monitoring by sEMG was feasible during SBT. Respiratory muscles EA increased during SBT, regardless of SBT outcome, and patients who failed the SBT had a higher increase of all the inspiratory muscles EA compared with the patients who passed the SBT.

Around 100 million people in Brazil (50% of the inhabitants) are users of social media networks C almost half of the countrys population. Most of the information on the Internet is unregulated, and its quality remains questionable. METHODS: In this study, we examine the main characteristics of misinformation published on the topic. We analysed 232 pieces of misinformation published by the Brazilian fact-checking service Agncia Lupa. The following aspects of each news item were analysed: a) In what social media has it circulated?; b) What is the content classification, sentiment and type of misinformation?; d) Are there recurrent themes in the sample studied? RESULTS: Most were published on Facebook (76%), followed by WhatsApp, with 10% of total cases. Half of the stories (47%) are classified as real-life, that is, the focus is on everyday situations, or circumstances involving people. Regarding the type of misinformation, there is a preponderance of fabricated content, with 53% of total, followed by false context (34%) and misleading content (13%). Wrong information was mostly published in text format (47%). We found that 92.9% of misinformation classified as fabricated content are health tips, and 88.9% of virtual scams are also fabricated. CONCLUSION: Brazilian media and science communicators must understand the main characteristics of misinformation in social media about COVID-19, so that they can develop attractive, up-to-date and evidence-based content that helps to increase health literacy and counteract the spread of false information.","output":"Misinformation on social networks during the novel coronavirus pandemic: a quali-quantitative case study of Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective Healthcare workers, particularly those working in departments that provide care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are at a higher risk of this contagious disease than those who work in other departments.

Methods A multi-center cross-sectional survey on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse was conducted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers. Results The data of 745 eligible healthcare workers from 15 hospitals were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared to the basic characteristics of the participants to determine the association. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants had depressive symptoms, while 348 (46.7%) had anxiety symptoms. Age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms.

This paper will discuss the reporting data of children and the public health departments activities against the background of the restrictions of school and leisure time offers as well as sports and club activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reporting data from Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, were obtained using a SURVStat query for the calendar weeks 10/2020C28/2021 and from SURVNet (until 30 June 2021). Contact persons (CP) of SARS-CoV?2 positive persons from schools and daycare centers were screened for SARS-CoV?2 by PCR test. These results and those of rapid antigen testing, which has been mandatory for schoolchildren since April 2021, are presented. RESULTS: Until Easter break, the age-related seven-day incidence values per 100,000 for children 14 years of age and younger were lower than the overall incidence; it was only higher after rapid antigen-testing was mandatory for schoolchildren. Most children with SARS-CoV?2 had no or mild symptoms; hospitalization was rarely required and no deaths occurred. Contact tracing in schools and daycare centers found no positive contacts in most cases and rarely more than two. Larger outbreaks did not occur. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV?2 infections in children appear to be less frequent and much less severe than in adults. Hygiene rules and contact management have proven themselves effective during times with high incidences in the local population without mandatory rapid antigen testing C and even with a high proportion of variants of concern (alpha and delta variants) in Germany.

Previous studies revealed ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) exhibits Cd tolerance, and may be useful as a potential hyperaccumulator because of its wide distribution. In this study, the physiological and transcriptional responses of two ryegrass cultivars [i.e., high (LmHC) and low (LmLC) Cd tolerance] to Cd stress were investigated and compared. The Cd tolerance of LmHC was greater than that of LmLC at various Cd concentrations. The uptake of Evans blue dye revealed that Cd-induced root cell mortality was higher in LmLC than in LmHC after a 12-h Cd treatment. Furthermore, the content and influx rate of Cd in LmLC roots were greater than in LmHC roots under Cd stress conditions. The RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR data indicated that the Cd transport regulatory genes (ABCG37, ABCB4, NRAMP4, and HMA5) were differentially expressed between the LmLC and LmHC roots. This expression-level diversity may contribute to the differences in the Cd accumulation and translocation between LmLC and LmHC. These findings may help clarify the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying ryegrass responses to Cd toxicity.

Though diaphragmatic dystonia has been described in some neurodegenerative diseases, it has not been in HD. In general, little published data exists on overall respiratory function and diaphragmatic movement in HD. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 58-year-old male with HD, presenting with progressive dyspnea over 1 year and an accompanying choking sensation upon awakening. Cardiac evaluation with echocardiogram and dobutamine stress test revealed only left ventricular hypertrophy. Family history includes HD in his mother, diagnosed at autopsy age 72;an older brother with HD onset at 53 that died at 62;a maternal aunt with onset in her 50s that died in her 70s. His maternal grandmother and 2 other family members also had involuntary movements believed to be chorea. Most died from respiratory complications. Physical exam showed adequate air entry bilaterally, with clear breath sounds and decreased chest wall expansion. No abdominal paradox or diaphragm dysfunction was appreciated in supine or seated position. On walking oximetry, he became tachypneic and dyspneic after 2 minutes of walking, prompting him to stop. His saturation on room air did not drop below 96%. Heart rate increased to 110 beats per minute. Laboratory panel revealed hemoglobin 13.8 g/dl. A venous blood gas revealed pH 7.38 and pCO2 of 49.A dynamic digital chest radiography (DDR) was performed during two tidal breaths and a forced inspiratory and expiratory maneuver. This revealed decreased bilateral lung inflation. Diaphragmatic contours were elevated bilaterally with a mildly reduced excursion. During the breathing cycle multiple independent diaphragmatic contractions were appreciated on forced inspiration and exhalation resulting in paradoxical motion and dyssynchrony. There was exaggerated use of accessory muscles in the shoulder girdle as a compensatory mechanism. Spasms in the upper airway were also noted throughout the test. Because of covid restrictions, the patient is awaiting pulmonary function tests. DISCUSSION: DDR uniquely provides the opportunity to interrogate respiratory physiology and identify diaphragmatic abnormalities, such as coordination impairments and dyssynchrony compared to static chest radiography;with lower levels of radiation as used in video fluoroscopy. As previously described1, we suggest that the understanding of dyspnea in patients with neurologic disease is enhanced using DDR. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of diaphragmatic chorea in a patient with HD using DDR. Future studies are needed to better understand this newly recognized phenomenon of diaphragmatic discoordination and its association with shortness of breath.

AD, a degenerative brain disease, is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid beta (A) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles disposition. Some studies have recently demonstrated that A and tau cannot fully explain the pathophysiological development of AD and that metabolic disease factors, such as insulin, adiponectin, and antioxidants, are important for the sporadic onset of nongenetic AD. Obesity prevention and treatment can be an efficacious and safe approach to AD prevention. Adiponectin is a benign adipokine that sensitizes the insulin receptor signaling pathway and suppresses inflammation. It has been shown to be inversely correlated with adipose tissue dysfunction and may enhance the risk of AD because a range of neuroprotection adiponectin mechanisms is related to AD pathology alleviation. In this study, we summarize the recent progress that addresses the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of adiponectin in AD. Furthermore, we review recent studies on the diverse medications of adiponectin that could possibly be related to AD treatment, with a focus on their association with adiponectin. A better understanding of the neuroprotection roles of adiponectin will help clarify the precise underlying mechanism of AD development and progression.","output":"Adiponectin: The Potential Regulator and Therapeutic Target of Obesity and Alzheimer's Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapies have emerged to treat diseases by selectively modulating a patients immune response. Although the roles of T and B cells in adaptive immunity have been well studied, it remains difficult to select targets for immunotherapeutic strategies. Because human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) peptides activate CD4+ T cells and regulate B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, these peptide antigens represent a class of potential immunotherapy targets and biomarkers. To better understand the molecular basis of how HLA-II antigen presentation is involved in disease progression and treatment, systematic HLA-II peptidomics combined with multiomic analyses of diverse cell types in healthy and diseased states is required. For this reason, MS-based innovations that facilitate investigations into the interplay between disease pathologies and the presentation of HLA-II peptides to CD4+ T cells will aid in the development of patient-focused immunotherapies.","output":"MS-Based HLA-II Peptidomics Combined With Multiomics Will Aid the Development of Future Immunotherapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is regarded as an acute, resolving infection followed by the development of protective immunity, recent systematic literature review documents evidence for often highly prolonged shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory and faecal samples, periodic recurrence of PCR positivity in a substantial proportion of individuals and increasingly documented instances of reinfection associated with a lack of protective immunity. This pattern of infection is quite distinct from the acute/resolving nature of other human pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 furthermore occurs irrespective of disease severity or development of virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 possesses an intensely structured RNA genome, an attribute shared with other human and veterinary coronaviruses and with other mammalian RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus. These are capable of long-term persistence, possibly through poorly understood RNA structure-mediated effects on innate and adaptive host immune responses. The assumption that resolution of COVID-19 and the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies represents virus clearance and protection from reinfection, implicit for example in the susceptibleCinfectedCrecovered (SIR) model used for epidemic prediction, should be rigorously re-evaluated.","output":"Understanding the outcomes of COVID-19 C does the current model of an acute respiratory infection really fit?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diet is a powerful evolutionary force for species adaptation and diversification.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract to some extent. Rapid structural mutations have increased the virulence and infectivity of the virus drastically. One such mutated strain known as the UK variant has caused many deaths in the United Kingdom. HYPOTHESIS: Among several indigenous natural ingredients used for prevention and cure of many diseases, the catechins have been reported for their antiviral activity, even against SARS-CoV-2. Characteristic mutations present on the spike protein have presented the newer strain its enhanced infectivity. The spike protein helps the virus bind to ACE2 receptor of the host cell and hence is a drug target. Catechins have been reported for their entry-inhibitory activity against several viruses. METHOD: In this study, we performed molecular docking of different catechins with the wild and mutant variants of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The stability of the best docked complexes was validated using molecular dynamics simulation. RESULTS: The in-silico studies show that the catechins form favourable interactions with the spike protein and can potentially impair its function. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) showed the best binding among the catechins against both the strains. Both the protein-ligand complexes were stable throughout the simulation time frame. CONCLUSION: The outcomes should encourage further exploration of the antiviral activity of EGCG against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","output":"Entry-inhibitory role of catechins against SARS-CoV-2 and its UK variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, students, families, and educators have faced unprecedented challenges.

RECENT FINDINGS SAP-E sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030. A recent mapping of stroke care in Europe has documented massive inequalities and even in high-income European countries access to reperfusion therapy and mortality after ischaemic stroke varies significantly. Organized stroke care providing stroke unit care and access to reperfusion therapies reduces mortality and long-term disability. Stroke prevention and care are highly cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organized care, diverged attention from stroke and necessitated a novel approach to the implementation program because of the continued need for social distancing and reduced travelling. Consequently, meetings, training and engagement will be handled by online resources. SUMMARY Stroke can be prevented and treated but there remain massive inequalities in Europe. SAP-E has set targets for development of stroke care. COVID-19 pandemic has led to further challenges for stroke care and implementation of the Action Plan will rely on online meetings and resources as it is yet unforeseeable when things will return to normal.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one's mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or by providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","output":"Rise in Use of Digital Mental Health Tools and Technologies in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the obstetrics and gynaecology residency program and trainees have been affected by the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional explorative survey using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 40 questions that were subdivided into 4 subjects; workload, specialist training aspects in obstetrics and gynaecology, health and safety of the trainee and womens health and maternal health issues. Inclusion criteria consisted of being a trainee in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ObGyn) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe or trainees who had recently finished their training during the time of the outbreak. Taking part in the survey was voluntary. The questionnaire was shared on the website of the European Network for Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ENTOG), ENTOG social media, in the ENTOG-newsletter and through the national representatives of ENTOG. RESULTS: 110 ObGyn trainees from 25 different countries responded to the questionnaire. Almost all trainees (95%, N = 105) reported an effect on their training due to COVID-19 pandemic. Training was interrupted in 21% of cases (n = 23). Trainees observed a decrease in educational activities or lectures and a decrease in number of patients. The possibility of training surgical skills decreased, because 67% (N = 74) trainees reported that surgeries were cancelled. Trainees expressed concerns about reaching the goals of their ObGyn specialist training in 60% (n = 66) of cases. A decrease in workload was experienced during the first COVID-19 wave in Europe by 60% (n = 66) of trainees. On average these trainees worked 33% less hours compared to a normal workweek. Although 22% (n = 24) were expected to be available continuously for 24 hours a day and 7 days a week for unscheduled duties, 15% (n = 16) were deployed to work on special COVID-units. Concerning preparation, 45% of the trainees (n = 50) had not received any training for treating COVID-positive patients. Trainees claimed to have enough personal protective equipment (PPE), although problems were reported. Any form of psychosocial support was arranged for 65% of trainees (n = 71) by the hospital or department. The results of the survey suggest that obstetric care was not affected much (92% (n = 102) of the respondents said at least necessary care continued) while patients in need for reproductive medicine were affected the most; out of the 110 departments 58% (n = 60) were closed and 35% (n = 36) reduced their activities. Access to family planning and benign gynaecology were also significantly reduced; 77% and 87% respectively of the departments were less accessible or only open to emergency cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous effect on the ObGyn training in Europe. Exposure to learning opportunities, surgeries and teaching has been decreased during the outbreak and may result in a decrease in quality of care provided to women in the future if impairment of training is not recovered.","output":"The influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on European trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology: a survey of the impact on training and trainee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2009, a novel A(H1N1) influenza virus emerged with rapid human-to-human spread and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century.

however, this association remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the relationship between serum amylase activity and the CNV of AMY1/2A/2B with the occurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Chinese adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anthropometry, metabolic risk factors, and serum amylase activity were assessed in 560 subjects (260 MetS patients; 300 healthy controls). AMY1/2A/2B CNs were evaluated using the highly sensitive droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: The serum total, pancreatic, and salivary amylase activity, but not the AMY1/2A/2B CNs, was significantly lower in MetS patients than that in the control subjects. Patients <45 y had a lower AMY1 CN, compared to that in healthy controls. Low serum amylase activity was significantly associated with high MetS prevalence (p < 0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, serum amylase activity was a significant diagnostic indicator for MetS. The diagnostic value of total amylase was second only to that of -glutamyl transpeptidase; it was higher than that of alanine aminotransferase and uric acid. CONCLUSION: Low serum amylase activity was significantly associated with increased risk of MetS in Chinese adults. Therefore, amylase could be a potential biomarker for predicting MetS.","output":"Association of Serum Amylase Activity and the Copy Number Variation of AMY1/2A/2B with Metabolic Syndrome in Chinese Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Adolescents are vulnerable to short, insufficient sleep stemming from a combined preference for late bedtimes and early school start times, and also circadian disruptions from frequent shifts in sleep schedules (i.e., social jetlag). These sleep disruptions are associated with poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted education nationwide, including changes in instructional formats and school schedules. With data from the Nationwide Education and Sleep in TEens During COVID (NESTED) study, we examined whether sleep variability and social jetlag (SJL) during the pandemic associate with mental health. METHODS: Analyses included online survey data from 4767 students (grades 6-12, 46% female, 36% non-White, 87% high school). For each weekday, participants identified if they attended school in person (IP), online-scheduled synchronous classes (O/S), online-no scheduled classes (asynchronous, O/A), or no school. Students reported bedtimes (BT) and wake times (WT) for each instructional format and for weekends/no school days. Sleep opportunity (SlpOpp) was calculated from BT and WT. Weekday night-to-night SlpOpp variability was calculated with mean square successive differences. SJL was calculated as the difference between the average sleep midpoint on free days (O/A, no school, weekends) versus scheduled days (IP, O/S). Participants also completed the PROMIS Pediatric Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Short Form. Data were analyzed with hierarchical linear regressions controlling for average SlpOpp, gender, and school-level (middle vs high school). RESULTS: Mean reported symptoms of anxiety (60.0 9.1; 14%R70) and depression (63.4 10.2; 22%R70) fell in the at-risk range. Shorter average SlpOpp (mean=8.31.2hrs) was correlated with higher anxiety (r=-.10) and depression (r=-.11; ps<.001) T-scores. Greater SlpOpp variability was associated with higher anxiety (B=.71 [95%CI=.41-1.01, p<.001) and depression (B=.67 [.33-1.00], p<.001) T-scores. Greater SJL (mean=1.81.2hrs; 94% showed a delay in midpoint) was associated with higher anxiety (B=.36 [.12-.60], p<.001) and depression (B=.77 [.50-1.03], p<.001) T-scores. CONCLUSION: In the context of system-wide education changes during COVID-19, students on average reported at-risk levels of anxiety and depression symptoms which were associated with greater variability in sleep opportunity across school days and greater social jetlag. Our findings suggest educators and policymakers should consider these sleep-mental health associations when developing instructional formats and school schedules during and post-pandemic.

Whilst such efforts aim to slow or stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they have also resulted in increased food insecurity, whether due to reduced incomes or increased food prices. This is the first paper to track food insecurity and its determinants during the pandemic using multi-country and multi-wave evidence. Using data from 11 countries and up to 6 waves of High-Frequency Phone Survey data (household-level surveys) on COVID-19 and its impacts, we use a fixed-effects linear probability model to investigate the socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity during the pandemic for each country using household-level data over multiple waves. We control for socioeconomic characteristics including gender and education of the household head; income and poverty status of the households during the pandemic; safety nets in the form of cash and food assistance; coping strategies adopted by households; and price effects of major food items. Our findings suggest that cash safety nets appear to have been more effective than food in terms of reducing food insecurity during the pandemic; and that those particularly hard hit are female headed-households (highest in Malawi: 0.541, 95% CI 0.516, 0.569; lowest in Cambodia: 0.023, 95% CI 0.022, 0.024), the less educated (highest in Djibouti: ? 0.232, 95% CI ? 0.221, ? 0.244; lowest in Nigeria: 0.006, 95% CI ? 0.005, ? 0.007), and poorer households (highest in Mali: 0.382, 95% CI 0.364, 0.402; lowest in Chad: 0.135, 95% CI 0.129, 0.142). In line with the existing literature, our results show that, even controlling for income loss and poverty status, those households who had to borrow rather than rely on savings had a higher probability of suffering from food insecurity. Distinct differences in the efficacy of safety nets across the 11 countries, and the differential impact of the pandemic on different groups within societies, suggest in-depth country-specific studies are needed to understand why some countries have coped better than others. Our paper highlights the importance of improving household resilience to future systemic crises, and using evidence-based best practice in the design of relevant policy instruments.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity using multiple waves of high frequency household surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Several parameters driving the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain unclear, including age-specific differences in infectivity and susceptibility, and the contribution of inapparent infections to transmission Robust estimates of key time-to-event distributions remain scarce as well Methods We collected individual records for 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 contacts identified by contact tracing and monitoring over the period from January 13 to April 02, 2020 in Hunan Province, China We provide descriptive statistics of the characteristics of cases and their close contacts;we fitted distributions to time-to-key-events distributions and infectiousness profile over time;and we used generalized linear mixed model to estimate risk factors for susceptibility and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 Results We estimated the mean serial interval at 5 5 days (95%CI -5 0, 19 9) and the mean generation time at 5 5 days (95%CI 1 7, 11 6) The infectiousness was estimated to peak 1 8 days before symptom onset, with 95% of transmission events occurring between 7 6 days before and 7 3 days after the date of symptom onset The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated to be 62 5% We estimated that at least 3 5% of cases were generated asymptomatic individuals SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility was not significantly different between working-age adults (15-59 years old) and other age groups (0-14 years old: p-value=0 16;60 years and over: p-value=0 33), whilst susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated to increase with age (p-value=0 03) In addition, transmission risk was higher for household contacts (p-value&lt;0 001), decreased for higher generations within a cluster (second generation: odds ratio=0 13, p-value&lt;0 001;generations 3-4: odds ratio=0 05, p-value&lt;0 001, relative to generation 1), and decreased for infectors with a larger number of contacts (p-value=0 04) Interpretation Our findings warn of the possible relevant contribution of children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission When lockdown interventions are in place, we found that odds of transmission are highest in the household setting but, with the relaxation of interventions, other settings (including schools) could bear a higher risk of transmission Moreover, the estimated relevant fraction of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission highlight the importance of large-scale testing, contact tracing activities, and the use of personnel protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic Key words: transmissibility, risk factors, contact tracing, coronavirus","output":"Infectivity, susceptibility, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission under intensive contact tracing in Hunan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I'd like to acknowledge that the writing of the various articles of this issue was undertaken before the eruption of the COVID 19 global health crisis, subsequently interrupted by it, and then resumed during the slow recovery.

METHODS: A 29-question anonymous online survey was sent by e-mail to members of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the Italian Breast Cancer Study Group on April 3, 2020. Only medical oncologists (both those in training and specialists) were invited to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: Out of 165 responding oncologists, 121 (73.3.%) worked in breast units. In the (neo)adjuvant setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted weekly paclitaxel (68.5% v 93.9%) and a dose-dense schedule for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (43% v 58.8%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the metastatic setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted first-line weekly paclitaxel for HER2-positive disease (41.8% v 53.9%) or CDK4/6 inhibitors for luminal tumors with less-aggressive characteristics (55.8% v 80.0%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. A significant change was also observed in delaying the timing for monitoring therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors, assessing treatment response with imaging tests, and flushing central venous devices. Clinical research and scientific activities were reduced in 80.3% and 80.1% of respondents previously implicated in these activities, respectively.

Changes to current anaesthetic practice, recommended recently, such as the use of flow monitoring in high risk patients, are already beginning to have an impact in reducing complications but not mortality [1]. Better understanding of the patho-physiology should help improve management even further. Analysis of selected individual clinical trials has been used to illustrate particular areas of patho-physiology and how changes in practice have improved outcome. There is physiological support for the importance of achieving an appropriate rate of oxygen delivery (DO2), particularly following induction of anaesthesia. It is suggested that ensuring adequate DO2 during anaesthesia will avoid development of oxygen debt and hence obviate the need to induce a high, compensatory, DO2 in the post-operative period. In contrast to the usual assumptions underlying strategies requiring a global increase in blood flow [1] by a stroke volume near maximization strategy, blood flow control actually resides entirely at the tissues not at the heart. This is important as the starting point for understanding failed circulatory control as indicated by 'volume dependency'. Local adjustments in blood flow at each individual organ - auto-regulation - normally ensure the appropriate local rate of oxygen supply, i.e. local DO2. Inadequate blood volume leads to impairment of the regulation of blood flow, particularly in the individual tissues with least capable auto-regulatory capability. As demonstrated by many studies, inadequate blood flow first occurs in the gut, brain and kidney. The inadequate blood volume which occurs with induction of anaesthesia is not due to blood volume loss, but probably results from redistribution due to veno-dilation. The increase in venous capacity renders the existing blood volume inadequate to maintain venous return and pre-load. Blood volume shifted to the veins will, necessarily, also reduce the arterial volume. As a result stroke volume and cardiac output fall below normal with little or no change in peripheral resistance. The resulting pre-load dependency is often successfully treated with colloid infusion and, in some studies, 'inotropic' agents, particularly in the immediate post-operative phase. Treatment during the earliest stage of anaesthesia can avoid the build up of oxygen debt and may be supplemented by drugs which maintain or restore venous tone, such as phenylephrine; an alternative to volume expansion. Interpretation of circulatory patho-physiology during anaesthesia confirms the need to sustain appropriate oxygen delivery. It also supports reduction or even elimination of supplementary crystalloid maintenance infusion, supposedly to replace the \\"mythical\\" third space loss. As a rational evidence base for future research it should allow for further improvements in anaesthetic management.","output":"Clarification of the circulatory patho-physiology of anaesthesia - implications for high-risk surgical patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged towards the end of 2019.

Despite improvements in survival by using acute non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to treat patients with exacerbations of COPD complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF), these patients are at high risk of readmission and further life-threatening events, including death. Recent studies suggested that NIV at home can reduce readmissions, but in a small proportion of patients, and with a high level of expertise. Other studies, however, do not show any benefit of home NIV. This could be related to the fact that respiratory failure in patients with stable COPD and their response to mechanical ventilation are influenced by several pathophysiological factors which frequently coexist in the same patient to varying degrees. These pathophysiological factors might influence the success of home NIV in stable COPD, thus long-term NIV specifically adapted to a patients phenotype is likely to improve prognosis, reduce readmission to hospital, and prevent death. In view of this conundrum, Rescue2-monitor (R2M), an open-label, prospective randomized, controlled study performed in patients with hypercapnic COPD post-AHRF, will investigate the impact of the quality of nocturnal NIV on the readmission-free survival. The primary objective is to show that any of 3 home NIV strategies (rescue, non-targeted, and targeted) will improve readmission-free survival in comparison to no-home NIV. The targeted group of patients will receive a treatment with personalized (targeted) ventilation settings and extensive monitoring. Furthermore, the influence of comorbidities typical for COPD patients, such as cardiac insufficiency, OSA, or associated asthma, on ventilation outcomes will be taken into consideration and reasons for non-inclusion of patients will be recorded in order to evaluate the percentage of ventilated COPD patients that are screening failures.

DESIGN: Pilot study involving phacoemulsification cataract surgery on enucleated porcine eyes by experienced ophthalmologists in an ophthalmic operating theatre. PARTICIPANTS: Two ophthalmic surgical teams. METHODS: Standardized phacoemulsification of porcine eyes by two ophthalmologists accompanied by an assistant. Fluorescein incorporated into phacoemulsification irrigation fluid identifying microdroplets and spatter. Contamination documented using a single-lens reflex camera with a 532 nm narrow bandpass (fluorescein) filter, in-conjunction with a wide-field blue light and flat horizontal laser beam (wavelength 532 nm). Quantitative image analysis using Image-J software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microdroplet and spatter contamination from cataract phacoemulsification. RESULTS: With phacoemulsification instruments fully within the eye, spatter contamination was limited to <10 cm. Insertion and removal of the phacoemulsification needle and bimanual irrigation/aspiration, with irrigation active generated spatter on the surgeons' gloves and gown extending to >16 cm below the neckline in surgeon 1 and > 5.5 cm below the neckline of surgeon 2. A small tear in the phacoemulsification irrigation sleeve, presented a worse-case scenario the greatest spatter. No contamination above the surgeons' neckline nor contamination of assistant occurred.

This study evaluated the lipid composition of asthenozoospermic and normozoospermic spermatozoa, and identified the exact lipid species that correlated with sperm motility. METHODS A total of 12 infertile asthenozoospermia patients and 12 normozoospermia subjects with normal sperm motility values were tested for semen volume, sperm concentration, count, motility, vitality and morphology. High-coverage targeted lipidomics with 25 individual lipid classes was performed to analyze the sperm lipid components and establish the exact lipid species that correlated with sperm motility. RESULTS A total of 25 individual lipid classes and 479 lipid molecular species were identified and quantified. Asthenozoospermic spermatozoa showed an increase in the level of four lipid classes, including Cho, PE, LPI and GM3. A total of 48 lipid molecular species were significantly altered between normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic spermatozoa. Furthermore, the levels of total GM3 and six GM3 molecular species, which were altered in normozoospermic spermatozoa versus asthenozoospermic spermatozoa, were inversely correlated with sperm progressive and total motility.

Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3 chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity.

Here, we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, nonspecific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance, if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness.

To facilitate BToV detection, a reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay was developed that targets the BToV M gene with high specificity and reproducibility. The assay has a limit of detection of 23 copies/L. Out of 69 diarrheic fecal samples from yaks collected on six farms in Tibet and Sichuan provinces in China, 11.59% (8/69) tested positive for BToV using this assay. The full-length spike (S) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) genes of three positive samples were subsequently sequenced. Notably, an identical recombination event was identified in the S1 subunit of the S protein of three isolates. All of the HE genes were found to belong to genotype III and shared the same unique aa variation (P44S) in the esterase domain. This study is the first confirmation of BToV in yaks and the first report of an S gene recombination event in BToV.

This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to win. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment.

OBJECTIVE To identify whether there are amino-acid residues common to the epitopes of the known enhancing human monoclonal antibodies (MAb), and to provide a structural model for this functional region present on the HIV envelope. Since our model predicts that this region is involved in the association of gp120 with gp41, this association was monitored for each mutant. DESIGN The binding of enhancing human MAb to point and deletion mutations within the enhancing domain was analyzed by two methods. The first analyzed binding to mutants expressed in COS cells: the second quantified the binding of four enhancing human MAb to each mutant gp160 versus wild-type control by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). METHODS Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce specific deletions and point mutants, which were expressed in COS cells. Binding of MAb 50-69 and V3-loop MAb 5F7 were visualized in the wild-type and each of the mutant constructs by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative evaluation of enhancing human MAb binding to each mutant versus wild-type was performed by ELISA. A model for the enhancing domain and its relationship to gp120 association with gp41 was provided by molecular dynamics and ligand docking methods. RESULTS All available enhancing human MAb known to bind to the principal immunodominant region of gp41 were unable to bind to deletions involving the disulfide loop, which in our molecular model provided the primary association site between gp120 and gp41. Point mutations in the loop blocked this association, but had a quantitatively smaller effect on the binding of the enhancing human MAb. A conservative W596Y mutation completely blocked the binding of all human MAb, but had no effect on gp120-gp41 association. CONCLUSIONS A variety of mutations within the primary C'-ADE domain inhibit binding of enhancing human MAb as well as blocking the association of gp120 and gp41. A conservative W596Y mutation blocks binding of all enhancing human MAb with retention of gp120-gp41 association. These data are important to the design of vaccines in which the primary enhancing epitope is disarmed to prevent the subsequent induction of an amnestic response that could lead to viral enhancement of infection. The retention of the gp120-gp41 association is postulated to yield an immunogen similar to natural infection for both subunit and genetic vaccines.","output":"Inactivation of a common epitope responsible for the induction of antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires host-expressed TMPRSS2 to facilitate the viral spike (S) protein priming. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that Mg treatment leads to DNA methylation changes in TMPRSS2. Methods: This study is nested within the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT), a double-blind 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 250 participants from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Target doses for both Mg and placebo arms were personalized. Results: We found that 12-week of personalized Mg treatment significantly increased 5-mC methylation at cg16371860 (TSS1500, promoter) by 7.2% compared to placebo arm (decreased by 0.1%) in those aged < 65 years old. The difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex and baseline methylation as well as FDR correction (FDR-adjusted P=0.014). Additionally, Mg treatment significantly reduced 5-hmC level at cg26337277 (close proximity to TSS200 and 5'UTR, promoter) by 2.3% compared to increases by 7.1% in the placebo arm after adjusting for covariates in those aged < 65 years old (P=0.003). The effect remained significant at FDR of 0.10 (adjusted P value=0.088). Conclusion: Among individuals aged younger than 65 years with the Ca:Mg intake ratios equal to or over 2.6, reducing Ca:Mg ratios to around 2.3 increased 5-mC modifications (i.e. cg16371860) and reduced 5-hmC modifications (i.e. cg26337277) in the TMPRSS2 gene.

There are limited data available on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hematological malignancies with more than 60 days of follow-up. This study describes the clinical characteristics, including multiple recurrences of COVID-19, in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during 69 days of follow-up. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old female was admitted to hospital isolation after being infected with COVID-19 as part of a family cluster on January 30, 2020. Apart from SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, laboratory results revealed lymphocytosis of uncertain etiology and abnormal distribution of T lymphocytes. On blood smears, small blue lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm were observed, and the presence of high levels of circulating clonal B cells was also demonstrated by flow cytometry. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and CLL. Among her family members, she had the highest viral loads and the fastest progression on lung injury and developed severe pneumonia. Serological results showed she had both 2019-nCoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; however, only IgG antibodies were detected in her husband's plasma. Results: A combination regimen of antiviral therapy and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the early stage seemed to be effective for treating CLL and SARS-Cov-2 infection. Because of the low humoral immune response, the CLL patient could not effectively clear the SARS-Cov-2 infection and suffered from recurrence twice during the 69-day follow-up. Conclusion: In CLL, a neoplastic antigen-specific B-cell clone proliferates, and the progeny cells accumulate and outgrow other B cells, leading to immune deficiency. Considering the low humoral immune response and ineffective clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in CLL patients, the follow-up and home quarantine period should be extended. We need further studies to clarify suspending or continuing CLL therapy during COVID infection. For those patients who are prone to progression to severe disease, administering humoral immunity therapies can help to prevent disease progression and quickly meet the cure criteria.","output":"Low Humoral Immune Response and Ineffective Clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in a COVID-19 Patient With CLL During a 69-Day Follow-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing global pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is in the crucial stage.

Therefore, an effort is made to develop a system that can enhance safety and check unwanted viruses. Although the complete specification of the SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be evaluated, the present work considers the characteristic of SARS-CoV-1, which closely relates to that of SARS-CoV-2. The proteins are one of the most important structural and functional molecules of the virus; therefore, few properties of a protein are considered. In this work, we propose a sanitization procedure of the personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and masks, before and after the use, by employing high voltage charge generator (30 kV) from a very low DC source of 5 V to eliminate the virus from the surface of PPE. The positive output is connected to a metallic surface coated with carbon nanotubes (CNT) or a metallic surface ablated using lithography to achieve desired nano-grooves of 200 nm. At the tip of these nano-grooves, a very high electric field is generated which readily ionises the air in the vicinity of the tip. The high electric field alters the induced dipole of the protein of the virus, causing permanent damage in terms of electroporation.

We focused our investigation on four frequency bands C 2C8, 4C14, 15C25 and 25C40 Hz C and found that the largest reductions in seismic noise associated with the lockdown correspond to the high-frequency range of 15C40 Hz. We found that all the stations with large reductions in seismic noise (> 40 %) are located inside and near schools or in buildings, indicating that at these frequencies the drop is related to the drastic reduction of human activity in these edifices. In the lower-frequency range (2C8 and 4C14 Hz) the variability of the noise reduction among the stations is lower than in the high-frequency range, corresponding to about 35 % on average. This drop is due to reduced traffic during the lockdown, as most of the stations showing such changes in seismic noise in these bands are located within cities and near main or side streets. In addition to the noise reduction observed at stations located in populated areas, we also found seismic noise lockdown-related changes at several stations located far from urban areas, with movement of people in the vicinity of the station explaining the noise reductions.","output":"The effect of 2020 COVID-19 lockdown measures on seismic noise recorded in Romania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Masks and testing are necessary to combat asymptomatic spread in aerosols and droplets.","output":"Reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Silk is a unique example of heritage where memory, identity, creativity and knowledge can be found in just one piece.

Our results have showed that the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus activates early HERV-W and K transcription but only HERV-W ENV protein expression, in an infection- and ACE2-independent way within peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from one-third of healthy donors.

Well-designed trials with an emphasis on monitoring hand hygiene adherence are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"The effect of hand hygiene frequency on reducing acute respiratory infections in the community: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rapid and unprecedented shift of widening participation and outreach activities to online and remote delivery. The impact of this went beyond practitioners and the university sector;positive and negative implications are felt by stakeholders and the broader community. This shift online is discussed through the lens of a multi-university perspective, using four case studies from university outreach programs in one Australian state. The article provides a holistic view of the lessons learned and discoveries made, informing future program design and delivery. These programs include primary and secondary students, teachers, parents, guardians and carers, and work within a range of low socioeconomic and regional, rural and remote contexts. We argue that the fundamentally necessary shift online created a profound legacy and bears potential to increase accessibility (via diversity and scale), but, simultaneously, that care must be applied if substituting face-to-face engagement with that online. While this article primarily focuses on issues of value to practitioners, it also discusses important implications for academics, support staff, and university executive regarding the access and participation of underrepresented cohorts during times of mass change.","output":"Equalizing and Widening Access to Higher Education During a Pandemic: Lessons Learned from a Multi-University Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently and rapidly emerged and developed into a global pandemic. Through the renin-angiotensin system, the virus may impact the lung circulation, but the expression on endothelium may conduct to its activation and further systemic damage. While precise mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain to be further clarified, the understanding of the disease, its clinical course, as well as its immunological and hematological implications is of paramount importance in this phase of the pandemic. METHODS This review summarizes the evidence gathered until 12 June; electronic databases were screened for pertinent reports on coronavirus and inflammatory and hematological changes. Search was conducted by two independent investigators; keywords used were \\"SARS-CoV-2,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"inflammation,\\" \\"immunological,\\" and \\"therapy.\\" RESULTS The viral infection is able to trigger an excessive immune response in predisposed individuals, which can result in a \\"cytokine storm\\" that presents an hyperinflammation state able to determine tissue damage and vascular damage. An explosive production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- IL-1 and others occurs, greatly exaggerating the generation of molecule-damaging reactive oxygen species. These changes are often followed by alterations in hematological parameters. Elucidating those changes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could help to understand the pathophysiology of disease and may provide early clues to diagnosis. Several studies have shown that hematological parameters are markers of disease severity and suggest that they mediate disease progression. According to the available literature, the primary hematological symptoms-associated COVID-19, and which distinguish patients with severe disease from patients with nonsevere disease, are lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a significant increase in D-dimer levels. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a complex response altering inflammatory, hematological, and coagulation parameters. Measuring these alterations at certain time points may help identify patients at high risk of disease progression and monitor the disease severity.","output":"Immunological and Hematological Response in COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of mortality in men and women. We are now seeing an increasing number of patients with advanced-stage diagnosis and mortality from colorectal cancer before 50 years of age, which requires earlier screening. With the increasing need for CRC screening through colonoscopy, and thus endoscopists, easier and simpler techniques are needed to train proficient endoscopists. The most widely used approach by endoscopists is air insufflation colonoscopy, where air distends the colon to allow visualization of the colonic mucosa. This technique is un-comfortable for patients and requires an anesthetist to administer sedation. In addition, patients commonly complain about discomfort post-op as air escapes into the small bowel and cannot be adequately removed. Current research into the use of water insufflation colonoscopies has proved promising in reducing the need for sedation, decreasing discomfort, and increasing the visibility of the colonic mucosa. Future direction into water insufflation colonoscopies which have shown to be simpler and easier to teach may increase the number of proficient endoscopists in training to serve our aging population.","output":"Screening colonoscopy: The present and the future."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To analyse the relationship between work engagement, sense of coherence and psychological distress levels in Spanish health professionals who were active during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic lockdown. BACKGROUND: Work engagement and sense of coherence can help professionals to cope with work\\\\related psychological distress due to the harsh conditions of the COVID\\\\19 working environment. METHODS: Cross\\\\sectional observational study of 1,459 health care professionals. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analysed with descriptive and multiple linear regression methods. RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p < .001) were identified between all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with each other and both negatively with psychological distress. So, health care professionals, despite presenting psychological distress, perceive their work satisfactorily and positively despite the severity of the situation and the harsh conditions.

To achieve this objective, we propose to derive new data-based SVM kernels generated from the developed mixture model SSDMM. The proposed approach includes the following steps: the extraction of robust local descriptors, the learning of the developed mixture model via the expectationCmaximization (EM) algorithm, and finally the building of three SVM kernels for data categorization and classification. The potential of the implemented framework is illustrated through two challenging problems that concern the categorization of retinal images into normal or diabetic cases and the recognition of lung diseases in chest X-rays (CXR) images.

This study explores neurologists' perceptions of telephone and videophone remote consultations. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with neurologists and a GP with a specialist interest (n = 22). Interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom?, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: 'unknown unknowns (risks/uncertainties)', 'better service', 'challenges', and 'beyond the pandemic'. Thematic saturation was achieved by interview 19. Participants highlighted a number of benefits of remote consultations but over 80% also complained of a reduction in work satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The sudden introduction of tele-neurology is unlikely to be fully reversed when pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted. However, this study confirms tele-neurology cannot completely replace face-to-face consultations. Some patient groups and consultation types require direct contact. Moreover, significant administrative and infrastructural investment will be required to develop the full potential of tele-neurology.

Several solutions have been employed to address this problem depending on the airplane detection process. The most effective solutions are through the use of satellite images with deep learning techniques. Such solutions, however, are significantly costly and require satellites and modern complicated technology which may not be available in most countries worldwide. This paper provides a universal, low cost and fast solution for airplane detection in airports. This paper recommends the use of drones instead of satellites to feed the system with drone images using a proposed deep learning model. Drone images are employed as the dataset to train and evaluate a mask region convolution neural network (RCNN) model. The Mask RCNN model applies faster RCNN as its base configuration with critical modifications on its head neural network constructions. The model detects whether or not an airplane is present and includes mask estimations to approximate surface area and length, which will help future works identify the airplane type. This solution can be easily implemented globally as it is a low-cost and fast solution for airplane detection at airports.

The simplest way to understand the cross-presentation of peptides by different alleles is to classify these alleles into supertypes. A1 and A3 HLA supertypes are widely distributed in humans. However, direct structural and functional evidence for peptide presentation features of key alleles (e.g., HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03) are lacking. Herein, the molecular basis of peptide presentation of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 was demonstrated by crystal structure determination and thermostability measurements of complexes with T-cell epitopes from influenza virus (NP44), human immunodeficiency virus (RT313), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). When binding to the HIV peptide, RT313, the P-Lys anchoring modes of HLA-A(*)30:01, and -A(*)30:03 were similar to those of HLA-A(*)11:01 in the A3 supertype. However, HLA-A(*)30:03, but not -A(*)30:01, also showed binding with the HLA(*)01:01-favored peptide, NP44, but with a specific structural conformation. Thus, different from our previous understanding, HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 have specific peptide-binding characteristics that may lead to their distinct supertype-featured binding peptide motifs. Moreover, we also found that residue 77 in the F pocket was one of the key residues for the divergent peptide presentation characteristics of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03. Interchanging residue 77 between HLA-A(*)30:01 and HLA-A(*)30:03 switched their presented peptide profiles.

This review evaluated the outcomes for the components of the ACF campaign against the NTEPs minimum indicators and elicited the challenges faced in implementation. We supplemented data from completed pretested data proformas returned by ACF programme managers from nine states and two union territories (for 2017C2019) and five implementing partner agencies (2013C2020), with summary national data on the state-wise ACF outcomes for 2018C2020 published in annual reports by the NTEP. The data revealed variations in the strategies used to map and screen vulnerable populations and the diagnostic algorithms used across the states and union territories. National data were unavailable to assess whether the NTEP indicators for the minimum proportions identified with presumptive TB among those screened (5%), those with presumptive TB undergoing diagnostic tests (>95%), the minimum sputum smear positivity rate (2% to 3%), those with negative sputum smears tested with chest X-rays or CBNAAT (>95%) and those diagnosed through ACF initiated on anti-TB treatment (>95%) were fulfilled. Only 30% (10/33) of the states in 2018, 23% (7/31) in 2019 and 21% (7/34) in 2020 met the NTEP expectation that 5% of those tested through ACF would be diagnosed with TB (all forms). The number needed to screen to diagnose one person with TB (NNS) was not included among the NTEPs programme indicators. This rough indicator of the efficiency of ACF varied considerably across the states and union territories. The median NNS in 2018 was 2080 (interquartile range or IQR 517C4068). In 2019, the NNS was 2468 (IQR 1050C7924), and in 2020, the NNS was 906 (IQR 108C6550). The data consistently revealed that the states that tested a greater proportion of those screened during ACF and used chest X-rays or CBNAAT (or both) to diagnose TB had a higher diagnostic yield with a lower NNS. Many implementation challenges, related to health systems, healthcare provision and difficulties experienced by patients, were elicited.

Savoring may be particularly helpful for athletes who are often trained to attend more to negative (e.g. rectifying weaknesses) compared to positive stimuli (e.g. enjoying progress). METHODS: Sixty-seven college athletes completed a two-week daily diary study. Using multi-level modeling, we first explored whether various regulatory responses to daily negative events predicted unique variance in daily emotions (i.e. happy, content, grateful, sad, angry, annoyed). Next, we tested whether savoring positive events strengthened the association between event intensity and positive daily emotions. Finally, we tested whether regulatory responses to positive compared to negative events had stronger moderating (buffering) effects on the association between daily negative event intensity and daily emotions. RESULTS: Based on 836 daily observations, reappraising and accepting negative events were the only strategies that predicted unique variance in daily emotions. Savoring enhanced positive emotions related to positive events. Reappraising negative events buffered associations between negative event intensity and decreased daily gratitude, while savoring positive events buffered associations between negative event intensity and increased anger, annoyance, and average negative emotions. Accepting negative events had similar effects. CONCLUSIONS: Savoring positive events may be an underappreciated strategy for helping athletes regulate emotions related to negative events.

The mean duration of onset of symptoms of mucormycosis from the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 17.36  7.392 (3C45) days. Poor outcome with disease progression or death occurred in 21.3% of patients. Clinical group II patients (44.9%) with ROCM stages 3c and above had poor outcomes (P = 0.005). Histopathological analysis showed minimal inflammation in 25.8%, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in 75.3%, and angio-invasion in 28.1% of patients. Minimal inflammation was associated with clinical group II (P = 0.004) and poor outcome (P = 0.001). Angio-invasion correlated with poor outcome (P = 0.007). Patients with severe clinical group and poor outcome had higher mean NLR with P = 0.017 and P = 0.007, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vision loss and cerebral involvement had poor outcomes. The histopathologic features such as inflammation and angio-invasion along with NLR aid as prognostic indicators in the management of ROCM. The role of NET in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated ROCM needs further studies.","output":"A clinico-pathological study of COVID-19 associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there is a paradigm shift in medical education. This shift occurred following the Covid-19 crisis. The world uses digital e-learning to support the public health response to this pandemic. The study's objective was to determine the medical students acceptance and perceptions of e-learning during the Covid-19 closure time in Jeddah. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was done among 340 medical students from King Abdulaziz University, 2020. A standardized, electronic, self-administered, Google Form data collection sheet was distributed. It included the E-learning acceptance measure (ElAM) containing three constructs, namely: tutor quality (TQ), perceived usefulness (PU), and facilitating conditions (FC). The sheet also inquired about the students perceptions of the benefits, enablers, and barriers to e-learning. Descriptive, inferential statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Blackboard and Zoom were the most preferred Learning Management Systems (LMS) by our medical students. The mean score of ElAM was 102.82  24.102. Better achievers obtained significantly (P < 0.001) higher scores in all ElAM constructs. About three-fifths of the students confirmed that e-learning substituted classical on-campus learning and was an adaptable, and less time-consuming method. The educator's good e-learning skills, the subject, instructional design, interaction, motivation, and good LMS were agreed as enablers of e-learning. However, most students accepted that clinical teaching is the most challenging learning outcome and that exams could be affected by low internet quality. CONCLUSION: Medical students moderately accepted e-learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic closure time. More training of the students and tutors, better designing e-courses, more interaction, motivation, and blended learning are recommended.","output":"Medical students acceptance and perceptions of e-learning during the Covid-19 closure time in King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The study was designed to evaluate the influence of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (HBOT) on the parotid gland in patients following radiotherapy for head and neck tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HBOT response was monitored by 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T 2 mapping and subsequent measurement of mean T 2 and T 2 variability as well as by salivary tests (salivary flow, buffer capacity, and pH). Eighteen patients previously treated with irradiation doses between 50 and 80 Gy as well as 18 healthy gender and age matched controls were enrolled. MRI was performed prior to HBOT (40.2  20 months after radiotherapy) and after 20 daily HBOT at 2.5 ATA (absolute atmosphere). Each HBOT consisted of breathing 100% oxygen for 90 minutes. RESULTS: Significant differences in mean T 2 prior to HBOT were observed between the ipsilateral irradiated (121  20 ms), contralateral parotids (107  21) and control group (96  12 ms). A positive correlation in patients between T 2 variability and irradiation dose was detected in contralateral parotids before HBOT (R = 0.489, p = 0.0287). In addition, negative correlations were observed between mean T 2 in the ipsilateral as well as the contralateral gland and salivary flow before and after HBOT. Negative correlations between mean T 2, T 2 variability and pH of unstimulated saliva were also observed in the sides of parotid before and after HBOT. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that T 2 mapping had a potential for monitoring the differences between irradiated and normal parotid glands.

Diabetes is a major contributor to acute care re-utilization and associated costs. The goals of this paper are to (1) review the epidemiology of readmissions among patients with diabetes, (2) describe models that predict readmission risk, and (3) address various strategies for reducing the risk of acute care re-utilization. RECENT FINDINGS: Hospital readmissions and ED visits by diabetes patients are common and costly. Major risk factors for readmission include sociodemographics, comorbidities, insulin use, hospital length of stay (LOS), and history of readmissions, most of which are non-modifiable. Several models for predicting the risk of readmission among diabetes patients have been developed, two of which have reasonable accuracy in external validation. In retrospective studies and mostly small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), interventions such as inpatient diabetes education, inpatient diabetes management services, transition of care support, and outpatient follow-up are generally associated with a reduction in the risk of acute care re-utilization. Data on readmission risk and readmission risk reduction interventions are limited or lacking among patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19. The evidence supporting post-discharge follow-up by telephone is equivocal and also limited. SUMMARY: Acute care re-utilization of patients with diabetes presents an important opportunity to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs. Currently available predictive models are useful for identifying higher risk patients but could be improved. Machine learning models, which are becoming more common, have the potential to generate more accurate acute care re-utilization risk predictions. Tools embedded in electronic health record systems are needed to translate readmission risk prediction models into clinical practice. Several risk reduction interventions hold promise but require testing in multi-site RCTs to prove their generalizability, scalability, and effectiveness.","output":"Predicting and Preventing Acute Care Re-Utilization by Patients with Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inference of phylogenetic trees from raw sequencing reads is foundational to biology. However, state-of-the-art phylogenomics requires running complex pipelines, at significant computational and labour costs, with additional constraints in sequencing coverage, assembly and annotation quality. To overcome these challenges, we present Read2tree, which directly processes raw sequencing reads into groups of corresponding genes. In a benchmark encompassing a broad variety of datasets, our assembly-free approach was 10-100x faster than conventional approaches, and in most cases more accurate--the exception being when sequencing coverage was high and reference species very distant. To illustrate the broad applicability of the tool, we reconstructed a yeast tree of life of 435 species spanning 590 million years of evolution. Applied to Coronaviridae samples, Read2Tree accurately classified highly diverse animal samples and near-identical SARS-CoV-2 sequences on a single tree--thereby exhibiting remarkable breadth and depth.

The subject is extremely visual and has therefore previously been a target for the development of technology enhanced learning initiatives over the last ten years. Today's students have come to expect the integration of technology in the classroom and remotely. They adjust quickly to the innovative use of new applications and software and have begun to integrate it within their own workflow for note taking and study aids. Given the intense drive towards blended deliveries of anatomy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is easy to picture how the benefits of working in partnership with students (in order to achieve many of these aims) would be possible, particularly in difficult subjects like neuroanatomy. In doing so, it provides anatomists with new opportunities to engage students in a way that aligns well with best practice frameworks for engaging students through partnership. The current United Kingdom guidelines set out by Advance HE (a professional membership scheme for promoting excellence in higher education) strongly encourages the higher education community to seek out appropriate academic contexts where a balance of power can be struck between staff and student to create a community of practice. If such an approach can be fully embraced by anatomists, a strong argument can be made for seizing the opportunity to optimize the benefits of student partnership work in this discipline.","output":"Working in Creative Partnership with Students to Co-Produce Neuroanatomy e-Learning Resources in a new era of Blended Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID\\\\19) has variable clinical, sinonasal, and smell/taste outcomes.

Advanced analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to find brain abnormalities and their relationship to neurocognitive impairments in children and adolescents with DS. Because genetic factors affect brain development in early fetal life, there is a growing interest in analyzing brains from living fetuses with DS. In this study, we investigated regional sulcal folding depth as well as global cortical gyrification from fetal brain MRIs. Nine fetuses with DS (29.1  4.24 gestational weeks [mean  standard deviation]) were compared with 17 typically developing [TD] fetuses (28.4  3.44). Fetuses with DS showed lower whole-brain average sulcal depths and gyrification index than TD fetuses. Significant decreases in sulcal depth were found in bilateral Sylvian fissures and right central and parieto-occipital sulci. On the other hand, significantly increased sulcal depth was shown in the left superior temporal sulcus, which is related to atypical hemispheric asymmetry of cortical folding. Moreover, these group differences increased as gestation progressed. This study demonstrates that regional sulcal depth is a sensitive marker for detecting alterations of cortical development in DS during fetal life, which may be associated with later neurocognitive impairment.","output":"Regional Alterations in Cortical Sulcal Depth in Living Fetuses with Down Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent headline events ? most notably the COVID-19 pandemic ? have illustrated the fragility of tourism capitalism, prompting forward-looking analyses among critical scholars While grappling with political and philosophical implications, commentaries have tended towards the prescriptive and general: contemplating the collapse of tourism as-we-know-it, and foregrounding opportunities to reconstitute more sustainable, resilient and inclusive forms of tourism Heeding Haraway?s call to ?stay with the trouble?, I briefly outline three sympathetic critiques, integrating insights from more-than-human theory, disaster studies and climate change adaptation literatures First, I unsettle temporalities of disruption and change that emphasise singular moments, such as lockdowns, rather than multiple temporalities of vulnerability and resilience Second, a lurking species exceptionalism, which positions humans as the locus of agency, is contrasted with nonhuman capacities to shape unfurling events Third, speculations on tourism?s future that rest on normative categories, disembodied from lived experience, are contrasted with First Nations ontologies, and the messiness of tourism?s relatings in place Theorising tourism, within and beyond crisis, must evolve iteratively from the ethnographic To illustrate, I ?write from? the east coast of Australia, where an otherwise steady-growth tourism economy has experienced profound disruption in 2020, not just from coronavirus-related travel restrictions, but from climate-change-amplified catastrophic bushfires From this vantage point, multiple traumas refract tourism industry responses, while hope commingles with caution, tempering strident proclamations on the future The nonhuman, political-economic, and emotional are inextricably entwined in the fabric of tourism The fraught navigation of lived (more-than-human) experience must figure more prominently in our scholarly reckonings","output":"Theorising tourism in crisis: Writing and relating in place"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studenten in de zorg moeten makkelijker aan stages komen, daarvoor wil demissionair minister Hugo de Jonge (Volksgezondheid) nog dit jaar 13 miljoen euro extra vrijmaken.","output":"Minister maakt extra geld vrij voor stages in de zorg"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":".","output":"The cunning bookcase of Alexander Knips Macoppe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Street performers are able to contribute to a fabric of a citys creative dynamic.

To get the data the researcher modified the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale questionnaire (FLCAS) by Howitz and Young (1991) which is commonly applied to determine the level of anxiety. Since the study concentrated in distance learning the researchers also decided to adopt an On-line Language Learning Anxiety (OLLA) Inventory (Majid Othman & Rahmat 2007). Findings revealed that students experienced higher anxiety levels in the beginning stage of distance learning. A year after the implementation of distance learning students had adapted well and the level of anxiety they encountered was reduced.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 156 patients with 233 ears who had used the beautiful ear orthosis system in Jiangxi Province in the last 3 years were included. The patients were grouped according to age at initial correction, sex, and type of deformity, and data on duration and age of orthotic use and complications were obtained. RESULTS: We studied 156 paediatric cases with 233 ear deformities, 79 of which were single-ear deformities. In total, 77 cases had an ear shape deformity, and an implicit ear was the most common deformity. For a good therapeutic effect evaluation standard above 96.57%, the mean duration of follow-up was 1 month. The initial correction age was an important factor in the correction effect while gender had no obvious influence. The difference in the mean wearing time was not statistically significant (p = 0.233, p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the ratio of correcting effects between the 6 types of deformities that were excellent or good (p = 0.086, p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Domestic auricle orthosis is an effective nonsurgical treatment for ear malformation. The correction effect is related to the initial correction age. The younger the child is, the better the treatment effect is, and the shorter the treatment time is. Complications are common in older infants.

For the widespread adoption of new technology, it must be locally demonstrable and become normalized. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to install smart speakers in care homes in a rural and coastal region and to explore if and how the devices were being used, the barriers to their implementation, and their potential benefits. METHODS: Email, workshops, drop-in sessions, phone, and cold calling was used to contact all 230 care homes, offering a free smart speaker and some advisory support. Care homes accepting the devices were asked to complete a feedback diary. Nonresponse rate for diary completion was high and was thus supplemented with a telephone survey. RESULTS: Over the course of 7 months, we installed 156 devices in 92 care homes for older people, 50 devices for people with physical or mental health needs, and 8 for others. The devices were used mainly for music but also for poetry, recipes, light controls, jokes, and video calls. Care home managers reported the benefits for the residents, including enhanced engagement with home activities, enjoyment, calming effects, and the acquisition of new skills. Implementation problems included internet connectivity, staff capacity, and skills. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable consumer devices such as smart speakers should be installed in all care homes to benefit residents. Voice-activated technologies are easy to use and promote interaction.

RESULTS Our database search yielded 504 articles, of which 34 met final inclusion criteria. The studies took place across 21 countries and focused on 18 different health topics. The studies primarily used qualitative study designs (68%). Over half (59%) of the studies applied the CFIR at study endline, primarily to guide data analysis or to contextualize study findings. Nineteen (59%) of the contacted authors participated in the survey. Authors unanimously identified culture and engaging as compatible with use in global implementation research. Only two constructs, patient needs and resources and individual stages of change were commonly identified as incompatible with use. Author feedback centered on team level influences on implementation, as well as systems characteristics, such as health system architecture. We propose a \\"Characteristics of Systems\\" domain and eleven novel constructs be added to the CFIR to increase its compatibility for use in LMICs. CONCLUSIONS These additions provide global implementation science practitioners opportunities to account for systems-level determinants operating independently of the implementing organization. Newly proposed constructs require further reliability and validity assessments.

METHODS: Preoperative patients had one or two nasopharyngeal swabs, depending on low or high risk of viral transmission. Positive tests were repeated. RESULTS: Forty-three of 52 patients required two or more preoperative tests. Four (9.3%) had discrepant results (positive/negative). One of these left the coronavirus disease (COVID) unit against medical advice despite an orbital abscess, with unknown true disease status. The remaining 3 of 42 (7.1%) had negative repeat RT-PCR. Although ultimately considered falsepositives, one was sent to a COVID unit postoperatively and two had urgent surgery delayed.

There also will be continued interest in vaccines that are more effective or have improved scalability to facilitate mass vaccination campaigns. Ongoing clinical testing of new vaccines also will be needed as variant strains continue to emerge that may elude some aspects of immunity induced by current vaccines. Randomized clinical trials meaningfully enhance the efficiency and reliability of such clinical testing. In clinical settings with limited or no access to known effective vaccines, placebo-controlled randomized trials of new vaccines remain a preferred approach to maximize the reliability, efficiency and interpretability of results. When emerging availability of licensed vaccines makes it no longer possible to use a placebo control, randomized active comparator non-inferiority trials may enable reliable insights. METHODS: In this article, \\"hybrid\\" methods are proposed to address settings where, during the conduct of a placebo-controlled trial, a judgment is made to replace the placebo arm by a licensed COVID-19 vaccine due to emerging availability of effective vaccines in regions participating in that trial. These hybrid methods are based on proposed statistics that aggregate evidence to formally test as well as to estimate the efficacy of the experimental vaccine, by combining placebo-controlled data during the first period of trial conduct with active-controlled data during the second period. RESULTS: Application of the proposed methods is illustrated in two important scenarios where the active control vaccine would become available in regions engaging in the experimental vaccine's placebo-controlled trial: in the first, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 50%-70% for the 4- to 6-month duration of follow-up of its placebo-controlled trial; in the second, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 90%-95% during that duration. These two scenarios approximate what has been seen with adenovirus vaccines or mRNA vaccines, respectively, assuming the early estimates of vaccine efficacy for those vaccines would hold over longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The proposed hybrid methods could readily play an important role in the near future in the design, conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials performed to address the need for multiple additional vaccines reliably established to be safe and have worthwhile efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic disease from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine trials: The potential for \\"hybrid\\" analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) in children is milder compared with adults.

A key mechanism recognised in progressive severe disease is virus-induced endothelial dysregulation. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), being the most highly expressed peptide in endothelial cells and potent vasoconstrictor of human blood vessels, represents a potential therapeutic target through the use of Endothelin receptor antagonists. ObjectiveTo investigate the association of plasma ET-1 with Covid-19 disease severity DesignRetrospective longitudinal cohort study of Covid-19 patients divided into Group A (asymptomatic or symptoms not requiring hospitalisation), Group B (symptoms requiring hospitalisation) and Group C (symptoms requiring supplemental oxygen therapy or assisted ventilation) recruited between March and July 2020 (the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK). Data were compared with a contemporaneous cross-section of non-infected volunteers (Controls). SettingSingle Tertiary National Health Service Hospital. ParticipantsTissue banked plasma samples were obtained from 194 patients. ExposuresQuantitation of ET-1 in plasma by specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Main outcome and measuresPairwise comparison of ET-1 levels (median [IQR]) between patient categories, and subgroups defined by clinical outcomes. ResultsBaseline ET-1 plasma levels (pg/ml) were elevated in patients requiring hospitalisation compared with controls and patients with asymptomatic or mild infection (Group B: 1.59 [1.13-1.98], and Group C: 1.65 [1.02-2.32] versus controls: 0.68 [0.47-0.87], p=<0.001 and Group A: 0.72 [0.57-1.10], p=<0.001). ET-1 levels were also elevated in patients that died (2.09 [1.66-3.15]), developed acute kidney (1.70 [1.07-2.36]) or myocardial injury (1.50 [0.92-2.28]) compared with patients with an uncomplicated infection (1.00 [0.61-1.57], p=<0.01). Amongst surviving hospitalised patients, ET-1 concentrations decreased when measured at 28 days (Group B: 0.86 [0.60-1.61] and Group C: 1.17 [0.66-1.62] versus baseline, p=<0.05) and 90 days (Group B: 0.69 [0.59-1.38] and Group C: 1.01 [0.64-1.21] versus baseline, p=<0.05). Conclusions and relevanceHospitalised Covid-19 patients demonstrate elevated ET-1 levels during the acute phase of infection and this is associated with increasing clinical severity of the disease.

This study describes the occurrence of BCoV infection among calves from dairy and beef herds in four Brazilian states. A total of 282 stool samples from 1 to 60-day-old calves were evaluated for the presence of BCoV by a semi-nested (SN) PCR assay.

During the first epidemic wave in 2020, Gauteng accounted for 32.0% of South Africas reported COVID-19 cases. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the health system response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first epidemic wave in Gauteng province and to explore the perspectives of key informants on the provincial response. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using an adapted Pandemic Emergency Response Conceptual Framework, this was a qualitative case study design consisting of 36 key informant interviews and a document analysis. We used thematic analysis to identify themes and sub-themes from the qualitative data. RESULTS: Our case study found that Gauteng developed an innovative, multi-sectoral and comprehensive provincial COVID-19 response that aimed to address the dual challenge of saving lives and the economy. However, the interviews revealed multiple perspectives, experiences, contestations and contradictions in the pandemic response. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and amplified the fragilities of existing systems, reflected in the corruption on personal protective equipment, poor data quality and inappropriate decisions on self-standing field hospitals. Rooted in a chronic under-investment and insufficient focus on the health workforce, the response failed to take into account or deal with their fears, and to incorporate strategies for psychosocial support, and safe working environments. The single-minded focus on COVID-19 exacerbated these fragilities, resulting in a de facto health system lockdown and reported collateral damage. The key informants identified missed opportunities to invest in primary health care, partner with communities and to include the private health sector in the pandemic response.

We found that irregular eating patterns changed central ghrelin levels of pigs, affected the circadian entrainment and circadian rhythm pathways in hypothalamus tissue, and altered the daily behavior and food anticipatory activity (FAA). To determine whether ghrelin exerts an effect, growing pigs were intravenously injected with ghrelin antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 for 7 days.

However, variation in population size poses a challenge to the triggering of public health interventions using wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. This is especially important for near-to-source sites that are subject to significant daily variability in upstream populations. Focusing on a university campus in England, this study investigates methods to account for variation in upstream populations at a site with highly transient footfall and provides a better understanding of the impact of variable populations on the SARS-CoV-2 trends provided by wastewater-based epidemiology. The potential for complementary data to help direct response activities within the near-to-source population is also explored, and potential concerns arising due to the presence of heavily diluted samples during wet weather are addressed. Using wastewater biomarkers, it is demonstrated that population normalisation can reveal significant differences between days where SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are very similar. Confidence in the trends identified is strongest when samples are collected during dry weather periods; however, wet weather samples can still provide valuable information. It is also shown that building-level occupancy estimates based on complementary data aid identification of potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 and can enable targeted actions to be taken to identify and manage potential sources of pathogen transmission in localised communities.","output":"Building knowledge of university campus population dynamics to enhance near-to-source sewage surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pneumonia represents the most severe pandemic of the twenty-first century and has crucial clinical, social and economical implications.

It is known that people with good psychological resilience(PR) levels could successfully cope with the problems. The study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the psychological resilience training program in PHE-HCW. OBJECTIVES: This intervention study conducted on PHE-HCW. In the study, when type 1 error() was taken as 5% and type 2 error(1-) was taken as 95% and the effect size was accepted as 0.5, it was calculated that there should be at least 47 HCW in the groups.To minimizing the differences between groups, two groups were selected as intervention(n = 51) and control(n = 49) by applying propensity score matching analysis, taking into age, gender, occupation and working time. The questionnaire included questions of sociodemographic characteristics and the PR Scale(PRS).The questionnaire was applied to the both groups before the program and after four weeks of follow-up. The PRS consists of six subdimensions(structural style, future perception, family cohesion, personal strenghts, social competence, social resources), and it was accepted that psychological resilience increased as the score increased. The intervention group received video training on PR(self-awareness, hopefulness, optimism, etc.) whereas online classical training was applied to the control group. RESULTS: There was no difference in PR score between the intervention and control groups before the intervention(p > 0.05).The mean PR scoreSD increased in both groups, for the intervention group from (67.218.2) to (80.312.4) and for the control group from (64.219.3) to (77.79.5).After the follow-up, positive changes were found in all subdimensions in the intervention group and in subdimensions except structural style and social competence in the control group(p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological resilience training is effective in PHE-HCW during the pandemic period.

Although viral respiratory tract infections are, in general, more severe in patients with CF compared with the general population, a small number of studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause a worse infection in CF. This is surprising since comorbidities including preexisting lung disease have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several recent studies provide insight into why SARS-CoV-2 may not produce more severe outcomes in CF. First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1-7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Second, many CF patients are treated with azithromycin, which suppresses viral infection and lung inflammation and inhibits the activity of furin, a serine protease. Finally, the CF lung contains high levels of serine protease inhibitors including ecotin and SERPINB1, which are predicted to reduce the ability of TMPRSS2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Thus, a variety of factors may mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in CF.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and cystic fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to lifestyle changes, which in turn may have an impact on the course of headache disorders. We aimed to assess changes in primary headache characteristics and lifestyle factors during the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany using digital documentation in the mobile application (app) M-sense. MAIN BODY: We analyzed data of smartphone users, who entered daily data in the app in the 28-day period before lockdown (baseline) and in the first 28 days of lockdown (observation period). This analysis included the change of monthly headache days (MHD) in the observation period compared to baseline. We also assessed changes in monthly migraine days (MMD), the use of acute medication, and pain intensity. In addition, we looked into the changes in sleep duration, sleep quality, energy level, mood, stress, and activity level. Outcomes were compared using paired t-tests. The analysis included data from 2325 app users. They reported 7.01  SD 5.64 MHD during baseline and 6.89  5.47 MHD during lockdown without significant changes (p > 0.999). MMD, headache and migraine intensity neither showed any significant changes. Days with acute medication use were reduced from 4.50  3.88 in the baseline to 4.27  3.81 in the observation period (p < 0.001). The app users reported reduced stress levels, longer sleep duration, reduced activity levels, along with a better mood, and an improved energy level during the first lockdown month (p  0.001).

The current study describes the design, implementation, and convergent validity of a fWeb-based cognitive assessment tool, the Survey for Memory, Attention, and Reaction Time (SMART), for older adults. METHODS A community-dwelling sample of older adults (n = 69) was included, classified as cognitively intact (n = 44) or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 25). Participants completed the SMART at home using their computer, tablet, or other Internet-connected device. The SMART consists of 4 face-valid cognitive tasks available in the public domain assessing visual memory, attention/processing speed, and executive functioning. Participants also completed a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests, a cognitive screener, and a daily function questionnaire. Primary SMART outcome measures consisted of subtest completion time (CT); secondary meta-metrics included outcomes indirectly assessed or calculated within the SMART (e.g., click count, total CT, time to complete practice items, and time of day the test was completed). RESULTS Regarding validity, total SMART CT, which includes time to complete test items, practice items, and directions, had the strongest relationship with global cognition ( = -0.47, p < 0.01). Test item CT was significantly greater for the MCI group (F = 5.20, p = 0.026). Of the SMART tasks, the executive functioning subtests had the strongest relationship with cognitive status as compared to the attention/processing speed and visual memory subtests. The primary outcome measures demonstrated fair to excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.50-0.76).

Myocardial injury is associated with worse outcome. This study aimed to evaluate cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients and to assess their association with 30-day mortality in comparison to other biomarkers, risk factors and clinical severity scores. Methods: Prospective, single-center, cohort study in patients with PCR-confirmed, critical COVID-19. Laboratory assessment included high sensitive troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on admission to ICU: a hs-cTnT  14 pg/mL and a NT-proBNP  450 pg/mL were considered as elevated. Transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation was performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Predictive markers for mortality were assessed by ROC analysis and cut-off values by the Youden Index. Results: A total of 100 patients were included. The median age was 63.5 years, the population was predominantly male (66%). At the time of ICU admission, 47% of patients had elevated hs-cTnT and 39% had elevated NT-proBNP. Left ventricular ejection fraction was below 50% in 19.1%. Elevated cardiac biomarkers (hs-cTnT P-value < 0.001, NT-proBNP P-value = 0.001) and impaired left ventricular function (P-value = 0.011) were significantly associated with mortality, while other biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein) and clinical scores (SOFA) did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors. An optimal cut-off value to predict increased risk for 30-day all-cause mortality was 16.5 pg/mL for hs-cTnT (OR 8.5, 95% CI: 2.9, 25.0) and 415.5 pg/ml for NT-proBNP (OR 5.1, 95% CI: 1.8, 14.7). Conclusion: Myocardial injury in COVID-19 is common. Early detection of elevated hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP are predictive for 30-day mortality in patients with critical COVID-19. These markers outperform other routinely used biomarkers, as well as clinical indices of disease severity in ICU.

In an effort to gain insights into the mechanism(s) governing the HDR-mediated integration of larger transgenes and to improve the technology, we conducted knock-in experiments targeting the human EMX1 locus and applied rigorous genomic PCR analyses in the human HEK293 cell line. This exercise revealed an unexpected molecular complication arising from the transgene HDR being initiated at the single homology arm and the subsequent genomic integration of plasmid backbone sequences. To pivot around this problem, we devised a novel PCR-constructed template containing blocked long 3' single-stranded overhangs (BL3SSO) that greatly improved the efficiency of bona fide Cas9-stimulated HDR at the EMX1 locus. We further refined BL3SSO technology and successfully used it to insert GFP transgenes into two important interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) loci, Viperin/RSAD2, and ISG15.

These compounds were evaluated as potential tubulin polymerisation inhibitors and for their antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cells. A number of the compounds showed potent activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, e.g., compound 10n (3-chloro-4-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one) and compound 11n (3,3-dichloro-4-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-azetidin-2-one), with IC(50) values of 17 and 31 nM, respectively, and displayed comparable cellular effects to those of Combretastatin A-4. Compound 10n demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity against non-tumorigenic HEK-293T cells and inhibited the in vitro polymerisation of tubulin with significant G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest.

The prominent location for mucosal lesions are tongue, palate and labial mucosa. The exact pathogenesis of these oral symptoms is not known. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors are expressed in abundance on oral mucosa allowing severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect them. Gustatory impairment along with olfactory changes is now listed as a symptom of Covid-19 by the World Health Organization, but further research is needed to confirm a link between reported additional oral symptoms and Covid-19. Dental professionals may encounter individuals with Covid-19 and be called upon to identify various oral manifestations of this disease.","output":"Oral manifestations of Covid-19-A literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify individual characteristics that are associated with communicative participation after total laryngectomy (TL). METHODS: This study was a single-institution investigation of individuals who had undergone TL. Data were collected at a single timepoint via patient self-report and medical record review. Thirty-five participants completed a questionnaire containing a communication survey as well as several published, validated instruments. Independent variables included characteristics related to demographics, health and medical history, social network composition, and communication. The dependent variable was communicative participation, which was assessed using the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB). Correlations between the independent variables and CPIB scores were calculated to assess the influence of these characteristics on communicative participation. The study participants were subdivided into three distinct groups based on whether their primary method of communication was spoken or non-spoken and the frequency of using alternate methods of communication. Outcomes across the three groups were then compared. A follow-up survey was also conducted to examine the impact of \\"stay at home\\" orders during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between communicative participation and some non-communication-related characteristics. Reduced communicative participation was associated with younger age, less time since TL, a history of reconstructive surgery, poorer self-rated health, more depressive symptoms, worse quality of life, and a weaker social network of friends. Several communication-related characteristics were also associated with CPIB scores. Increased communicative participation was associated with using fewer non-spoken communication methods, higher levels of satisfaction with speech and communication, and better communicative effectiveness. There were significant differences between the three groups for communicative effectiveness and satisfaction with speech. The three groups did not differ significantly for satisfaction with communication or communicative participation. There were no significant differences in CPIB scores measured before and during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Communicative participation is a complex measure that may be affected by a variety of factors related to demographics, health, social network status, and communication. Despite poorer communicative effectiveness and lower levels of satisfaction, individuals who use non-spoken methods of communication after TL did not demonstrate worse communicative participation than those using spoken methods. Surprisingly, CPIB scores did not decline as a result of social distancing.","output":"Characteristics associated with communicative participation after total laryngectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a sample of 208 children seeking medical care, seropositivity rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 8.7%, suggesting a similar infection rate to that observed in adults, but >100-fold the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed pediatric cases.

Hence, studying the mechanisms behind the coexistence of diabetes and COVID-19 is useful for the development of better public health policies. In this article, we have developed a novel deterministic model for the co-infection of diabetes and COVID-19. It consists of five compartments corresponding to five population classes, namely, diabetes susceptible, diabetes patients, COVID-19 susceptible, COVID-19 infected and COVID19 recovered class. We have discussed the non-negativity and invariant region of the system. Next, the existence of equilibrium points and stabilities of different equilibria of the model are studied. Also, by using the next-generation matrix method the basic reproduction number (R0) is calculated. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of R0 and observed that reduction of transmission coefficient (?) from diabetes susceptible class to diabetes class is the most critical factor to control the co-infection. We endeavor to fit our model with the data given by the World Health Organization(WHO)[1] and it suits well with the data. Moreover, the deterministic model is extended into the stochastic model. And by using numerical simulations our results of stochastic and deterministic models are compared. Our numerical findings are performed through computer simulation, which illustrates the robustness of our model from the eco-epidemiological perspective.

METHODS: We linked provincial health administrative data in Ontario, Canada, to create 3 cross-sectional panels of residents of any age in 2003, 2009, and 2016 to describe: (i) 13-year trends in multimorbidity prevalence and constellations among residents and across age, sex, and income; and (ii) chronic condition clusters. Multimorbidity was defined as having at least any 2 of 18 selected conditions, and further grouped into levels of 2, 3, 4, or 5 or more conditions. Age-sex standardized multimorbidity prevalence was estimated using the 2009 population as the standard. Clustering was defined using the observed combinations of conditions within levels of multimorbidity. RESULTS: Standardized prevalence of multimorbidity increased over time (26.5%, 28.8%, and 30.0% across sequential panels), across sex, age, and area-based income. Females, older adults and those living in lower income areas exhibited higher rates in all years. However, multimorbidity increased relatively more among males, younger adults, and those with 4 or 5 or more conditions. We observed numerous and increasing diversity in disease clusters, namely at higher levels of multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Our study provides relevant and needed population-based information on the growing burden of multimorbidity, and related socio-demographic risk factors. Multimorbidity is markedly increasing among younger age cohorts. Also, there is an increasing complexity and lack of common clustering patterns at higher multimorbidity levels.

In the face of significant uncertainty around the epidemic impact of in-person schooling, policymakers, parents, and teachers are weighing the risks and benefits of returning to in-person education. In this context, we examined the impact of different school reopening scenarios on transmission within and outside of schools and on the share of school days that would need to be spent learning at a distance. Methods: We used an agent-based mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and interventions to quantify the impact of school reopening on disease transmission and the extent to which school-based interventions could mitigate epidemic spread within and outside schools. We compared seven school reopening strategies that vary the degree of countermeasures within schools to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, including the use of face masks, physical distancing, classroom cohorting, screening, testing, and contact tracing, as well as schedule changes to reduce the number of students in school. We considered three scenarios for the size of the epidemic in the two weeks prior to school reopening: 20, 50, or 110 detected cases per 100,000 individuals and assumed the epidemic was slowly declining with full school closures. For each scenario, we calculated the percentage of schools that would have at least one person arriving at school with an active COVID-19 infection on the first day of school; the percentage of in-person school days that would be lost due to scheduled distance learning, symptomatic screening or quarantine; the cumulative infection rate for students, staff and teachers over the first three months of school; and the effective reproduction number averaged over the first three months of school within the community. Findings: In-person schooling poses significant risks to students, teachers, and staff. On the first day of school, 5-42% of schools would have at least one person arrive at school with active COVID-19, depending on the incidence of COVID in the community and the school type. However, reducing class sizes via A/B school scheduling, combined with an incremental approach that returns elementary schools in person and keeps all other students remote, can mitigate COVID transmission. In the absence of any countermeasures in schools, we expect 6-25% of teaching and non-teaching staff and 4-20% of students to be infected with COVID in the first three months of school, depending upon the case detection rate. Schools can lower this risk to as low as 0.2% for staff and 0.1% for students by returning elementary schools with a hybrid schedule while all other grades continue learning remotely. However, this approach would require 60-85% of all school days to be spent at home. Despite the significant risks to the school population, reopening schools would not significantly increase community-wide transmission, provided sufficient countermeasures are implemented in schools. Interpretation: Without extensive countermeasures, school reopening may lead to an increase in infections and a significant number of re-closures as cases are identified among staff and students. Returning elementary schools only with A/B scheduling is the lowest risk school reopening strategy that includes some in-person learning.","output":"Schools are not islands: Balancing COVID-19 risk and educational benefits using structural and temporal countermeasures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guided by the stress process model (Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990; Pearlin, 1999), the purpose of this longitudinal investigation was to examine the extent to which the stressor of premature forced reentry from studying abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., reentry shock, reacculturative stress) was predictive of stress-related compromised mental health (i.e., perceived stress and loneliness) into the subsequent academic year.

Here we provide a theoretically-grounded assessment regarding the interventions acceptability and feasibility. METHODS: We conducted 30-min exit interviews with a stratified sample of participants (n = 26 Latinx sexual minority men, 15 Latinx transgender women), supplemented with insights from study staff (n = 6). All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for a content analysis using Dedoose. Cohens Kappa was 89.4% across coded excerpts. We evaluated acceptability based on how participants cognitively and emotionally reacted to the intervention and whether they considered it to be appropriate. We measured feasibility based on resource, scientific and process assessments (e.g., functionality of text messaging service, feedback on study recruitment procedures and surveys). RESULTS: Regarding acceptability, most participants clearly understood the intervention as a program to receive information about HIV prevention methods through text messages. Participants who did not complete the intervention shared they did not fully understand what it entailed at their initial enrollment, and thought it was a one-time engagement and not an ongoing program. Though some participants with a higher level of education felt the information was simplistic, most appreciated moving beyond a narrow focus on HIV to include general information on sexually transmitted infections; drug use and impaired sexual decision-making; and differential risks associated with sexual positions and practices. Latinx transgender women in particular appreciated receiving information about Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. While participants didnt fully understand the exact chances of winning a prize in the quiz component, most enjoyed the quizzes and chance of winning a prize. Participants appreciated that the intervention required a minimal time investment. Participants shared that the intervention was generally culturally appropriate. Regarding feasibility, most participants reported the text message platform worked well though inactive participants consistently said technical difficulties led to their disengagement. Staff shared that clients had varying reactions to being approached while being tested for HIV, with some unwilling to enroll and others being very open and curious about the program. Both staff and participants relayed concerns regarding the length of the recruitment process and study surveys.

An increasing number of people have insomnia every year, young adults, especially. Due to the importance that sleep has in almost every aspect of our lives, the need to monitor disturbances in circadian rhythms has arisen. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of sleep disorders among Polish students, including their quality of life (QOL) and drug use patterns. The study also investigated associations between sleep, QoL, and drug use. The study was conducted in 2016C2021 based on the self-made sociodemographic questionnaire, as well as standardized psychometric tools: Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Manchester Short Assessment of quality of life (MANSA). A total of 14,844 students participated in the study. The majority were women (80.7%), of which 3425 (23.1%) were medical students, with the most numerous representing medical and dental faculties, 1884 (57.2%). Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 52.1% of the surveys were collected; 54.1% of respondents had insomnia as indicated by the AIS scores, and 26.1% displayed sleepiness during the day. Female students, the first-year college students, more often suffered from sleep disorders. Drug use was widespread among Polish students, correlating with sleep assessment results and QoL. In conclusion, sleep disorders are a significant clinical problem among Polish students. Female and junior students years are more prone to sleep deprivation. Insufficient sleep can be associated with a lower QoL score and psychoactive substance use. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep are not conclusive, because there was decreasing quality for longer sleep durations. In order to analyze these associations, there is a need for further in-depth study.","output":"Assessment of Insomnia Symptoms, Quality of Life, Daytime Sleepiness, and Psychoactive Substance Use among Polish Students: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey for Years 2016C2021 before and during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)-cell therapy is a promising treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.

METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1(st) and March 13(th). A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25% to 75-100%) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging ( 5 and > 5 days) and according to age ( 50 and > 50 years old). RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8%). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57% (95% CI = 47-67) and 89% (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to  5 days (76% [62-87] vs 37% [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to  50 years (59% [48-69] vs 47% [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68% [45-86] and 82% [73-89], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57%. Sensitivity was higher when symptoms had started more than 5 days before, at the expense of lesser specificity, while slightly higher in older patients in comparison to younger ones.","output":"DIAGNOSTIC IMPACT OF BEDSIDE CHEST X-RAY FEATURES OF 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS IN THE ROUTINE ADMISSION AT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: CASE SERIES FROM LOMBARDY REGION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the social and economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of countries.

I show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease but also cross-country spillovers in perceptions about coronavirus risk and in social distancing behavior. In the early phases of the pandemic, perceptions of coronavirus risk in most countries are affected by pandemic shocks originating in Italy. Later, the USA, Spain, and the UK play sizable roles.

Therefore, the authorities controlled personal movements and private and public non-essential activities were cancelled. It has probably had an important emotional impact on chronic patients and hence in those who are suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) due to their high risk of emotional disorders. The aim of this study is to know how COVID 19 influenced to the patients suffering from IBD during the quarantine period, focusing heavily on the psychological distress through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), and also the impact of the pandemic on therapeutic adherence using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). METHODS: This is an unicentric and analytical observational study carried out in IBD unit of a large public teaching Hospital (University Hospital Lozano Blesa) during August 2020. Patients were contacted and interviewed by phone by two trained researchers not involved in the patients medical care. Inclusion criteria were age  18 years old and confirmed diagnosis of Crohns Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Indeterminate Colitis. A descriptive analysis was carried out and, subsequently, the factors associated with the loss of therapeutic adherence and higher-moderate levels of stress were analyzed through Logistic regression multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of the 426 patients included, 217 (50.9%) were women, 249 (58.4%) had UC and 177 (41.6%) had EC. During the Spanish lockdown period, most of patients did not have symptoms related to their IBD (302; 72.1%). Among those who had symptoms, the most frequent was diarrhea and abdominal pain (11.5%). Most of subjects were not diagnosed of SARS-CoV2 infection (93%), whereas 2.1% suffered confirmed infection and 4.9% had compatible symptoms without test confirmation. Regarding economic situation of patients, most of them did not have economic difficulties (87.6%). Moreover, 74.4% of participants referred a very good physician-patient relationship and 21.8% a good relationship. People who participated in the study had a median PSS-10 score of 12 (10C16). A higher level of stress was reported between those who were not married, women, and those who experimented an increase of IBD related symptoms. Adherence to treatment was not associated with stress level based on PSS-10 questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Although the lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic has probably had an important emotional impact on Spanish population, IBD patients had in general lower PSS-10 scores.

We describe a cohort of patients with a constellation of symptoms occurring four weeks after diagnosis causing different degrees of reduced functional capacity. Although different hypothesis have been proposed to explain this condition like persistent immune activation or immunological dysfunction, to date, no physiopathological mechanism has been identified. Consequently, there are no therapeutic options besides symptomatic treatment and rehabilitation. METHODS: We evaluated patients with symptoms that persisted for at least 4 weeks after COVID-19. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected. Blood tests, including inflammatory markers, were conducted, and imaging studies made if deemed necessary. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in plasma, stool, and urine were performed. Patients were offered antiviral treatment (compassionate use). RESULTS: We evaluated 29 patients who reported fatigue, muscle pain, dyspnea, inappropriate tachycardia, and low-grade fever. Median number of days from COVID-19 to positive RT-PCR in extra-respiratory samples was 55 (39C67). Previous COVID-19 was mild in 55% of the cases. Thirteen patients (45%) had positive plasma RT-PCR results and 51% were positive in at least one RT-PCR sample (plasma, urine, or stool). Functional status was severely reduced in 48% of the subjects. Eighteen patients (62%) received antiviral treatment. Improvement was seen in most patients (p = 0.000) and patients in the treatment group achieved better outcomes with significant differences (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms, 45% of them have detectable plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Design: Population-based closed cohort study between 31 January 2020 and 22 July 2020 in the setting of a UK primary care database (The Health Improvement Network, THIN). Methods: The main outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 coded as suspected or confirmed by the primary care provider. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model with stepwise inclusion of explanatory variables (age, BMI, impaired glucose regulation, androgen excess, anovulation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) to provide unadjusted and adjusted hazard risks (HR) of COVID-19 infection among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS. Results: We identified 21 292 women with a coded diagnosis of PCO/PCOS and randomly selected 78 310 aged and general practice matched control women. The crude COVID-19 incidence was 18.1 and 11.9 per 1000 person-years among women with and without PCOS, respectively. Age-adjusted Cox regression analysis suggested a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS (HR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.27-1.80), P < 0.001).

From August 2010 to April 2011, 309 outpatients were recruited at the Luang Prabang Provincial Hospital covering highland Lao communities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were screened for the presence of 13 respiratory viruses. At least one virus was detected in 69.6% and dual/triple viral infections in 12.9%/1.9% of the patients. Influenza A and B viruses combined were the most frequently detected pathogens, followed by human adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The other viruses were detected in less than 10% of the patients. Phylogenetic analyses on a representative set of RSV strains revealed that, while otherwise very rare, the RSV\\\\B CB1/THB genotype cocirculated with other common genotypes. A single wave of influenza virus and RSV activity was observed during the rainy season, providing further support to influenza vaccination before the onset of the rains.

The present case study was done on an adult learner of German and analyzed her accounts of experiencing boredom throughout a whole semester, 13 sessions in length. The trajectory of boredom throughout the course showed that the beginning of the course was the most boring though the learner continued to experience boredom until the end of the semester. Among the theoretical explanations of boredom, under-stimulation, low perceived control over tasks and attention deficit were found to be the most dominant until the end of the course. Among the nontheoretical explanations of boredom, user-unfriendly requirements of online learning prevailed mostly in the beginning of the course until the middle but they were found to be less influential in the end of the course. The process tracing approach showed to be effective in unpacking the black box of the causal mechanisms involved in the boredom experienced in the online L3 learning.

This presents, however, a risk to the umbilicus vascularisation with possible umbilical necrosis. To minimize this risk we associated abdominoplasty with laparoscopic UH repair. The aim of this study was to present the technique of simultaneous abdominoplasty and UH repair and the first results. MATERIALS AND METHODS Simultaneous abdominoplasty and laparoscopic mesh UH repair was analysed in the first 10 cases. The intervention was performed by a plastic surgeon and a general surgeon. It begins as a standard abdominoplasty with flap elevation, umbilicus detachment and diastasis repair, if indicated. The second stage is the UH repair via laparoscopy using an intraperitoneal mesh. The third stage consists of umbilical transposition and closure of the abdominoplasty incision. RESULTS We had no complications at the umbilicus or the hernia mesh. In all cases, umbilical vascularisation was preserved and no hernia recurrence was noted. CONCLUSIONS Our first results suggest that the simultaneous UH repair with abdominoplasty is safe, minimizing the risk to the umbilicus blood supply.

In contrast to lab-based fully charged or totally discharged states, partial load states will be the principal operation states in real-world applications. Hence, a closer look on the partial load states and the effective power rates are worthwhile for a successful implementation of this storage type. A vertical finned shell and tube heat exchanger pipe with a combination of transversal and longitudinal fins is applied. Sodium nitrate with a melting temperature of 306 [Formula: see text] is used as phase change material and thermal oil serves as heat transfer fluid. Temperatures in the storage and the heat transfer fluid as well as the mass flow are measured for data analysis. The state of charge formulation is based on an enthalpy distribution function, where the latent heat of fusion is spread over a specific temperature range. The data show consistently high power rates for all partial load cycles at any state of charge. The mean power rate for charging is 6.78 kW with an 95.45 % confidence interval of [Formula: see text] 1.14 kW for all cycles. The discharging power rate is ?5.72 kW with a 95.45 % confidence interval of [Formula: see text] 1.36 kW for all cycles. The lowest power rate is measured for the full cycle at the end of charging/discharging. It is caused by a narrow volume, which is not penetrated by fins, near the perimeter of the cylindrical heat exchanger. The state of charge formulation correlates with the storage capacity and enables state of charge based cycling. With the energy balance of the storage, the data validity is proven and further storage parameters are determined. The energy density is as high as 110 kW h m(?3) and a power rate of 2.28 kW m(?1) for the finned tube is confirmed.

This modelling allows for identifying direct and indirect emissions hot spots along the complex and intricate global value chains. The main results show how while Spains tourism contribution to GDP accounts for 12.3%, its carbon footprint accounts for 15% of the Spanish total emissions, which is above the global average (8%). In global terms, 29% of the total carbon footprint is imported, so it is, directly or indirectly, embodied in the global production chains. It is concentrated in some close European Union countries, China, BRIIAT, and the United States.

This work provides cross-validation for the recent report demonstrating potent antiviral activity of probenecid against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical models (1).

Probenecid or control media was then reapplied and plates incubated for 48 hours. Cells were fixed with 4% v/v paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet and cytopathic activity quantified by spectrophotometry at 590 nm. Syrian golden hamsters (n=5 per group) were intranasally inoculated with virus (SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2; 103 PFU/hamster) for 24 hours prior to treatment. Hamsters were treated with probenecid or vehicle for 4 doses. Hamsters were ethically euthanised before quantification of total and sub-genomic pulmonary viral RNAs. No inhibition of cytopathic activity was observed for probenecid at any concentration in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, no reduction in either total or sub-genomic RNA was observed in terminal lung samples from hamsters on day 3 (P > 0.05). Body weight of uninfected hamsters remained stable throughout the course of the experiment whereas both probenecid- (6 - 9% over 3 days) and vehicle-treated (5 - 10% over 3 days) infected hamsters lost body weight which was comparable in magnitude (P > 0.5).

The present review detail new arguments for over-activation of STING pathways in COVID-19, following the description of hyper-coagulability and Kawasaki-like diseases in children. Indeed, Kawasaki disease is induced by overreaction of innate cells following exposition to various viruses, including herpes viruses which trigger STING. It predisposes to diffuse vasculitis and aneurysms, whereas STING is over-expressed in arterial aneurisms. The redness at the inoculation site of bacillus Calmette-Gurin, a specific feature of Kawasaki disease, is reproduced by activation of the STING pathway, which is inhibited upstream by aspirin, intravenous immunoglobulins, and Vitamin-D. SARS-CoV2 binding to ACE2 can lead to excessive angiotensin II signaling, which activates the STING pathway in mice. Over-activation of the STING-pathway promotes hyper-coagulability through release of interferon- and tissue factor by monocytes-macrophages. Aspirin and dipyridamole, besides their anti-platelet activity, also reduce tissue factor procoagulant activity, and aspirin inhibits the STING pathway upstream of STING. Aspirin and dipyridamole may be used, in combination with drugs blocking downstream the activation of the STING pathway, like inhibitors of IL-6R and JAK/STAT pathways.

To improve on this concept as a potential therapeutic, we developed a bispecific T cell engager combining ACE2 with an anti-CD3 scFv (ACE2-Bite) to target infected cells and the virus. Similar to CAR-T cell approach, ACE2-Bite endowed cytotoxic cells to selectively kill Spike-expressing targets. Furthermore, ACE2-Bite neutralized the pseudoviruses of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variants including Delta and Omicron, as a decoy protein. Remarkably, ACE2-Bite molecule showed a higher binding and neutralization affinity to Delta and Omicron variants compared to SARS-CoV-2 wild-type Spike proteins, suggesting the potential of this approach as a variant-proof, therapeutic strategy for future SARS-CoV-2 variants, employing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune response.","output":"Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Infection Through CAR-T Like Bispecific T Cell Engagers Incorporating ACE2 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a serious pandemic with millions of cases diagnosed worldwide. To fight COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 countries instituted either a full or partial lockdown, affecting billions of people. In Tyrol, first lockdown measures were taken on 10 March 2020. On 16 March 2020, a curfew went into force which ended on 1 May 2020. On 19 March 2020, Tyrol as a whole was placed in quarantine which ended on 7 April 2020. The governmental actions helped reducing the spread of COVID-19 at the cost of significant effects on social life and behaviour. Accordingly, to provide a comprehensive picture of the population health status not only input from medical and biological sciences is required, but also from other sciences able to provide lifestyle information such as drug use. Herein, wastewater-based epidemiology was used for studying temporal trends of licit and illicit drug consumption during lockdown and quarantine in the area of the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck (174,000 inhabitants). On 35 days between 12 March 2020 and 15 April 2020, loads of 23 markers were monitored in wastewater. Loads determined on 292 days between March 2016 and January 2020 served as reference. During lockdown, changes in the consumption patterns of recreational drugs (i.e. cocaine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, and alcohol) and pharmaceuticals for short-term application (i.e. acetaminophen, codeine, and trimethoprim) were detected. For illicit drugs and alcohol, it is very likely that observed changes were linked to the shutdown of the hospitality industry and event cancelation which led to a reduced demand of these compounds particularly on weekends. For the pharmaceuticals, further work will be necessary to clarify if the observed declines are indicators of improved population health or of some kind of restraining effect that reduced the number of consultations of medical doctors and pharmacies.","output":"Monitoring drug consumption in Innsbruck during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown by wastewater analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants showing increased transmissibility and immune escape is a matter of global concern. Their origin remains unclear, but intra-host virus evolution during persistent infections could be a contributing factor. Here, we studied the long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipient. Frequent respiratory specimens were tested for variant viral genomes by RT-qPCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and virus isolation. Late in infection, several virus variants emerged which escaped neutralization by COVID-19 convalescent and vaccine-induced antisera and had acquired genome mutations similar to those found in variants of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Importantly, infection of susceptible hACE2-transgenic mice with one of the patient escape variants elicited protective immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus, the escape variant or the South African variant of concern, demonstrating broad immune control. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment, the patient generated spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection. Our results indicate that immunocompromised patients are an alarming source of potentially harmful SARS-CoV-2 variants and open up new avenues for the updating of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Within-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunosuppressed COVID-19 patient: a source of immune escape variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Data on the effectiveness and safety of new vaccines against COVID-19 in patients (pts) with hematological diseases are just beginning to accumulate. We planned to obtain such information for pts with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during vaccination. Objective. To evaluate the antibodies formation and adverse events (AEs) after vaccination against COVID-19 in pts with CML Materials and methods. All pts with CML diagnosis who applied to the National Research Center for Hematology (NRCH, Moscow, Russia) for outpatient or remote consultations were suggested to prospectively report the AEs after getting a vaccination against COVID-19 by the most frequently used vector-based vaccine GamCovidVac (Sputnik V). Two vaccine components with the interval of 21 days were given at the vaccination facilities, as prescribed. At least after 3 weeks after the 2 nd injection, pts were advised to perform a blood test for the specific antibodies against spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. A semi-quantitative test detecting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit (RBD) IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit was used in the clinic. The results were considered positive with the cutoff index >1,1. The use of any other lab tests detecting antibodies to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was acceptable as well. Results. In total, 66 pts with chronic phase of CML received a vaccination by Sputnik V in the 7 months period (from 18.12.2020 to 20.07.2021). Me age was 54 years (range 29 - 89 years), 34 (52%) were males. Median (Me) CML duration was 8 years (from the moment of diagnostics up to 20 years). Fifty one (77%) pt received TKI therapy and 15 (23%) were off-therapy at the time of vaccination, including 12 (18%) in a treatment-free remission and 3 (4,5%) pts in the process of diagnosis. Deep and major molecular response (MMR) was in 46 (70%) and 7 (11%) pts, respectively. Two (3%) pts had a molecular response MR2, 11 (17%) had no MR2. Eight (12%) pts had a history of COVID-19 manifestation prior to vaccination. Me time for testing for the antibodies was 27 days (range 5-77) after the 2 nd vaccine injection. The tests were done in 44 (67%) of pts and revealed positive by any of the test systems in 42 (95%) pts. ELISA test was used in 30 (45%) pts and was positive in 25 (83%) of 30 pts. Me cutoff index in the positive samples was 7,7 (range 1,1 - 12) and corresponded to the value observed in healthy people after vaccination (medical stuff, data not shown). In all 3 pts with the history COVID 19, the index of positivity was above the Me value (Fig. 1, 2). Other test systems were used in 14 (21%) pts, in all 14 (100%) the antibodies were found. In 3 of 5 patients with the cutoff index<1 the antibodies were detected by using other test systems, but all with a level slightly above the detection threshold. Me age of these 5 pts was 63 years (range 59- 70), Me time of analysis was 49 days (range 23-59) after 2 nd vaccine shot. All these pts were on treatment by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 pts with MMR and deeper, 1 pt with MR2 and 1 pt without MR2. A weak reverse correlation of the antibody levels with the time after vaccination was noted ( r = - 0,39, p = 0,033). A very weak reverse correlation with age was observed ( r = - 0,28, p = 0,127) (Fig. 1, 2). No AEs after the vaccination were observed in 25 (38%) pts while 41 (62%) pts reported the AEs and 7 (10%) pts did not report their reactions. The AEs were as follows: local pain/discomfort in the injection site in 19 (29%) pts, weakness and/or drowsiness in 20 (30%), fever and/or chills in 16 (24%), other reactions in 8 (12%) including headache, heartbeat, lower back pain, pain in limbs, activation of herpes infection. Conclusion: The single center study revealed no unusual or unexpected AEs in CML pts after the vaccination against COVID-19 by Sputnik V vaccine. The proportion of CML pts with specific antibodies after was 95% which is close to the published results of the 3rd phase study. No significant correlation was found with age (r = -0,28, p = 0,127), however, the absence or very low antibody levels were detected in individual patients aged about 60-70 years. This data raise a question of a necessity for a non-specific protection (masks, respirators, distance etc) and probably considering additional vaccination in some elderly persons. The duration of a humoral response against COVID-19, protective antibody titer and connection with clinical outcomes in CML pts need further evaluation in parallel with a common population.

Given the prominent role that digital technology will have in the future, it is important to investigate parent and child characteristics which impacted parental mediation of children's digital technology use. Therefore, the present study aimed at analysing the frequency of parental mediation strategies (i.e. active and restrictive) during lockdown, their determinants, and how the two strategies affected children's digital skills and time spent online. Data were collected from 461 parent and 461 child participants. Results showed that almost half of parents (46%) practiced parental mediation with the same frequency, while the 42.6% applied it more often. Active mediation was predicted by parental worries about online risks, while restrictive mediation was predicted by time spent online by children, parental worries about online risks, parental negative attitudes towards digital technology and parents' digital skills. Children developed more digital skills when their parents applied higher levels of both active and restrictive mediation, and they spent the lowest amount of time online when their parents employed higher levels of restrictive and lower levels of active mediation. Practical implications for families and children's wellbeing are discussed.","output":"Parental mediation in pandemic: Predictors and relationship with children's digital skills and time spent online in Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Anatomical hepatectomy is an ideal curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have standardized our laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy (LAH) procedure, gradually extending its indications. In the present study, we describe our experience and the perioperative and oncological outcomes of LAH for HCC compared to those of open anatomical hepatectomy (OAH) during the gradual introduction of LAH. METHODS Seventy patients with primary HCC underwent anatomical hepatectomy in our institution from November 2008 to April 2014. As we gained experience with LAH, our indications for choosing LAH over OAH gradually expanded. Ultimately, 40 and 30 patients underwent LAH and OAH, respectively. Perioperative and oncological outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, sex, background of liver disease, liver function, tumor size, tumor number, or type of liver resection between the two groups. Major complications and mortality rates were similar between the LAH and OAH groups (12.5% vs. 20%; p = 0.582, and 0% vs. 3.3%; p = 0.429, respectively). The median follow-up time after surgery was 40.5 months in the LAH group and 32.9 months in the OAH group (p = 0.835). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.9, 84.7, and 70.9%, in the LAH group, and 89.8, 68.0, and 63.1% in the OAH group, respectively (p = 0.255). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 79.5, 58.0, and 42.5%, in the LAH group, and 72.4, 56.1, and 50.4% in the OAH group, respectively (p = 0.980). CONCLUSIONS Through gradual introduction of LAH, we obtained comparable results to those achieved with OAH.

This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens' attitude about a number of principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in current COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and Methods: An electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator. Results: 1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study. More than 95% of participants agreed upon the necessity to avoid discrimination and avoid prioritization according to patients' gender, economic and political status. While 40.9% of citizens and 49.6% of healthcare workers believed that a ventilator can be disconnected from a patient with a poor prognosis to help a patient who has a better prognosis (P-value=0.13), 34.3% of people and 29.6% of healthcare workers believed that the earlier admitted patients have the right to receive the device even if the likeliness of his/her survival is less than the next patient (P-value=0.009). Conclusions: This study showed that people accept maximizing health benefits as a measure of ventilator allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19.

This paper develops a conceptual model that reflects short-term changes in waste flows from households that are due to COVID-19 disruptions, focusing on the case of multi-residential buildings in Toronto, Canada. Multi-residential buildings are of interest because they differ from single family homes in several key ways that can produce some slightly different impacts of COVID19 on waste flows and practices. Primary research for the study included interviews with 19 staff, residents and property managers of ten multi-residential buildings. All of the research took place while Toronto was still in partial-lockdown. Analysis of the interviews revealed five themes around the impact of COVID-19: (1) changes in garbage, recycling and organics flows, (2) new health and safety concerns, (3) changes in reuse and reduction practices, (4) changes in special waste and deposit-return bottle collections, and (5) changes in waste diversion and reduction education. Given the time frame of our study, we recognize these as short-term impacts and call for future research to determine how many of the changes are likely to perpetuate over the medium and longer term.","output":"This section comprises references that occur in the reference list but not in the body of the text.

Although MG has been reported across many regions and population groups, it is not yet routinely tested for in China. Our study contributes to current research by reporting the prevalence and correlates of MG infection in patients attending a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in Guangdong from Jan 2017-May 2018. METHODS: Urethral (from 489 men) and endo-cervical (from 189 women) samples, blood samples, and patient histories (via questionnaires) were collected. Doctors clinically diagnosed anogenital warts (GW) during the examination (n = 678). The presence of MG was evaluated using an in-house via polymerase chain reaction protocol. We also tested all participants for herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), syphilis and HIV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate factors associated with MG. RESULTS: MG was detected in 7.2% (49/678) of the patients (men, 7.4%; women, 6.9%). The MG positivity rate was 14.2% among symptomatic patients, and 5.6% for asymptomatic patients, respectively. Only 36.7% (18/49) Mg positive patients were symptomatic. Among the MG-infected patients, 10.2% were co-infected with CT, 6.1% with NG, 8.2% with HSV-2, 4.1% with syphilis and 22.4% with GW. Presentation with clinical symptoms was significantly associated with MG infection [OR = 2.52 (2.03C3.13)]. In our analysis, MG was not associated with other STIs. CONCLUSIONS: MG is a relatively common infection among individuals attending an STI clinic in Guangdong Province.

Despite causing mortality, it has halted the therapeutic facilities because of the in-person interaction involved in it. Communication difficulties have been aggravated which seeks for immediate attention as it can lead to a lack of improvement in communication delays observed in children with Hearing Impairment (HI). Aim: To highlight the communication challenges faced by children with hearing impairment and consequently investigate the effectiveness and need for telepractice during the Lockdown. It also aims to improve the service delivery models. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in MERF Institute of Speech and Hearing, Chennai from July 2020 to August 2020. A convenience sampling was opted for enrolling the participants in the study. The questionnaire was administered to the parents in two modalities-telephonic survey and electronic format. The data analysis was done by frequency counting and percentage calculation. Results: The findings of the current study suggest that the speech and language performances have worsened for 35% (due to lack of formal stimulation, device malfunction, etc.,), improved for 35% (due to intensive home training, adequate stimulation, etc.,) and no difference has been noted for 30% of children with HI during the lockdown. 23 (57.5%) parents were aware of the Telepractice services, and those unaware were oriented. 12 (40%) respondents opted for other modalities of assistance instead of Telepractice services. Conclusion: The communication challenges faced, calls for seamless intervention during the lockdown. The introduction of Teletherapy proves to be beneficial and hence, the ultimate goal is to integrate telerehabilitation services into clinical facilities.

Since its first outbreak from Wuhan, China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has gone through structural changes arising due to mutations in its surface glycoprotein. These mutations have led to the emergence of different genetic variants threatening public health due to increased transmission and virulence. As new drug development is a long process, repurposing existing antiviral drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 might be a possible solution to mitigate the current situation. Methods: : This study focused on utilizing molecular docking to determine the effect of potential drugs on several variants of concern (VOCs). The effect of various drugs such as baricitinib, favipiravir, lopinavir, remdesivir and dexamethasone, which might have the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections as evident from previous studies, was investigated for different VOCs. Results: : Remdesivir showed promising results for B.1.351 variant (binding energy: -7.3 kcal/mol) with residues Gln319 and Val503 facilitating strong binding. Favipiravir showed favorable results against B.1.1.7 (binding energy: -5.6 kcal/mol), B.1.351 (binding energy: -5.1 kcal/mol) and B.1.617.2 (binding energy: -5 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation for favipiravir/B.1.1.7 was conducted and showed significant results in agreement with our findings. Conclusions: : From structural modeling and molecular docking experiments, it is evident that mutations outside the receptor binding domain of surface glycoprotein do not have a sharp impact on drug binding affinity. Thus, the potential use of these drugs should be explored further for their antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.","output":"Interaction of surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with potential drug candidates: A molecular docking study (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of new potentially more transmissible and vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 is an ever-present threat. Thus, it remains essential to better understand innate immune mechanisms that can inhibit the virus. One component of the innate immune system with broad antipathogen, including antiviral, activity is a group of cationic immune peptides termed defensins. The ability of defensins to neutralize enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and to inactivate numerous bacterial toxins correlate with their ability to promote the unfolding of proteins with high conformational plasticity. We found that human neutrophil -defensin HNP1 binds to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with submicromolar affinity that is more than 20 fold stronger than its binding to serum albumin. As such, HNP1, as well as a -defensin retrocyclin RC-101, both interfere with Spike-mediated membrane fusion, Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus infection, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. These effects correlate with the abilities of the defensins to destabilize and precipitate Spike protein and inhibit the interaction of Spike with the ACE2 receptor. Serum reduces the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HNP1, though at high concentrations, HNP1 was able to inactivate the virus even in the presence of serum. Overall, our results suggest that defensins can negatively affect the native conformation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike, and that - and -defensins may be valuable tools in developing SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies.","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by human defensin HNP1 and retrocyclin RC-101"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Hypertension emerged from early reports as a potential risk factor for worse outcomes for persons with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among the putative links between hypertension and COVID-19 is a key counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ACE2 facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, into host cells Since RAS inhibitors have been suggested to increase ACE2 expression, healthcare providers and patients have grappled with the decision of whether to discontinue these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic However, experimental models of analogous viral pneumonias suggest RAS inhibitors may exert protective effects against acute lung injury We review how RAS and ACE2 biology may affect outcomes in COVID-19 through pulmonary and other systemic effects In addition, we briefly detail the data for and against continuation of RAS inhibitors in persons with COVID-19 and summarize the current consensus recommendations from select specialty organizations","output":"COVID-19 and Hypertension: The Role of ACE2 and the Renin-Angiotensin System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review chronicles the indirect transmission method which seems to be overlooked by most people and makes attempts to document the various transmission ways with a hope that such information may strengthen the knowledge base of researchers towards methods of eradicating the pandemic.

Most of us deal with the pathogen by containment (associated with clinical latency) or sterilization, but tragically millions each year do not. After decades of studies on host genetic susceptibility to Mtb infection, genetic variation has been discovered to play a role in tuberculous immunoreactivity and tuberculosis (TB) disease. Genes encoding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) enable a consistent, molecularly direct interaction between humans and Mtb which suggests the potential for co-evolution. In this review, we explore the roles ascribed to PRRs during Mtb infection and ask whether such a longstanding and intimate interface between our immune system and this pathogen plays a critical role in determining the outcome of Mtb infection. The scientific evidence to date suggests that PRR variation is clearly implicated in altered immunity to Mtb but has a more subtle role in limiting the pathogen and pathogenesis. In contrast to effectors like IFN-, IL-12, Nitric Oxide and TNF that are critical for Mtb control, sensors like PRRs are less critical for the outcome of Mtb infection. This is potentially due to redundancy of the numerous PRRs in the innate arsenal, such that Mtb rarely goes unnoticed. Genetic association studies investigating PRRs during Mtb infection should therefore be designed to investigate endophenotypes of infection C such as immunological or clinical variation C rather than just TB disease, if we hope to understand the molecular interface between innate immunity and Mtb.","output":"Underwhelming or Misunderstood?

In this overarching context, governments are faced with making rapid and high-stake decisions dictated by emergency that in a state of normalcy they would not, or could not pursue. Governments tend to gather, therefore, an incredible amount of unchecked power in times of fast-moving ecological crises that raises concerns about where the legitimacy of such excessive power comes from. Moreover, the elected politicians rely on the expert advice in a pandemic. This takes away democratic political authority from the sovereign people and instead places it on allegedly objective unelected experts. In contrast, experts have (1) a dubious reputation in predicting the future and (2) varying degrees of biases and self-interests, which make them susceptible, for instance, to \\"framing problems\\" in relation to the urgent public issues at stake. This article suggests new ways of thinking about COVID-19 technology policy, drawing from the field of political science and democratic theory.

Objectives of the study were to investigate the effect of quarantine on sleep quality (SQ) and body mass index (BMI), and if change in SQ was related to working modalities. Materials: We enrolled 121 adults (age 44.913.3 years and 35.5% males). Anthropometric parameters, working modalities and physical activity were studied. Sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. At baseline, the enrolled subjects were assessed in outpatient clinic and after 40 days of quarantine/lockdown by phone interview. Results: : Overall, 49.6% of the subjects were good sleepers (PSQI < 5) at the baseline and significantly decreased after quarantine ( p <0.001). In detail, sleep onset latency ( p <0.001), sleep efficiency ( p =0.03), sleep disturbances ( p <0.001), and daytime dysfunction ( p <0.001) significantly worsened. There was also a significant increase in BMI values in normal weight ( p =0.023), in subjects grade I ( p =0.027) and II obesity ( p =0.020). In all cohort, physical activity was significantly decreased ( p =0.004). However, analyzing the data according gender difference, males significantly decreased physical activity as well as females in which there was only a trend without reaching statistical significance (53.5% vs 25.6%;p =0.015 and 50.0% vs 35.9%, p =0.106;in males and females, respectively). In addition, smart working activity resulted in a significant worsening of SQ, particularly in males ( p <0.001). Conclusions: : Quarantine was associated to a worsening of SQ, particularly in males doing smart working, and to an increase in BMI values.","output":"Does Sars-Cov-2 threaten our dreams?

Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020. Adult residents of Greece anonymously completed an online survey that was distributed through email and social media. A total of 1396 fully complete questionnaires were collected. Demographic questions, questions regarding the knowledge about the disease etiology, diagnosis and prevention, and questions related to the respondents' attitude and perception toward the restriction measures and the confidence in different kinds of institutions providing information were included in the survey items. The appropriate statistical analyses were conducted according to the type of variable and the research question. Results: The highest knowledge scores were found in females (74.8%, p = 0.015), individuals over 60 years old (77.3%, p<0.001) and individuals having completed post-secondary or tertiary education (76.5%, p<0.001). Five attitude patterns toward the pandemic were identified: 'trust in institutions', 'trust in the restriction measures', 'trust in media and the internet', 'trust in traditional institutions', and 'measures deniers'. Age, education, and knowledge score were the factors defining the attitudinal patterns revealed.

A main interest is to identify and assess the potential of infectious disease outbreaks. While popular methods to analyze sequence data often involve phylogenetic tree inference, they are vulnerable to errors from recombination and impose a high computational cost, making it difficult to obtain real-time results when the number of sequences is in or above the thousands. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to outbreak detection using genomic data based on deep learning methods developed for image classification. The key idea is to use a pairwise genetic distance matrix calculated from viral sequences as an image, and develop convolutional neutral network (CNN) models to classify areas of the images that show signatures of active outbreak, leading to identification of subsets of sequences taken from an active outbreak. We showed that our method is efficient in finding HIV-1 outbreaks with R0  3, and overall a specificity exceeding 85% and sensitivity better than 70%. We validated our approach using data from HIV-1 CRF01 in Europe, containing both endemic sequences and a well-known dual outbreak in intravenous drug users. Our model accurately identified known outbreak sequences in the background of slower spreading HIV. Importantly, we detected both outbreaks early on, before they were over, implying that had this method been applied in real-time as data became available, one would have been able to intervene and possibly prevent the extent of these outbreaks. This approach is scalable to processing hundreds of thousands of sequences, making it useful for current and future real-time epidemiological investigations, including public health monitoring using large databases and especially for rapid outbreak identification. Author summary The analysis of pathogen genomic data to analyze epidemics at scale is constrained by the computational cost associated with phylogenetic tree reconstruction. As a fast and efficient alternative, we employed convolutional neural networks to analyze evolutionary pairwise distance matrices as images to perform classifications of the current epidemiological situation of a growing public health sequence database. We used simulated data to train and test our model, and as validation we accurately mapped the start and end of two linked well-documented HIV-1 outbreaks in the backdrop of ongoing slower HIV spread. Thus, our new approach is efficient, accurate, scalable, and can analyze data in real time.","output":"A deep learning approach to real-time HIV outbreak detection using genetic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and less-than-optimal care of people living with HIV (PLHIV) continue to challenge public health and clinical care organizations in the communities that are most impacted by HIV. In the era of evidence-based public health, it is imperative to monitor viral load (VL) in PLHIV according to global and national guidelines and assess the factors associated with variation in VL levels. Purpose: This study had two objectives(a) to describe the levels of HIV VL in persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and (b) to analyze the significance of variation in VL by patients demographic and clinical characteristics, outcomes of HIV care, and geographic characteristics of HIV care facilities. Methods: The study population for this quantitative study was 49,460 PLHIV in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) receiving ART from 241 CDC-funded HIV/AIDS clinics in the Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa provinces of the DRC. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, including Tamhanes T2 test for pairwise comparisons using de-identified data on all patients enrolled in the system by the time the data were extracted for this study by the HIV programs in May 2019. Results: The VL was undetectable (<40 copies/mL) for 56.4% of the patients and 24.7% had VL between 40 copies/mL and less than 1000 copies per mL, indicating that overall, 81% had VL < 1000 and were virologically suppressed. The remaining 19% had a VL of 1000 copies/mL or higher. The mean VL was significantly (p < 0.001) higher for males than for females (32,446 copies/mL vs. 20,786, respectively), persons <15 years of age compared to persons of ages  15 years at the time of starting ART (45,753 vs. 21,457, respectively), patients who died (125,086 vs. 22,090), those who were lost to follow-up (LTFU) (69,882 vs. 20,018), those with tuberculosis (TB) co-infection (64,383 vs. 24,090), and those who received care from urban clinics (mean VL = 25,236) compared to rural (mean VL = 3291) or semi-rural (mean VL = 26,180) clinics compared to urban. WHO clinical stages and duration on ART were not statistically significant at p  0.05 in this cohort. Conclusions: The VL was >1000 copies/mL for 19% of PLHIV receiving ART, indicating that these CDC-funded clinics and programs in the Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa provinces of DRC have more work to do. Strategically designed innovations in services are desirable, with customized approaches targeting PLHIV who are younger, male, those LTFU, with HIV/TB co-infection, and those receiving care from urban clinics.","output":"HIV Viral Suppression among People Living with HIV on Antiretroviral Therapy in Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa Provinces of Democratic Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The key component in deep learning research is the availability of training data sets With a limited number of publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray images, the generalization and robustness of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 cases developed based on these images are questionable We aimed to use thousands of readily available chest radiograph images with clinical findings associated with COVID-19 as a training data set, mutually exclusive from the images with confirmed COVID-19 cases, which will be used as the testing data set We used a deep learning model based on the ResNet-101 convolutional neural network architecture, which was pretrained to recognize objects from a million of images and then retrained to detect abnormality in chest X-ray images The performance of the model in terms of area under the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 0 82, 77 3%, 71 8%, and 71 9%, respectively The strength of this study lies in the use of labels that have a strong clinical association with COVID-19 cases and the use of mutually exclusive publicly available data for training, validation, and testing","output":"COVID-19 Deep Learning Prediction Model Using Publicly Available Radiologist-Adjudicated Chest X-Ray Images as Training Data: Preliminary Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: No data are available about whether Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic have led to changes in clinical profiles or results of exercise testing once the usual activity was reassumed, as well as if wearing a facemask has any impact on the tests.

An innovative and practical approach to ensure access at school is to maintain a supply of stock albuterol that can be used by any student who experiences respiratory distress. To make this possible, state laws allowing for stock albuterol are needed to improve medication access. Objectives: To provide policy recommendations and outline steps for passing and implementing stock albuterol laws. Methods: We assembled a diverse stakeholder group and reviewed guidelines, literature, statutes, regulations, and implementation documents related to school-based medication access. Stakeholders were divided into two groupslegislation and implementationon the basis of expertise. Each group met virtually to review documents and draft recommendations. Recommendations were compiled and revised in iterative remote meetings with all stakeholders. Main Results: We offer several recommendations for crafting state legislation and facilitating program implementation. 1) Create a coalition of stakeholders to champion legislation and implement stock albuterol programs. The coalition should include school administrators, school nurses and health personnel, parents, or caregivers of children with asthma, pediatric primary care and subspecialty providers (e.g., pulmonologists/allergists), pharmacists, health department staff, and local/regional/national advocacy organizations. 2) Legislative components critical for effective implementation of stock albuterol programs include specifying that medication can be administered in good faith to any child in respiratory distress, establishing training requirements for school staff, providing immunity from civil liability for staff and prescribers, ensuring pharmacy laws allow prescriptions to be dispensed to schools, and suggesting inhalers with valved holding chambers/spacers for administration. 3) Select an experienced and committed legislator to sponsor legislation and guide revisions as needed during passage and implementation. This person should be from the majority party and serve on the legislatures health or education committee. 4) Develop plans to disseminate legislation and regulations/policies to affected groups, including school administrators, school nurses, pharmacists, emergency responders, and primary/subspecialty clinicians. Periodically evaluate implementation effectiveness and need for adjustments. Conclusions: Stock albuterol in schools is a safe, practical, and potentially life-saving option for children with asthma, whether asthma is diagnosed or undiagnosed, who lack access to their personal quick-relief medication. Legislation is imperative for aiding in the adoption and implementation of school stock albuterol policies, and key policy inclusions can lay the groundwork for success. Future work should focus on passing legislation in all states, implementing policy in schools, and evaluating the impact of such programs on academic and health outcomes.","output":"Ensuring Access to Albuterol in Schools: From Policy to Implementation.

To date, no studies have evaluated the quality of information available on YouTube regarding lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Our aim was to determine the quality and content of YouTube videos regarding LAM and to compare the information provided with current knowledge and guidelines about the disease. METHODS: The first 200 video hits on YouTube in English for the search term lymphangioleiomyomatosis were recorded. All videos suitable for patient education on LAM were included. Video quality was analyzed independently by two investigators utilizing the Health on the Net (HONcode) score, which assesses whether websites provide understandable, accessible, and trustworthy health information; the DISCERN score, which evaluates the quality of information about treatment decisions; and a newly developed LAM-related content score (LRCS) with 31 guideline elements. RESULTS: The search identified 64 eligible videos. The engagement rate of 0.3 was low, with a median number of views of 408 (range 42C73,943), a median of 4 likes (range 0C2082), and the majority (53%) receiving a low HONcode score ( 2) and only 10% of videos achieving a high score (> 5).

Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis have been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. We examined the genetic relationship between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: We estimated the genetic correlation between CUD (n case=14,080, n control=343,726) and COVID-19 hospitalization (n case=9,373, n control=1,197,256) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Using independent GWASs conducted prior to the pandemic, we controlled for several covariates (i.e., tobacco use phenotypes, problematic alcohol use, BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, risk-taking, ADHD, and Townsend Deprivation Index; as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetic causality between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated using latent causal variable models. Results: Genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 was correlated with genetic liability to CUD (rG=0.423(.0965), p=1.33e-6); this association remained when accounting for genetic liability to related risk factors and covariates (b = 0.381 - 0.539, p=0.012 - 0.049). Latent causal variable analysis revealed causal effect estimates that were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Problematic cannabis use and vulnerability to serious COVID-19 complications share genetic underpinnings that are unique from common correlates. While CUD may plausibly contribute to severe COVID-19 presentations, causal inference models yielded no evidence of putative causation. Curbing excessive cannabis use may mitigate COVID-19's impact.","output":"Genetic Liability to Cannabis Use Disorder and COVID-19 Hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: No risk stratification tool has been validated in hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), despite a high rate of intensive care requirement and in-hospital mortality. We aimed to determine whether the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) at admission can accurately predict in-hospital mortality and ICU transfer. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study from January 24 to April 16, 2020, at Lille University Hospital. All consecutive adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were initially admitted to non-ICU wards were included. The primary outcome was a composite criterion consisting of ICU transfer or in-hospital mortality. We evaluated the prognostic performance of NEWS by calculating the area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimal threshold value of NEWS, and its association with the primary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 202 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 65 (interquartile range 52-78), 38.6% were women and 136 had at least one comorbidity. The median NEWS was 4 (2-6). A total of 65 patients were transferred to the ICU or died in the hospital.

This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. METHODS: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. RESULTS: Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.","output":"COVID-19 health and social care access for autistic people: European policy review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The authors examined parents views about children nose-masking in public gatherings in Ghana between January and May 2021.

With the widespread implementation of advanced life-support techniques in emergency medical services (EMS), orotracheal intubation is now performed not only by professional practitioners but, in many occasions, nonprofessionals. With extensively diversified skill equipped, we tested whether the Sunscope, a patented tracheal intubation device with a digital display, is able to facilitate tracheal intubation by na?ve EMS personnel with various training backgrounds. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine rate of success and time required to insert an orotracheal tube into a mannequin using Sunscope. The participants were placed into the professional group (i.e., anesthesiologists and emergency medical paramedics; EMT-P) or the nonprofessional group (i.e., emergency medical technicians; EMT). Intubation required three steps: equipment preparation, vocal cord exposure, and tube insertion. The time required for each step was recorded by a senior staff member, and the data were analyzed by nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Each consecutive step in the operating procedure was significantly shorter for the professional group in comparison with the nonprofessional group during the first trial: equipment preparation, 10.5  2.1 vs. 11.9  4.1 seconds; vocal cord exposure, 7.4  7.7 vs. 12.2  7.7 seconds; tube insertion, 8.8  4.8 vs. 17.6  9.4 seconds; and total time required for intubation, 26.7  8.8 vs. 35.8  19.6 seconds. The professional practitioners showed no significant improvement, in terms of time reduction, on the following three trials. On the other hand, the nonprofessional practitioners showed no significant differences, in terms of time required to expose the vocal cords and total operation time, following the third trial in comparison with the professional practitioners. CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrates that professional practitioners are able to use the Sunscope on their first attempt. Despite a lack of training in conventional endotracheal intubation, emergency medical technicians (EMT-I and -II) were able to complete intubation on their first attempt; a significant reduction in the time required to intubate was noted after repeated practice. All levels of na?ve EMTs were able to readily visualize the vocal cords through Sunscope and, thereby, reliably insert the endotracheal tube in less than 1 minute, regardless of their skills before testing.","output":"Direct endotracheal intubation using a novel detachable optic probe (Sunscope) by emergency medical technicians with various training backgrounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern technologies are now available to provide appropriate information and improved services in healthcare delivery.

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another flu-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location-Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests.

In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","output":"How Reliable are Test Numbers for Revealing the COVID-19 Ground Truth and Applying Interventions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimating the hospitalization risk for people with certain comorbidities infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is important for developing public health policies and guidance based on risk stratification. Traditional biostatistical methods require knowing both the number of infected people who were hospitalized and the number of infected people who were not hospitalized. However, the latter may be undercounted, as it is limited to only those who were tested for viral infection. In addition, comorbidity information for people not hospitalized may not always be readily available for traditional biostatistical analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a Bayesian approach that only requires the observed frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. By applying our approach to two different large-scale datasets in the U.S., our results consistently indicated that cardiovascular diseases carried the highest hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and obesity, respectively.","output":"A Bayesian Framework for Estimating the Risk Ratio of Hospitalization for People with Comorbidity Infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter examines Mr. Trumps combativeness and fight club presidency.

In this study, we report how students enrolled in online courses in higher education voluntarily used mobile devices for their coursework and course-related activities, the challenges in using these devices, and how they managed those challenges. We surveyed 103 college students enrolled in one or more fully online courses regarding their habits in using mobile devices for online learning. Findings reveal most participants use mobile devices for convenience, portability, and overall ease of use. The way the devices are used for course-related activities varies, however, with reasons ranging from taking notes and reading course materials, to downloading those materials, communicating, socializing, and other purposes. Challenges when using these devices often relate to access issues and overall limitations of the technology. Yet, despite these limitations, some reported that, depending on the task, even though using a mobile device often took longer compared to a laptop or PC, the convenience of using it was a greater benefit. Participants were surveyed about their experiences prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing additional perspectives for possible future research focused on emergency circumstances to remote teaching or alternative forms of instruction.

Methods We performed global micro-RNA (miRNA) analysis in plasma in two cohorts encompassing 375 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with late diabetic kidney disease and targeted proteomics analysis in plasma in four cohorts encompassing 746 individuals with late and early diabetic kidney disease. We examined structural lesions in kidney biopsies from the 105 individuals with early diabetic kidney disease. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the effects of miRNA mimics or inhibitors on regulation of candidate proteins. Results In the late diabetic kidney disease cohorts, we identified 17 circulating miRNAs represented by four exemplars (miR-1287-5p, miR-197-5p, miR-339-5p, miR-328-3p), which were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD. These miRNAs targeted proteins in the axon guidance pathway. Circulating levels of six of these proteins-most notably EFNA4 and EPHA2-were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD in all cohorts. Furthermore, circulating levels of these proteins correlated with severity of structural lesions in kidney biopsies. In contrast, expression levels of genes encoding these proteins had no apparent effects on the lesions. In in vitro experiments, mimics of miR-1287-5p and miR-197-5p and inhibitors of miR-339-5p and miR328-3p upregulated concentrations of EPHA2 in either cell lysate, supernatant, or both. Conclusions This study reveals novel mechanisms involved in progression to ESKD and points to the importance of systemic factors in the development of diabetic kidney disease.

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled laboratory animal research institutions to implement new work practices in order to maintain essential animal care operations. These modifications ranged from shift changes to last-resort measures, such as culling animal colonies, to accommodate reduced staffing. Such changes could cause personnel to experience increased stress, isolation, and helplessness-all of which can increase CF risk. In the current study, 200 persons involved with animal research completed an online survey to gauge whether CF among laboratory animal personnel had increased during the pandemic. The survey examined professional quality of life, self-assessed levels of CF, institutional changes, perceived changes in animal welfare, and institutional measures intended to alleviate CF. A total of 86% of participants had experienced CF at some point in their career, with 41% experiencing a CF event (new or worsening symptoms of CF) during the pandemic. In addition, 90% of participants who reported a CF event also reported subsequent effects on their personal or professional lives. Health, employment, and animal-related stress that arose due to the pandemic were all found to influence CF scores significantly. Although 96% of respondents were considered essential workers, 67% did not feel as valued for their work as other essential personnel. Furthermore, 88% of personnel responsible for the euthanasia of healthy animals who experienced a CF event reported that CF also affected their personal life, professional life, or both, and 78% responded that interventions from internal CF programs or leadership did not help to alleviate symptoms of CF. The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant institutional changes will likely have lasting effects on persons and organizations. By determining and subsequently mitigating sources of CF, we can better assist the laboratory animal community during future crises.","output":"Compassion Fatigue in Laboratory Animal Personnel during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although SARS-CoV-2 infection often causes milder symptoms in children and adolescents, young people might still play a key part in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. An efficacious vaccine for children and adolescents could therefore assist pandemic control. For further evaluation of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate BBIBP-CorV, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of BBIBP-CorV in participants aged 3C17 years. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase 1/2 trial was done at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan, China. In phases 1 and 2, healthy participants were stratified according to age (3C5 years, 6C12 years, or 13C17 years) and dose group. Individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV infection were excluded. All participants were randomly assigned, using stratified block randomisation (block size eight), to receive three doses of 2 g, 4 g, or 8 g of vaccine or control (1:1:1:1) 28 days apart. The primary outcome, safety, was analysed in the safety set, which consisted of participants who had received at least one vaccination after being randomly assigned, and had any safety evaluation information. The secondary outcomes were geometric meant titre (GMT) of the neutralising antibody against infectious SARS-CoV-2 and were analysed based on the full analysis set. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Aug 14, 2020, and Sept 24, 2020, 445 participants were screened, and 288 eligible participants were randomly assigned to vaccine (n=216, 24 for each dose level [2/4/8 g] in each of three age cohorts [3C5, 6C12, and 13C17 years]) or control (n=72, 24 for each age cohort [3C5, 6C12, and 13C17 years]) in phase 1. In phase 2, 810 participants were screened and 720 eligible participants were randomly assigned and allocated to vaccine (n=540, 60 for each dose level [2/4/8 g] in each of three age cohorts [3C5, 6C12, and 13C17 years]) or control (n=180, 60 for each age cohort [3C5, 6C12, and 13C17 years]). The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain (ten [4%] 251 participants in all vaccination groups of the 3C5 years cohort; 23 [91%] of 252 participants in all vaccination groups and one [12%] of 84 in the control group of the 6C12 years cohort; 20 [79%] of 252 participants in all vaccination groups of the 13C17 years cohort). The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (32 [127%] of 251 participants in all vaccination groups and six [71%] of 84 participants in the control group of the 3C5 years cohort; 13 [52%] of 252 participants in the vaccination groups and one [12%] of 84 in the control group of the 6C12 years cohort; 26 [103%] of 252 participants in all vaccination groups and eight [95%] of 84 in the control group of the 13C17 years cohort). Adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The neutralising antibody GMT against the SARS-CoV-2 virus ranged from 1053 to 1802 in the 3C5 years cohort, 841 to 1686 in the 6C12 years cohort, and 880 to 1557 in the 13C17 years cohort on day 28 after the second vaccination; and ranged from 1435 to 2244 in the 3C5 years cohort, 127 to 1848 in the 6C12 years cohort, and 1507 to 199 in the 13C17 years cohort on day 28 after the third vaccination. INTERPRETATION: The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV is safe and well tolerated at all tested dose levels in participants aged 3C17 years. BBIBP-CorV also elicited robust humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses. Our findings support the use of a 4 g dose and two-shot regimen BBIBP-CorV in phase 3 trials in the population younger than 18 years to further ascertain its safety and protection efficacy against COVID-19.

METHODS: In\\\\depth interviews and focus groups with 16 participants from rural communities in British Columbia, Canada, were performed. Participants included those who had been pregnant or given birth after March 11, 2020. Data from the interviews and focus groups were analyzed using the principles of thematic analysis to understand the perinatal experiences of rural families during the initial months of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. RESULTS: Analysis of the data revealed 4 major themes: perceived risk of infection, navigating uncertainty, experience of care received, and resilience and silver linings. In general, participants conceptualized rural communities as safer bubbles. Exceptions included specific vectors of risk such as tourism travel and border communities. Challenges experienced by rural families including anxiety around changing health guidelines, reduced social support, and potential loss of their partners support at births. Additional concerns specific to rural experiences added to this burden, including fear of traveling to referral centers for care and increased difficulties accessing resources.

Methods: All RT-PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in NHS Lothian, Scotland, United Kingdom between the 7 th of February and 19 th April 2020 (inclusive) was reviewed, and hospitalised patients were identified. All upper respiratory tract RT-PCR tests were analysed for each patient to determine the sequence of negative and positive results. For those who were tested twice or more but never received a positive result, case records were reviewed, and a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 allocated based on clinical features, discharge diagnosis, and radiology and haematology results. For those who had a negative RT-PCR test but a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, respiratory samples were retested using a multiplex respiratory panel, a second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, and a human RNase P control. Results: Compared to the gold standard of a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of a single upper respiratory tract RT-PCR for COVID-19 was 82.2% (95% confidence interval 79.0-85.1%). The sensitivity of two upper respiratory tract RT-PCR tests increased sensitivity to 90.6% (CI 88.0-92.7%). A further 2.2% and 0.9% of patients who received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were positive on a third and fourth test;this may be an underestimate of the value of further testing as the majority of patients 93.0% (2999/3226) only had one or two RT-PCR tests. Conclusions: The sensitivity of a single RT-PCR test of upper respiratory tract samples in hospitalised patients is 82.2%. Sensitivity increases to 90.6% when patients are tested twice.

Main Outcomes and Measures, A small sample of aqueous humor (approximately 0.2cc) was acquired at the beginning of anterior segment surgery in all participants. Aqueous humor was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Demographic information was acquired from participants for secondary analyses. RESULTS: A total of 70 samples were acquired. Of these, 39 were excluded due to insufficient material or inconclusive results. Out of 31 samples that were successfully analyzed, 6 (19.4%) demonstrated detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. None of the six individuals (0%) with detectable viral RNA in aqueous humor reported symptoms during the year, compared to 2 of 25 individuals (8%) with negative samples (p=1). Positive samples were distributed throughout the study period, including both the first and the last day of enrollment.

We sought to determine if SMI-aided visualization of flow velocities in spiral artery (SA) and fetal arterioles in intravillous (IV) space could predict fetal growth restriction (FGR), gestational hypertension (GHT) and/or preeclampsia (PE). MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a prospective longitudinal study over a 5-year period. We measured SA and IV flow velocity using SMI-aided Color Doppler between 11 to 13 + 6, 18 to 22 + 6/7 and 28 to 34+ 6/7 weeks of gestation. SA and IV flow velocities were reported as resistance indices (RI). RI values were analyzed with multilevel modeling: individual regression curves were estimated and combined to obtain the reference intervals for SA and IV flow velocities in normal pregnancies. FGR was defined as estimated fetal weight < 10th percentile. Student t-tests compared deviation from expected flow velocity between normal and complicated pregnancies. RESULTS Among 540 pregnancies included; 18 (3.3%) had FGR, 31 (5.7%) PE and 61 (11.3%) GHT. In uncomplicated pregnancies, the RI of SA decreased progressively with advancing gestational age. Alternatively, IV RI increased with gestational age. Mean RI values for SA was significantly higher in the FGR and PE groups compared with uncomplicated pregnancies in the third trimester. There was no significant difference in mean RI between uncomplicated pregnancies and those with GHT at any gestational age. When all adverse outcomes were combined, increased SA RI was significantly associated with these outcomes only in the third trimester when compared with the control group [mean RI (SD)= 0.29(0.12) versus 0.27(0.11), respectively; p=0.04]. When SA RI is used to screen for FGR, the area under the receiver operating curves are: 0.68, 0.73 and 0.73, in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively.

We explored the subcellular localizations of four representative NSD2 transcripts with immunofluorescence microscopy. Next, we used label-free quantification to perform immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analyses of the transcripts. Using the interaction partners for each transcript detected in the IP-MS results, we identified 890 isoform-specific PPI partners (83% are novel). These PPI networks were further divided into four categories of the exon-specific interactome. In these exon-specific PPI partners, two genes, RPL10 and HSPA8, were successfully confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. RPL10 primarily interacted with Isoforms 1, 3, and 5, and HSPA8 interacted with all four isoforms, respectively. Using our extended NSD2 protein interactions, we constructed an isoform-level PPI landscape for NSD2 to serve as reference interactome data for NSD2 spliceosome-level studies. Furthermore, the RNA splicing processes supported by these isoform partners shed light on the diverse roles NSD2 plays in WHS and myeloma development. We also validated the interactions using Western blotting, RPL10, and the three NSD2 (Isoform 1, 3, and 5). Our results expand gene-level NSD2 PPI networks and provide a basis for the treatment of NSD2-related developmental diseases.","output":"Alternatively Splicing Interactomes Identify Novel Isoform-Specific Partners for NSD2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the financial investments of the LIFE projects, Europe has become an experimental arena for biological conservation.

In the context of wound healing, it has been demonstrated that treatment of chronic or complicated wounds with PRGF or PRF improves wound healing in the majority of treated patients. Nevertheless, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism are still poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to analyze if PRGF-treatment of human keratinocytes caused the induction of genes encoding paracrine factors associated with successful wound healing. The investigated genes were Semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A), Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPLT4), Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), Interleukin-32 (IL-32), the CC-chemokine-ligand 20 (CCL20), the matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), the chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and the subunit B of the Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGFB). We observed a significant gene induction of SEMA7A, ANGPLT4, FGF-2, IL-32, MMP-2 and PDGFB in human keratinocytes after PRGF treatment. The CCL20- and CXCL10 gene expressions were significantly inhibited by PRGF therapy. Signal transduction analyses revealed that the PRGF-mediated gene induction of SEMA7A, ANGPLT4, IL-32 and MMP-2 in human keratinocytes was transduced via the IL-6 receptor pathway. In contrast, EGF receptor signaling was not involved in the PRGF-mediated gene expression of analyzed genes in human keratinocytes. Additionally, treatment of ex vivo skin explants with PRGF confirmed a significant gene induction of SEMA7A, ANGPLT4, MMP-2 and PDGFB. Taken together, these results describe a new mechanism that could be responsible for the beneficial wound healing properties of PRGF or related thrombocytes concentrate products such as PRF.","output":"Platelet-Released Growth Factors Influence Wound Healing-Associated Genes in Human Keratinocytes and Ex Vivo Skin Explants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This review aims to summarize the current knowledge concerning the clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic approach of ocular toxoplasmosis focusing mainly on the postnatally acquired form of the disease. METHODS: A meticulous literature search was performed in the PubMed database. A supplementary search was made in Google Scholar to complete the collected items. RESULTS: Ocular toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent infectious etiologies of posterior uveitis. It typically presents with retinochoroiditis. Setting an accurate diagnosis depends to a considerable degree on detecting characteristic clinical characteristics. In addition to the evaluation of clinical features, the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis relies at a large degree on serologic testing. The detection of the parasite DNA in the aqueous or vitreous humor can provide evidence for a definitive diagnosis. The current mainstay for the treatment, if necessary, is the use of oral antibiotic with systemic corticosteroids. Recent evidence suggests other therapeutic approaches, such as intravitreal antibiotics can be used.

Particularly, it is currently unclear why the spike (S) gene has extraordinarily high mutation rate among all SARS-CoV-2 genes. By analyzing the occurrence of fixed synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, and profiling the DAF (derived allele frequency) of polymorphic synonymous sites among millions of world-wide SARS-CoV-2 strains, we found that both fixed and polymorphic mutations show higher mutation rates in S gene than other genes. The majority of mutation is C-to-T, representing the APOBEC-mediated C-to-U deamination instead of the previously-proposed A-to-I deamination. Both in silico and in vivo evidences indicated that S gene is more likely to be single-stranded compared to other SARS-CoV-2 genes, agreeing with the APOBEC preference on ssRNA. We conclude that the single-stranded property of S gene makes itself a favorable target for C-to-U deamination, leading to its excessively high mutation rate compared to other non-S genes. In conclusion, APOBEC, rather than ADAR, is the \\"editor-in-chief\\" of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.

PURPOSE Nonadherence is a leading cause of death-censored allograft loss in kidney transplant recipients. Strong associations have tied tacrolimus intrapatient variability (IPV) to degree of nonadherence and high tacrolimus IPV to clinical endpoints such as rejection and allograft loss. Nonadherence is a dynamic, complex problem best targeted by multidimensional interventions, including mobile health (mHealth) technologies. METHODS This was a secondary planned analysis of a 12-month, parallel, 2-arm, semiblind, 1:1 randomized controlled trial involving 136 adult kidney transplant recipients. The primary aims of the TRANSAFE Rx study were to assess the efficacy of a pharmacist-led, mHealth-based intervention in improving medication safety and health outcomes for kidney transplant recipients as compared to usual care. RESULTS Patients were randomized equally to 68 patients per arm. The intervention arm demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in tacrolimus IPV over time as compared to the control arm (P = 0.0133). When analyzing a clinical goal of tacrolimus IPV of less than 30%, the 2 groups were comparable at baseline (P = 0.765), but significantly more patients in the intervention group met this criterion at month 12 (P = 0.033). In multivariable modeling, variables that independently impacted tacrolimus IPV included time, treatment effect, age, and warm ischemic time. CONCLUSION This secondary planned analysis of an mHealth-based, pharmacist-led intervention demonstrated an association between the active intervention in the trial and improved tacrolimus IPV. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the mutability of tacrolimus IPV and impact of reducing tacrolimus IPV on long-term clinical outcomes.","output":"Impact of a pharmacist-led, mHealth-based intervention on tacrolimus trough variability in kidney transplant recipients: A report from the TRANSAFE Rx randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Acute COVID-19 clinical symptoms have been clearly documented, but long-term functional and symptomatic recovery from COVID -19 is less well described. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to describe patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in adults at least 8 weeks post hospital discharge for COVID-19. Comprehensive database searches in accordance with the PRISMA statement were carried out up till 31/05/2021. Data were narratively synthesized, and a series of meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects inverse variance method. Results From 49 studies, across 14 countries with between 2-12 months follow up, the most common persisting symptom reported was fatigue with meta-analysis finding 36.6% (95 % CI 27.6 to 46.6, n=14) reporting it at 2-4 months, decreasing slightly to 32.5% still reporting it at >4 months (95% CI 22.6 to 44.2, n=15). This was followed by dyspnoea. Modified MRC score (mMRC) []1 was reported in 48% (95% CI 30 to 37, n=5) at 2-4months reducing to 32% (95% CI 22 to 43, n=7) at 4 months. Quality of life (QOL) as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L VAS remained reduced at >4 months (73.6 95% CI 68.1 to 79.1, n=6). Hospitalisation with COVID-19 also resulted in persisting sick leave, change in scope of work, and continued use of primary and secondary healthcare. Conclusion The symptomatic and functional impact of COVID-19 continues to be felt by patients months after discharge from hospital. This widespread morbidity points towards a multi-disciplinary approach to aid functional recovery.","output":"Patient-reported respiratory outcome measures in the recovery of adults hospitalised with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assesment of arterial stiffness the substantional prognostic factor for evaluating complications of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with atherosclerosis, hypertension and type 2 diabetes, may be performed using different parameters, including cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI).

Our objective was to describe patients characteristics and diagnoses associated with an immune alveolitis profile in undiagnosed ILD. METHODS: We performed a monocentric retrospective observational study. Eligible patients were adults undergoing diagnostic exploration for ILD and whose BAL fluid displayed an immune alveolitis profile. For each patient, we collected clinical, radiological and biological findings as well as the final etiology of ILD. RESULTS: Between January 2012 and December 2018, 249 patients were included. Mean age was 57  16 years, 140 patients (56%) were men, and 65% of patients were immunocompromised. The main etiological diagnosis was Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) (24%), followed by drug-induced lung disease (DILD) (20%), viral pneumonia (14%) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) (10%). All PCP were diagnosed in immunocompromised patients while HP was found in only 8% of this subgroup. DILD and viral pneumonia were also commonly diagnosed in immunocompromised patients (94% and 80%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the additional value of BAL qualitative description in ILD. We suggest incorporating the immune alveolitis profile for the diagnosis and management of ILD, especially in immunocompromised patients, since it guides towards specific diagnoses.

OBJECTIVE: The study aims to conduct a systematic review on spontaneous simultaneous bilateral basal ganglion bleeding and a descriptive statistical analysis of collected data on epidemiology, clinical features, etiology, therapeutic approach and prognosis. This review aims to be a clinical reference for busy clinicians when they are faced with such a rare condition. METHODOLOGY: This review has been carried out in accordance with recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Review of 60 cases showed that SSBBGH affected predominantly male patients (70%) with an average age of 50.8  15.33 years and the male-to-female ratio was 2.5:1. The female patients tend to be older with an average age of 54.22  16.67 years. Location of SSBBGHwas more common in the putamen (90% vs 10% non-putaminal). SSBBGH posed a significant mortality rate (33.33%). Among patients who survived, only 40.6% (13/32 report) have had favorable outcomes (mRS 2) and the remaining 59.4% (19/32) ended up with poor functional status (mRS 3-5). The most common implicated etiologies were hypertension followed by alcohol intoxication. CONCLUSION: SSBBGH is a rare clinical entity with significant morbidity and mortality.

SUMMARY ANSWER: A delay in IVF treatment up to 180 days does not affect the live birth rate for women with diminished ovarian reserve when compared to women who initiate IVF treatment within 90 days of presentation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In clinical practice, treatment delays can occur due to medical, logistical or financial reasons. Over a period of years, a gradual decline in ovarian reserve occurs which can result in declining outcomes in response to IVF treatment over time. There is disagreement among reproductive endocrinologists about whether delaying IVF treatment for a few months can negatively affect patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study of infertile patients in an academic hospital setting with diminished ovarian reserve who started an IVF cycle within 180 days of their initial consultation and underwent an oocyte retrieval with planned fresh embryo transfer between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Diminished ovarian reserve was defined as an anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) <1.1 ng/ml. In total, 1790 patients met inclusion criteria (1115 immediate and 675 delayed treatment). Each patient had one included cycle and no subsequent data from additional frozen embryo transfer cycles were included. Since all cycle outcomes evaluated were from fresh embryo transfers, no genetically tested embryos were included. Patients were grouped by whether their cycle started 1C90 days after presentation (immediate) or 91C180 days (delayed). The primary outcome was live birth (24 weeks of gestation). A subgroup analysis of more severe forms of diminished ovarian reserve was performed to evaluate outcomes for patients with an AMH <0.5 and for patients >40 years old with an AMH <1.1 ng/ml (Bologna criteria for diminished ovarian reserve). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted a priori for patient age, was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% CI. All pregnancy outcomes were additionally adjusted for the number of embryos transferred. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The mean  SD number of days from presentation to IVF start was 50.5  21.9 (immediate) and 128.8  25.9 (delayed). After embryo transfer, the live birth rate was similar between groups (immediate: 23.9%; delayed: 25.6%; OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85C1.38). Additionally, a similar live birth rate was observed in a subgroup analysis of patients with an AMH <0.5 ng/ml (immediate: 18.8%; delayed: 19.1%; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65C1.51) and in patients >40 years old with an AMH <1.1 ng/ml (immediate: 12.3%; delayed: 14.7%; OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77C1.91). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is the potential for selection bias with regard to the patients who started their IVF cycle within 90 days compared to 91C180 days after initial consultation. In addition, we did not include patients who were seen for initial evaluation but did not progress to IVF treatment with oocyte retrieval; therefore, our results should only be applied to patients with diminished ovarian reserve who complete an IVF cycle. Finally, since we excluded patients who started their IVF cycle greater than 180 days from their first visit, it is not known how such a delay in treatment affects pregnancy outcomes in IVF cycles. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in initiating IVF treatment in patients with diminished ovarian reserve up to 180 days from the initial visit does not affect pregnancy outcomes. This observation remains true for patients who are in the high-risk categories for poor response to ovarian stimulation. Providers and patients should be reassured that when a short-term treatment delay is deemed necessary for medical, logistic or financial reasons, treatment outcomes will not be affected. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No financial support, funding or services were obtained for this study. The authors do not report any potential conflicts of interest.

Complications associated with laparoscopy are often related to entry. Life-threatening complications include injury to the bowel, bladder, major abdominal vessels, and an anterior abdominal-wall vessel. Other less serious complications can also occur, such as post-operative infection, subcutaneous emphysema and extraperitoneal insufflation. There is no clear consensus as to the optimal method of entry into the peritoneal cavity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the benefits and risks of different laparoscopic techniques in gynaecological and non-gynaecological surgery. SEARCH METHODS This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. In addition, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO were searched through to February 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials were included when one laparoscopic entry technique was compared with another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted independently by the first three authors. Differences of opinion were registered and resolved by the fourth author. Results for each study were expressed as odds ratio (Peto OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS The review included 28 randomised controlled trials with 4860 individuals undergoing laparoscopy and evaluated 14 comparisons. Overall there was no evidence of advantage using any single technique in terms of preventing major vascular or visceral complications. Using an open-entry technique compared to a Veress Needle demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of failed entry, Peto OR 0.12 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.92). There were three advantages with direct-trocar entry when compared with Veress Needle entry, in terms of lower rates of failed entry (Peto OR 0.21, 95% Cl 0.14 to 0.31), extraperitoneal insufflation (Peto OR 0.18, 95% Cl 0.13 to 0.26), and omental injury (Peto OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.55).There was also an advantage with radially expanding access system (STEP) trocar entry when compared with standard trocar entry, in terms of trocar site bleeding (Peto OR 0.31, 95% Cl 0.15 to 0.62). Finally, there was an advantage of not lifting the abdominal wall before Veress Needle insertion when compared to lifting in terms of failed entry, without an increase in the complication rate (Peto OR 4.44, 95% CI 2.16 to 9.13). However, studies were limited to small numbers, excluding many patients with previous abdominal surgery and women with a raised body mass index who may have unusually high complication rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS An open-entry technique is associated with a significant reduction in failed entry when compared to a closed-entry technique, with no difference in the incidence of visceral or vascular injury.Significant benefits were noted with the use of a direct-entry technique when compared to the Veress Needle. The use of the Veress Needle was associated with an increased incidence of failed entry, extraperitoneal insufflation and omental injury; direct-trocar entry is therefore a safer closed-entry technique.The low rate of reported complications associated with laparoscopic entry and the small number of participants within the included studies may account for the lack of significant difference in terms of major vascular and visceral injury between entry techniques. Results should be interpreted with caution for outcomes where only single studies were included.","output":"Laparoscopic entry techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract To date, the world perhaps has never waited for the summer so impatiently in the entire Anthropocene, owing to the debate whether increasing temperature and humidity will decrease the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV-2.

Under experimental conditions, SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious on surfaces for several days. However, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection on surfaces in healthcare settings and the public is currently not known. A systematic literature review was performed. On surfaces around COVID-19 cases in healthcare settings (42 studies), the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates mostly were between 0% and 27% (Ct values mostly &gt;30). Detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was only successful in one of seven studies in 9.2% of 76 samples. Most of the positive samples were obtained next to a patient with frequent sputum spitting during sampling. Eight studies were found with data from public surfaces and RNA detection rates between 0% and 22.1% (Ct values mostly &gt;30). Detection of infectious virus was not attempted. Similar results were found in samples from surfaces around confirmed COVID-19 cases in non-healthcare settings (7 studies) and from personal protective equipment (10 studies). Therefore, it seems plausible to assume that inanimate surfaces are not a relevant source for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This contactless method is a promising technology to continuously monitor the vital signs of patients in clinical environments. In this study, we investigated both skin temperature trend measurement and the extraction of respiration-related chest movements to determine the respiratory rate using low-cost hardware in combination with advanced algorithms. In addition, the frequency of medical examinations or visits to the patients was extracted. We implemented a deep learning-based algorithm for real-time vital sign extraction from thermography images. A clinical trial was conducted to record data from patients on an intensive care unit. The YOLOv4-Tiny object detector was applied to extract image regions containing vital signs (head and chest). The infrared frames were manually labeled for evaluation. Validation was performed on a hold-out test dataset of 6 patients and revealed good detector performance (0.75 intersection over union, 0.94 mean average precision). An optical flow algorithm was used to extract the respiratory rate from the chest region. The results show a mean absolute error of 2.69 bpm. We observed a computational performance of 47 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module for YOLOv4-Tiny, which proves real-time capability on an embedded GPU system. In conclusion, the proposed method can perform real-time vital sign extraction on a low-cost system-on-module and may thus be a useful method for future contactless vital sign measurements.","output":"A Deep Learning-Based Camera Approach for Vital Sign Monitoring Using Thermography Images for ICU Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a desperate need for effective therapies and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the growing economic crisis that has ensued from societal lockdown.

The spike protein (SP) in SARS-CoV-2 is primarily responsible for the attachment and entry of the virus into the cell, which binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Owing to the lack of an effective therapy, drug repositioning is an opportunity to search for molecules with pharmacological potential for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, three candidates with the potential to destabilize the SP-ACE2 complex are reported. Through molecular docking, 147 drugs were evaluated and their possible binding sites in the interface region of the SP-ACE2 complex and the SP of SARS-CoV-2 were identified. The five best candidate molecules were selected for molecular dynamics studies to observe changes in interactions between SP-ACE2 and ligands with the SP-ACE2 complex. Using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the binding energy of SP with ACE2 (?29.58 kcal/mol) without ligands, and in complex with amprenavir (?20.13 kcal/mol), enalaprilat (C23.84 kcal/mol), and plerixafor (?19.72 kcal/mol) were calculated. These drugs are potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 as they destabilize the SP-ACE2 complex; the binding energy of SP is decreased in the presence of these drugs and may prevent the virus from entering the cell. Plerixafor is the drug with the greatest potential to destabilize the SP-ACE2 complex, followed by amprenavir and enalaprilat; thus, these three drugs are proposed for future in vitro and in vivo evaluations.","output":"In-silico drug repurposing study: Amprenavir, enalaprilat, and plerixafor, potential drugs for destabilizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency and elective hand surgery in four Italian regions that had either a high (Lombardy and Piemonte) or a low (Sicilia and Puglia) COVID-19 case load to discuss problems and to elaborate strategies to improve treatment pathways.

METHODS: We conducted a review of lessons learnt from previous infectious disease epidemics for primary care, and their relevance to COVID-19. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, PROQUEST and Google Scholar, hand-searched reference lists of included studies, and included research identified through professional contacts. RESULTS: Of 173 publications identified, 31 publications describing experiences of four epidemics in 11 countries were included. Synthesis of findings identified six key lessons: (i) improve collaboration, communication and integration between public health and primary care; (ii) strengthen the primary health care system; (iii) provide consistent, coordinated and reliable information emanating from a trusted source; (iv) define the role of primary care during pandemics; (v) protect the primary care workforce and the community and (vi) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pts in an outpatient HIV clinic, study period 03/30/2019 to 03/29/2021. Two periods were defined: pre-COVID (Pre-CO) 3/30/2019 to 3/29/2020 and COVID (CO) 3/30/2020 to 3/29/2021. Data was collected on demographics, HIV risk, type of encounter, number of encounters, CD4, HIV Viral loads (VL) at first, and last visit, treatment regimen information. HIV VL < 200 copies/ml was considered as undetectable. RESULTS: A total of 607 pts were evaluated. Mean age 51years; (Range-20-84).

It is difficult to go back to work and participate in familiar social activities, as typically the person is only able to remain mentally active for short periods, and if mentally exhausted, the recovery time will be disproportionally long. Mental fatigue after traumatic brain injury correlates with brain information processing speed. Information processing is energy consuming and requires widespread and specific neural signaling. Glutamate signaling is essential for information processing, including learning and memory. Low levels and the fine-tuning of extracellular glutamate are necessary to maintain a high precision in information processing. The astroglial cells are responsible for the fine-tuning of the glutamate transmission, but this capacity is attenuated by substances or conditions associated with neuro-inflammation in brain pathology. In this paper, we extend our previously presented hypothesis on the cellular mechanisms underlying mental fatigue suggesting a dysfunction in the astroglial support of the glutamate transmission.

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique, and RPA-based diagnostic assays have been described for the detection of different types of pathogens. RESULTS: The RPA assays using real-time fluorescence detection (real-time RPA) and lateral flow strip detection (LFS RPA) were developed to detect M. ovipneumoniae targeting a conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene. Real-time RPA was performed in a portable florescence scanner at 39 C for 20 min. LFS RPA was performed in a portable metal bath incubator at 39 C for 15 min, and the amplicons were visualized with the naked eyes within 5 min on the lateral flow strip. Both assays were highly specific for M. ovipneumoniae, as there were no cross-reactions with other microorganisms tested, especially the pathogens involved in respiratory complex and other mycoplasmas frequently identified in ruminants. The limit of detection of LFS RPA assay was 1.0  10(1) copies per reaction using a recombinant plasmid containing target gene as template, which is 10 times lower than the limit of detection of the real-time RPA and real-time PCR assays. The RPA assays were further validated on 111 clinical sheep nasal swab and fresh lung samples, and M. ovipneumoniae DNA was detected in 29 samples in the real-time RPA, 31 samples in the LFS RPA and 32 samples in the real-time PCR assay. Compared to real-time PCR, the real-time RPA and LFS RPA showed diagnostic specificity of 100 and 98.73%, diagnostic sensitivity of 90.63 and 93.75%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.932 and 0.934, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed real-time RPA and LFS RPA assays provide the attractive and promising tools for rapid, convenient and reliable detection of M. ovipneumoniae in sheep, especially in resource-limited settings. However, the effectiveness of the developed RPA assays in the detection of M. ovipneumoniae in goats needs to be further validated.","output":"Development and validation of the isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification assays for rapid detection of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in sheep"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Withdrawal: Martin Bordewieck and Malte Elson, the impact of inducing troubleshooting strategies via visual aids on performance in a computerized digital network task, Applied Cognitive Psychology 2020, (https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3731)The above article from Applied Cognitive Psychology, published online on 11 August 2020 in Wiley Online Library (http://wileyonlinelibrary.com) has been withdrawn by agreement among the authors, the Journal Editor\\\\in\\\\Chief Graham Davies and John Wiley & Sons Inc.

METHODS: The phenomenological research method was used. The study participants were 16 Korean nurses who had experiences in caring for patients with COVID-19 in clinical settings. Data was collected using one-on-one in-depth interviews, from June 30 to September 30, 2020. During the interview, the quarantine rules were observed. RESULTS: The study derived four themes clusters and thirty-eight sub themes. Four theme clusters were identified, i.e., 'a repetitive sense of crisis', 'enduring a drastic change,' 'sacrifice of personal life,' and 'pride in nursing'. The nurses' experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19 were an uneasy, unfamiliar, and threatening experiences for an individual, but it is an opportunity for a nursing organization to renew. Accordingly, it was found that nurses faithfully fulfill their individual roles with a vocation and responsibility. CONCLUSION: The study provides an in-depth understanding of the situational, psychological, and environmental aspects of challenges facing nurses in the pandemic situation. Based on the findings, institutional follow-up measures should be provided to establish support systems for better nursing care.

With over 97% of the planet's water being saltwater, and two thirds of freshwater being frozen in the ice caps and glaciers, there is a significant need to maintain and reuse the remaining 1%, which is a precious resource, critical to the sustainability of most life on Earth. Sanitation and reutilization of wastewater is an important method of water conservation, especially in arid regions, making the understanding of wastewater itself, and of its treatment processes, a highly relevant area of environmental research. Here, the benefits, challenges and subtleties of using NMR spectroscopy for the analysis of wastewater are considered. First, the techniques available to overcome the specific challenges arising from the nature of wastewater (which is a complex and dilute matrix), including an examination of sample preparation and NMR techniques (such as solvent suppression), in both the solid and solution states, are discussed. Then, the arsenal of available NMR techniques for both structure elucidation (e.g., heteronuclear, multidimensional NMR, homonuclear scalar coupling-based experiments) and the study of intermolecular interactions (e.g., diffusion, nuclear Overhauser and saturation transfer-based techniques) in wastewater are examined. Examples of wastewater NMR studies from the literature are reviewed and potential areas for future research are identified. Organized by nucleus, this review includes the common heteronuclei (13C, 15N, 19F, 31P, 29Si) as well as other environmentally relevant nuclei and metals such as 27Al, 51V, 207Pb and 113Cd, among others. Further, the potential of additional NMR methods such as comprehensive multiphase NMR, NMR microscopy and hyphenated techniques (for example, LC-SPE-NMR-MS) for advancing the current understanding of wastewater are discussed. In addition, a case study that combines natural abundance (i.e. non-concentrated), targeted and non-targeted NMR to characterize wastewater, along with in vivo based NMR to understand its toxicity, is included. The study demonstrates that, when applied comprehensively, NMR can provide unique insights into not just the structure, but also potential impacts, of wastewater and wastewater treatment processes. Finally, low-field NMR, which holds considerable future potential for on-site wastewater monitoring, is briefly discussed. In summary, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most versatile tools in modern science, with abilities to study all phases (gases, liquids, gels and solids), chemical structures, interactions, interfaces, toxicity and much more. The authors hope this review will inspire more scientists to embrace NMR, given its huge potential for both wastewater analysis in particular and environmental research in general.","output":"NMR spectroscopy of wastewater: A review, case study, and future potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Initially these were deployed as screening tools to evidence spread of the virus within populations. The recent availability of vaccines against the virus and the need to better understand the parameters of post-infection protective immunity requires development of methods, suitable for use in the routine diagnostic laboratory, capable of characterising the viral immune response in greater detail. Such methods need to consider both cellular and humoral immunity. Toward this aim we have investigated use of a commercial multiplex assay (COVID Plus Assay, One Lambda), providing assessment of the SARS-CoV-2 response at structural level, and developed an in-house cell stimulation assay using commercially available viral peptides (Miltenyi). This paper reports our experience in use of these methods in extended investigation of a cohort of healthcare workers with prior screening results indicative of viral infection.

PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Studies describing the accuracy or reliability of virtual compared with in-person cognitive assessments (i.e., reference standard) for diagnosing dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), identifying virtual cognitive test cutoffs suggestive of dementia or MCI, or describing correlations between virtual and in-person cognitive test scores in adults. MEASUREMENTS: Reviewer pairs independently conducted study screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal. RESULTS: Our systematic review included 121 studies (15,832 patients). Two studies demonstrated that virtual cognitive assessments could diagnose dementia with good reliability compared with in-person cognitive assessments: weighted kappa 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.62) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.4-0.9), respectively. Videoconference-based cognitive assessments were 100% sensitive and specific for diagnosing dementia compared with in-person cognitive assessments in a third study. No studies compared telephone with in-person cognitive assessment accuracy. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS; maximum score 41) and modified TICS (maximum score 50) were the only virtual cognitive tests compared with in-person cognitive assessments in >2 studies with extractable data for meta-analysis. The optimal TICS cutoff suggestive of dementia ranged from 22 to 33, but it was 28 or 30 when testing was conducted in English (10 studies; 1673 patients). Optimal modified TICS cutoffs suggestive of MCI ranged from 28 to 31 (3 studies; 525 patients). Sensory impairment was the most often voiced condition affecting assessment.

We conducted a randomized phase III study investigating the efficacy of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer by evaluating its noninferiority to tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin (UFT/LV). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients aged 20-80 years with curatively resected stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned to receive S-1 (80-120 mg/day on days 1-28 every 42 days; four courses) or UFT/LV (UFT: 300-600 mg/day and LV: 75 mg/day on days 1-28 every 35 days; five courses). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years. RESULTS A total of 1518 patients (758 and 760 in the S-1 and UFT/LV group, respectively) were included in the full analysis set. The 3-year DFS rate was 75.5% and 72.5% in the S-1 and UFT/LV group, respectively. The stratified hazard ratio for DFS in the S-1 group compared with the UFT/LV group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-1.03), demonstrating the noninferiority of S-1 (noninferiority stratified log-rank test, P < 0.001).

Efforts to synthesize the evidence reach seemingly discrepant conclusions. METHODS: Systematic evaluations of seroprevalence studies that had no restrictions based on country and which estimated either total number of people infected and/or aggregate IFRs were identified. Information was extracted and compared on eligibility criteria, searches, amount of evidence included, corrections/adjustments of seroprevalence and death counts, quantitative syntheses and handling of heterogeneity, main estimates and global representativeness. RESULTS: Six systematic evaluations were eligible. Each combined data from 10 to 338 studies (9-50 countries), because of different eligibility criteria. Two evaluations had some overt flaws in data, violations of stated eligibility criteria and biased eligibility criteria (eg excluding studies with few deaths) that consistently inflated IFR estimates. Perusal of quantitative synthesis methods also exhibited several challenges and biases. Global representativeness was low with 78%-100% of the evidence coming from Europe or the Americas; the two most problematic evaluations considered only one study from other continents. Allowing for these caveats, four evaluations largely agreed in their main final estimates for global spread of the pandemic and the other two evaluations would also agree after correcting overt flaws and biases. CONCLUSIONS: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of ~0.15% and ~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.","output":"Reconciling estimates of global spread and infection fatality rates of COVID-19: An overview of systematic evaluations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) comprise an irreplaceable resource in combating the COVID-19 pandemic However, thousands of HCWs have been infected with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) globally, and hundreds have died in the line of duty Increased stress and fear about personal and familial safety also erode the confidence of HCWs in adhering to the best-practices for COVID-19 patient care A tool and checklist for rapid assessment of health-care facilities for their preparedness in prioritizing the protection of healthcare workers were developed based on a survey of multiple sources A total of ten domains were identified that are pivotal toward enabling the protection of HCWs involved in the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients","output":"COVID-19 health facility preparedness for protecting healthcare workers: designing a tool for rapid self-assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Promoting the psychosocial flourishing of emerging adults is crucially important.

Aspergillus flavus/oryzae (n=54), A. fumigatus (n=24), A. niger (n=15), and A. terreus (n=12) were the most prevalent Aspergillus species, respectively. Among 35 Aspergillus species, the MIC ranges of AMB, ITR, and VOR for A. flavus/oryzae, A. niger, and A. terreus were (0.5-4 g/mL; 0.5-16 g/mL; 0.25-8 g/mL), (1 g/mL, 1 g/mL, 1 g/mL), and (4-4 g/mL, 0.5-1 g/mL, 0.5-1 g/mL), respectively. Conclusion: Aspergillus infections have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and often occur in immunocompromised patients. Accurate identification at the species level is essential since the emergence of cryptic species is connected to different patterns of AFST that affect patient treatment outcomes. Azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. is a global concern, and the detection of the route of resistance is pivotal to prevent and control infection.","output":"A 9-Year Experience of Aspergillus Infections from Isfahan, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether routine blood tests and clinical characteristics can predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19.

METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley female rats underwent bladder and epidural catheter implantation. Five days later, cystometry was performed using continuous infusion. Anesthesia with isoflurane, ketamine-xylazine (KX) or fentanyl-fluanisone-midazolam (FFM) was used. After three micturition cycles, intrathecal bupivacaine was administered leading to the suppression of reflex bladder contractions. LPP measurements were performed using vertical tilt. After the initial LPP measurement, animals underwent partial resection of the striated urethral sphincter. The effect was evaluated 6 weeks after surgery, by repeating the LPP measurement in the same animal. RESULTS: Ten out of 19 animals showed full micturition cycles under isoflurane, and all 9 animals under KX anesthesia. No significant difference in micturition pressures (Mean  SEM; 30.1  2.3 vs. 26.8  1.6 mmHg) and LPP (31.0  2.4 vs. 28.0  0.9 mmHg) was observed between isoflurane and KX groups, respectively. Reflex micturition was suppressed with FFM. Bupivacaine led to overflow incontinence in all cases. Sphincter injury caused fibrotic changes and a significant increase in LPP (26.4  2.3 before vs. 46.9  4.6 mmHg after injury, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: KX anesthesia preserves bladder contractions. Intrathecal bupivacaine eliminates reflex micturition, allowing for repeated LPP measurements in the same animal. Resection of striated sphincter resulted in increased LPP 6 weeks post injury.

Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility to MS. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes. Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and for non-MHC regions. The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been associated with MS development. Current data suggest that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which predisposes for MS development. In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS.","output":"Viral triggers of multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study explores the SARS-CoV-2 drugable target inhibition efficacy of phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MM-PBSA analysis. A total of 130 phytochemicals were screened against SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Main protease (M(pro)). Result of molecular docking showed that Isoquercetin potentially binds with the active site/protein binding site of the Spike, RdRP, and Mpro targets with a docking score of -8.22, -6.86, and -9.73 kcal/mole, respectively. Further, MS 3, 7-Hydroxyaloin B, 10-Hydroxyaloin A, showed -9.57, -7.07, -8.57 kcal/mole docking score against Spike, RdRP, and M(pro) targets respectively. The MD simulation was performed to study the favorable confirmation and energetically stable complex formation ability of Isoquercetin and 10-Hydroxyaloin A phytochemicals in M(pro)-unbound/ligand bound/standard inhibitor bound system. The parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, Hydrogen-bond formation, energy landscape, principal component analysis showed that the lead phytochemicals form stable and energetically stabilized complex with the target protein. Further, MM-PBSA analysis was performed to compare the Gibbs free energy of the M(pro)-ligand bound and standard inhibitor bound complexes. The analysis revealed that the His-41, Cys145, Met49, and Leu27 amino acid residues were majorly responsible for the lower free energy of the complex. Drug likeness and physiochemical properties of the test compounds showed satisfactory results. Taken together, the study concludes that that the Isoquercetin and 10-Hydroxyaloin A phytochemical possess significant efficacy to bind SARS-Cov-2 M(pro) active site.

Nsp14 forms a stable complex with non-structural protein Nsp10 and exhibits exoribonuclease and N7-methyltransferase activities. Protein-interactome studies identified human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a putative binding partner of Nsp14. SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 stably interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments. SIRT5 knock-out cells expressed higher basal levels of innate immunity markers and mounted a stronger antiviral response.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 100 patients admitted with suspected COVID-19. Predictive models of COVID-19 diagnosis were performed based on radiology, clinical and laboratory findings; bootstrapping was performed in order to account for overfitting. RESULTS: A total of 29% of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Variables associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in multivariate analysis were leukocyte count 7.7  10(3) mm(C3), LDH >273 U/L, and chest radiographic abnormality. A predictive score was built for COVID-19 diagnosis, with an area under ROC curve of 0.847 (95% CI 0.77C0.92), 96% sensitivity and 73.5% specificity. After bootstrapping, the corrected AUC for this model was 0.827 (95% CI 0.75C0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Considering unavailability of RT-PCR at some centers, as well as its questionable early sensitivity, other tools might be used in order to identify patients who should be prioritized for testing, re-testing and admission to isolated wards.

Thus, we assessed occurrence and effects of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on patients on the Swiss national waiting list for solid organ transplantation. METHODS: Patient data were retrospectively extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS). From 16 March to 31 May 2020, we included all patients listed for solid organ transplantation on the Swiss national waiting list who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Severity of COVID-19 was categorised as follows: stage I, mild symptoms; stage II, moderate to severe symptoms; stage III, critical symptoms; stage IV, death. We compared the incidence rate (laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2), the hospital admission rate (number of admissions of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals), and the case fatality rate (number of deaths of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals) in our study population with the general Swiss population during the study period, calculating age-adjusted standardised incidence ratios and standardised mortality ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 1439 patients were registered on the Swiss national solid organ transplantation waiting list on 31 May 31 2020. Twenty-four (1.7%) waiting list patients were reported to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range 45.3&ndash;65.8), and 14 (58%) were male. Of all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, two patients were asymptomatic, 14 (58%) presented in COVID-19 stage I, 3 (13%) in stage II, and 5 (21%) in stage III. Eight patients (33%) were admitted to hospital, four (17%) required intensive care, and three (13%) mechanical ventilation.

SETTING University of Louisville Hospital. The local Institutional Review Board deemed the video exempt from formal approval (Canadian Task Force Classification III). PATIENT A 77-year-old woman presented with complaints of vaginal leakage of urine, dysuria, and pelvic pain. She had a Gellhorn pessary placed 12 years prior without further evaluation or removal. The patient had a leukocytosis with a pseudomonal urinary tract infection. Imaging confirmed a Gellhorn pessary free floating within the urinary bladder. INTERVENTIONS The patient was taken to the operating room for an exam under anesthesia where a copious amount of urine was found coming from the vagina. A small vesicovaginal fistula was appreciated but could not be thoroughly explored. Cystoscopy revealed the foreign object in the urinary bladder. A robotic approach to the foreign body extraction was then performed with the davinci Xi robot (da Vinci Xi Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). The pessary was evident in the bladder on abdominal entry. Cystotomy was performed with the monopolar curved scissors. A vaginal EEA sizer was found to be advanced through the vesicovaginal fistula. The pessary was then grasped and removed from the bladder. Bilateral ureteral orifices were visualized. The fistula was then closed in 2 layers with 3-0 vicryl V-loc sutures (Covidien Medtronic, St. Paul, MN). The bladder was then closed in 2 layers with 3-0 vicryl V-loc sutures. A no. 15 Jackson-Pratt drain was then inserted through the right lower quadrant port and placed in the pelvis under direct visualization. The pessary was then removed via mini-laparotomy. A Foley catheter was left in place for prolonged drainage for a total of 6 weeks because of the multiple bladder repairs on the inflamed tissue.

Methods: Survey of outpatient MH/SUD clinicians (psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers; N = 107) at a psychiatric hospital. Clinician satisfaction and experiences using telehealth across a variety of services (individual, group or family therapy, initial assessments, evaluation and management, and neuropsychological assessment) were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. Results: Across services, a majority agreed/strongly agreed that telehealth provided an opportunity to build rapport with patients (67-88%) and they could treat their patients' needs well (71-88%). The interest in continuing to use telehealth when in-person visits resume varied by type of service provided (50-71%). Group therapy and initial assessment were lowest (50% and 51%, respectively). Clinicians noted telehealth improved access to care for patients with logistical barriers, competing demands, mobility difficulties, and medical concerns; but was more challenging to care for patients with certain psychiatric characteristics (e.g., psychosis, paranoia, catatonia, high distractibility, and avoidance), high symptom severity, or who needed to improve social skills. Telehealth influenced the therapeutic process (e.g., observations of family dynamic, increased patient/clinician therapeutic alliance). Discussion and Conclusions: MH/SUD clinicians who quickly transitioned to telehealth care during the pandemic were largely satisfied with telehealth, but also identified challenges related to specific patient characteristics, or types of MH/SUD services. These observations warrant additional study to better delineate the role for an expanded use of telehealth postpandemic.","output":"Clinicians' Perceptions of Rapid Scale-up of Telehealth Services in Outpatient Mental Health Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic infection with cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hematological manifestations Abnormal hematological findings are thought to have a role in early risk stratification and prognostication of COVID-19 patients However, the data on hematological abnormalities associated with the disease among Ethiopian COVID-19 patients are limited OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude of hematological abnormalities among COVID-19 patients admitted at Millennium COVID-19 referral treatment center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 referral treatment center from May to July, 2020 A total of 334 COVID-19 patients were included using convenience sampling Socio-demographic data and disease severity status of admitted patients were recorded Three milliliters of venous blood was collected and analyzed by Beckman Coulter DXH-600 automated analyzer to determine complete blood count (CBC) The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software Association of age, sex, and disease severity with hematological abnormalities was analyzed using binary logistic regression An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to measure the strength of association P-value &lt;0 05 was considered as statistically significant RESULTS: Of 334 admitted COVID-19 patients, the majority were males (62 3%) and 69 8% had moderate disease conditions The overall magnitude of any cytopenia and pancytopenia was 41% and 1 8%, respectively The magnitude of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia was 24 9%, 21 6%, and 5 4%, respectively Lymphopenia (72 2%) was the most common hematological abnormality COVID-19 patients with severe and critical disease were more likely to develop anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilia-lymphopenia than those with moderate disease condition, with a significant association CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia was the most common hematological abnormality observed among COVID-19 patients Hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilia-lymphopenia were significantly associated with disease severity Monitoring and evaluation of hematological parameters could provide prognostic insight into the management and risk stratification of COVID-19 patients However, further studies are required to fully understand the utility of hematological parameters for the prognosis of COVID-19 disease","output":"The Magnitude of Hematological Abnormalities Among COVID-19 Patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A rapid one-step reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay targeting the pol-integrase gene was developed to detect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group M.

METHOD In research on health promotion addressing equity and environmental sustainability, we identified a socioecological discourse, based on an ethic of care for people and ecosystems. Using Foucault's concept of discourse as a regime that produces and legitimises certain kinds of knowledge, and ecofeminist historical analysis, we analysed this discourse and its relationship to economism. RESULTS The socioecological discourse takes social and ecological wellbeing as primary values, while economism takes production and trade of goods and services, measured by money, as primary. Following British invasion, property-owning white men in Australia had the right to control and profit from land, trade, and the work of women and subordinate peoples. A knowledge regime using money as a primary measure reflects this history. In contrast, a First Nations' primary value expressed in the study was 'look after the land and the children'. Conclusion and implications for public health: Public health often attempts to express value through economism, using monetary measures. However, socioecological discourse, expressed for example through direct measures of social and ecological wellbeing, appears more fit for purpose in promoting a fair and sustainable society.","output":"A socioecological discourse of care or an economistic discourse: which fits better with transition?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Uveitis is one of the most common causes of visual impairment, accounting for up to 25% of visual loss in the developing world and 10% in developed countries.

The available scientific literature is presented and when such literature is lacking, clinical experience is provided to support the following conclusions. Preoperative staging should be done in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, but endoscopic fine needle aspiration of enlarged mediastinal nodes can be used, and if histology is positive for malignancy, mediastinoscopy can be avoided. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy is not generally recommended but can be considered to downstage an unresectable patient. There is currently no role for preoperative radiation or chemoradiation. Adjuvant systemic therapy is not recommended for stage IA and IB patients; however, adverse prognostic factors are acceptable reasons to consider adjuvant systemic therapy in the latter.

The objective of this study is to describe the probabilities of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the probabilities of hospital discharge among positive COVID-19 patients according to demographics and comorbidities recorded at hospital admission. Methods: A prospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 found in the Electronic Medical Records of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital in Kuwait was conducted. The study included 3995 individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic) of all ages who tested positive from February 24th to May 27th, 2020, out of which 315 were treated in the ICU and 3619 were discharged including those who were transferred to a different healthcare unit without previously entering the ICU. A competing risk analysis considering two events, namely, ICU admission and hospital discharge using flexible hazard models was performed to describe the association between event-specific probabilities and patient characteristics. Results: Results showed that being male, increasing age and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and weakened immune system increased the risk of ICU admission within 10 days of entering the hospital. CKD and weakened immune system decreased the probabilities of discharge in both females and males however, the age-related pattern differed by gender. Diabetes, which was the most prevalent comorbid condition, had only a moderate impact on both probabilities whilst CKD which had the largest effect, was only present in 2% of the study cohort. Conclusion: This study provides useful insight in describing the probability of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to age, gender, and comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. A web-tool is also provided for free to allow the user to estimate these probabilities for any combination of these covariates. These probabilities enable the deeper understanding of the hospital demand according to patient characteristics which is essential to hospital management and useful for developing a vaccination strategy.","output":"Probabilities of ICU Admission and Hospital Discharge According to Patient Characteristics in the Designated COVID-19 Hospital of Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we introduce a portable and low-cost ventilator that could be rapidly manufactured, to meet the increasing demand of ventilators worldwide produced by COVID-19 pandemic.

However, some patients developed severe lower-respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences, and the cause of these infections remain unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to pH1N1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics. Here, we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model. Our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients. Severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication, especially in alveolar areas, and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs. Moreover, detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down-regulation of IFN in the lungs. Additionally, severe lung lesions were associated with greater up-regulations of pro-apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of pH1N1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung.

Preparing for a phased reopening, a knowledge exchange coalition (representing government, academia, hospitals, oral health professions, and regulators) developed return-to-work (RTW) guidelines detailing the augmentation of standard practices to ensure safety for patients, oral health care providers (OHPs), and the community. Using online surveys, this study explored the influence of the RTW guidelines and related education on registered NS OHPs during a phased return to work. METHODS: Dissemination of R2W guidelines included website or email communiques and interdisciplinary education webinars that coincided with 2 RTW phases approved by the government. Aligned with each phase, all registered dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants were invited to complete an online survey to gauge the influence of the coalition-sponsored education and RTW guidelines, confidence, preparedness, and personal protective equipment use before and after the pandemic. RESULTS: Three coalition-sponsored multidisciplinary webinars hosted 3541 attendees prior to RTW. The response to survey 1 was 41% (881/2156) and to survey 2 was 26% (571/2177) of registrants. Survey 1 (82%) and survey 2 (89%) respondents agreed/strongly agreed that R2W guidelines were a primary source for guiding return to practice, and most were confident with education received and had the skills needed to effectively treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As there is currently no randomized evidence comparing hypofractionated (HFRT) and conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT), the aim of this study was to compare overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity of HFRT and CFRT in LS-SCLC. Methods LS-SCLC patients treated between 2000-2013 with HFRT (40Gy/15, 45Gy/15, 45Gy/20 fractions) or CFRT (60Gy/30 or 66Gy/33 fractions) were included. Propensity scores were generated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Patients were matched on a 1:1 ratio with a caliper distance of 0.20. OS and PFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. As a sensitivity analysis, univariable and multivariable Cox regression was performed including all patients without matching. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of pulmonary and esophageal adverse events. Results In the overall group of 117 patients, there were significant baseline differences between the HFRT and CFRT cohorts. Patients who received CFRT were older, smoked more often concurrently with treatment, had higher ECOG performance status, different T and N stage patterns, and more commonly received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. After propensity score matching for these differences, 72 patients were included, 36 in the HFRT and CFRT cohorts respectively. There was no difference in OS (P=0.724), PFS (P=0.862), any pulmonary (P=0.350), or esophageal (P=0.097) adverse events between cohorts. Skin adverse events were significantly higher for CFRT (41.7%) compared with HFRT (16.7%, P=0.020). Multivariable Cox regression also revealed no differences in OS (P=0.886) or PFS (P=0.717) between all HFRT and CFRT patients, without matching. No grade 5 adverse events were observed. Conclusion In LS-SCLC patients, HFRT was associated with comparable survival and toxicity outcomes and may be considered as an alternative to CFRT, should its efficacy be confirmed in prospective studies.","output":"Is there a Role for Hypofractionated Thoracic Radiotherapy in Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer?

We have previously shown that excessive cytokine release induced by highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus was reduced by application of proteasome inhibitors. In the present study we present experimental data of a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathways, NF-kappaB, in the context of published clinical data from COVID-19 patients and develop a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB by proteasome inhibitors. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokines using clinically approved proteasome inhibitors is expected to have a higher therapeutic potential compared to single target approaches to prevent cascade (i.e. triggering, synergistic, and redundant) effects of multiple induced cytokines and may provide an additional therapeutic option to be explored for treatment of critical stage COVID-19 patients.","output":"Potential of proteasome inhibitors to inhibit cytokine storm in critical stage COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Globally, key subpopulations such as healthcare workers (HCW) may have a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. In Uganda, limited access to Personal Protective Equipment and lack of clarity on the extent/pattern of community spread may exacerbate this situation. The country established infection prevention/control measures such as lockdowns and proper hand hygiene. However, due to resource limitations and fatigue, compliance is low, posing continued onward transmission risk. This study aimed to describe extent of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in selected populations within the Rakai region of Uganda. METHODS: From 30th November 2020 to 8th January 2021, we collected venous blood from 753 HCW at twenty-six health facilities in South-Central Uganda and from 227 population-cohort participants who reported specific COVID-19 like symptoms (fever, cough, loss of taste and appetite) in a prior phone-based survey conducted (between May and August 2020) during the first national lockdown. 636 plasma specimens collected from individuals considered high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Uganda were also retrieved. Specimens were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the CoronaChek? rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG lateral flow test assay. IgM only positive samples were confirmed using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) (Architect AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM) which targets the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as either confirmed IgM, both IgM and IgG or sole IgG positivity. Overall seroprevalence in each participant group was estimated, adjusting for test performance. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCW was 26.7% [95%CI: 23.5, 29.8] with no difference by sex, age, or cadre. We observed no association between PPE use and seropositivity among exposed healthcare workers. Of the phone-based survey participants, 15.6% [95%CI: 10.9, 20.3] had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, with no difference by HIV status, sex, age, or occupation. Among 636 plasma specimens collected prior to the first confirmed COVID-19 case, 2.3% [95%CI: 1.2, 3.5] were reactive. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among HCW and substantial exposure in persons presenting with specific COVID-19 like symptoms in the general population of South-Central Uganda. Based on current limitations in serological test confirmation, it remains unclear whether seroprevalence among plasma specimens collected prior to confirmation of the first COVID-19 case implies prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Uganda.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 seroprevalence in South-Central Uganda, during 2019C2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to Covid-19 and the inaccessibility of study abroad for some students, we successfully tested an alternative for building intercultural effectiveness -- a glocal classroom (GC) pedagogy highlighting assessment as learning.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections have been demonstrated to impact the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and induce apoptosis in many cell lines. However, the detailed mechanism of EV71-induced apoptosis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we report that EV71 2B protein (2B) localized to the mitochondria and induced cell apoptosis by interacting directly with and activating the proapoptotic protein Bax. 2B recruited Bax to the mitochondria and induced Bax conformational activation. In addition, mitochondria isolated from 2B-expressing cells that were treated with a recombinant Bax showed increased Bax interaction and cytochrome c (Cyt c) release. Importantly, apoptosis in cells with either EV71 infection or 2B expression was dramatically reduced in Bax knockdown cells but not in Bak knockdown cells, suggesting that Bax played a pivotal role in EV71- or 2B-induced apoptosis. Further studies indicate that a hydrophobic region of 18 amino acids (aa) in the C-terminal region of 2B (aa 63 to 80) was responsible for the location of 2B in the mitochondria. A hydrophilic region of 14 aa in the N-terminal region of 2B was functional in Bax interaction and its subsequent activation. Moreover, overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL abrogates 2B-induced release of Cyt c and caspase activation. Therefore, this study provides direct evidence that EV71 2B induces cell apoptosis and impacts the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by directly modulating the redistribution and activation of proapoptotic protein Bax. IMPORTANCE EV71 infections are usually accompanied by severe neurological complications. It has also been postulated that the induction of cell apoptosis resulting from tissue damage is a possible process of EV71-related pathogenesis. In this study, we report that EV71 2B protein (2B) localized to the mitochondria and induced cell apoptosis by interacting directly with and activating the proapoptotic protein Bax. This study provides evidence that EV71 induces cell apoptosis by modulating Bax activation and reveals important clues regarding the mechanism of Cyt c release and mitochondrial permeabilization during EV71 infection.","output":"Enterovirus 71 2B Induces Cell Apoptosis by Directly Inducing the Conformational Activation of the Proapoptotic Protein Bax."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many neighborhoods which have been unjustly impacted by histories of uneven urban development, resulting in socioeconomic and racial segregation, are now at risk for gentrification. As urban renewal projects lead to improvements in the long-neglected built environments of such neighborhoods, accompanying gentrification processes may lead to the displacement of or exclusion of underprivileged residents from benefiting from new amenities and improvements. In addition, gentrification processes may be instigated by various drivers. We aimed to discuss the implications of specific types of gentrification, by driver, for health equity. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent articles find differential effects of gentrification on the health of underprivileged residents of gentrifying neighborhoods compared to those with greater privilege (where sociodemographic dimensions such as race or socioeconomic status are used as a proxy for privilege). Generally, studies show that gentrification may be beneficial for the health of more privileged residents while harming or not benefiting the health of underprivileged residents. Very recent articles have begun to test hypothesized pathways by which urban renewal indicators, gentrification, and health equity are linked. Few public health articles to date are designed to detect distinct impacts of specific drivers of gentrification. SUMMARY: Using a case example, we hypothesize how distinct drivers of gentrificationspecifically, retail gentrification, environmental gentrification, climate gentrification, studentification, tourism gentrification, and health care gentrificationmay imply specific pathways toward reduced health equity.

Although insufficient to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of infection, antibody assays can be of great use for surveillance studies or for some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presenting late to the hospital. METHODS: This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antibody tests using 213 serum specimens from 90 PCR-positive confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 59 negative control sera, 50 were obtained from patients with other respiratory infectious diseases before COVID-19 pandemic began while nine were from patients infected with other respiratory viruses, including two seasonal coronaviruses. RESULTS: The varied sensitivities for the four commercial kits were 70.9%, 65.3%, 45.1%, and 65.7% for BioMedomics, Autobio Diagnostics, Genbody, and KURABO, respectively, between sick days 1 and 155 in COVID-19 patients. The sensitivities of the four tests gradually increased over time after infection before sick day 5 (15.0%, 12.5%, 15.0%, and 20.0%); from sick day 11-15 (95.7%, 87.2%, 53.2%, and 89.4%); and after sick day 20 (100%, 100%, 68.6%, and 96.1%), respectively. For severe illness, the sensitivities were quite high in the late phase after sick day 15. The specificities were over 96% for all four tests.

The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of UIAs that rupture by size threshold from 10 to 3 mm when selected for management without repair and to determine the level of precision and sources of heterogeneity in the rupture risk estimate. Methods This study was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42019121522). The Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched (inception to August 2020). Studies with longitudinal follow-up of patients with UIAs ( 10 mm to 3 mm) without endovascular or neurosurgical repair were eligible. We included studies, which provided details of aneurysm size and in which UIA rupture was reported as an outcome. The primary outcome of the pooled proportion of UIA rupture during follow-up was synthesized with random-effects meta-analysis; heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression. Results A total of 31 studies that included 13,800 UIAs 10 mm in size were eligible for data synthesis. The pooled proportion of 10 mm UIAs that ruptured when managed without repair was 1.1% (95% CI 0.8-1.5; I 2 = 52.9%) over 3.7 years. Findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses at all the size stratified thresholds including 5 and 3 mm; rupture occurred in 1.0% (95% CI 0.8-1.3; I 2 = 0%) of 7,280 5 mm UIAs and 0.8% (95% CI 0.4-1.5; I 2 = 0%) of 1,228 3 mm UIAs managed without repair. In higher quality studies with lower risk of bias, rupture occurred in 1.8% (95% CI 1.5-2.0; I 2 = 0%) over 3.9 years. In meta-regression, aneurysm size, shape, anatomical location, and exposure to prior subarachnoid hemorrhage were not identified as sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion For every 1,000 UIAs that are 10 mm or less in size and selected for conservative management without repair, between 8 and 15 UIAs are estimated to rupture over 3.7 years.

The viral communicability may be mediated by various body fluids, but insufficient information is available on the presence of the virus in human tears. Objectives: To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in tears collected from patients with COVID-19 by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and to assess the association of virus presence with concomitant clinical conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study conducted between April 9 and May 5, 2020. The setting was intensive care units at Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Sette-Laghi Hospital, University of Insubria, in Varese, Lombardy, Italy. A conjunctival swab was performed in 91 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, which was clinically diagnosed by rRT-PCR assay on nasopharyngeal swabs and by radiological imaging. Conjunctival swabs from 17 additional healthy volunteer participants with no symptoms of COVID-19 were examined to evaluate the availability and applicability of the conjunctival swab test. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 detection by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on the collected samples obtained by conjunctival swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Conjunctival swab and nasopharyngeal swab results are reported, as well as demographic and clinical data. Results: A total of 108 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [14.2] years; 55 female and 53 male) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR assay, including 91 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 17 were healthy volunteers. SARS-CoV-2 was found on the ocular surface in 52 of 91 patients with COVID-19 (57.1%; 95% CI, 46.3%-67.5%), with a wide variability in the mean viral load from both eyes. Among a subset of 41 patients, concordance of 63.0% (95% CI, 41.0%-81.0%) was found between positive conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab test results when performed within 2 days of each other. In 17 of these patients, nasopharyngeal swab results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In 10 of these 17 patients, conjunctival swab results were positive for the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on the ocular surface in a large part of this cohort of patients with COVID-19, although the infectivity of this material could not be determined. Because patients may have positive test results with a conjunctival swab and negative results with a nasopharyngeal swab, use of the slightly invasive conjunctival swab may be considered as a supplementary diagnostic test.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 on Ocular Surfaces in a Cohort of Patients With COVID-19 From the Lombardy Region, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In normal pregnancy, the maternal thyroid gland undergoes alterations to maintain the necessary levels of thyroid hormones (THs) in each gestational period. However, various factors may reduce TH levels, potentially impacting the onset and development of pregnancy. Such cases of thyroid dysfunction are divided into overt (clinical) hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, or isolated hypothyroxinemia, depending on the severity of deficiency. The reported incidence of overt hypothyroidism in pregnancy is 0.3-1.9%, while that of subclinical hypothyroidism is 1.5-5% and that of isolated hypothyroxinemia ranges between 1.3%-25.4%. On a global level, the most common factor for hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency, but in regions where iodine sufficiency is the norm, the most cause is autoimmune thyroiditis or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Early diagnosis and treatment of low TH levels can play a significant role in lowering the risk of negative outcomes such as recurring miscarriage, gestational hypertension, premature birth, and adverse fetal outcomes. However, there is no agreement on TH reference levels during pregnancy to be used to diagnose thyroid dysfunction, nor is there agreement on universal screening of pregnant women for thyroid function in the first trimester, so specific studies for different populations are needed. In extremely stressful events, as is the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, thyroid function may be altered early in pregnancy, so pregnant women in these situations merit extra monitoring of their thyroid function. As managed hypothyroidism is not a risk factor for more negative outcomes in patients with COVID-19, no extra precautions or measures need to be taken.

The severity of COVID-19 is attributable to several factors such as the dysfunctional host immune response manifested by uncontrolled viral replication, type I interferon suppression, and release of impaired cytokines by the infected resident and recruited cells. Due to the evolving pathophysiology and direct involvement of the host immune system in COVID-19, the use of immune-modulating drugs is still challenging.

Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15-22 March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level.

COVID-19 is forcing many around the world to reevaluate existing processes and organizations and adapt to carry out business, of which medicine and education are not immune. The majority of national and international orthopaedic conferences, training programs, and workshops have been postponed or canceled, and we are now critically evaluating the delivery of education to our colleagues as well as residents and fellows.

The unique needs of neonates and children, and their role in the spread of the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) should be included in preparedness and response plans. Fetuses and newborn infants may be uniquely vulnerable to the damaging consequences of congenitally- or perinatally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are limited about outcomes of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. Therefore, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), as well as comparisons to common congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), are warranted. Research regarding the potential routes of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prenatal and perinatal setting is of a high public health priority.

Antimicrobial drug abuse aggravates the incidence rate of multi-drug resistant (MDR) extended-spectrum -lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC). However, knowledge of detection and significance of disease-related biomarkers in neonatal female calves are still limited. Gallic acid (GA), a natural secondary metabolite mostly derived from plants, has attracted increasing attention for its excellent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, it is vague how GA engenders amelioration effects on clinical symptoms and colitis induced by ESBL-EAEC infection in neonatal animals. Here, differentiated gut microbiome and fecal metabolome discerned from neonatal calves were analyzed to ascertain biomarkers in their early lives. Commensal Collinsella and Coriobacterium acted as key microbial markers mediating colonization resistance. In addition, there exists a strongly positive relation between GA, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) or other prebiotics, and those commensals using random forest machine learning algorithm and Spearman correlation analyses. The protective effect of GA pretreatment on bacterial growth, cell adherence, and ESBL-EAEC-lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated Caco-2 cells were first assessed, and results revealed direct antibacterial effects and diminished colonic cell inflammation. Then, oral GA mediated colitis attenuation and recovery of colonic short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) productions on neonatal mice peritonitis sepsis or oral infection model. To corroborate this phenomenon, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) method was adopted to remedy the bacterial infection. Of note, FMT from GA-treated neonatal mice achieved profound remission of clinical symptoms and colitis over the other groups as demonstrated by antibacterial capability and prominent anti-inflammatory abilities, revealing improved hindgut microbiota structure with enriched Clostridia_UCG-014, Lachnospiraceae, Oscillospiraceae, and Enterococcaceae, and upregulation of SCFA productions. Collectively, our findings provided the direct evidence of hindgut microbiota and intestinal metabolites, discriminating the health status of neonatal calves post ESBL-EAEC infection.

The scientific community is engaged in extensive research to improve its performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility for the recognition of specific biomolecules. Essentially, there is a need for miniaturizing the size of existing sensors with innovative designs without compromising its bio-affinity and sensitivity performance. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a grating-coupled surface plasmon polariton sensor on a thin flat gold layer using a hybrid configuration. The proof of concept of the grating architecture has been realized through an innovative fabrication procedure, with experimental verification of its bulk sensitivity. The geometry is identical to the prism-coupling configuration, yet, with miniaturization and compactness. Characteristics of the excited modes in the spectral regime of interest are investigated using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The effective index calculation of the resonance conditions and the accompanying field distribution can identify the excited surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and metal-assisted guided-mode resonance (MaGMR) modes. Detailed probing of the electric field distribution of the desired SPP mode reveals an extended evanescent decay length of 1284 nm, close to the theoretical limit, and an extended propagation length of 270 m. The experimental demonstration of reflectance dip with two different analyte media perceived an increased bulk sensitivity of 1133 nm/RIU. Remarkably, this resonant mode exhibits sensing capabilities for a wide range of analyte refractive index. We believe that the fabricated configuration with observed high-sensitivity and calculated ultra-deep evanescent field penetration depth along with extended propagation length can lead to the designing of a hands-on biochip for detecting large biomolecules.","output":"Grating-coupled surface plasmon-polariton sensing at a flat metal-analyte interface in a hybrid-configuration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to systematically synthesize the currently available literature on various modes of transmission (congenital, intrapartum, and postpartum), clinical features and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science until 9 June 2020. A combination of keywords and MeSH terms, such as COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, neonates, newborn, infant, pregnancy, obstetrics, vertical transmission, maternal-foetal transmission and intrauterine transmission, were used in the search strategy. We included studies reporting neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 proven pregnancies or neonatal cases diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Eighty-six publications (45 case series and 41 case reports) were included in this review. Forty-five case series reported 1992 pregnant women, of which 1125 (56.5%) gave birth to 1141 neonates. A total of 281 (25%) neonates were preterm, and caesarean section (66%) was the preferred mode of delivery. Forty-one case reports describe 43 mother-baby dyads of which 16 were preterm, 9 were low birth weight and 27 were born by caesarean section. Overall, 58 neonates were reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection (4 had a congenital infection), of which 29 (50%) were symptomatic (23 required ICU) with respiratory symptoms being the predominant manifestation (70%). No mortality was reported in SARS-CoV-2-positive neonates. CONCLUSION: The limited low-quality evidence suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates is extremely low. Unlike children, most COVID-positive neonates were symptomatic and required intensive care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic data, test results, treatments, and latest status of patients receiving inpatient COVID-19 pneumonia therapy were recorded. The initial favipiravir and LPV/RTV receiving groups were compared regarding the need for intensive care units (ICU) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed by including variables showing significant differences as a result of paired comparisons into the model. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 59 (28.9%), 131 (64.2%), and 14 were administered LPV/RTV, favipiravir, and favipiravir with LPV/RTV, respectively. No difference was found in age, sex, presence of comorbidity, and tocilizumab, systemic corticosteroid, and plasma therapy use between patients administered with these three different treatment regimens. The mean mortality age of the patients was 7114.3 years, which was substantially greater than that of the survivors (54.215.5 years).

Flavors are among the most cited reasons for use of e-cigarettes among youths, and therefore, some states have imposed restrictions on flavored e-cigarette sales. To our knowledge, no study has compared e-cigarette sales between states with statewide flavored e-cigarette restrictions and states without such restrictions while controlling for co-occurring events. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether implementation of statewide restrictions on flavored e-cigarette sales in Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington was associated with a reduction in total e-cigarette unit sales from 2014 to 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study with difference-in-differences analysis used e-cigarette retail sales data from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Washington, which implemented restrictions on flavored e-cigarette sales in October 2019; New York, which implemented these restrictions in May 2020; and 35 states without these restrictions (control states). Sales were summed into 4-week periods from August 24, 2014, to December 27, 2020, for a total of 2988 state-period observations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A difference-in-differences analysis was conducted to compare e-cigarette unit sales in the 4 states with flavor restrictions (before and after implementation) with those in the 35 control states. The model controlled for other population-based policies and emergent events (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic). Data on 4-week e-cigarette unit sales were sorted into 4 flavor categories (tobacco, menthol, mint, and other). Unit sales were standardized to reflect the most common package sizes for each product type. RESULTS: Statewide restrictions on nonCtobacco-flavored e-cigarette sales were associated with the following reductions in mean 4-week total e-cigarette sales in intervention states compared with control states from October 2019 to December 2020: 30.65% (95% CI, 24.08%-36.66%) in New York, 31.26% (95% CI, 11.94%-46.34%) in Rhode Island, and 25.01% (95% CI, 18.43%-31.05%) in Washington. In Massachusetts, the comprehensive sales prohibition of all e-cigarette products was associated with a 94.38% (95% CI, 93.37%-95.23%) reduction in 4-week sales compared with control states. Except in Massachusetts, where all sales of flavored e-cigarettes decreased, reductions were found only for nonCtobacco-flavored e-cigarette sales in the other states with restrictions. Among control states, mean sales decreased by 28.4% from August 2019 to February 2020 but then increased by 49.9% from February through December 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, statewide restrictions on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington were associated with a reduction in total e-cigarette sales. These findings suggest that not all e-cigarette users who purchased nonCtobacco-flavored e-cigarettes switched to purchasing tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes after policy implementation.","output":"Evaluation of Statewide Restrictions on Flavored e-Cigarette Sales in the US From 2014 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) serotype 3 (Spn3) is considered one of the most virulent serotypes with resistance to conventional vaccine and treatment regimens. Pn3Pase is a glycoside hydrolase that we have previously shown to be highly effective in degrading the capsular polysaccharide of type 3 Spn, sensitizing it to host immune clearance. To begin assessing the value and safety of this enzyme for future clinical studies, we investigated the effects of high doses of Pn3Pase on host cells and immune system. METHODS: We assessed the enzymes catalytic activity following administration in mice, and performed septic infection models to determine if prior administration of the enzyme inhibited repeat treatments of Spn3-challenged mice. We assessed immune populations in mouse tissues following administration of the enzyme, and tested Pn3Pase toxicity on other mammalian cell types in vitro. RESULTS: Repeated administration of the enzyme in vivo does not prevent efficacy of the enzyme in promoting bacterial clearance following bacterial challenge, with insignificant antibody response generated against the enzyme. Immune homeostasis is maintained following high-dose treatment with Pn3Pase, and no cytotoxic effects were observed against mammalian cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that Pn3Pase has potential as a therapy against Spn3.

There were 4 adults with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations using MR-LUND PROTOCOL: Single-shot Fast Spin Echo (SSFSE), LAVA 3D and IDEAL 3D, Echo-planar imaging (EPI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and Fast Spin Echo (FSE) T2 weighted imaging (T2WI). On T2WI changes were identified in 9 (60,0%) patients, on DWI C in 5 (33,3%) patients. In 5 (33,3%) patients lesions of the parenchyma were visualized on T2WI and DWI simultaneously. At the same time, 4 (26.7%) patients had changes in lung tissue only on T2WI. (P(McNemar) = 0,125; OR = 0,00 (95%); kappa = 0,500).

Yet, psychological measures of optimism often assess only one time point or ask participants to generalize about their future.

By performing sentiment analysis on over 3.5 million tweets that reference 23 future time points (2 days to 30 years), we measured how positivity differs across short-, medium-, and longer-term future references. We found a consistent negative association between positivity and the distance into the future referenced: From August 2017 to February 2020, the long-term future was discussed less positively than the short-term future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this relationship inverted, indicating declining near-future- but stable distant-future-optimism.

We report a novel experimental strategy, TAMBAS (tandem approach for microphysical and biological assessment of airborne microorganism survival), to explore the synergistic interactions between the physicochemical and biological processes that impact airborne microbe survival in aerosol droplets. This innovative approach provides a unique and detailed understanding of the processes taking place from aerosol droplet generation through to equilibration and viability decay in the local environment, elucidating decay mechanisms not previously described. The impact of evaporation kinetics, solute hygroscopicity and concentration, particle morphology, and equilibrium particle size on airborne survival are reported, using Escherichia coli MRE162 as a benchmark system. For this system, we report that (i) particle crystallization does not directly impact microbe longevity, (ii) bacteria act as crystallization nuclei during droplet drying and equilibration, and (iii) the kinetics of size and compositional change appear to have a larger effect on microbe longevity than the equilibrium solute concentration.IMPORTANCE A transformative approach to identify the physicochemical processes that impact the biological decay rates of bacteria in aerosol droplets is described. It is shown that the evaporation process and changes in the phase and morphology of the aerosol particle during evaporation impact microorganism viability. The equilibrium droplet size was found to affect airborne bacterial viability. Furthermore, the presence of Escherichia coli MRE162 in a droplet does not affect aerosol growth/evaporation but influences the dynamic behavior of the aerosol by processing the culture medium prior to aerosolization, affecting the hygroscopicity of the culture medium; this highlights the importance of the inorganic and organic chemical composition within the aerosolized droplets that impact hygroscopicity.

This study aimed to explore the mental-health status and its associated factors amongst the medical workforce of Xinjiang province under the normalisation of the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control. METHODS: A total of 408 medical staff were recruited from February 20 to March 10, 2021. Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) scale, Social support Scale, and Simplified Coping-Style Questionnaire were applied to assess their mental-health status and stress-coping tendency. Descriptive analyses, welch's T-test, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The prevalence of mental-health problems was 20.25% (80/395) amongst the surveyed medical staff, and their total symptom mean score (1.31  0.40) was lower than that of the general population (1.44  0.43). Logistic regression analysis revealed that nurse, individual with poor health condition, those who lived with their elderly parents at home, those receiving less social support, and those with a negative stress-coping style were more likely to show psychological problems. CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the mental state of the medical workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government and professional institutes should facilitate social supportive activities and essential counselling services to help strengthen the psychological resilience of medical staff. Additionally, it is necessary for health administration committee and hospitals to make COVID-19 prevention practice guides and risk communication principles for improving the mental health of the front-line medical staff.","output":"Mental health status of medical staff in Xinjiang Province of China based on the normalisation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to identify the impact of third-party organizations on the effectiveness of tourist services the market.

The racial justice challenges of today, combined with persistent health inequities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have intensified the need for racial equityCminded public health professionals. Because training programs play a key role in developing professionals, they must center teaching about racism and promoting antiracism within their curricula. The critical race theoryCgrounded strategy Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP) provides a useful framework, calling for examination of how racism operates within individuals and the systems, such as public health, in which they work. Foundational public health courses provide a vital opportunity to launch such an examination and lay the groundwork for antiracism praxis. This article offers a curricular model that integrates PCHRP with a creative approach to facilitate exploration of racial identity among public health students. Students in our course use photography and written reflections to create dual portraits, one depicting how they see themselves and the other imagining how they might be seen by others in our racialized society. Our pedagogical process prompts critical self-reflection about racial identity, a crucial foundation for addressing the health consequences of structural racism. Spurred by creative inquiry, students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds tell us that our course boosts their racial consciousness, enhances their understanding and ability to engage diverse communities, equips them to see and name racism in the public health context, and galvanizes them to work toward dismantling it. ? 2021 Society for Public Health Education.","output":"Developing an Antiracist Lens: Using Photography to Facilitate Public Health Critical Race Praxis in a Foundational MPH Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our main objectives were to estimate the incidence of illnesses presumably caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection during the lockdown period and to identify the associated risk factors.

The main outcome was COVID-19-Like Symptoms (CLS), defined as a sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3 days and occurred during the 17 days before the survey. We used delayed-entry Cox models to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Between April 2, 2020 and May 12, 2020, 279,478 participants were invited, 116,903 validated the questionnaire and 106,848 were included in the analysis. Three thousand thirty-five cases of CLS were reported during 62,099 person-months of follow-up. The cumulative incidences of CLS were 6.2% (95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 5.7%; 6.6%) on day 15 and 8.8% (95%CI 8.3%; 9.2%) on day 45 of lockdown.

Composite razor-thin skin grafting over acellular dermal matrix scaffold has been used successfully in repairing burns of the trunk and limbs, but its use in covering deep facial burns has rarely been reported. In this study, the authors investigated the clinical outcomes of early escharectomy and concurrent composite razor-thin skin autografting and acellular dermal matrix scaffold for treating deep facial burns. METHODS Patients with deep facial burns (n = 16) involving 8 to 30 percent of the total body surface area received early escharectomy by postburn day 3 and concurrent, one-stage, large, razor-thin skin autografting on top of human acellular dermal matrix scaffold. Wound dressings were changed on postoperative days 7, 9, and 12 to examine the survival of skin autografts. Patients were followed up for 12 months to evaluate their facial profiles. RESULTS The take rate of composite skin autografts was 97.3 percent at postoperative day 12. At the follow-up visit, the skin autografts appeared normal in color, with soft texture and good elasticity. The skin junctures showed little scarring. The patients exhibited a chubby facial appearance and abundant expression, except for one patient with microstomia and two patients with ectropion who required further plastic surgical interventions.

Many articles in this field enrolled trials not based on acute kidney injury. The safety of the watchful waiting strategy has not been fully discussed, and late RRT initiation criteria vary across studies. The effect of early RRT initiation in the AKI population with high plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has not been examined yet. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systemically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Trials not conducted in the AKI population were excluded. Data of study characteristics, primary outcome (all-cause mortality), and related secondary outcomes [mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of hospital stay, RRT days, and length of ICU stay] were extracted. The outcomes were compared between early and late RRT groups by estimating the pooled odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes and the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes. Prospective trials were also examined and analyzed using the same method. RESULTS: Nine RCTs with 1938 patients were included. Early RRT did not provide a survival benefit (pooled OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62C1.27). However, the early RRT group had significantly fewer MV days (pooled mean difference, ? 3.98 days; 95% CI ? 7.81 to ? 0.15 days). Subgroup analysis showed that RCTs enrolling the surgical population (P = .001) and the AKI population with high plasma NGAL (P = .031) had favorable outcomes regarding RRT days in the early initiation group. Moreover, 6 of 9 RCTs were selected for examining the safety of the watchful waiting strategy, and no significant differences were found in primary and secondary outcomes between the early and late RRT groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, early RRT initiation did not provide a survival benefit, but a possible benefit of fewer MV days was detected. Early RRT might also provide the benefit of shorter MV or RRT support in the surgical population and in AKI patients with high plasma NGAL. Depending on the conventional indication for RRT initiation, the watchful waiting strategy is safe on the basis of all primary and secondary outcomes.","output":"Comparison between watchful waiting strategy and early initiation of renal replacement therapy in the critically ill acute kidney injury population: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first reported in Malaysia in March 2020 We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists RESULTS: In total there were 25 patients (all males;mean age [SD], 21 642 40 years;range, 18-27 years) Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2 2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0 5 x 109/L) Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients The distribution of the lesions were;upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%) Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19 CONCLUSION: We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients Thus the use of CT thoraxfor early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older agegroups, and not in younger patients","output":"Lung computed tomography patterns of a cluster of asymptomatic young males with COVID-19 admitted to a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data preparation includes data collection and integration, visual data exploration, and data preprocessing by imputing missing data, handling outliers, data transformation, and data balancing.

However, the causality and especially the role of body fat distribution in this context is still unclear. Thus, using a univariable as well as multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated for the first time the causal impact of body composition on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Methods As indicators of overall and abdominal obesity we considered the measures body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and trunk fat ratio (TFR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these body composition measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium and UK Biobank, while for susceptibility and severity due to COVID-19 disease data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used. For the COVID-19 cohort neither age nor gender was available. Total and direct causal effect estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques and mediation effects of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were investigated within multivariable MR analyses. Results Genetically predicted BMI was strongly associated with both, susceptibility (OR=1.31 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.15C1.50; P-value=7.310-5) and hospitalization (OR=1.62 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.33C1.99; P-value=2.810-6) even after adjustment for genetically predicted visceral obesity traits. These associations were neither mediated substantially by T2D nor by CVD. Finally, total but not direct effects of visceral body fat on outcomes could be detected. Conclusions This study provides strong evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 disease. The impact of abdominal obesity was weaker and disappeared after adjustment for BMI. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a high-risk group.

From these, 5,958 patients were selected after filtering for continuous (minute-by-minute) physiological data availability. A total of 617 (10.4%) patients were identified as sepsis cases, using the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria. Physiomarkers, a set of signal processing features, were derived from five physiological data streams including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), captured every minute from the bedside monitors.

Preventive behavior such as handwashing and wearing face masks has been recommended. However, little is known about what psychosocial factors might influence people's decision to adopt such preventive behavior. This study aims to explore risk perception and other factors associated with handwashing and wearing face masks to prevent AI. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An interviewer-administered survey was conducted among 352 traditional market workers and shoppers in Taiwan between December 2009 and January 2010. Factors associated with the recommended AI preventive behavior (i.e., when in a traditional market, wearing a face mask and also washing hands after any contact with poultry) included: having correct knowledge about the fatality rate of AI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.18), knowing of severe cases of AI (AOR = 2.13), being informed of local AI outbreaks (AOR = 2.24), living in northeastern Taiwan (AOR = 6.01), having a senior high-school education (AOR = 3.33), and having a university or higher education (AOR = 6.86). Gender interactive effect was also found among participants with a senior high-school education, with males being less likely to engage in the recommended AI preventive behavior than their female counterparts (AOR = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Specific information concerning AI risk perception was associated with the recommended AI preventive behavior. In particular, having correct knowledge about the fatality rate of AI and being informed of severe cases and local outbreaks of AI were linked to increased AI preventive behavior.

IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. Failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in a lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore, it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This response might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination to optimize vaccination protocols and achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Avidity determination might also be useful to control for truly protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 in individual cases.","output":"The potential significance of high avidity immunoglobulin G (IgG) for protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has spread rapidly among people living in other countries and is approaching approximately 101,917,147 cases worldwide according to the statistics of World Health Organization.

However, none provide reflection of current service provision. This international survey aimed to clarify the changes observed in esophageal and gastric cancer management and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey covering key areas for esophagogastric cancer services, including staging investigations and oncological and surgical therapy before and during (at two separate time-points-24th March 2020 and 18th April 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic were developed. RESULTS: A total of 234 respondents from 225 centers and 49 countries spanning six continents completed the first round of the online survey, of which 79% (n = 184) completed round 2. There was variation in the availability of staging investigations ranging from 26.5% for endoscopic ultrasound to 62.8% for spiral computed tomography scan. Definitive chemoradiotherapy was offered in 14.8% (adenocarcinoma) and 47.0% (squamous cell carcinoma) of respondents and significantly increased by almost three-fold and two-fold, respectively, in both round 1 and 2. There were uncertainty and heterogeneity surrounding prioritization of patients undergoing cancer resections. Of the surgeons symptomatic with COVID-19, only 40.2% (33/82) had routine access to COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing for staff. Of those who had testing available (n = 33), only 12.1% (4/33) had tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight management challenges and several practice variations in caring for patients with esophagogastric cancers. Therefore, there is a need for clear consistent guidelines to be in place in the event of a further pandemic to ensure a standardized level of oncological care for patients with esophagogastric cancers.","output":"The influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on esophagogastric cancer services: an international survey of esophagogastric surgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with a high incidence and mortality rate.

To address these questions, we retrieved data from TCGA database to analyze HIC1 promoter methylation levels and transcript expression data, and performed targeted region bisulfite sequencing on three stable HIC1 down-regulated cell lines and normal control cell lines, and performed whole transcriptome and metabolite assays in HIC1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Results demonstrated that HIC1 promoter hypermethylation might be a crucial driving force leading to its down-regulation in HIC1 expression in gastric cancer. This implicated that promoter CG methylation of HIC1 might play a major role in the development of gastric carcinogenesis. Besides, HIC1 may suppress gastric cancer progression by maintaining the normal cellular metabolism, and inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway activity.","output":"The promoter methylation drives down-regulation mode of HIC1 in gastric cancer, its molecular characteristics and downstream functional pathways."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected over 170 countries around the world.

Successful vaccination constitutes a crucial prerequisite to protect this group during the pandemic. Since post vaccination antibody monitoring is not standard of care in all healthcare institutions, data on risk factors of impaired vaccine induced immune response are urgently required. Moreover, there are no data on cellular immune responses in humoral low responders so far. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG was assessed after vaccination with BNT162b2 in 1386 employees of three hospitals of a German healthcare provider. Concentrations were compared to those of 45 convalescent employees. Vaccine-induced cellular immunity was measured in employees with reduced humoral response by assessment of frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG were detected in 99.9% of 1386 healthcare workers after completed vaccination. The median antibody concentration was significantly higher after vaccination than after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.0001). 10 subjects (0.7%) generated an IgG concentration < 100 IU/ml, and only two persons (0.1%, solid organ recipients) did not produce detectable antibodies at all.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective study that enrolled (i) patients and oncology health professionals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assays on nasal/pharyngeal swab specimens; (ii) patients and oncology health professionals with clinical or radiological suspicious of infection by SARS-CoV-2; and (iii) patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy and/or major surgery. All enrolled subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, which is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate in patients with cancer and oncology health care professionals with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. RESULTS: From 30 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Among them, cancer patients and health workers were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively.

Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries. Methods In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. Findings We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen. Interpretation With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

Twenty subjects with Class II Division I malocclusion considered as study group were allocated randomly to two treatment groups of 10 each, consecutively treated with twin block appliances (mean age 10.850  1.37 years) and myobrace system (mean age 10.40  1.89 years). Ten children (mean age 10.60  1.77 years) with untreated Class II Division I malocclusion were considered as a control group to eliminate possible growth effects. At the start of the treatment and end of the observation period of 18-24 months, lateral cephalograms were taken. All the angular and linear parameters measured were subjected to statistical analysis. Twin block group subjects produced more measurable and statistically significant skeletal and dentoalveolar changes at the end of the observation period, demonstrated by correction of full cuspal Class II molar relationship to Class I molar relationship and yielding mandibular growth in increments greater in magnitude than the myobrace system. Meanwhile, the myobrace system-induced favorable dentoalveolar changes by a significant reduction of overjet.

RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients, significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.","output":"Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Chapter 7, you learned about webinars and their impact in delivering content while fostering engagement within an online learning environment.

METHOD: A total of 55 nasal swab samples from the first wave in Hiroshima and 13 from the second wave were examined quantitatively by RT-qPCR and qualitatively by nested PCR using specific primers. Four samples from each wave underwent next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis including controls and all sequences retrieved in Japan from GISAID and GenBank. Subsequently, mutations were examined. RESULTS: Viral load ranged 7.85  101-1.42  108 copies/ml. Of 68 samples, one was Asian type-O, 65 were European type-GR, and 2 were undetectable. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that Japan was infected with various Asian strains (L, S, V, O) from January through April. By second week of March, European strains (G, GH, GR) had appeared, and GR strains became predominant after mid-March. The first case in Hiroshima was classified as Asian strain O, and the rest were GR strains. Then, second wave of GR strains appeared independently with 11-15 base mutations. Comparing the first- and second-wave GR strains, mutation rate was 1.17-1.36  10-3 base substitutions per site per year; in addition, amino acid changes occurred at S1361P and P3371S in ORF1a, A314V in ORF1b, and P151L in N. All seven GR strains were D614G variants with R202K and G203R mutations in N. A single-nucleotide insertion in ORF8 that causes a defect in ORF8 protein was found in one isolate (S66) from the second wave.

Portable nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 are critically important for diagnostics. In this study, we used an isothermal amplification methodMultienzyme Isothermal Rapid Amplification (MIRA)for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. We designed the primers and probes in ORF1ab and N gene of SARS-CoV-2. The amplicons could be monitored by lateral flow dipsticks (LFDs). The reaction temperature, time, concentrations of primers and probes, and working volume were optimized. Four commercial swab collection buffers were used to test the amplification efficacy of our assay without RNA extraction. Our assay was able to amplify duplex targets of SARS-CoV-2 in one single reaction using one-step RT-MIRA. The assay worked well in a low volume of 10 l at 38C for 20 min. Using three collection buffers without guanidinium, our assay was able to amplify efficaciously without RNA extraction. The 95% limit of detection (LoD) of the RT-MIRA assay was 49.5 (95% CI, 46.8C52.7) copies/ml for ORF1ab gene and 48.8 (95% CI, 46.5C52.6) copies/ml for N gene. There is no cross-reaction with other human respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus 229E in our assay. The precision evaluation revealed that the C50?20% to C50+20% range bounds the C5CC95 interval. This assay also showed high anti-interference ability. The extraction-free RT-MIRA and qPCR detection results of 243 nucleic acid specimens from suspected patients or national references showed a 100.0% (95% confidence interval, 94.2%C100.0%) positive predictive value and a 100.0% (95% confidence interval, 92.7%C100.0%) negative predictive value.

Studies have shown that phone follow-up may be successfully used for the detection of postoperative hernia recurrences. However, no studies have evaluated the detection rates of other postoperative complications, such as emergency department visits and readmissions, with the utilization of phone follow-up after inguinal hernia repair. The objective of our study was to investigate the safety of a phone follow-up care pathway following elective, outpatient inguinal hernia repair. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients who underwent elective, outpatient inguinal hernia repair between 2013 and 2019 at a large academic health system in the Midwest United States were identified from the electronic health record. Patients were categorized by type of postoperative follow-up: in-person or phone follow-up. Baseline demographics, operative, and postoperative data were compared between follow-up groups. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate predictors of having any related emergency department (ED) visit/readmission/reoperation within 90 days. RESULTS: We included 2009 patients who underwent elective inguinal hernia repair during the study period. 321 patients had in-person follow-up only, while 1,688 patients had phone follow-up. There was a higher rate of laparoscopic repair in the phone follow-up group (85.4% vs. 53.0% for in-person follow-up). There were no differences in rates of related 90-day ED visits, readmissions, and reoperations between the phone and in-person follow-up groups. On multivariable logistic regression, receipt of phone follow-up was not a predictor of having 90-day ED visits, readmissions, or reoperations (OR 1.30, 95% CI [0.83, 2.05]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent phone follow-up had similarly low rates of adverse outcomes to those with in-person follow-up. Phone follow-up protocols may be implemented as an alternative for patients and provide a means to decrease healthcare utilization following inguinal hernia repair.

The receptor for SARS-CoV-2, like that for SARS-CoV, is the human cell-surface membrane protein ACE2 2C4 . Membrane fusion activity, as for other class-1 fusion glycoproteins, requires S to be proteolytically cleaved into S1 and S2 that remain associated following cleavage 4C7 . SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have emerged from bats, possibly via a secondary host 8,9 . To better understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 we have determined the structure of its furin-cleaved S by cryoEM, which shows that cleavage at this polybasic amino-acid site increases the structural plasticity of the receptor binding region and facilitates the adoption of an open conformation that is required for it to bind to the ACE2 receptor. To investigate relationships between S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and of the most closely related bat virus, RaTG13 8 , we have determined and compared their structures and characterised biochemically their affinities for ACE2 and their relative stabilities. Whilst the overall structures are similar, there are key differences likely pertinent to virus infectivity. These include a more stable pre-cleavage form of human S, about 1000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor, and a higher proportion of S in the conformation required for binding ACE2 upon protease cleavage.","output":"Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the complexity and uncertainty of the current COVID-19 risks, the elderly people in long-term care facilities are at the highest risk for infection.

Studies based on actual employment changes during the first wave of the pandemic have found that among the EEE, Bulgaria and Hungary showed increases in the at-risk-of-poverty rate higher than the EU average. The chapter also warns that the success in building prosperous and inclusive societies largely depends on the portfolio of institutions, values, and behaviours. Full-fledged effects of the Covid crisis will depend on the way policies are changed both in labour markets and in the health sectors. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Inequality and Welfare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Mumbai Suburban Railways, \\\\emph{locals}, are a key transit infrastructure of the city and is crucial for resuming normal economic activity. To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. \\\\emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on \\\\textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being.

Poverty and economic inequality are among the most important variables explaining the spread of coronavirus. This study evaluates the impact of poverty and economic inequality on the prevalence of COVID-19 worldwide. Methods: This is an applied study which uses descriptive-analytical method. Also, the current study employs cross-sectional data and stable regression method to evaluate the effect of poverty and economic inequality on the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 among 145 countries. The statistical population of this research study includes COVID-19 aggregate data extracted from Oxford-Martin Research Program and the World Bank in 2020-2021. According to the World Bank classification, we classified the surveyed countries, including Iran, in terms of their income levels into four income groups. Then, the impact of poverty and inequality indicators on the prevalence of COVID-19 has been analyzed among them. Also, econometrics and data analysis were performed using MATLAB software. Results: Estimates confirm the increasing effect of undernourishment and population aging on the spread of coronavirus for all income groups worldwide. In contrast, increasing stringency index reduces the morbidity rate of COVID-19. Significant variables in the prevalence of corona for Iran and countries within the upper middle-income group have also confirmed the effect of aging and stringency index. Finally, the variables explaining the increase in COVID-19 mortality rate in Iran and the upper middle-income group includes GINI coefficient, aging, and undernourishment. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that adequate nutrition in line with health expenditures and stringency index can play an effective role in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Also, employing appropriate policies in order to increase economic equality will play a significant role in reducing COVID-19 mortality rate. ? 2021. Journal of Health Administration.

It is under-recognized and has not been investigated well in low-income countries like Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with suicide ideation and attempt among pregnant women attending antenatal care services at public hospitals in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A group of 762 pregnant women who were attending the antenatal service at public hospitals in Hawassa, southern Ethiopia, selected by a systematic random sampling technique, took part in an interview. A Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to measure suicide ideation and attempt. Chi-square and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used for reporting the result with a p-value<0.05 statistical significance level. RESULTS: The prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt among pregnant women was 11.8% and 2.7%, respectively. Unplanned pregnancy (AOR=2.01, 95% CI=1.04C3.88), poor social support (AOR=3.29, 95% CI=1.62C6.68), common mental disorders (AOR=2.77, 95% CI=1.50C5.09), and lifetime suicide ideation (AOR=4.63, 95% CI=2.63C8.16) were factors significantly associated with suicide ideation. Social support was the only correlated factor with suicide attempt among pregnant mothers. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt among pregnant women was found to be high. Intervention strategies towards suicidal ideation and attempt should consider improving social support and antenatal related common mental disorders with a primary focus on women with unplanned pregnancy and prior history of suicide ideation.","output":"Prevalence and Correlates of Suicide Ideation and Attempt among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Care Services at Public Hospitals in Southern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A few marketing columns from earlier this year addressed how the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has impacted our work One was about the shift to managing teams remotely, another focused on how to promote the online learning experience in a more engaging way, and a third looked at changing trends in our industry","output":"How to address the wants and needs of your audience in this new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article aims to improve understanding of institution formation in (former) liberal-democratic polities characterized by autocratization tendencies We examine how the critical juncture created by the COVID-19 pandemic was used, as well as the interplay between antecedent, structural conditions and the particular combinations of political agency and contingency By comparing the two similar cases of Hungary and Poland ? the two European Union countries that have progressed the farthest towards illiberal transformation ? and using documentary and interview evidence, we conclude that: (1) whereas Hungary exhibited significant institutional changes, Poland did not;(2) these differences in institutional outcomes can be significantly attributed to differences in certain critical antecedent conditions;and (3) the ability of key political actors ?

Recent findings have shown that tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites such as itaconate and succinate are not just mitochondrial metabolites, but rather important signaling mediators, involving in the regulations of metabolism, immune modulation. Itaconate exerts anti-inflammatory role through regulating ATF3 and NRF2 pathways under stressed conditions.

Within the pet dog population, CnPnV-seropositive dogs were detected throughout the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, with an overall estimated seroprevalence of 50% (n = 314/625 dogs). In the kennel population, there was a significant increase in seroprevalence, from 26% (n = 56/215 dogs) on the day of entry to 93.5% (n = 201/215 dogs) after 21 days (P <0001). Dogs that were seronegative on entry but seroconverted while in the kennel were 4 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease than those that did not seroconvert (P < 0.001), and dogs with preexisting antibodies to CnPnV on the day of entry were significantly less likely to develop respiratory disease than immunologically naive dogs (P < 0.001).

Older adults (n = 115; Mage = 68.62) reported perceived stress, coping strategies, global sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and perceived mental, physical, and overall health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress-health relationships were modelled with hierarchical linear regression. Higher perceived stress was associated with greater depressive symptoms and poorer mental health concurrently and longitudinally. Coping strategies moderated the association of perceived stress with physical health and overall perceived health. For example, higher perceived stress was associated with poorer overall perceived health among those with lower problem-focussed coping, but not among those with higher problem-focussed coping. Older adults may benefit from prevention and intervention strategies targeting stress management.

Such information may in turn be used for reducing geometric uncertainties during therapeutic planning, dose delivery and response assessment. However, given the multiple imaging modalities and/or contrasts potentially included within the imaging protocol over the course of the treatment, the current manual approach to determining tissue displacement may become time-consuming and error prone. In this context, variational multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms allow automatic estimation of tumor and OAR deformations across the acquired images. In addition, they require short computational times and a low number of input parameters, which is particularly beneficial for online adaptive applications, which require on-the-fly adaptions with the patient on the treatment table. However, the majority of such DIR algorithms assume that all structures across the entire field-of-view (FOV) undergo a similar deformation pattern. Given that various anatomical structures may behave considerably different, this may lead to the estimation of anatomically implausible deformations at some locations, thus limiting their validity. Therefore, in this paper we propose an anatomically-adaptive variational multi-modal DIR algorithm, which employs a regionalized registration model in accordance with the local underlying anatomy. The algorithm was compared against two existing methods which employ global assumptions on the estimated deformations patterns. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed method has demonstrated an improved anatomical plausibility of the estimated deformations over the entire FOV as well as displaying overall higher accuracy. Moreover, despite the more complex registration model, the proposed approach is very fast and thus suitable for online scenarios. Therefore, future adaptive IGRT workflows may benefit from an anatomically-adaptive registration model for precise contour propagation and dose accumulation, in areas showcasing considerable variations in anatomical properties.","output":"Anatomically-adaptive multi-modal image registration for image-guided external-beam radiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colostral and milk whey rotavirus (RV) and coronavirus (CV) antibody titers stimulated in 15 beef heifers by vaccination with a modified live-RV-CV vaccine were compared with titers in 15 nonvaccinated heifers.

Differentially expressed miRNA and mRNAs (DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs) were extracted between NPC and noncancerous nasopharyngeal tissues. The target genes of DEmiRNAs were predicted with miRTarBase followed by the construction of DEmiRNAs-target DEmRNAs network, and functional analyses were performed. The DEmiRNAs expressions were validated and the performance of these DEmiRNAs was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) values. Finally, the correlations between DEmiRNAs and specific clinical factors were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 1140 interaction pairs (including let-7d/f-MYC/HMGA2 and miR-452-ITGA9) in DEmiRNAs-target DEmRNAs network. The GO annotation analysis showed that several genes such as MYC, HMGA2 and ITGA9 primarily participated in cellular process.

Case Presentation: We present a case report of an individual with mannose binding lectin deficiency who tested positive on two separate occasions, months apart, and did not develop IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. This patient Is a 30- year-old female healthcare worker with a past medical history of ITP, pancreatitis, GERD, anxiety and recurrent pneumonia. She presented in March 2020 with fever, nasal congestion, and dry cough. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in March 2020, via PCR through employee health. She was treated with a course azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms resolved, however in June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were negative. Seven months later in October, she once again developed symptoms which were milder. She was found to have a decreased level of mannose binding lectin, normal immunoglobulin levels, and normal streptococcus pneumonia IgG antibodies. On immune work-up after recovery, she was found to have a decreased level of mannose binding lectin (&lt;50 ng/mL), normal immunoglobulin levels, and protective Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibodies with appropriate vaccine response. Her SARS-CoV-2 IgG returned back as positive 8 weeks after her second infection.

Especially in countries such as Ethiopia in the Global South, all three are impacted by, and in turn have bearing upon, social justice and equity. Combined, these spatial and social factors reduce wellbeing, leading to increasing urgency to create urban environments that are more livable, resilient, and adaptive. However, the impacts on, and of, non-human urban residents, particularly on the ecosystem services they provide, are often neglected. We review the literature using the One Health theoretical framework and focusing on Ethiopia as a case-study. We argue for specific urban strategies that benefit humans and also have spillover effects that benefit other species, and vice versa. For example, urban trees provide shade, clean the air, help combat climate change, create more livable neighborhoods, and offer habitat for many species. Similarly, urban neighborhoods that attract wildlife have characteristics that also make them more desirable for humans, resulting in improved health outcomes, higher livability, and enhanced real-estate values. After summarizing the present state of knowledge about urban ecology, we emphasize components relevant to the developing world in general and pre- COVID-19 pandemic Ethiopia in particular, then expand the discussion to include social justice and equity concerns in the built environment. Prior to the ongoing civil war, Ethiopia was beginning to invest in more sustainable urbanization and serve as a model.

A proper model needs to be established, not only to simulate the epidemic, but also to evaluate the future epidemic situation and find a pilot indicator for the outbreak. METHODS: The original susceptible-infectious-recover model is modified into the susceptible-infectious-quarantine-confirm-recover combined with social factors (SIDCRL) model, which combines the natural transmission with social factors such as external interventions and isolation. The numerical simulation method is used to imitate the change curve of the cumulative number of the confirmed cases and the number of cured patients. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the suspected close contacts (SCC) and the final outcome of the growth trend of confirmed cases with a simulation approach. RESULTS: This article selects four representative countries, that is, China, South Korea, Italy, and the United States, and gives separate numerical simulations. The simulation results of the model fit the actual situation of the epidemic development and reasonable predictions are made. In addition, it is analyzed that the increasing number of SCC contributes to the epidemic outbreak and the prediction of the United States based on the population of the SCC highlights the importance of external intervention and active prevention measures. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation of the model verifies its reliability and stresses that observable variable SCC can be taken as a pilot indicator of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"Suspected Close Contacts as the Pilot Indicator of the Growth Trend of Confirmed Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Simulation Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 20-40% of SARS-CoV-2 infection is asymptomatic; however, data are limited on drivers of such infection.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG in seroprevalent patients receiving dialysis. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Nationwide sample from dialysis facilities. PATIENTS: 2215 patients receiving dialysis who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as of July 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Remainder plasma from routine monthly laboratories was used to measure semiquantitative RBD IgG index value over 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 2063 (93%) seroprevalent patients reached an assay detectable response (IgG index value &#8805;1). Most (n = 1323, 60%) had responses in July with index values classified as high (IgG &#8805;10); 1003 (76%) remained within this stratum. Adjusted median index values declined slowly but continuously (July vs. December values were 21 vs. 13; P < 0.001). The trajectory of the response did not vary by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, or diabetes status. Patients without an assay detectable response (n = 137) were more likely to be White and in the younger (18 to 44 years) or older (&#8805;80 years) age groups and less likely to have diabetes and hypoalbuminemia.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of statins on COVID-19 severity for people who have been taking statins before COVID-19 infection. The examined research patients include people that had taken three types of statins consisting of Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, and Rosuvastatin. The case study includes 561 patients admitted to the Razi Hospital in Ghaemshahr, Iran, during February and March 2020. The illness severity was encoded based on the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure in five categories: mild, medium, severe, critical, and death. Since 69.23% of participants were in mild severity condition, the results showed the positive effect of Simvastatin on COVID-19 severity for people that take Simvastatin before being infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, systolic pressure for this case study is 137.31, which is higher than that of the total patients. Another result of this study is that Simvastatin takers have an average of 95.77 mmHg O2Sat; however, the O2Sat is 92.42, which is medium severity for evaluating the entire case study. In the rest of this paper, we used machine learning approaches to diagnose COVID-19 patients' severity based on clinical features.

For this meta-analysis, PubMed, CENTRAL, and grey literature were searched from their inception to 19 May 2020 for randomized, controlled trials or observational studies that evaluate the association between the use of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and the risk for major clinical endpoints (infection, hospitalization, admission to ICU, death) in adult patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a subgroup geographical analysis of outcomes was performed. Studies including less than 100 subjects were excluded from our analysis. RECENT FINDINGS: In total, 25 observational studies were included. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with increased odds for SARS-CoV-2 infection, admission to hospital, severe or critical illness, admission to ICU, and SARS-CoV-2-related death. In Asian countries, the use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs decreased the odds for severe or critical illness and death (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.16C0.89, I(2) = 83%, and OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.39C0.99, I(2) = 0%, respectively), whereas they increased the odds for ICU admission in North America and death in Europe (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.37C2.23, I(2) = 0%, and OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.05C2.70, I(2) = 82%, respectively). ACE inhibitors might be marginally protective regarding SARS-CoV-2-related death compared with ARBs (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.74C1.00, I(2) = 0%).

Aim: to summarize data from clinical and scientifi c studies on the known mechanisms of AKI in COVID- 19. To identify markers of early kidney injury in COVID-19. Materials and methods. In the Web of Science, Scopus and RSCI databases, 81 sources were selected that contained relevant data from clinical and scientifi c researches on the topic of this review. Results: the main reported mechanisms of kidney damage in COVID-19 patients are as follows: intracellular activity of the virus leading to cell death, excessive release of pro-infl ammatory cytokines and cytokine storm, pathology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), hyperergic infl ammation and immunothrombosis. The main effects of angiotensin II in the case of dysregulation of the RAAS, as well as the spectrum of pro-infl ammatory cytokines and their functions in the development of the cytokine storm, were determined. The possibility of a direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the renal epithelium as an independent cause of AKI in COVID-19 was considered. The association between the hyperergic infl ammatory response and the process of immunothrombosis, which is mediated by many defense systems, including neutrophils, platelets and proteins of the complement system was presented.

PURPOSE: Alvimopan is a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist indicated to accelerate gastrointestinal (GI) recovery following surgery, but its benefits past GI recovery are unknown and evidence suggests that it may increase risk for myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a pilot alvimopan stewardship program aimed at intervening to discontinue alvimopan use following GI recovery. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study examining the first 5 months of the alvimopan stewardship pilot program. During this initial period, a pharmacy resident assessed whether each patient met criteria for GI recovery, defined as solid food toleration and first bowel movement or flatus. If a patient met the criteria for GI recovery, the resident intervened and recommended that the primary team discontinue alvimopan. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with alvimopan continued past GI recovery and the percentage of patients for whom alvimopan ordered past GI recovery was discontinued following intervention by stewardship. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of accepted recommendations to discontinue alvimopan following GI recovery and the number of alvimopan doses ordered following GI recovery. RESULTS: In total, 73 patients were included in the study analysis, all of whom underwent abdominal and/or urologic surgery. Alvimopan was ordered to be administered in 35.6% (26/73) of patients after GI recovery. The stewardship program intervened and recommended discontinuation on 50% (13/26) of the alvimopan doses ordered past GI recovery. Recommendations were accepted by the primary team for 92.3% (12/13) of the patients. A total of 51 doses of alvimopan were ordered for administration past GI recovery, with an average of 2 doses per patient. CONCLUSION: A pilot pharmacy-driven alvimopan stewardship program was able to identify and intervene on alvimopan orders continued past GI recovery. Interventions decreasing alvimopan use past GI recovery could be of benefit by minimizing potential risk and decreasing potential costs without a negative impact on patient outcomes.","output":"Trust your gut: Effect of a pharmacist-driven pilot project to decrease alvimopan use past gastrointestinal recovery in postsurgical patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article is to give an overview of the first month of the novel coronavirus outbreak and of the public reactions to the news in media comments and social media environments in both local Estonian and global contexts The pandemic was still ongoing at the time the article was published and, with some modifications and new emphases, vernacular reactions in the media (incl social media) continued flourishing During the first month (January 2020), the growing flow of information and rapid escalation of the situation made the topic more noticeable in both the media and social media, and thus provided a fertile basis for jokes and internet memes, legends, fake news, misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc , as was the case with the former bigger epidemics and pandemics As it has also been observed previously, the consequences of some fake news, misinformation, and conspiracy theories may often be more harmful for society than the disease itself Several motifs and storylines are universal and surge as similar situations arise both in Estonia and all over the world The article also presents a selection of more prominent topics and examples of the outbreak from social media environments during the initial phase of international awareness of the novel coronavirus ? 2021, FB and Media Group of Estonian Literary Museum All rights reserved","output":"EArly days of the novel coronavirus: Public response in social media during the first month of the outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several previously healthy young adults have developed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and a few of them progressed to the severe stage.

Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the number of STEMI patients (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32C0.85), the incidence of OHCA remained unchanged (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83C1.83). CONCLUSION: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with chest pain or STEMI evaluated by the EMS, while the incidence of OHCA remained similar. Although the reason for the decrease in chest pain and STEMI consultations is not entirely clear, more attention should be paid to the importance of contacting the EMS in case of suspected cardiac symptoms in possible future lockdowns.

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5-7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.","output":"Shifting attention to accuracy can reduce misinformation online."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dyspnea, shortness of breath, and inability to perform activities of daily living are the main complaints in patients with COVID-19 and physiotherapy has a vital role in managing such symptoms We present a case treated with pulmonary and neurological physiotherapy, which improved symptoms and quality of life In this case report, the importance and potential effect of concise physiotherapy on patients with COVID-19 is presented","output":"Pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise therapy in a patient with COVID-19: A Case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet of Things consists of things made up of small sensors and actuators capable of interacting with the environment.

Twelve intact male purpose-bred research dogs, weighing less than 15 kg, were positioned in dorsal recumbency, and a 3-portal technique was used. Bilateral dissection was performed with vessel-sealing devices while tilting the surgical table by up to 30 towards the contralateral side of the target medial iliac lymph node (MILN) without changing the surgeon's position. Using a ventral laparoscopic approach, bilateral MILNs were identified and excised in all dogs. The mean times for unilateral and bilateral MILN dissections were 9.7  3.8 and 21.0  6.0 min, respectively. The mean times for the right and left MILN dissections were 10.8  4.3 and 9.8  2.5 min, respectively. The mean total surgery time was 43.7  7.7 min. In total, 26 MILNs were dissected. Several complications, including mild to moderate capillary hemorrhage from perinodal fat and vessels (controlled laparoscopically), mild spleen trauma caused by the first trocar insertion and capsular damage of MILNs, were observed. However, there were no other major complications. All MILN samples were evaluated and deemed suitable for histopathologic diagnosis. Laparoscopic excision of MILNs is a useful method of excisional biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis.

Several transcription factors (TFs) have also been reported to regulate the antitumor activity and immune cell infiltration. This study aimed to quantify the populations of different immune cells infiltrated in tumor samples based on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from 50 cancer patients using the CIBERSORT and the EPIC algorithm. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified eigengene modules strongly associated with tumorigenesis and the activation of CD4+ memory T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. TF genes FOXM1, MYBL2, TAL1, and ERG are central in the subnetworks of the eigengene modules associated with immune-related genes. The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer data confirmed these findings and further showed that the expression of these potential TF genes regulating immune infiltration, and the immune-related genes that they regulated, was associated with the survival of patients within multiple cancers. Exome-seq was performed on 24 paired samples that also had RNA-seq data. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that mutations were significantly more frequent in the regions flanking the TF genes compared with those of non-TF genes, suggesting a driver role of these TF genes regulating immune infiltration.

AIMS: The aims of the current study were to assess the prevalence of loneliness among young people at the time of COVID-19 and to identify whether selected variables related to the pandemic predicted the level of loneliness. METHOD: A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively. History of depression or anxiety, being dissatisfied with life, and having depression at the time of COVID-19 were significant predictors of loneliness among youth. The model was significant (F = 44.95, p < .05) and accounted for 29.8% of the variance in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the high prevalence rate of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with depression and impaired life satisfaction among Middle Eastern youth.

Serological tests for COVID-19 are important in providing results for surveillance and supporting diagnosis. Investigating the serological response in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity is important for assessing the clinical utility of serological assays.Gap Statement. However, few studies have investigated the clinical utility of antibody assays for COVID-19 or differences in antibody response in association with disease severity.Aim. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and clinical utility of VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests according to COVID-19 severity in patients in Japan.Methodology. We analysed 255 serum specimens from 130 COVID-19 patients and examined clinical records and laboratory data. Presence of total (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and specific IgG antibody for the spike 1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was determined using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests.Results. Overall, 98 (75.4a%) and 32 (24.6a%) patients had mild and severe COVID-19, respectively. On admission, 76 (58.5a%) and 45 (34.6a%) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody assays. Among 91 patients at discharge, 90 (98.9a%) and 81 (89.0a%) were positive for total and IgG antibody, respectively. Clinical background and laboratory findings on admission, but not the prevalence or concentration of total or IgG antibody, were associated with disease prognosis. Total and IgG antibody intensities were significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases in serum collected >11 days after onset, but not within 10 days.Conclusion. VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG assays will be useful as supporting diagnostic and surveillance tools and for evaluation of humoral immune response to COVID-19.

Health authorities recommend wearing a mask as a barrier measure to limit the spread of viral respiratory diseases. During the first waves of the pandemic, besides professional high-quality PPE, decontaminated disposable mask reuse and homemade cloth masks were allowed due to scarcities. This work introduces a simple method based on-time history of the differential pressure, and an easy to use the setup for the testing of different kinds of respiratory protective masks for the purposes of quality control and evaluation of air permeability performance. The standard mask testing method and the new proposed approach were then used to evaluate the effect of machine washing on the widely used type of disposable masks; namely the surgical (medical) face masks. The objective is to determine the number of acceptable washing cycles that this kind of mask can withstand before losing its performance in terms of breathability and airflow resistance. Other quality characteristics such as material (fibres) degradation and hydrophobicity are investigated. Degradation mechanisms due to washing cycles for the different mask constituent layers were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. This work is an attempt to contribute to the determination of the reusability threshold of general-purpose disposable surgical type face masks thereby contributing to the reduction of environmental concerns.

In this paper, we evaluated the inhibition of IAV by mannose-binding lectins of human, bacterial, and fungal origin to understand and possibly increase activity vs. the pandemic IAV. A modified version of the human surfactant protein D (SP-D) neck and carbohydrate recognition domain (NCRD) with combinatorial substitutions at the 325 and 343 positions, previously shown to inhibit pandemic H3N2 IAV in vitro and in vivo, and to inhibit pandemic H1N1 in vitro, failed to protect mice from pandemic H1N1 in vivo in the current study. We attempted a variety of maneuvers to improve the activity of the mutant NCRDs vs. the 2009 pandemic H1N1, including the formation of full-length SP-D molecules containing the mutant NCRD, cross-linking of NCRDs through the use of antibodies, combining SP-D or NCRDs with alpha-2-macroglobulin, and introducing an additional mutation to the double mutant NCRD. None of these substantially increased the antiviral activity for the pandemic H1N1. We also tested the activity of bacterial and algal mannose-binding lectins, cyanovirin, and griffithsin, against IAV. These had strong activity against seasonal IAV, which was largely retained against pandemic H1N1.

Given that IL-1 and TNF, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.","output":"Selective induction of interleukin-6 in mouse microglia by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the COVID-19 worldwide spread, evidence suggested a vast diffusion of negative consequences on people's mental health. Together with depression and sleep difficulties, anxiety symptoms seem to be the most diffused clinical outcome. The current contribution aimed to examine attentional bias for virus-related stimuli in people varying in their degree of health anxiety (HA). Consistent with previous literature, it was hypothesized that higher HA would predict attentional bias, tested using a visual dot-probe task, to virus-related stimuli. Participants were 132 Italian individuals that participated in the study during the lockdown phase in Italy. Results indicated that the HA level predicts attentional bias toward virus-related objects. This relationship is double mediated by the belief of contagion and by the consequences of contagion as assessed through a recent questionnaire developed to measure the fear for COVID-19. These findings are discussed in the context of cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of anxiety suggesting a risk for a loop effect. Future research directions are outlined.","output":"Health anxiety and attentional bias toward virus-related stimuli during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses the directional spillover effects and connectedness for both return and volatility of nine US dollar exchange rates of globally most traded currencies under the influence of trade policy uncertainty. We find two interesting results over the study period ranging from December 1993 to July 2019. First, there exists asymmetric spillovers and connectedness among the considered exchange rates when trade policy uncertainty is present. Second, the volatility spillover is stronger than the return connectedness between exchange rate and trade policy uncertainty. These findings are robust to the presence of economic policy uncertainty effects. Concomitantly, the trade policy uncertainty patterns are also found to be useful for predicting currency market dynamics.

Despite the availability of different coronavirus vaccines, it is still recommended by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and local authorities to apply public safety measures including maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks. This includes individuals who have been fully vaccinated. Remarkable increase in scientific studies, along with manufacturing-related research and development investigations, have been performed in an attempt to provide better PPE solutions during the pandemic. Recent literature has estimated the filtration efficiency (FE) of face masks and respirators shedding the light on specific targeted parameters that investigators can measure, detect, evaluate, and provide reliable data with consistent results. This review showed the variability in testing protocols and FE evaluation methods of different face mask materials and/or brands. In addition to the safety requirements needed to perform aerosol viral filtration tests, one of the main challenges researchers currently face is the inability to simulate or mimic true aerosol filtration scenarios via laboratory experiments, field tests, and in vitro/in vivo investigations. Moreover, the FE through the mask can be influenced by different filtration mechanisms, environmental parameters, filtration material properties, number of layers used, packing density, fiber charge density, fiber diameter, aerosol type and particle size, aerosol face velocity and concentration loadings, and infectious concentrations generated due to different human activities. These parameters are not fully understood and constrain the design, production, efficacy, and efficiency of face masks.","output":"Advanced Research and Development of Face Masks and Respirators Pre and Post the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produo do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publicaes cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referente ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avaliao da qualidade metodolgica Essa avaliao tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomendao oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 14 artigos e 31 protocolos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 30 de junho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Siwak is a chewing stick used as an oral hygiene aid associated with Muslim communities across the globe since more than 1500 years ago. Used either exclusively or in conjunction with a regular toothbrush, there is evidence supporting its clinical effectiveness in plaque control, but adverse effects on periodontal health remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review the wide range of data and literatures related to siwak practice and its effect on periodontal health. METHOD: The review was conducted based on scoping review techniques, searching literature in EBSCOHOST, PubMed, SCOPUS and Google scholar databases using the following search terms: siwak or miswak or chewing stick for intervention, and periodontium or periodontal or periodontal health or periodontal disease for outcome. Articles published between January 1990 to March 2021 and written in English language were included. RESULTS: A total of 721 articles collected from the search and 21 of them were eligible for the final analysis. Results of this study was described based on clinical and antibacterial reporting of siwak, method of siwak practice and its adverse effect on oral health. Siwak was found effective at removing dental plaque and improving periodontal health over time although its effect on subgingival microbiota was inconclusive. Presence of gingival recession and clinical attachment loss were much more commonly reported in siwak users, attributable to variations in the methods employed for tooth cleaning using the siwak. CONCLUSION: There is substantial evidence that the lack of standardised reporting for effective siwak use may have resulted in contradictory findings about its oral hygiene benefits and adverse effects. As such, future work on safe and effective siwak practice is to be advocated among its users.","output":"Clinical benefits and adverse effects of siwak (S. persica) use on periodontal health: a scoping review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During esophagojejunostomy using a circular stapler after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy, placement of the anvil head via the transabdominal approach proved difficult. The authors report on a method modified for laparoscopy-assisted, esophagojejunostomy performed by placing the pretilted anvil head via the transoral approach. METHODS Between November 2007 and December 2008, esophagojejunostomy was performed using the transoral, pretilted anvil head in 27 patients after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy. The anesthesiologist introduced the anvil while observing its passage through the pharynx. During the anastomosis, we kept the jejunum fixed in position with a silicone band Lig-A-Loops, thereby preventing the intestine from slipping off the shaft of the stapler. RESULTS Esophagojejunal anastomosis using the transoral anvil head was achieved successfully in 26 patients; for 1 patient, passage of the anvil head was difficult owing to esophageal stenosis. No other complications, such as hypopharyngeal perforation and/or esophageal mucosal injury, occurred during passage. No postoperative complications occurred, except for 1 patient who developed anastomotic stenosis, in whom mild relief was achieved using a bougie.

DESIGN: Nationwide mortality registries. SETTING: 605 urban districts and rural counties in Chinas nationally representative Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) system. PARTICIPANTS: More than 300 million people of all ages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed overall and weekly mortality rates from all cause and cause specific diseases for three months (1 January to 31 March 2020) of the covid-19 outbreak compared with the predicted (or mean rates for 2015-19) in different areas to yield rate ratio. RESULTS: The DSP system recorded 580 819 deaths from January to March 2020. In Wuhan DSP districts (n=3), the observed total mortality rate was 56% (rate ratio 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.87) higher than the predicted rate (1147 v 735 per 100 000), chiefly as a result of an eightfold increase in deaths from pneumonia (n=1682; 275 v 33 per 100 000; 8.32, 5.19 to 17.02), mainly covid-19 related, but a more modest increase in deaths from certain other diseases, including cardiovascular disease (n=2347; 408 v 316 per 100 000; 1.29, 1.05 to 1.65) and diabetes (n=262; 46 v 25 per 100 000; 1.83, 1.08 to 4.37). In Wuhan city (n=13 districts), 5954 additional (4573 pneumonia) deaths occurred in 2020 compared with 2019, with excess risks greater in central than in suburban districts (50% v 15%). In other parts of Hubei province (n=19 DSP areas), the observed mortality rates from pneumonia and chronic respiratory diseases were non-significantly 28% and 23% lower than the predicted rates, despite excess deaths from covid-19 related pneumonia. Outside Hubei (n=583 DSP areas), the observed total mortality rate was non-significantly lower than the predicted rate (675 v 715 per 100 000), with significantly lower death rates from pneumonia (0.53, 0.46 to 0.63), chronic respiratory diseases (0.82, 0.71 to 0.96), and road traffic incidents (0.77, 0.68 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Except in Wuhan, no increase in overall mortality was found during the three months of the covid-19 outbreak in other parts of China. The lower death rates from certain non-covid-19 related diseases might be attributable to the associated behaviour changes during lockdown.","output":"Excess mortality in Wuhan city and other parts of China during the three months of the covid-19 outbreak: findings from nationwide mortality registries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban green spaces (UGS) provide health benefits to city dwellers, which may be even more important during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, lack of access to UGS or important UGS features, in addition to concerns about UGS safety or maintenance, could prevent people from receiving these benefits. We designed an online survey to understand how people were using and perceiving UGS during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City during the spring of 2020. The survey included questions about how peoples visits to UGS and perceptions of the importance of UGS for health had changed since the start of the pandemic, as well as the concerns people had and features of UGS they considered important. Of the 1372 people who took the survey, most respondents were concerned about a lack of social distancing and crowded UGS, and respondents with these concerns were less likely to visit UGS and had visited UGS less often during than before the pandemic. In addition, generalized linear models showed differences in some concerns and important features of UGS across gender, race and ethnicity, demonstrating the importance of considering community needs in UGS design and management. Although concerns about lack of access were not common in our study population, these also appeared to prevent people from using UGS, and were more common in certain areas of the city that were also hard-hit by COVID-19 in the beginning of the pandemic. To ensure that people can get health benefits from UGS during times of crisis, cities must eliminate barriers by providing equitable access to UGS, considering what amenities communities need from UGS, and provide consistent communication about public health policies.","output":"Who benefits from urban green spaces during times of crisis?

Our objective was to assess antimicrobial use among suspected COVID-19 in-patients while waiting for the COVID-19 test report. Methods From March to August 2020, we collected data from in-patients of 12 tertiary-level hospitals across Bangladesh. We identified suspected COVID-19 patients;collected information on antimicrobial received within 24 h before and on hospitalization;and tested nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR. We used descriptive statistics and a regression model for data analysis. Results Among 1188 suspected COVID-19 patients, the median age was 34 years (IQR:2C56), 69% were male, 40% had comorbidities, 53% required oxygen, and 1% required ICU or ventilation support after admission. Antibiotics were used in 92% of patients, 47% within 24 h before, and 89% on admission. Patients also received antiviral, mostly favipiravir (1%) and antiparasitic drugs particularly ivermectin (3%). Third-generation cephalosporin use was the highest (708;60%), followed by macrolide (481;40%), and the majority (853;78%) who took antibiotics were SARS-CoV-2 negative. On admission, 77% mild and 94% moderately ill patients received antibiotics. Before admission, 3% patients had two antibiotics, and on admission, 27% received two to four classes of antibiotics at the same time. According to WHO AWaRe classification, the Watch group antibiotics were mostly used before (43%) as well as on admission (80%). Reserve group antibiotic particularly linezolid was used in 1% patients includes mild cases on admission. Antibiotic use on admission was higher among severely ill patients (AOR = 11.7;95%CI:4.5C30.1) and those who received antibiotics within 24 h before hospital admission (AOR = 1.6;95%CI:1.0C2.5).

The MCAI involves two consultations at the FLS. During the first consultation, a decision aid is will be used to involve patients in the decision of whether to start anti-osteoporosis medication. During the follow-up visit, the nurse inquires about, and stimulates, medication adherence using motivational interviewing techniques. METHODS: A quasi-experimental trial to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness and feasibility of an MCAI, consisting of a decision aid (DA) at the first visit, combined with nurse-led adherence support using motivational interviewing during the follow-up visit, in comparison with care as usual, in improving adherence to oral anti-osteoporosis medication for patients with a recent fracture two Dutch FLS. Medication persistence, defined as the proportion of patients who are persistent at one year assuming a refill gap < 30 days, is the primary outcome. Medication adherence, decision quality, subsequent fractures and mortality are the secondary outcomes.

The initial selection of the (S(P))-diastereomer for remdesivir was reportedly due to the difficulty in producing the pure (R(P))-diastereomer of the required precursor. However, the two currently known enzymes responsible for the initial activation step of remdesivir are each stereoselective and show differential tissue distribution.

METHODS: We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for development of candidemia in 2384 COVID-19 patients admitted during August 2020-January 2021 in ICUs of two hospitals (Delhi and Jaipur), India. A 1:2 case control matching was used to identify COVID-19 patients who did not develop candidemia as controls. RESULT: A total of 33 patients developed candidemia accounting for an overall incidence of 1.4% over a median ICU stay of 24 days. A two-fold increase in the incidence of candidemia in COVID-19 versus nonCCOVID-19 patients was observed with an incidence rate of 14 and 15/1000 admissions in two ICUs. Candida auris was the predominant species (42%) followed by Candida tropicalis. Multivariable regression analysis revealed the use of tocilizumab, duration of ICU stay (24 vs. 14 days) and raised ferritin level as an independent predictor for the development of candidemia. Azole resistance was observed in C. auris and C. tropicalis harbouring mutations in the azole target ERG11 gene. MLST identified identical genotypes of C. tropicalis in COVID-19 patients raising concern of nosocomial transmission of resistant strains. CONCLUSION: Secondary bacterial infections has been a concern with the use of tocilizumab. In this cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients tocilizumab was associated with development of candidemia.

Often, pericarditis and myocarditis occur with viral infections in young adults. It is rare to see viral infections causing cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially fatal complication. Several cases of pericardial effusions and pre-tamponade physiology have been reported in elderly individuals with an extensive history of cardiac disease. Here, we describe the case of a previously healthy young adult who developed COVID-19 related cardiac tamponade without any preceding respiratory symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism had tested positive for the SARS CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2) one week prior to presentation. She presented with constant, central chest pain radiating to the back for 2 days. While being evaluated for hypotension, the patient broke into convulsions and was consequently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated at 2,470 pg/mL (normal range: 0 C 450 pg/mL), and cardiac troponin was mildly elevated at 0.63 ng/mL. Initial electrocardiogram showed a low voltage strip with sinus tachycardia, and electrical alternans, suggestive of pericarditis(1). Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast revealed a small non-tappable pericardial effusion. CT head was negative. Over the course of a few hours, significant elevation of cardiac troponin to 5.18 ng/mL, and escalation in vasopressor requirements prompted us to obtain bedside echocardiography, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with pre-tamponade physiology. Emergent bedside pericardiocentesis was performed and 250cc of serous pericardial fluid was drained. A pericardial window was kept open to watch for re-accumulation. Post-procedural electrocardiogram had normal voltage, showed no electrical alternans and tachycardia had resolved. The patient was gradually weaned from vasopressor support and other supportive treatment. The pericardial drain was removed. An echocardiogram obtained at a 2-month follow-up showed a healthy heart with a normal ejection fraction. DISCUSSION: On initial evaluation, the differential diagnosis for convulsive syncope in a young patient with hypotension and COVID-19 were pulmonary embolism or a thromboembolic stroke. EKG findings and subsequent clinical course pointed towards a possible pericardial effusion. However, pericardial effusions are commonly idiopathic and only a smaller subset of cases stem from infectious disease. Viral pericarditis causes gradual accumulation of transudate leading to a pericardial effusion. Interestingly, in our patient cardiac tamponade was acute. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores that an index of suspicion should be held for COVID-19 causing cardiac tamponade in young individuals and that prompt intervention is invaluable.

The role of endovascular surgery in traumatic iliac lesions is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes for open versus endovascular management of traumatic iliac injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was searched for patients from 2002to 2016 with iliac arterial injury. Patients were sorted by treatment modality (open versus endo) and mechanism (blunt versus penetrating) and matched using mangled extremity score variables. The proportion of patients undergoing amputation were compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS: In the blunt group, 1550 (82%) had endovascular and 342 (18%) had open repair. Endovascular repair was associated with a significantly lower amputation rate than open repair (0.6% versus 3.6%, P = 0.015) despite higher incidence of concomitant injuries. Venous injury was more frequent in the open group (13.7% versus 1.8%, P < 0.001). Within the penetrating group, 209 (22%) had endovascular and 755 (78%) had open repair. Again endovascular repair was associated with a lower amputation rate (0% versus 5.1%, P = 0.004). Patients undergoing endovascular repair had more severe extremity/orthopedic injury, with venous injury again associated with open repair (48.5% versus 37.4%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular repair of iliac injuries was associated with a significantly lower rate of amputation than open surgery. Endovascular repair was associated with a higher incidence of several injuries, although open repair was associated with concomitant venous injury.

As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers.

Objectives: Identify the anxiety level, risk perception, information sources, adoption of preventive measures, and ability and willingness to self-isolate during and post-lockdown periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigate socio-demographic factors associated with adoption of preventive measures against COVID-19 and self-isolation. Method: Between April 22 nd and June 21 st 2020, Saudi adults aged 18 years completed an open web-based survey including questions on anxiety level, COVID-19 risk perceptions and adoption of preventive measures. Weighted percentages, Pearsons chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression were applied to evaluate associations between these factors and socio-demographic variables. Results: : A total of 2,393 respondents filled-out the survey with around (27.2%) aged 35-44 years old. Around 11% of the respondents reported high anxiety level, 74% were worried about the COVID-19 outbreak, and of those, 27% reported that it is likely that they will be infected with COVID-19 with 16% believing it will be life-threatening or severe. Adoption of hygiene practices and social distancing were lower among older (65+ years) compared to younger (18-24 years) respondents (OR: 0.06;95% CI: 0.01, 0.28, OR 0.06;95% CI: 0.01, 0.27), respectively.

The charts of 2020 patients registered in our FMF center in the years 2008-2017 were screened with regard to age of disease onset. Patients with disease onset after the age of 40 were considered as late-onset group (Group 1). The control group (Group 2) consisted of patients with a disease onset before the age of 20 who were randomly selected from the patient pool with twice the number of probands. Demographic, clinical and genetic data were recorded. Out of 2020 patients, the attacks of FMF had started after the fourth decade in 41 patients (2.02%), (Group 1). The male to female ratio was 1:1.7 in both groups. The delay of diagnosis was 5.6  5.75 years in group 1, 10.7  12.3 years in group 2.

Logistic regression analysis after PS matching showed that the PWH group had a 20% lower live discharge rate after ICPR compared with the control group (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97; Pa? =a? .024). However, Cox regression analysis after PS matching showed that the risks of 6-month survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93-1.11; Pa? =a? .768) and 1-year survival (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.93-1.11; Pa? =a? .702) were not significantly different between the PWH and control groups. Conclusions: Although the PWH group showed lower live discharge rates compared with the control group after ICPR, long-term survival outcomes from 6 months and 1 year were not significantly different.","output":"Impacts of Symptomatic HIV Infection on In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Outcomes: A Population-Based Cohort Study in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the lethal illnesses that humanity has ever seen is COVID-19 irrefutably.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health. METHODS: Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist. RESULTS: The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. \\"Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease\\" and \\"suicide mortality rate\\" were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as \\"critically low\\" for 25 reviews, as \\"low\\" for 7 reviews, and as \\"moderate\\" for 3 reviews. The most frequently identified challenges were establishment of a well-designed and structured data source, and a secure, transparent, and standardized database for patient data. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall quality of included studies was limited, big data analytics has shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis of certain diseases, improvement in managing chronic diseases, and support for prompt and real-time analyses of large sets of varied input data to diagnose and predict disease outcomes.

Yet, such governments are increasingly facing budgetary strain as sources of tax revenue evaporate. If the financial burden on such governments can be eased, they may better address those aspects of pandemic response to which they are uniquely suited, such as coordinating resources and re-allocating space within their communities. This paper investigates the role of Medicaid, traditionally the default insurer of the unemployed, as a stabilizing force on local government budgets. Using panel data from county governments during the Great Recession (2006-2012), we estimate the effect of state Medicaid generosity on local government finances. We find that Medicaid mitigates the effect of unemployment shocks on county government expenditures, specifically safety net programs and debt. We apply these point estimates to extrapolate predictions based on contemporary state Medicaid generosity and local unemployment rates. In this way, we show that Medicaid continues to mitigate the financial strain on local government during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Too Small to Fail: The Role of Medicaid in Mitigating Pandemic-Related Fiscal Strain on Local Governments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a context where SARS-CoV-2 population-wide testing is implemented, clinical features and antibody response in those infected have never been documented in Africa. Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18C35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36C60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1C42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6C50%) and lymphocytopenia (20C40%) were more frequent. More than 60% of participants were blood type O. It is also important to note that infection rate was slightly higher among A and B blood types compared with type O. In this African setting, young and middle-aged adults are most likely driving community transmission of COVID-19. The rate of critical disease is relatively low.

Nevertheless, a survey based on the data of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Istanbul, Turkey [19] displayed an unexpected time shift between the hospital referrals and fatalities. With the motivation of investigating the underlying reason, we use multistage SIR and SEIR models to provide an explanation for this time shift. Numerical solutions of these models present strong evidences that the delay is approximately half of the infection period of the epidemic disease. In addition, graphs of the classical SIR and the multistage SIR models; and the classical SEIR and the multistage SEIR models are compared for various epidemic parameters. Depending on the number of stages, it is observed that the delay varies for relatively small stage numbers whereas it does not change for large numbers in multistage systems. One important result that follows immediately from this observation is that this fixed delay for large numbers explains the time shift. Additionally, depending on the stage number and the duration of the epidemic disease, the distance between the points where each infectious stage reaches its maximum is found approximately both graphically and qualitatively for both systems. Variations of the time shift, the maximum point of the sum of all infectious stages, and the in ection point of the removed stage are observed subject to the stage number N and it is shown that these variations stay unchanged for greater values of N.","output":"On the time shift phenomena in epidemic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic required that instruction be shifted online through asynchronous, synchronous, or hybrid models of instruction.

While drivers of racial disparities in childhood immunization rates (CIR) have been described, none have explored these disparities at UW Health, and few have highlighted the role of anti-vaccination (anti-vaxx) campaigns in the Black/African American (BAA) community. OBJECTIVES This quality improvement study evaluates childhood immunization data for racial and ethnic disparities, identifies possible drivers, and proposes equitable solutions. METHODS UW Health CIR were analyzed for racial and ethnic disparities between December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2019. A root cause analysis was done to explore potential drivers. An in-depth media review of targeted anti-vaxx campaigns was chosen for further exploration using \\"anti-vaccine leaders targeting minority becomes growing concern at NYC forum\\" as the initial search query template. Google Trend and literature searches were performed to understand questions BAA parents have about vaccines. RESULTS UW Health data show significant increasing racial and ethnic disparities in CIR. As of December 31, 2019, the immunization rates were 90.74% for White children, 88.11% for Asian children, and 68.29% for BAA children. Media review suggests anti-vaccination leaders have increasingly targeted the BAA community with vaccine misinformation and skepticism. Analysis of vaccine-related queries suggest 8 core questions BAA parents have about vaccines. CONCLUSIONS Health systems must assess their CIR for disparities and further dissect drivers to effect change.

It is in high demand to explore novel, safe and green insecticidal techniques to address such concerns. In this work, both raw and calcined diatomite were used as a natural insecticide to remove common grain storage pests with improved lethal effect on the saw-toothed grain beetle. Interestingly, the raw diatomite showed higher insecticidal efficiency than the calcined diatomite, and its associated insecticidal properties and preparation conditions were also optimized through orthogonal tests. The optimal conditions for processing the raw diatomite insecticide were identified as follows: the diatomite dust was 500 mesh (A(3)), the temperature was 25 C (B(1)), the relative humidity was 65% (C(2)), the diatomite dosage was 20 g m(?2) (D(2)), the influence factor order was C  D > A > B. The observation of surface morphology indicated that the raw diatomite had a complete, multi hole surface morphology and good adsorption performance, whereas the structure of the calcined diatomite was uncomplete with collapsed pores, resulting in poor adsorption performance. The special pore structure and excellent adsorption capacity of diatomite make the stored grain pests lose water to lethal effect. Acute toxicity and long-term toxicity tests in mice showed that diatomite has no harmful effects on mammals.

MethodsOmicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing. Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the Omicron, Delta and Beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 Coronavac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay. ResultsThe Omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation, which is present in 8.5% of strains in GISAID database. Only 20% and 24% of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K, respectively, while none of the Coronavac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either Omicron isolates. For BNT162b2 recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers(GMT) of the Omicron variant isolates(5.43 and 6.42) were 35.7-39.9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus(229.4), and the GMT of both omicron isolates were significantly lower than those of the beta and delta variants.

RESULTS: Patients with STEMI presenting with concurrent COVID-19 infection had higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count, but elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein. There were significantly higher rates of multivessel thrombosis, stent thrombosis, higher modified thrombus grade post first device with consequently higher use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and thrombus aspiration. Myocardial blush grade and left ventricular function were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 with STEMI. Higher doses of heparin to achieve therapeutic activated clotting times were also noted. Importantly, patients with STEMI presenting with COVID-19 infection had a longer in-patient admission and higher rates of intensive care admission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with STEMI and concurrent COVID-19 infection, there is a strong signal toward higher thrombus burden and poorer outcomes. This supports the need for establishing COVID-19 status in all STEMI cases. Further work is required to understand the mechanism of increased thrombosis and the benefit of aggressive antithrombotic therapy in selected cases.","output":"High Thrombus Burden in Patients With COVID-19 Presenting With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The absolute positioning accuracy of a robot is an important specification that determines its performance, but it is affected by several error sources. Typical calibration methods only consider kinematic errors and neglect complex non-kinematic errors, thus limiting the absolute positioning accuracy. To further improve the absolute positioning accuracy, we propose an artificial neural network optimized by the differential evolution algorithm. Specifically, the structure and parameters of the network are iteratively updated by differential evolution to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Then, the absolute positioning deviation caused by kinematic and non-kinematic errors is compensated using the trained network. To verify the performance of the proposed network, the simulations and experiments are conducted using a six-degree-of-freedom robot and a laser tracker. The robot average positioning accuracy improved from 0.8497 mm before calibration to 0.0490 mm. The results demonstrate the substantial improvement in the absolute positioning accuracy achieved by the proposed network on an industrial robot.","output":"Absolute Positioning Accuracy Improvement in an Industrial Robot."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses are among the most important human pathogens and are responsible for annual epidemics and sporadic, potentially devastating pandemics. The humoral immune response plays an important role in the defense against these viruses, providing protection mainly by producing antibodies directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. However, their high genetic variability allows the virus to evade the host immune response and the potential protection offered by seasonal vaccines. The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs in recent years further limits the options available for the control of influenza. The development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is therefore urgently needed. In this study, we describe a human monoclonal antibody (PN-SIA49) that recognizes a highly conserved epitope located on the stem region of the HA and able to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses belonging to different subtypes (H1, H2 and H5). Furthermore, we describe its protective activity in mice after lethal challenge with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses suggesting a potential application in the treatment of influenza virus infections.","output":"A Non-VH1-69 Heterosubtypic Neutralizing Human Monoclonal Antibody Protects Mice against H1N1 and H5N1 Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a deterministic model capturing essential features of contact tracing as part of public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate an outbreak of an infectious disease By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing We define and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed and coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, a temporary interruption of contact tracing may, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the infection, lead to an irreversible loss of control even when the epidemic was previously contained","output":"A renewal equation model to assess roles and limitations of contact tracing for disease outbreak control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional bolus vaccine administration leads to rapid clearance of vaccine from lymphoid tissue.

To achieve sustained vaccine delivery kinetics, we have developed a microneedle array patch (MIMIX), with silk fibroin-formulated vaccine tips designed to embed in the dermis after a short application to the skin and release antigen over 1-2 weeks, mimicking the time course of a natural influenza infection. In a preclinical murine model, a single influenza vaccine administration via MIMIX led to faster seroconversion, response-equivalence to prime-boost bolus immunization, higher HAI titers against drifted influenza strains, and improved protective efficacy upon lethal influenza challenge when compared with intramuscular injection. These results highlight infection mimicry, achieved through sustained release silk microneedles, as a powerful approach to improve existing seasonal influenza vaccines, while also suggesting the broader potential of this platform technology to enable more efficacious next-generation vaccines and vaccine combinations.","output":"Enhancing influenza vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy through infection mimicry using silk microneedles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spanish Society of Neurology has run a registry of patients with neurological involvement for the purpose of informing clinical neurologists.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive, observational, multicentre study of patients with symptoms compatible with encephalitis or encephalopathy, entered in the Spanish Society of Neurology's COVID-19 Registry from 17 March to 6 June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 232 patients with neurological symptoms were registered, including 51 cases of encephalopathy or encephalitis (21.9%). None of these patients were healthcare professionals. The most frequent syndromes were mild or moderate confusion (33%) and severe encephalopathy or coma (9.8%). The mean time between onset of infection and onset of neurological symptoms was 8.02 days. Lumbar puncture was performed in 60.8% of patients, with positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in only one case. Brain MRI studies were performed in 47% of patients, with alterations detected in 7.8% of these. EEG studies were performed in 41.3% of cases, detecting alterations in 61.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Encephalopathy and encephalitis are among the complications most frequently reported in the registry. More than one-third of patients presented mild or moderate confusional syndrome. The mean time from onset of infection to onset of neurological symptoms was 8 days (up to 24hours earlier in women than in men).

IL-18 regulates both T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 responses. It acts synergistically with IL-12 in the Th1 paradigm, whereas with IL-2 and without IL-12 it can induce Th2 cytokine production from cluster of differentation (CD)4+ T cells, natural killer (NK cells, NKT cells, as well as from Th1 cells. IL-18 also plays a role in the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a cytokine storm that can be secondary to infections. IL-18-mediated inflammation was largely studied in animal models of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. These studies highlight the contribution of either IL-18 overproduction by the host or overresponsiveness of the host to IL-18 causing an exaggerated inflammatory burden and leading to tissue injury. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The damage in the later phase of the disease appears to be driven by a cytokine storm, including interleukin IL-1 family members and secondary cytokines like IL-6. IL-18 may participate in this hyperinflammation, as it was previously found to be able to cause injury in the lung tissue of infected animals. IL-18 blockade has become an appealing therapeutic target and has been tested in some IL-18-mediated rheumatic diseases and infantile-onset macrophage activation syndrome.

By focusing on life experiences and life courses in Italy, the paper analyses how transition is strongly affected by the geographical, cultural, social and economic contexts in which the biographies of the young people interviewed are immersed. Furthemore, the article explores the subjective meanings they ascribe to those contexts. Firstly, the results show that a common feature of the biographies of the young people we encountered is a perception of uncertainty. More specifically, the paper underlines the ambivalent role that geographical context plays in the narrations and biographies of young people. Especially, when it is characterized by scarcity of resources, and therefore, by the impossibility of recognition and realization of personal aspirations.

The urgent need to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and enable continued development of effective countermeasures is aided by the production of laboratory tools that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research. We previously created a directly accessible SARS-CoV-2 toolkit containing user-friendly reverse genetic (RG) infectious clones of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using K18-human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, we confirmed the validity of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses to reproduce the infection profile, clinical disease, and pathogenesis already established in mice infected with natural SARS-CoV-2 isolates, often patient derived. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice developed substantial clinical disease and weight loss by day 6 postinfection. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from the lungs and brains of infected K18-hACE2 mice, and infection resulted in viral pneumonia with considerable changes in lung pathology, as seen previously with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In mice infected with RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-mCherry, mCherry was detected in areas of lung consolidation and colocalized with clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2-assocated immunopathology. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses successfully recapitulated many of the features of severe COVID-19 associated with the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With utility in vivo, the RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be valuable resources to advance numerous areas of SARS-CoV-2 basic research and COVID-19 vaccine development.IMPORTANCE To develop COVID-19 countermeasures, powerful research tools are essential.

This study sought to evaluate the depth of laboratory professionals-patient interactions during pre- and post-sampling period at two hospitals in Ghana. METHODS: This study used real time observations of patient-laboratory staff interactions to collect first-hand data. Additionally, two separate sets of semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect data on the experiences of patients and laboratory professionals. Data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analysed using SPSS version 25. RESULTS: Inadequate laboratory space is a major factor limiting adequacy of patients-laboratory professionals interactions. Overall, even though the laboratory professionals (93.3%) overwhelmingly agreed to the need to inform patients about the turnaround time of the respective laboratory testing, this was not routinely done. Irrespective of patients educational attainment, patients were poorly informed about their respective laboratory tests. Although both patients and laboratory professionals (60.0% vs 63.6% respectively) indicated that the test requester has responsibility to inform patients about their laboratory testing, only 29.1% of patients indicated having received such explanations. Furthermore, although 28.1% of patients indicated knowing the specifics of their respective test requisition, only 15% could correctly identify their requested laboratory testing.

Rapid progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) field has led to the advent of newer CAD systems using deep learning-based algorithms which have the potential to reach human performance levels. Those systems, however, have been developed using mammography images mainly from women in western countries. Because Asian women characteristically have higher-density breasts, it is uncertain whether those AI systems can apply to Japanese women. In this study, we will construct a deep learning-based CAD system trained using mammography images from a large number of Japanese women with high quality reading. METHODS We will collect digital mammography images taken for screening or diagnostic purposes at multiple institutions in Japan. A total of 15,000 images, consisting of 5000 images with breast cancer and 10,000 images with benign lesions, will be collected. At least 1000 images of normal breasts will also be collected for use as reference data. With these data, we will construct a deep learning-based AI system to detect breast cancer on mammograms.

Timely monitoring of risks of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and associated deaths at small-area level is essential to inform local response strategies. However, the potentials of spatial epidemiology to contribute to this aim are yet untapped in most countries. Using the example of Germany, we analysed the spatiotemporal epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and associated deaths at district level to develop a tool for monitoring incidence and mortality rates and to estimate district-specific risks of disease incidence. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal small-area analysis for 401 districts to assess the district-specific risks of SARS-CoV-2 incidence by using nationally representative data from the national surveillance system in Germany on a daily basis (January 28 th to May 4 th 2020). We used a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to estimate the district-specific risk ratios (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and the posterior exceedance probability for RR thresholds greater than 1, 2 or 3, respectively. We further calculated standardised incidence (SIR) and mortality ratios (SMR) stratified by sex and age groups to assess the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and deaths. Results: A total of 85 districts (21 % of all districts) showed a RR greater than 3, and 63 districts (16 % of all districts) exceed the RR threshold with a probability of greater than 80 %. Median RR was 1.19 (range 0-523.08), and the median SIR and SMR were 0.34 (range 0-423.94) and 0 (range 0-343.39), respectively. Elevated RR, and correspondingly high SIR and SMR, were observed in at-risk districts (identified by the spatiotemporal model) in southern and western districts of Germany. Daily updates of district-specific risk, SIR and SMR are implemented in a web-based platform.

During the pandemic of March-May 2020, 17 French nursing homes organized staff confinement periods with residents 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, to reduce the risk of entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into their facilities, in a context where visits to residents were prohibited. By means of a telephone survey of their directors, we observed that 16 nursing homes (94%) had no cases of COVID-19 among the residents, and that mortality from COVID-19 was very low compared to that recorded at the national level by Sant publique France (p<10-4). Moreover, the number of cases of Covid-19 among the staff of these nursing homes was also lower than that recorded by Sant publique France (p<10-4). These establishments experienced certain difficulties which the directors managed to overcome and the investment of these teams was widely appreciated by the families of the residents and through the press.","output":"Confinement du personnel d'Ehpad avec les rsidents : une solution contre le Covid-19 ?/ Confinement of staff with residents in nursing homes: a solution against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we comprehensively analyzed multispecific antibody kinetics of different immunoglobulins in hospitalized patients with acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Three hundred fifty-four blood samples longitudinally obtained from 81 IgG-seroconverting progressed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) patients were quantified for spike 1 (S1), S2, and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, and total Ig antibodies using a microarray, 11 different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)/chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs), and 1 rapid test by seven manufacturers. The assays specificity was assessed in 130 non-CoVID-19 pneumonia patients. Using the microarray, NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies continuously displayed higher detection rates during acute CoVID-19 than S1- and S2-specific ones. S1-specific IgG antibodies, however, reached higher peak values. Until the 26th day post-symptom onset, all patients developed IgG responses against S1, S2, and NCP. Although detection rates by ELISAs/CLIAs generally resembled those of the microarray, corresponding to the target antigen, sensitivities and specificities varied among all tests. Notably, patients with more severe CoVID-19 displayed higher IgG and IgA levels, but this difference was mainly observed with S1-specific immunoassays. In patients with high SARS-CoV-2 levels in the lower respiratory tract, we observed high detection rates of IgG and total Ig immunoassays with a particular rise of S1-specific IgG antibodies when viral concentrations in the tracheal aspirate subsequently declined over time. In summary, our study demonstrates that differences in sensitivity among commercial immunoassays during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are only partly related to the target antigen. Importantly, our data indicate that NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies are detected earlier, while higher S1-specific IgA antibody levels occur in severely ill patients.","output":"Assessment of S1-, S2-, and NCP-Specific IgM, IgA, and IgG Antibody Kinetics in Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection by a Microarray and Twelve Other Immunoassays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our objective is to examine whether residential racial segregation may be constraining capacities for social distancing thus leaving African Americans potentially more exposed to contracting COVID-19. We hypothesized that residential racial segregation constrains African Americans spatial mobility when the whole population is locked down but increases their need for moving under reopening orders. METHODS: We employ a Black/White dissimilarity index as our independent variable and county-level mobility ratios as our dependent variable. Using generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data, we analyzed the effects of Black/White segregation on population mobility by counties across the United States from March 8 to August 7, 2020 under two different COVID-19 related policy conditions: lockdown and reopening. FINDINGS: While higher county-wide levels of segregation were significantly associated with decreased mobility under lockdown and stay-at-home orders, we found that this relationship between segregation and mobility dissipated under reopening orders. INTERPRETATIONS: Investigating the effects of health policy without considering differing effects due to structural racism will likely ignore complexities that may create unintended consequences of health policy. Our conclusions suggest African Americans may face structural limitations to effective social distancing as evidenced by higher rates of mobility after reopening policies go into effect.","output":"Residential racial segregation and social distancing in the United States during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The aim of the study was to assess patient preference for the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer in PHranceSCa (NCT03674112). MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who completed neoadjuvant P + H + chemotherapy + surgery were randomised 1:1 to three intravenous (IV) P + H cycles followed by three cycles of PH FDC SC or vice versa (crossover) and then chose subcutaneous (SC) injection or IV infusion to continue up to 18 cycles (continuation). Assessments were via patient and healthcare professional (HCP) questionnaires. RESULTS One hundred and sixty patients were randomised (cut-off: 24 February 2020); 136 (85.0%, 95% confidence interval: 78.5-90.2%) preferred SC; 22 (13.8%) preferred IV; 2 (1.3%) had no preference. The main reasons for SC preference were reduced clinic time (n = 119) and comfort during administration (n = 73). One hundred and forty-one patients (88.1%) were very satisfied/satisfied with SC injection versus 108 (67.5%) with IV infusion; 86.9% chose PH FDC SC continuation. HCP perceptions of median patient treatment room time ranged from 33.0-50.0 min with SC and 130.0-300.0 min with IV. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1/2 (no 4/5s); serious AE rates were low. AE rates before and after switching were similar (cycles 1-3 IV  cycles 4-6 SC: 77.5%  72.5%; cycles 1-3 SC  cycles 4-6 IV: 77.5%  63.8%). CONCLUSION Most patients strongly preferred PH FDC SC over P + H IV. PH FDC SC was generally well tolerated, with no new safety signals (even when switching), and offers a quicker alternative to IV infusion.","output":"Preference for the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (PHranceSCa): A randomised, open-label phase II study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has focused surgeons and healthcare systems on the aerosolization hazards of minimally invasive surgery and its devices.

ABSTRACT: Widespread media reports suggest that unusually high numbers of the public purchased, or sought to purchase, puppies following the first lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, dubbed Pandemic Puppies. This study aimed to explore this phenomenon by comparing pre-purchase motivations and behaviours, and purchase behaviours of UK owners purchasing puppies aged < 16 weeks from 23 March 2020C31 December 2020 with those of owners who purchased puppies during the same date-period in 2019. An online survey was conducted during November-December 2020, from which 5517 valid responses were analysed (2019 puppies: n = 1148; 2020 Pandemic Puppies: n = 4369). Over 1 in 10 Pandemic Puppy owners had not considered purchasing a puppy before the pandemic, and 2 in 5 felt their decision to purchase a puppy had been influenced by the pandemic, most commonly by having more time to care for a dog (86.7%). Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that Pandemic Puppy owners were more likely to be first-time dog owners and have children in their household, were less likely to seek out a breeder that performed health testing on their breeding dog(s) or view their puppy in-person, and were more likely to pay a deposit without seeing their puppy. At purchase, Pandemic Puppies were more likely to be younger, delivered or collected from outside their breeders property, seen without their littermates, and cost > 2000 compared with 2019 puppies.

After sucrose equilibrium centrifugation of high passage virus, a single peak contained both infectious virus and interfering activity. This virus population resembled the original JHM virus in its structural proteins, but it contained an increased proportion of a protein with a molecular weight of 65  103. Genomic RNA from standard JHM virus contained a single species of RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4  106. After five undiluted passages, however, the virion population contained two RNA species with molecular weights of 5.4  106 and 5.2  106. RNase T1 resistant oligonucleotide finger-printing of these RNAs showed that the lower molecular weight RNA had lost several oligonucleotide spots that were present in the genomic RNA of the standard JHM virus. After several serial diluted passages of passage 10 virus, a single virus population was obtained which again had only standard virus RNA with a molecular weight of 5.4  106 and lacked interfering activity.

Moreover, approaches to manipulate spikelet development have the potential to increase grain yield.

The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs. In addition, the main body of the palea was reduced, and the sterile lemma was enlarged and partially acquired hull (lemma and/or palea) identity. We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect. MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes.

Prepared tissue sections were observed by 2 expert pathologists. Results. Diffuse alveolar damage was the main pathologic finding in the lung tissue samples. Patients with hospitalization durations of more than 10 days showed evidence of organization. Multinucleated cells in alveolar spaces and alveolar walls, atypical enlarged cells, accumulation of macrophages in alveolar spaces, and congestion of vascular channels were the other histopathologic alteration of the lung.

Liver biopsies showed congestion, micro- and macro-vesicular changes, and minimal to mild portal inflammation, in the majority of cases. Conclusions. Similar to the previous coronavirus infection in 2003, the main pathologic finding in the lung was diffuse alveolar damage with a pattern of organization in prolonged cases.

This is a barrier to developing effective interventions for social adjustment of traumatized individuals. The present study addressed this research gap through a cognitive model. Methods: A total of 604 young adults (aged 18C24; living in Australia) from different backgrounds (refugee, non-refugee immigrant, and Australian) were assessed through self-report questionnaires. The data were analyzed through path analysis and multivariate analysis of variance. Two path analyses were conducted separately for migrant (including non-refugee and refugee immigrants) and Australian groups. Results: Analyses indicated that cognitive avoidance and social problem solving can significantly mediate the relation between trauma and social adjustment (p < 0.05). The model explaining this process statistically fit the data (e.g., NFI, TLI, CFI > 0.95). According to the model, reacting to trauma by cognitive avoidance (i.e., chronic thought suppression and over-general autobiographical memory) can disturb the cognitive capacities that are required for social problem solving. Consequently, a lack of effective social problem solving significantly hinders social adjustment. There were no significant differences among the Australian, non-refugee immigrant and refugee participants on the dependent variables. Moreover, the hypothesized links between the variables was confirmed similarly for both migrant (including refugee and non-refugee immigrants) and Australian groups. Conclusion: The findings have important implications for interventions targeting the social adjustment of young individuals.

The estimated annual incidence rate of AIS was 82.6 cases per 100a?000 people in this study compared with 38.2 cases per 100a?000 people in the historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched cohort (rate ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This case series suggests that the risk for AIS is higher in adults 50 years or younger during the convalescent period of a COVID-19 infection without respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke could be part of the next wave of complications of COVID-19, and stroke units should be on alert and use serological testing, especially in younger patients or in the absence of traditional risk factors.","output":"Acute Ischemic Stroke During the Convalescent Phase of Asymptomatic COVID-2019 Infection in Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Trabalhadores do sexo tornam-se cada vez mais vulnerveis economicamente como resultado das medidas restritivas implementadas para responder  pandemia de coronavrus.

We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer and non-cancer patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, with and without cancer, admitted to the ICU of Centro Hospitalar Universitrio do Porto from 2nd March 2020 to 31st January 2021. Patients were matched according to age, gender and underlying comorbidities. Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were obtained from medical records. COVID-19 related outcomes of both groups were compared using logistic regression. Results: 29 critical COVID-19 cancer patients (cases) and 29 critical COVID-19 non-cancer patients (controls) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea and cough were the most common presenting symptoms in both groups. Lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were the most common laboratory findings in both groups and anemia was observed significantly more often in cancer patients (75.9% vs 44.8%;p=0.031). Ground glass opacities were more frequently seen in controls (100% vs 67%;p=0.018). Univariate regression revealed that invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) need on ICU admission was significantly higher among cancer patients [48% vs 7%;odds ratio (OR)= 12.600, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.517-63.063, p=0.002] but there was no significant impact either on global need of IMV during all-length ICU stay (76% vs 55%;OR= 2.554, 95% CI 0.831-7.842, p=0.102) or on mortality rates (59% vs 38%;OR= 2.318, 95% CI 0.809-6.644, p=0.118). A multivariate model showed an increase in the adjusted risk of IMV need at ICU admission (adjusted OR= 14.036, 95% CI 1.337-153.111, p=0.028). The length of ICU stay, time to death and rate of complications were not impacted by the presence of cancer. Conclusions: In this study critical cancer patients with COVID-19 had an increased risk for IMV need at ICU admission but not for IMV need during all-length ICU stay or mortality rates. Despite evolving more rapidly to respiratory failure (RF) cancer patients did not have significant increase on mortality, stressing the importance of aggressive treatment in this group of patients.

Here, we present a label-free nanoplasmonic biosensor-based, multiplex screening test for COVID-19 that can quantitatively detect 10 different biomarkers (6 viral nucleic acid genes, 2 spike protein subunits, and 2 antibodies) with a limit of detection in the aM range, all within one biosensor platform. Our newly developed nanoplasmonic biosensors demonstrate high specificity, which is of the upmost importance to avoid false responses. As a proof of concept, we show that our detection approach has the potential to quantify both IgG and IgM antibodies directly from COVID-19-positive patient plasma samples in a single instrument run, demonstrating the high-throughput capability of our detection approach. Most importantly, our assay provides receiving operating characteristics, areas under the curve of 0.997 and 0.999 for IgG and IgM, respectively. The calculated p-value determined through the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test is <0.0001 for both antibodies when the test of COVID-19-positive patients (n = 80) is compared with that of healthy individuals (n = 72). Additionally, the screening test provides a calculated sensitivity (true positive rate) of 100% (80/80), a specificity (true negative rate) >96% (77/80), a positive predictive value of 98% at 5% prevalence, and a negative predictive value of 100% at 5% prevalence. We believe that our very sensitive, multiplex, high-throughput testing approach has potential applications in COVID-19 diagnostics, particularly in determining virus progression and infection severity for clinicians for an appropriate treatment, and will also prove to be a very effective diagnostic test when applied to diseases beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Multiplexed and High-Throughput Label-Free Detection of RNA/Spike Protein/IgG/IgM Biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Utilizing Nanoplasmonic Biosensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses a significant challenge for curation and interpretation.

These may incorporate holistic themes including function, mood, and quality of life. People living with frailty have poorer outcomes from even short hospital stays. They benefit from person-centred, goal-directed care over protocol-driven pathway approaches. This could be improved by monitoring attainment of health outcome goals. METHODS: A systematic review for older peoples health outcome goals in emergency care was conducted using narrative synthesis. A qualitative study based on grounded theory expanded the outcome framework to include people living with frailty. People with cognitive and communication barriers were included in semi-structured interviews. Discussions focussed on the events and outcomes sought from emergency care. RESULTS: Older peoples health outcome goals for emergency care were classified as efficient and comprehensive care, sensitivity towards vulnerability, and person-centred informed care. The importance of understanding individual perceptions was explicit. Research generally recruited based on age rather than physiological and functional state, and did not assess for impact of frailty on healthcare perceptions. The interview study was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial results showed a predominance of person-centred and holistic care themes among health outcome goals. Participants most common goal for emergency care was relief of symptoms: people often had pain. Participants mostly had severe frailty and wanted their mobility to be assessed, with goals of recovering their functional baseline. While participants had confidence in healthcare professionals and were generally willing to do as we are told to feel better, they expected to undergo at least basic tests in order to receive a working diagnosis for their problem. People wanted to understand their illness and for explanations to be communicated to their relatives.

High endemicity with rapid spread and morbidity greatly impacts bovine species, demanding adequate attention towards BEFV prophylaxis. Currently, a few suboptimum vaccines are prevailing, but were confined to local strains with limited protection. Therefore, we designed a highly efficacious multi-epitope vaccine candidate targeted against the geographically distributed BEFV population. By utilizing immunoinformatics technology, all structural proteins were targeted for B- and T-cell epitope prediction against the entire allele population of BoLA molecules. Prioritized epitopes were adjoined by linkers and adjuvants to effectively induce both cellular and humoral immune responses in bovine. Subsequently, the in silico construct was characterized for its physicochemical parameters, high immunogenicity, least allergenicity, and non-toxicity. The 3D modeling, refinement, and validation of ligand (vaccine construct) and receptor (bovine TLR7) then followed molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation to validate their stable interactions. Moreover, in silico cloning of codon-optimized vaccine construct in the prokaryotic expression vector (pET28a) was explored. This is the first time HTL epitopes have been predicted using bovine datasets. We anticipate that the designed construct could be an effective prophylactic remedy for the BEF disease that may pave the way for future laboratory experiments.","output":"Immunoinformatics Approach to Design Multi-Epitope- Subunit Vaccine against Bovine Ephemeral Fever Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is involved with a pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

The authors sought to describe practice for emergency intubation, estimate success rates and complications, and determine variation in practice and outcomes between high-income and low- and middle-income countries. The authors hypothesized that successful emergency airway management in patients with COVID-19 is associated with geographical and procedural factors. METHODS: The authors performed a prospective observational cohort study between March 23, 2020, and October 24, 2020, which included 4,476 episodes of emergency tracheal intubation performed by 1,722 clinicians from 607 institutions across 32 countries in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The authors investigated associations between intubation and operator characteristics, and the primary outcome of first-attempt success. RESULTS: Successful first-attempt tracheal intubation was achieved in 4,017/4,476 (89.7%) episodes, while 23 of 4,476 (0.5%) episodes required four or more attempts. Ten emergency surgical airways were reported-an approximate incidence of 1 in 450 (10 of 4,476). Failed intubation (defined as emergency surgical airway, four or more attempts, or a supraglottic airway as the final device) occurred in approximately 1 of 120 episodes (36 of 4,476). Successful first attempt was more likely during rapid sequence induction versus non-rapid sequence induction (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.49 to 2.39]; P < 0.001), when operators used powered air-purifying respirators versus nonpowered respirators (odds ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.16 to 2.20]; P = 0.006), and when performed by operators with more COVID-19 intubations recorded (odds ratio, 1.03 for each additional previous intubation [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.06]; P = 0.015). Intubations performed in low- or middle-income countries were less likely to be successful at first attempt than in high-income countries (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.79]; P = 0.001).

Understanding patients perceptions of the disruptions in care and their willingness to reengage the healthcare system are crucial to planning the resumption of elective care. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to elicit patient perceptions about delays in total joint arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified a consecutive series of patients who experienced COVID-19-driven delays to scheduled total hip or knee arthroplasty at an urban, academic medical center in the Southeastern United States. A 20-item survey was administered via telephone. Answers were recorded and descriptive statistics were performed. A post hoc -square analysis compared characteristics and outlooks of patients who did and did not immediately desire surgery. RESULTS: Of 111 patients (64% of those identified) who met inclusion criteria and completed the survey, 96% said they felt that they were treated fairly and 90% said that the surgical delay was in their best interest; 68% reported emotional distress from the delay, but 45% reported a desire to wait longer for the pandemic to subside. Lower joint-function scores, higher pain levels, higher pain catastrophizing scores, and longer latency from personally deciding to pursue surgery were associated with the reported need for immediate surgery. CONCLUSION: Overall, patients reported that they understood the need for elective surgical delays during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the psychological implications they reported were not negligible. Patient preference for immediate reengagement with the healthcare system was dichotomous, with many patients favoring precautionarily furthering the delay. Understanding these preferences will help optimize elective orthopedic care during unprecedented times.

Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect of first and second trimester maternal COVID-19 disease on fetal and perinatal outcomes. This was a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with a laboratory-proven SARS-COV-2 infection contracted prior to 26 weeks gestation. Women were followed at a single tertiary medical center by serial sonographic examinations every 4C6 weeks to assess fetal well-being, growth, placental function, anatomic evaluation and signs of fetal infection. Amniocentesis was offered to assess amniotic fluid SARS-COV-2-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was offered at 30C32 weeks gestation. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal data were collected from history intake, medical charts or by telephone survey. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women infected at first vs. second trimester. 55 women with documented COVID-19 disease at early gestation were included and followed at our center. The mean maternal age was 29.6  6.2 years and the mean gestational age at viral infection was 14.2  6.7 weeks with 28 (51%) women infected at the first trimester and 27 (49%) at the second trimester.

Describe the perceptions of key actors regarding the disruption of health services for populations that ceased to be prioritized because of the COVID-19 pandemicpregnant women, newborn, children, adolescents, and womenin countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) during the first stage of the pandemic. METHODS. In this cross-sectional study, a 35-question survey was administered to key actors in 19 LAC countries between July and September 2020. The respondents were asked for their personal perceptions regarding the situation of social and health services in their country before and during the pandemic. They were also asked for a projection of the situation during the post-pandemic period. RESULTS. In the 691 responses received, the main perception was that coverage in the services analyzed had been high before the pandemic, although their quality was not as highly rated. Both the coverage and quality of services were thought to have declined for adolescents and women. The majority of respondents predicted that all services will continue to function at lower than usual coverage levels for another three months (53.1%) and another 12 months (41.3%). Guaranteeing coverage and access to health services was considered the main policy challenge going forward. The next most needed initiatives noted were financing for actions to support women, children, and adolescents, and protection against violence and promotion of measures to combat it. CONCLUSIONS. Although the pandemic has struck all countries, its effect on the delivery of services in the populations analyzed differs from country to country and according to the types of service. It is essential to invest in national information systems that will make it possible to monitor the different services and identify the populations that need to be prioritized.","output":"Interrupcin de servicios de salud para embarazadas, recin nacidos, ni?os y ni?as, adolescentes y mujeres durante la pandemia de COVID-19: proyecto ISLAC 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic is proposed on the basis of the epiMOX dashboard (publicly accessible at https://www.epimox.polimi.it) that deals with data of the epidemic trends and outbreaks in Italy from late February 2020.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the State of New Jersey had a supply of registered nurses (RNs) that was sufficient to meet the needs of hospitalized patients during a natural disaster C Hurricane Sandy. METHODS: Secondary data were used to forecast the demand and supply of New Jersey RNs during Hurricane Sandy. Data sources from November 2011 and 2012 included the State Inpatient Databases (SID), American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey on hospital characteristics and staffing data from New Jersey Department of Health. Three models were used to estimate the RN shortage for each hospital, which was the difference between the demand and supply of RN full-time equivalents. RESULTS: Data were available on 66 New Jersey hospitals, more than half of which experienced a shortage of RNs during Hurricane Sandy. For hospitals with a RN shortage in ICUs, a 20% increase in observed RN supply was needed to meet the demand; and a 10% increase in observed RN supply was necessary to meet the demand for hospitals with a RN shortage in non-ICUs.

Among the contributors to thrombosis, the contact activation system and the kallikrein/kinin system, two overlapping plasma proteolytic systems that are often considered as synonymous, regulate thrombosis from different aspects. On one hand, components of the contact activation system such as factor XII initiates activation of the coagulation proteins promoting thrombus formation on artificial surfaces through factor XI- and possibly prekallikrein-mediated intrinsic coagulation. On the other hand, physiological activation of plasma prekallikrein in the kallikrein/kinin system on endothelial cells liberates bradykinin from associated high-molecular-weight kininogen to stimulate the constitutive bradykinin B2 receptor to generate nitric oxide and prostacyclin to induce vasodilation and counterbalance angiotensin II signaling from the renin-angiotensin system which stimulates vasoconstriction. In addition to vascular tone regulation, this interaction between the kallikrein/kinin and renin-angiotensin systems has a thrombo-regulatory role independent of the contact pathway. At the level of the G-protein coupled receptors of these systems, defective bradykinin signaling due to attenuated bradykinin formation and/or decreased B2 receptor expression, as seen in murine prekallikrein and B2 receptor null mice, respectively, leads to compensatory overexpressed Mas, the receptor for angiotensin-(1-7) of the renin-angiotensin system. Mas stimulation and/or its increased expression contributes to maintaining a healthy vascular homeostasis by generating graded elevation of plasma prostacyclin which reduces thrombosis through two independent pathways: (1) increasing the vasoprotective transcription factor Sirtuin 1 to suppress tissue factor expression, and (2) inhibiting platelet activation. This review will summarize the recent advances in this field that support these understandings. Appreciating these subtle mechanisms help to develop novel anti-thrombotic strategies by targeting the vascular receptors in the renin-angiotensin and the kallikrein/kinin systems to maintain healthy vascular homeostasis.","output":"Novel anti-thrombotic mechanisms mediated by Mas receptor as result of balanced activities between the kallikrein/kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to changes in health care use, including decreased emergency department visits for children. In this study, we sought to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inpatient use within children's hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the Pediatric Health Information System. We compared inpatient use and clinical outcomes for children 0 to 18 years of age during the COVID-19 period (March 15 to August 29, 2020) to the same time frame in the previous 3 years (pre-COVID-19 period). Adjusted generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the association of the pandemic period with inpatient use. We assessed trends overall and for a subgroup of 15 medical All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs). RESULTS: We identified 424 856 hospitalizations (mean: 141 619 hospitalizations per year) in the pre-COVID-19 period and 91 532 in the COVID-19 period. Compared with the median number of hospitalizations in the pre-COVID-19 period, we observed declines in hospitalizations overall (35.1%), and by APR-DRG (range: 8.5%-81.3%) with asthma (81.3%), bronchiolitis (80.1%), and pneumonia (71.4%) experiencing the greatest declines. Overall readmission rates were lower during the COVID-19 period; however, other outcomes, including length of stay, cost, ICU use, and mortality remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 period with some variability by APR-DRGs.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients are often in need for intensive chemotherapy to induce remission that will be complicated with prolonged period of cytopenias. They are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. These patients may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anti-cancer therapy. ALL patients are at higher risk of developing life-threatening infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection and the presence of multiple risk factors in the same patient is common. Cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population.

PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection were compared with patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (control). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 384 patients in the analysis. Inpatient mortality was significantly higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection compared with controls (64% vs 49%; p = 0.007). Despite both groups demonstrating similar ventilatory function and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on day 1 of intubation, with similar lung compliance throughout the study period, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection demonstrated progressive hypoxia compared with controls across the study period. Similarly, higher positive end-expiratory pressure levels and increased use of paralytics were observed in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome infection group. On univariate analysis of the entire cohort, significant risk factors for inpatient mortality included coronavirus disease 2019 infection (p = 0.007), older age (p < 0.001), high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (p = 0.003), vasopressor use (p = 0.039), paralytic use (p < 0.001), higher positive end-expiratory pressure levels on day 3 (p = 0.027) and day 7 (p < 0.001), in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome severity on both days 3 (p = 0.008) and 7 (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified coronavirus disease 2019 infection (odds ratio, 1.939; p = 0.021), older age (odds ratio, 1.042; p < 0.001), paralytic use (odds ratio, 3.366; p < 0.001), and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (odds ratio, 1.152; p = 0.027) as significant predictors of mortality across the entire cohort.

During the mechanical ventilation and the weaning process, the conduct of pulmonary rehabilitation is essential for the patients to improve the spontaneous breathing ability and to avoid the weakness of respiratory muscles and other pulmonary functional trauma. However, inappropriate mechanical ventilation strategies for pulmonary rehabilitation often result in weaning difficulties and other ventilator complications. In this article, the mechanical ventilation strategies for pulmonary rehabilitation are studied based on the analysis of patient-ventilator interaction. A pneumatic model of the mechanical ventilation system is established to determine the mathematical relationship among the pressure, the volumetric flow, and the tidal volume. Each ventilation cycle is divided into four phases according to the different respiratory characteristics of patients, namely, the triggering phase, the inhalation phase, the switching phase, and the exhalation phase. The control parameters of the ventilator are adjusted by analyzing the interaction between the patient and the ventilator at different phases. A novel fuzzy control method of the ventilator support pressure is proposed in the pressure support ventilation mode. According to the fuzzy rules in this research, the plateau pressure can be obtained by the trigger sensitivity and the patients inspiratory effort. An experiment prototype of the ventilator is established to verify the accuracy of the pneumatic model and the validity of the mechanical ventilation strategies proposed in this article. In addition, through the discussion of the patient-ventilator asynchrony, the strategies for mechanical ventilation can be adjusted accordingly.

The simulator assessment phase was carried out involving both expert neonatologists and residents. Before and after the clinical procedure, surveys were used for collecting subjective evaluations. Finally, procedural time was recorded. Based on the obtained results, neonatologists considered the simulator a valid teaching and retraining tool. Moreover, thanks to a simple setting and the possibility to provide real-time feedback, the simulator proved to be a valid tool for training also in critical conditions of personal distancing, e.g., Covid-19 pandemic, which often requires remote operation.

Although statewide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders on social distancing behaviors. METHOD: This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020, to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS: From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home, and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home, and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing but accounted for only part of this behavioral change.

Students reported that stay-at-home learning eroded support for their student role while also creating conflicts between the student role and other competing roles, such as child, sibling, or supplemental wage earner. As a result, they significantly lacked motivation to complete schoolwork during stay-at-home orders. Using a framework rooted in role identity theory, we analyze this role erosion and role conflict. Based on that analysis, we suggest potential actions for faculty to mitigate the adverse impact that this role erosion/conflict has on learning and, thus, bolster the student role while simultaneously reducing conflict between the student role and other competing roles. As we brace for multiple semesters of teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, such efforts to facilitate positive stay-at-home learning experiences for our students will contribute to determining our academic success and our educational institutions' economic viability.","output":"When Worlds Collide: Framing Students' Challenges with Stay-at-home Learning During COVID-19 through the Lens of Conflicting Role Identities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this retrospective cohort study at eight hospitals in Germany was to specify influenza-associated in-hospital mortality during the 2017/2018 flu season, which was the strongest in Germany in the past 30 years.

The paper discusses Chinas growing involvement in global health. Health is an area where there is broad agreement over global priorities and, potentially, a fertile space to build new forms of collaboration that point the way towards the adaptation of global governance to a rapidly changing context. RESULTS: Drawing on previous analyses of Chinas management of change in its domestic health reforms and interviews with a range of stakeholders in China, the UK and Switzerland, the paper argues that Chinas engagement in global health is developing and diversifying rapidly in response to the central governments desire to see a greater role for China in global health. This diversification is part of a pattern of change management familiar from Chinas domestic reform experience. Explorations underway by a range of Chinese agencies form part of a process of rapid experimentation and experiential learning that are informing Chinas search for (a) new global role(s). CONCLUSIONS: China is undergoing rapid institutional innovation and developing capacity for greater global engagement, including in health; however, substantial, recent leadership commitments make clear Chinese agencies need for continued exploration, innovation and rapid learning. How China engages globally is of significance to the world, not just China. The challenge for China, other global actors and multilateral organisations is to incorporate new approaches into existing global governance arrangements, including for the management of global health. This will require a willingness on all sides to learn from each other and invest the effort needed to build governance arrangements appropriate for the coming decades.

Patients with influenza had increased risk of fall injuries and fractures compared to controls. INTRODUCTION: Fractures and fall injuries often lead to disability, increased morbidity, and mortality. Older adults are at higher risk of influenza-related complications such as pneumonia, cardiovascular events, and deaths, but the risk of fractures and fall injuries is unclear. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the risk of fractures and fall injuries in older patients after admission with seasonal influenza. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of 6604 adults, 65 years or older, admitted with seasonal influenza at Swedish hospitals (from December 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017) and 330,200 age- and sex-matched controls from the general population and admitted for other reasons, the risk of fracture or fall injury was investigated. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 6604 influenza patients was 80.9 (8.1) years and 50.1% were women. During the first year after hospital discharge, there were 680 (10.3%) patients suffering from a fracture or fall injury among the patients with influenza, and 25,807 (7.8%) among the controls, corresponding to incident rates of 141 (95% CI, 131C152) and 111 (95% CI, 110C112) fractures or fall injuries per 1000 person-years respectively, translating to a significantly increased risk of fracture or fall injury in a Cox regression model (hazard ratio (HR) 1.28 (95% CI, 1.19C1.38)), a risk that was maintained after multivariable adjustment (HR 1.22 (95% CI 1.13C1.31)).

The statistical significance of the association between subscales of depression, anxiety, stress and QoL domains were assessed using the Pearson's correlation test. Results: Of the 180 participants, the majority were Malays (87.2%) and females (82.2%). The average scores were the highest for stress (5.66  4.59) and the score in the environment domain of QoL (59.27  17.23) was the lowest.

Study design A retrospective study of the circulation of different types and subtypes of EV-D68 was performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from March 2016 through October 2016 in children admitted to the Emergency Room with respiratory diseases. Results Among 390 children, 22 (59.1% males; mean age 47 months) were found to be infected by EV-D68 and most of them were immunocompetent (72.7%). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 12 (54.5%) children. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region showed that all the strains identified in this study belonged to clade B3. Within B3 subclade, the Italian EV-D68 strains were most closely related to strains detected in Southern China in 2015 as well as to strains detected in US and the Netherlands in 2016. Conclusions These results showed that EV-D68 infections are a common cause of lower respiratory illness in pediatric age.

Importantly, these double ORF-deficient rSARS-CoV-2 showed attenuation in both K18 hACE2 transgenic mice and golden Syrian hamsters. A single intranasal dose vaccination induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 VoC, and also activated viral component-specific T-cell responses.

The RNA synthesis machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal drug target and consists of non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), which is directly responsible for RNA synthesis, and numerous co-factors involved in RNA proofreading and 5 capping of viral RNAs. The formation of the 5 7-methylguanosine (m(7)G) cap structure is known to require a guanylyltransferase (GTase) as well as a 5 triphosphatase and methyltransferases; however, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping remains poorly understood. Here we find that SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 is involved in viral RNA capping as a GTase, carrying out the addition of a GTP nucleotide to the 5 end of viral RNA via a 5 to 5 triphosphate linkage. We further show that the nsp12 NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase) domain performs this reaction, and can be inhibited by remdesivir triphosphate, the active form of the antiviral drug remdesivir.

When analyzing 50 predicted folds per sequence, we found near-native predictions (79% PPV and 81% sensitivity) for RNAs of length  200 nucleotides, matching the performance of recent deep-learningbased structure prediction methods. Our algorithm also acts as a folding kinetic ansatz, which we tested on two RNAs: the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE) and a classic bi-stable sequence. For the CFSE, an ensemble of 68 distinct structures computed by RAFFT allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. For the second application, only 46 distinct structures were required to reproduce the kinetics, whereas known methods required a sample of 20,000 structures.

Conventionally, in vitro models are based on experimental manipulation of mammalian cells, grown as monolayers on flat, two-dimensional (2D) substrates. Despite the amazing progress and discoveries achieved with flat biology models, our ability to translate biological insights has been limited, since the 2D environment does not reflect the physiological behavior of cells in real tissues.

Safe and equitable full-in-person school instruction is a critical factor in the continued educational gains of children and for their general well-being. The objective of this study was to report epidemiological trends related to the increasing percentage of students returning to in-person instruction, the suspected in-school transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), the virus that causes COVID-19, and countywide COVID-19 case rates during the first 21 weeks of school reopening in Marin County, CA, in the fall of 2020. Materials and methods The institutional review board (IRB) approval was waived for this study as it did not involve any identifiable human subjects data. Retrospective electronic reviews of countywide COVID-19 daily case count and COVID-19-related reports associated with in-person school participants from 77 schools in Marin County, CA, from September 8, 2020, to January 29, 2021, were conducted. The data were made available in collaboration with the Marin County Office of Education (MCOE) and Marin County Department of Health and Human Services (Marin HHS). Descriptive trends analyses were performed to determine whether the phased increase of students attending in-person learning was a significant contributor to countywide COVID-19 incidence rate, crude rate, and in-school COVID-19 viral transmission. This is the first long retrospective study of COVID-19 data among the reopened school population during the second half of the first pandemic year. It was conducted in a 21-week surveillance period involving an immense collaboration between Marin Countys public health officials and school administrators. Results Over the 21-week observational period involving 17,639 students, 4,938 school staff, and 899,175 student days, the countywide COVID-19 crude rate decreased (from 89.9 to 35.89 per 10,000) as more students returned to in-person learning. The schools strict adherence to public health guidance and site-specific safety plans against COVID-19 yielded a significantly reduced incidence rate of 0.84% among in-person learning participants; only nine cases were traced to suspected in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission by way of rigorous contact tracing. The countywide COVID-19 incidence rate was 2.09%. Conclusions It is possible to minimize COVID-19 transmissions in in-person learning settings with cohesive mitigation strategies, specifically strict adherence to proper masking by students and staff while on school grounds. There is no clear correlation that the increasing phased return of students to in-person school drove an increase in countywide COVID-19 cases in Marin County, CA.

COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury might need special attention. However, understanding on this aspect remains unclear. This study aimed to illustrate clinical characteristics and the prognostic value of myocardial injury to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study finally included 304 hospitalized COVID-19 cases confirmed by real-time RT-PCR from January 11 to March 25, 2020. Myocardial injury was determined by serum high-sensitivity troponin I (Hs-TnI). The primary endpoint was COVID-19 associated mortality. RESULTS: Of 304 COVID-19 patients (median age, 65 years; 52.6% males), 88 patients (27.3%) died (61 patients with myocardial injury, 27 patients without myocardial injury on admission). COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had more comorbidities (hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease); lower lymphocyte counts, higher C-reactive protein (CRP, median, 84.9 vs 28.5 mg/L, p<0.001), procalcitonin levels (median, 0.29 vs 0.06 ng/ml, p<0.001), inflammatory and immune response markers; more frequent need for noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation; and was associated with higher mortality incidence (hazard ratio, HR=7.02, 95% confidence interval, CI, 4.45C11.08, p<0.001) than those without myocardial injury. Myocardial injury (HR=4.55, 95% CI, 2.49C8.31, p<0.001), senior age, CRP levels, and novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) types on admission were independent predictors to mortality in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID patients with myocardial injury on admission is associated with more severe clinical presentation and biomarkers. Myocardial injury and higher HsTNI are both strongest independent predictors to COVID related mortality after adjusting confounding factors. In addition, senior age, CRP levels and NCP types are also associated with mortality.","output":"The Prognostic Value of Myocardial Injury in COVID-19 Patients and Associated Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world, and more particularly Europe, is marked by a strong presence of national borders which have substantial direct and indirect effects on the lives of millions of inhabitants, as the recent covidfencing process (Medeiros et al.

Lipid-lowering agents represent an efficient tool for the prevention or reduction of progression of atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases and metabolic syndrome. Statins, ezetimibe, and recently proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are the most effective and used drugs in clinical lipid-lowering therapy. These drugs are mainly aimed to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms of actions. Statins, the agents of the first-line therapyknown as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitorssuppress the liver cholesterol synthesis. Ezetimibe as the second-line therapy can decrease cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol absorption. Finally, the PCSK9 inhibitors act as an inducer of LDL excretion. In spite of their beneficial lipid-lowering properties, many patients suffer from their serious side effects, route of administration, or unsatisfactory physicochemical characteristics. Clinical demand for dose reduction and the improvement of bioavailability as well as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile has resulted in the development of a new targeted therapy that includes nanoparticle carriers, emulsions or vaccination often associated with another more subtle form of administration. Targeted therapy aims to exert a more potent drug profile with lipid-lowering properties either alone or in mutual combination to potentiate their beneficial effects. This review describes the most effective lipid-lowering drugs, their favorable and adverse effects, as well as targeted therapy and alternative treatments to help reduce or prevent atherosclerotic processes and cardiovascular events.","output":"Targeted Strategy in Lipid-Lowering Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Despite strong efforts that have been taking place to control the pandemic globally, the virus is on the rise in many countries. Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care services utilization amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa zone, Central Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those who gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and an adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was higher among mothers who had primary (AOR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.29-3.60), secondary (AOR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.13-3.44), and college and above education (AOR = 2.89, 95%CI: 1.34-6.22) than those who could not read and write.

However, the mechanisms by which these dynamical entities coordinate themselves to perform biological tasks remain hotly debated. Here, a physical theory is presented to explain how functional dynamical behavior possibly emerge in complex/macro molecules, thanks to the effect that we term bilocalization of thermal vibrations. More specifically, our approach allows us to understand how structural irregularities lead to a partitioning of the energy of the vibrations into two distinct sets of molecular domains, corresponding to slow and fast motions. This shape-encoded spectral allocation, associated to the genetic sequence, provides a close access to a wide reservoir of dynamical patterns, and eventually allows the emergence of biological functions by natural selection. To illustrate our approach, the SPIKE protein structure of SARS-COV2 is considered.","output":"Energy Bilocalization Effect and the Emergence of Molecular Functions in Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past several decades, research on autophagy, a highly conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, has been advanced by studies in different model organisms, especially in the field of its molecular mechanism and regulation.

This vision paper discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19 and evidence for these modifications and suggests future directions for anesthesiology education.Learning management systems provide structure to online learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations, the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs. Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed curricular options.The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational knowledge prior to teaching sessions with a focus on application during structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate focused pre-class work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions interactive.Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients. Multidisciplinary, in-situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost. With the increasing dependency on multimedia and technology support for teaching and learning, one important focus of educational research is on the development and evaluation of strategies that reduce extraneous processing and manage essential and generative processing in virtual learning environments.

On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to enumerate the effect of the pandemic on vaccination rates during the COVID-19 lockdown and the aftermath in pediatric patients aged 6weeks-6 years. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of medical records was performed of missed well childcare visits at MetroHealth from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. The sample size of 400 children aged 6 weeks to 6 years were randomly selected. Demographic data, number of calls made to attempt, scheduled WCC, no show rates for clinic appointments, number of missed WCC, location of MH facility, insurance type, vaccination status prior to the pandemic were collected. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (IBM Corp. Released 2020. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). RESULTS: From this descriptive study, we found that 43.5% of patients were not up to date on their childhood vaccination. The mean age was 24.38 months (SD 20.15). There were slightly more males (52.8%) in the study than females (47.3%) and most children were of African American descent. More than 50% of patients missed a scheduled well child appointment and 27% had a missed at least two consecutive appointments. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has no doubt made a significant mark on health care; the effects would be both immediate and delayed, with vulnerable population being the most impacted.

The binding of SARS-CoV (CoV) spike protein (S-Protein) Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor initiates the entry of corona virus into the host cells leading to the infection. However, considering the mutations reported in the SARS-CoV 2 (nCoV), the structural changes and the binding interactions of the S-protein RBD of nCoV were not clear. The present study was designed to elucidate the structural changes, hot spot binding residues and their interactions between the nCoV S-protein RBD and ACE2 receptor through computational approaches. Based on the sequence alignment, a total of 58 residues were found mutated in nCoV S-protein RBD. These mutations led to the structural changes in the nCoV S-protein RBD 3d structure with 4 helices, 10 sheets and intermittent loops. The nCoV RBD was found binding to ACE2 receptor with 11 hydrogen bonds and 1 salt bridge. The major hot spot amino acids involved in the binding identified by interaction analysis after simulations includes Glu 35, Tyr 83, Asp 38, Lys 31, Glu 37, His 34 amino acid residues of ACE2 receptor and Gln 493, Gln 498, Asn 487, Tyr 505 and Lys 417 residues in nCoV S-protein RBD.

We hypothesized that neonates with opioid exposure would have reduced proportions of some immune cells, an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, reduced T cell proliferation, and monocyte bacterial killing activity compared to the control population. METHODS: The present study compares immune cell populations, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in the serum, and monocyte and T cell functional activity using umbilical cord samples from neonates with known opioid exposure during gestation and from control neonates without known exposure. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated a significant reduction in neutrophils, decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum, and reduced IL-2 production during in vitro CD4(+) T cell proliferation in neonates exposed to opioids compared to controls. The neutrophil findings were supported by retrospective analysis of an extended network of deidentified patient records. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to evaluate differences in neonatal immunity as a result of opioid exposure in the human population that will inform continued mechanistic studies. IMPACT: The opioid epidemic has become a public health crisis in the United States, and the corresponding incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) have risen accordingly. New research is required to understand the short and long-term health impacts of opioid exposure to the neonate. This is the first human study to investigate the immunologic profile and functionality in neonates with known opioid exposure in utero.

METHODS: Qualitative methods included expert input, literature and measure review, and parent interviews to confirm measure frameworks, item understandability, and developmental appropriateness. Quantitative methods included two waves of field testing and item response theory (IRT)-based psychometric evaluation of reliability and validity, as well as IRT centering and item calibration. Correlational analyses with other PROMIS Early Childhood (EC) Parent Report measures and known-group differences analyses by health status were conducted to evaluate construct validity. All measures were normed to the general U.S. population. RESULTS: Qualitative results suggested three primary early childhood well-being domains: Positive Affect, Engagement, and Self-Regulation. Quantitative results revealed a unidimensional factor structure for Positive Affect and multidimensional factor structures for Engagement and Self-Regulation, both of which had two factors accounting for >10% of modeled variance reflecting unique unidimensional domains. This resulted in five final PROMIS EC well-being measures: Positive Affect, Engagement-Curiosity, Engagement-Persistence, Self-Regulation-Flexibility, and Self-Regulation-Frustration Tolerance. Correlations and known-groups differences analyses showed robust construct validity across a range of chronic health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The new PROMIS EC Parent Report well-being measures offer clinicians and researchers a brief, efficient, and precise way to evaluate young children's well-being. All five measures include only positively valanced item content, which pushes the field to evaluate the presence of children's positive assets rather than the absence of problems.","output":"Measuring PROMIS?

Although most of the approved vaccines have been highly effective, many developing, and economically poor countries are still deprived of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 due to the unequal distribution of vaccines worldwide. Furthermore, the uncertainty about the effectiveness of the available vaccines against the emerging mutants and variants also remains a matter of concern. Due to the multistep pathogenesis and unique features, combination therapy using safe immunomodulatory and antiviral drugs should be considered as the most effective and acceptable therapeutic regimen for this infection. Based on a thorough assessment of the literature, it was determined that it would be interesting to study the therapeutic potential of ivermectin and doxycycline, given their roles in several biological pathways involved in SARS CoV-2 pathogenesis. Following that, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken using Scopus, Web of Science, and Pubmed, depending on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Our findings reveal that the coronavirus attracted the attention of people from different countries at different times in varying intensities. Also, the sentiment in their tweets is correlated to the news and events that occurred in their countries including the number of newly infected cases, number of recoveries and deaths. Moreover, common sentiment patterns can be observed in various countries during the spread of the virus.

Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. RESULTS: Five identified studies found that a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections have occurred outdoors (<10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% CI 6.0, 57.9). Five studies described influenza transmission outdoors and two described adenovirus transmission outdoors. There was high heterogeneity in study quality and individual definitions of outdoor settings which limited our ability to draw conclusions about outdoor transmission risks. In general, factors such as duration and frequency of personal contact, lack of personal protective equipment and occasional indoor gathering during a largely outdoor experience were associated with outdoor reports of infection.

Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity. METHODS: In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive two injections, 21 days apart, of 30 g of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-to-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19; onset, &#8805;7 days after dose 2) in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 2260 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79 to 86% of participants], fatigue [in 60 to 66%], and headache [in 55 to 65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-to-15-year-old participants relative to 16-to-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no Covid-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100).

Various components of the immune system, including neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), Ad specific T cells and type I IFN activated NK cells, contribute to dampening the efficacy of Ad vectors in individuals with pre-existing Ad immunity. In order to circumvent pre-existing immunity to adenovirus, numerous strategies, such as developing alternative Ad serotypes, varying immunization routes and utilizing prime-boost regimens, are under pre-clinical or clinical phases of development. However, these strategies mainly focus on one arm of pre-existing immunity. Selection of alternative serotypes has been largely driven by the absence in the human population of nAbs against them with little attention paid to cross-reactive Ad specific T cells. Conversely, varying the route of immunization appears to mainly rely on avoiding Ad specific tissue-resident T cells. Finally, prime-boost regimens do not actually circumvent pre-existing immunity but instead generate immune responses of sufficient magnitude to confer protection despite pre-existing immunity. Combining the above strategies and thus taking into account all components regulating pre-existing Ad immunity will help further improve the development of Ad vectors for animal and human use.","output":"Pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors: Humoral, cellular, and innate response, what's important?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: While telemedicine usage has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains little consensus about how spine surgeons perceive virtual care. The purpose of this study was to explore international perspectives of spine providers on the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. METHODS: Responses from 485 members of AO Spine were analyzed, covering provider perceptions of the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. All questions were optional, and blank responses were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The leading challenges reported by surgeons were decreased ability to perform physical examinations (38.6%), possible increased medicolegal exposure (19.3%), and lack of reimbursement parity compared to traditional visits (15.5%). Fewer than 9.0% of respondents experienced technological issues. On average, respondents agreed that telemedicine increases access to care for rural/long-distance patients, provides societal cost savings, and increases patient convenience. Responses were mixed about whether telemedicine leads to greater patient satisfaction. North Americans experienced the most challenges, but also thought telemedicine carried the most benefits, whereas Africans reported the fewest challenges and benefits. Age did not affect responses. CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons are supportive of the benefits of telemedicine, and only a small minority experienced technical issues. The decreased ability to perform the physical examination was the top challenge and remains a major obstacle to virtual care for spine surgeons around the world, although interestingly, 61.4% of providers did not acknowledge this to be a major challenge.

This study focused on the possible association between lymphopenia and computed tomography (CT) scan features and COVID-19 patient mortality. The clinical data of 596 COVID-19 patients were collected from February 2020 to September 2020. The patients' serological survey and CT scan features were retrospectively explored. The median age of the patients was 56.7  16.4 years old. Lung involvement was more than 50% in 214 COVID-19 patients (35.9%). The average blood lymphocyte percentage was 20.35  10.16 (normal range, 20%-50%). Although the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were high in more than 80% of COVID-19 patients; CRP, ESR, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) may not indicate the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Patients with severe lung involvement and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of death (odds ratio, 9.24; 95% confidence interval, 4.32-19.78). These results indicated that lymphopenia < 20% along with pulmonary involvement >50% impose a multiplicative effect on the risk of mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate of this group was significantly higher than other COVID-19 hospitalized cases. Furthermore, they meaningfully experienced a prolonged stay in the hospital (p = .00). Lymphocyte count less than 20% and chest CT scan findings with more than 50% involvement might be related to the patient's mortality.

We investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the level of frailty, physical, and cognitive performance in nursing home residents. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included nursing home residents who were infected with COVID-19 (case group, n = 76), matched by age to a control group (n = 76). METHODS: Participants' sociodemographic and medical data were collected, and they were also assessed for physical function (handgrip and walking speed), cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination) and frailty (Frail-NH scale) before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (October to December 2019, pre-COVID-19) and after (June to July 2020, post-COVID-19). COVID-19 symptoms and clinical course were recorded for the cases. RESULTS: Between the pre- and post-COVID-19 assessments, we found a 19% greater deterioration in handgrip, a 22% greater decrease in walking speed, and a 21% greater increase in Frail-NH scores in cases compared with controls. In both cases and controls, on the other hand, there was a significant 10% decrease in Mini-Mental State Examination scores over the study period. Multivariable logistic regression showed that COVID-19 survivors had a 4-fold increased chance of developing frailty compared with controls (odds ratio 4.95, 95% confidence interval 1.13-21.6, P = .03), but not cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 can accelerate the aging process of institutionalized older adults in terms of physical performance and frailty by around 20%.

The idea of using commonly available full-face diving (FFD) masks as a temporary solution was quickly spread across social media. However, it was unknown whether an FFD mask would considerably impair complex surgical tasks. Thus, we aimed to assess laparoscopic surgical performance while wearing an FFD mask as PPE. (2) Methods: In a randomized-controlled cross-over trial, 40 laparoscopically naive medical students performed laparoscopic procedures while wearing an FFD mask with ad hoc 3D-printed connections to heat and moisture exchange (HME) filters vs. wearing a common surgical face mask. The performance was evaluated using global and specific Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) checklists for suturing and cholecystectomy. (3) Results: For the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, both global OSATS scores and specific OSATS scores for the quality of procedure were similar (Group 1: 25  4.3 and 45.7  12.9, p = 0.485, vs. Group 2: 24.1  3.7 and 43.3  7.6, p = 0.485).

As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. METHOD: By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R(0t) proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use R(0t) to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. RESULTS: The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R(0t)) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R(0t) showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R(0t) has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R(0t). We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R(0t). CONCLUSION: The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R(0t) is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP. Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.","output":"Analysis of the Transmissibility Change of 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia and Its Potential Factors in China from 2019 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the beginning of the IEEE Yugoslav Section (in 1971), the first and thus the oldest chapter was the IEEE Joint Chapter Signal Processing/Circuits and Systems (SP-01/CAS-04), founded in 1988. Today, the SP/CAS Chapter of the IEEE Serbia and Montenegro Section has 85 active members as follows: 1 Fellow, 2 Life Senior, 9 Senior Members, 62 Members and 11 Student Members. The SP/CAS Chapter has been very active. Besides promoting IEEE, motivating young researchers to become IEEE members, and organizing annual chapter meetings, the chapter initiated many other events as tutorials and excellent talks (among the speakers were Leon Chua, Sanjit Mitra, Jacek Zurada, Jun Wang, Jelena Kovacevic, Ljiljana Trajkovic, Martin Vetterli, Petar Djuric, Zoran Obradovic,...). Also, the chapter successfully organized a number of conferences, probably the most prominent being NEUREL (Symposium of Neural Networks and Applications). The NEUREL symposia started in 1990, just before the breakup of former Yugoslavia, as the enthusiastic work of Professors Mirko Milic (1932-1993) and Rajko Tomovic (1919-2001) from the University of Belgrade. Unfortunately, after the first NEUREL, the Civil War in the former Yugoslavia stopped many intellectual, cultural, and scientific activities. Surprisingly, NEUREL events survived despite the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia: the second NEUREL was held in the winter of 1992/93, under the enormous inflation in Serbia, as a weekend lecture series directed by Professor Mirko Mili?. Fortunately, the situation in this region improved after 1994 and the third NEUREL, organized by Professor Branimir Reljin (SM, LM), was held in 1995 under (almost) normal conditions. Since that time, the NEUREL symposia have been a biennial scientific meetings dealing with all aspects of artificial neural networks and fuzzy systems, from their theoretical foundations to realizations and applications. After 1997, NEURELs were technically co-sponsored by several IEEE societies and by IEEE Region 8. Unfortunately, in 2020, the 15th NEUREL was canceled due to COVID -19. In some sense, NEUREL is the continuation of the very prominent symposia ISYNT (International Symposium of Network Theory) organized by Professor Horvat from 1968 to 1989.

AIMS We aimed to assess this postoperative activity using capsule endoscopy (CE) and analyze the association between treatment optimization based on CE findings and the long-term course. METHODS In patients who underwent intestinal resection, we performed CE and assessed the endoscopic activity using the Lewis score within 3 months postoperatively (1st CE) and during follow-up. Postoperative treatments were adjusted according to clinical symptoms or CE findings (severity of 1st CE or worsening of follow-up CEs). Hospitalization, repeat surgery, or endoscopic dilation defined the primary outcome. RESULTS Among the CE group (N = 48), 85.7% (1st CE) and 79.2% (2nd CE) exhibited endoscopic activities indicating residual or recurrent lesions. Postoperative treatments were adjusted according to clinical symptoms in the non-CE group (N = 57) and clinical symptoms or CE findings in the CE group. Compared to the non-CE group, the CE group had significantly fewer primary outcomes. Patients with treatment adjustments based on CE findings had even lower primary outcome rate. Multivariate analysis identified the CE group as an independent protective factor (hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval = 0.20-0.96). Treatment adjustments based on CE findings showed a stronger protective effect (0.30, 0.10-0.75). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative repeated CE enabled us to assess residual and recurrent lesions accurately before clinical symptoms appeared. The regular assessment of endoscopic activity and subsequent treatment optimization have the potential for improving postoperative course.","output":"Capsule Endoscopy Is Useful for Postoperative Tight Control Management in Patients with Crohn's Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late December 2019, scientists have been racing against time to effectively develop a vaccine.

In the aftermath of the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initial data raised concerns that ACE/ARB use can increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, leading to the worsening of COVID-19. However, recent studies have suggested that their use might be safe in a select subgroup of patients. We conducted a single-center retrospective study to evaluate the association of in-patient use of ACE/ARB with outcomes among a predominantly ethnic minority patient population of the inner New York City (NYC). Methods This was a retrospective analysis of all hospital admissions with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Results Of the 469 patients included in the study, 91 patients (19.4%) used ACE/ARB therapy during their hospital stay and were labeled as ACE/ARB group. Patients in the ACE/ARB therapy group were older and had a higher incidence of HTN, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure, DM, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Admission D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were similar between the two groups, but absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was lower in the non-ACE/ARB group (0.971 k/ul vs. 1.135 k/ul, p=0.0144). The incidence of hyperkalemia and the rise in creatinine were similar between the two groups. Univariate analysis by treatment group using the log-rank test produced significant results (p=0.0062), indicating a higher survival rate for the ACE/ARB group.

Rational performance in the education system depends on the synergy of educators through knowledge sharing as the basis of education. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge-sharing strategies in clinical education and its changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The content analysis was conducted in 2019 at Birjand University of Medical Sciences. Twenty-seven clinical instructors with enough experience and knowledge in the field of clinical education were chosen based on purposive theoretical sampling. Data collection was done by semi-structured interviews, which continued until data saturation. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and read several times to obtain a whole understanding. Next, the meaning units and initial codes were identified, and then, they were classified into subcategories and categories. To ensure the trustworthiness of the data, Lincoln and Guba criteria were considered. RESULTS: The results of the study include five pedagogical knowledge-sharing strategies: peer-helping, clinical education workplace, use of cyberspace, student mediation, working teams, and scientific communities. Coronavirus pandemic was identified as the facilitator and the culturalization factor of knowledge sharing. In addition, lack of shared knowledge management, lack of compliance with needs, and dispersion of content were considered as barriers to the efficiency of pedagogical knowledge sharing during the coronavirus pandemic.

They show a worldwide distribution, a high degree of ecological diversification as well as a high diversity of associated parasites and pathogens. Despite their prominent and unique role, the knowledge of their parasite-host-relationships as well as the mechanisms of co-evolutionary processes are, partly due to strict conservation regulations, scarce. METHODS: Juvenile specimens of the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) from a roosting colony in Gladenbach (Hesse, Germany) were examined for their metazoan endo-and ectoparasite infections and pathogens. Morphometric data were recorded and the individuals were checked for Lyssavirus-specific antigen using a direct immunofluorescence test. For unambiguous species identification, the bats were analysed by cyt-b sequence comparison. RESULTS: Myotis myotis were parasitized by the six insect and arachnid ectoparasite species, i.e. Ixodes ricinus, Ischnopsyllus octactenus, Ichoronyssus scutatus, Steatonyssus periblepharus, Spinturnix myoti and Cimex dissimilis. Additionally, the nematode Molinostrongylus alatus and the cestode Vampirolepis balsaci were recorded. Each bat was parasitized by at least four species. The parasites showed partially extreme rates of infection, never recorded before, with more than 1,440 parasites per single host. Ichoronyssus scutatus, Steatonyssus periblepharus, Vampirolepis balsaci and Molinostrongylus alatus are recorded for the first time in Germany. A checklist for Europe is presented containing records of 98 parasite species of 14 Myotis species. CONCLUSIONS: The Myotis myotis from Gladenbach (Hesse, Germany) were parasitized by a diverse parasite fauna with high infestation rates. We assume that in juvenile Myotis the number of parasites is generally higher than in adults due to only later acquired immune competence and behavioural adaptations. Our results revealed new insights into parasite fauna of M. myotis and European bats in general. The finding of endoparasitic cyclophyllidean cestodes that have a two-host lifecycle is, considering the stationary behaviour of the juvenile bats, rather unusual and suggests a non-predatory transmission mechanism (e.g. via autoinfection). A new insight gained from the collated literature was that the European wide composition of the Myotis parasite fauna is dominated by a few specific taxonomic groups in Europe.","output":"Parasite diversity of European Myotis species with special emphasis on Myotis myotis (Microchiroptera, Vespertilionidae) from a typical nursery roost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Histoplasmosis rarely causes significant illness in immunocompetent patients.

Objectives: In this scoping review of the literature, we aggregated type and prevalence of symptoms in people with long COVID. Eligibility Criteria: Original investigations concerning the name and prevalence of symptoms were considered in participants 4-weeks post-infection. Sources of Evidence: Four electronic databases [Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)] were searched. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Review selection and characterisation was performed by three independent reviewers using pretested forms. Results: Authors reviewed 2,711 titles and abstracts for inclusion with 152 selected for full-text review. 102 articles were subsequently removed as this did not meet inclusion criteria. Thus, fifty studies were analysed, 34 of which were described as cohort studies or prospective cohort studies, 14 were described as cross-sectional studies, one was described as a case control study, and one was described as a retrospective observational study.

New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions.

The authors examined the effects of high-grade carotid stenosis on the results of endovascular treatment of patients in the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS)-III trial. METHODS The 278 patients in the endovascular arm of the IMS-III trial were categorized according to the degree of carotid stenosis as determined by angiography. In comparing patients with severe stenosis or occlusion ( 70%) to those without severe stenosis (< 70%), the authors evaluated the time to endovascular reperfusion, modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction (mTICI) scores, 24-hour mean infarct volumes, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rates, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days. RESULTS Compared with the 249 patients with less than 70% stenosis, patients with severe stenosis (n = 29) were found to have a significantly longer mean time to reperfusion (105.7 vs 77.7 minutes, p = 0.004); differences in mTICI scores, infarct volumes, hemorrhage rates, and mRS scores at 90 days did not reach statistical significance. Multiple regression analysis revealed that severe carotid stenosis (p < 0.0001) and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p = 0.004) were associated with an increase in time to reperfusion. Older age (p < 0.0001), higher NIHSS score (p < 0.0001), and the absence of reperfusion (p = 0.001) were associated with worse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Severe ipsilateral ICA stenosis was associated with a significantly longer time to reperfusion in the IMS-III trial. Although these findings may not translate directly to modern devices, this 28-minute delay in reperfusion has significant implications, raising concern over the treatment of tandem ICA stenosis and downstream large-vessel occlusion.","output":"Severe carotid stenosis and delay of reperfusion in endovascular stroke treatment: an Interventional Management of Stroke-III study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Work and family are the two domains from which most adults develop satisfaction in life. They also are responsible for stressful experiences. There is a perception in the community that work is increasingly the source of much of our stress and distress. Depressive symptoms may be related to repeated stressful experiences. Intensive care unit (ICU) physicians are exposed to major stressors. However, the existence of depressive symptoms in these doctors has been poorly studied. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence and associated risk factors of depressive symptoms in junior and senior ICU physicians. METHOD A one-day national survey was conducted in adult intensive care units (ICU) in French public hospitals. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Centers of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). RESULTS A total of 189 ICUs participated, and 901 surveys were returned (75.8% response rate). Symptoms of depression were found in 23.8% of the respondents using the CES-D scale. Fifty-eight percent of these intensivists presenting symptoms of depression wished to leave their job compared with only 33% of those who did not exhibit signs of depression as assessed by the CES-D scale (p < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression showed that organizational factors were associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. Workload (long interval since the last nonworking weekend, absence of relief of service until the next working day after a night shift) and impaired relationships with other intensivists were independently associated with the presence of depressive symptoms. A high level of burnout also was related to the presence of depressive symptoms. In contrast, no demographic factors regarding ICU physicians and no factor related to the severity of illness of patients were retained by the model. The quality of relationships with other physicians (from other departments) was associated with the absence of depressive symptoms (protective effect). CONCLUSIONS Approximately one of four intensivists presented symptoms of depression. The next step could be to test whether organization modification is associated with less depressive symptoms and less desire to leave the job.","output":"Symptoms of depression in ICU physicians."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multisystem nature of coronavirus disease 2019 has become increasingly clear over the course of the pandemic.

Travel was inevitably associated with the rapid global transmission of COVID-19. In the UK, public health authorities took action to reduce risks of travel-associated spread by providing public health information at ports of entry. This study aims to understand individual risk assessment processes, decision making, and adherence to official advice among international travellers; to provide evidence to inform future policy on the presentation of public health information to facilitate safer international travel. Study designThis study is a qualitative study evaluation. MethodSemi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate risk assessment processes, decision making, and adherence to official Public Health England (PHE) advice among travellers. ResultsParticipants regarded official advice as adequate at the time, despite observing differences between the intervention measures implemented in the countries of departure. Participants however also described adopting precautionary measures including self-isolation and the use of face coverings that went beyond official advice, and variability in the extent to which they adhered to guidance on contacting health authorities. Adherence to official guidance was informed by the perceived salience of specific transmission possibilities and containment measures assessed in relation to participants social and institutional environments. ConclusionAnalysis of travellers reported motivations demonstrates that responses to public health advice constitute a proactive process of risk assessment and rationalised decision-making that incorporates consideration of living situation, trust in information sources, correspondence with cultural logics, and willingness to accept potential risk to self and significant others in guiding preventive action. Our findings concerning international passengers understanding of, and compliance with, official advice and mitigation measures provide valuable evidence to inform future policy and we provide recommendations on the presentation of public health information to facilitate safer international travel. Access to a central source of regularly updated official information would help minimise confusion between different national guidelines. Greater attention to the differentiated information needs of diverse groups in creating future public-facing guidance would help to minimise the uncertainties generated by receipt of generic information.","output":"Learning about COVID-19 across borders: Public health information and adherence among international travellers to the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Drowning is one of the leading causes of unintentional mortality in Iran. The COVID-19 pandemic combined with drowning has indirectly affected the community. Qazvin province has had a remarkable rate of drowning. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on drowning in this province. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study that used the national drowning registry database, all of the people in Qazvin who drowned between March 2017 to March 2021 were compared. Data were collected from the database of Emergency Medical Services in Qazvin and analyzed by SPSS software. Descriptive and Poisson regression and time series analysis were used. RESULTS: The number of missions before the COVID-19 outbreak was 35.6 per year and 32 after it. The number of deaths increased from 12.3 to 15. The mean age of the patients was 27.53 and 26.92 years before and after the pandemic, respectively. May-June had the highest number of drownings. Most of the drownings before and after COVID-19 belonged to the male gender. The number of missions in rural and urban areas increased after the COVID-19 outbreak, while all drowning callings outside urban and rural areas decreased. According to Poisson's estimation regression model, the drowning trend diminished with a coefficient of -0.037 and was statistically significant at p = 0.032. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study indicated that COVID-19 did not impact the frequency pattern of drownings in Qazvin. However, the increased number of drownings in agricultural pools and urban water channels was significant. Travel restrictions, pool closures, and decreased global warming due to lockdown could have been effective on the number of drownings. Therefore, it is recommended that policymakers consider drowning prevention planning with priority given to young age groups.

As operating room (OR) capacities are reduced everywhere to ensure availability of intensive care capacities, especially low-complex surgical procedures are often postponed. These include totally implantable central-venous access ports which are important for the oncologic treatment of cancer patients. METHODS: In our study, we investigated the potential of an outpatient surgical centre (OSC) in terms of workflow effectiveness compared to the central operating room complex (COR) of a university hospital using low-complex surgical procedures as an example. Data of 524 consecutive patients who received a Port-a-cath procedure (422 implantations (80.5%) and 102 explantations (19.5%)) in our department between February 2019 and February 2020 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 277 patients were operated in outpatient surgical centre (OSC), and 247 patients received the procedure in the central OR (COR) complex. Grade II and III complications according to the ClavienCDindo classification occurred in 5.2% (OSC) and 7.3% (COR) of patients. Incision-to-suture time was significantly quicker in the OSC group (36 vs. 42 min., p < 0.032). Total OR time (01:08 vs. 01:20 h) and preparation-to-incision time were also shorter in the OSC group (12 vs. 17 min., p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: In order to ensure effective OR utilization especially in times of the corona pandemic, the use of smaller decentralized OR units, e.g., outpatient surgical centres, for performing low-complex surgical cases is beneficial.

Based on the well-known MARTINI CG force field, the recently developed G-MARTINI model for proteins describes large-amplitude structural dynamics, which has not been possible with the commonly used elastic network model. Using the G-MARTINI model, we conduct MD simulations of the F-BAR Pacsin1 protein on lipid membrane. We observe that structural changes of the non-globular protein are largely dependent on the definition of the native contacts in the G model. To address this issue, we introduced a simple cutoff scheme and tuned the cutoff distance of the native contacts and the interaction strength of the Lennard-Jones potentials in the G-MARTINI model. With the optimized G-MARTINI model, we show that it reproduces structural fluctuations of the Pacsin1 dimer from atomistic simulations. We also show that two Pacsin1 dimers properly assemble through lateral interaction on the lipid membrane.

Few studies have looked at the patterns of compliance with different measures within individuals: whether people comply with all measures or selectively choose some but not others. Such research is important for designing interventions to increase compliance. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from 20 947 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected from 17 November to 23 December 2020. Self-report compliance was assessed with six behaviours: mask wearing, hand washing, indoor household mixing, outdoor household mixing, social distancing and compliance with other guidelines. Patterns of compliance behaviour were identified using latent class analysis, and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess demographic, socioeconomic and personality predictors of behaviour patterns. RESULTS: We selected a four-latent class solution. Most individuals reported similar levels of compliance across the six behaviour measures. High level of compliance was the modal response. Lower self-reported compliance was related to young age, high risk-taking behaviour, low confidence in government and low empathy, among other factors. Looking at individual behaviours, mask wearing had the highest level of compliance while compliance with social distancing was relatively low. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that individuals choose to comply with all guidelines, rather than some but not others.

Here, we present data regarding the decline of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-induced humoral immune response in a monocentric cohort of MS patients. METHODS: 96 MS patients undergoing eight different DMTs, all without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, were evaluated for anti-Spike IgG levels, 21 days (T1) and 5C6 months (T2) after the second SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose. The anti-Spike IgG titre from MS subjects was compared with 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: When compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels at T2 in HC, we observed comparable levels in interferon- 1a-, dimethyl fumarate-, teriflunomide- and natalizumab-treated MS subjects, but an impaired humoral response in MS subjects undergoing glatiramer acetate-, cladribine-, fingolimod- and ocrelizumab-treatments. Moreover, comparison between SARS-CoV-2 IgG Spike titre at T1 and T2 revealed a faster decline of the humoral response in patients undergoing dimethyl fumarate-, interferon- 1a- and glatiramer acetate-therapies, while those receiving teriflunomide and natalizumab showed higher persistence compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The prominent decline in humoral response in MS subjects undergoing dimethyl fumarate-, interferon- 1a- and glatiramer acetate-therapies should be considered when formulating booster regimens as these subjects would benefit of early booster vaccinations.","output":"Long term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 humoral response in multiple sclerosis subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented global crisis.

Trolls, poised to disrupt the online discourse and spread disinformation, quickly seized the absence of a credible response to COVID-19 and created a COVID-19 infodemic by promulgating dubious content on Twitter. To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the TrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set of Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to troll. TrollHunter achieved 98.5% accuracy, 75.4% precision and 69.8% recall over a dataset of 1.3 million tweets. Without a final resolution of the pandemic in sight, it is unlikely that the trolls will go away, although they might be forced to evade automated hunting. To explore the plausibility of this strategy, we developed and tested an adversarial machine learning mechanism called TrollHunter-Evader. TrollHunter-Evader employs a Test Time Evasion (TTE) approach in a combination with a Markov chain-based mechanism to recycle originally trolling tweets. The recycled tweets were able to achieve a remarkable 40% decrease in the TrollHunter's ability to correctly identify trolling tweets. Because the COVID-19 infodemic could have a harmful impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide an elaborate discussion about the implications of employing adversarial machine learning to evade Twitter troll hunts.","output":"TrollHunter [Evader]: Automated Detection [Evasion] of Twitter Trolls During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, online learning platforms have proven to help people gain knowledge more conveniently.

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes among hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in the southeast of Mexico between March 28th and June 30th, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivor or non-survivor and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. Results: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men, 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of patients with IMV had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for Non-ICU admission (p<0.014).

METHODS Data from patient visits to 2 San Diego, California, EDs-within an integrated health-care system-were extracted from the electronic health record. Daily patient visits, hospital admissions from the ED, Emergency Severity Index scores, and mode of arrival were compared between two 28-day periods, with the 28 days following a \\"stay at home\\" order issued by the governor of California and a control period of the same dates in 2019. RESULTS These EDs observed a significant decrease in daily visits (42% compared to the previous year) associated with the pandemic. An increased rate of hospital admissions (16.6%-21.6%) was suggestive of an overall increase in acuity; however, changes in the distribution of Emergency Severity Index scores were less pronounced. The overall number of admissions declined significantly. Although overall ambulance traffic decreased, the proportion of patients arriving by ambulance was unchanged.

In this study, our aim was to compare the subjective (self-reported) and objective (test-based) cognitive functioning of senior choir singers and matched control subjects, coupled with assessment of mood, QOL, and social functioning. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study in 162 healthy older (age  60 years) adults (106 choir singers, 56 controls), including measures of cognition, mood, social engagement, QOL, and role of music in daily life. The choir singers were divided to low (1C10 years, N = 58) and high (>10 years, N = 48) activity groups based on years of choir singing experience throughout their life span. A subcohort of 74 participants (39 choir singers, 35 controls) were assessed also with a neuropsychological testing battery. RESULTS: In the neuropsychological testing, choir singers performed better than controls on the verbal flexibility domain of executive function, but not on other cognitive domains. In questionnaires, high activity choir singers showed better social integration than controls and low activity choir singers. In contrast, low activity choir singers had better general health than controls and high activity choir singers. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In healthy older adults, regular choir singing is associated with better verbal flexibility. Long-standing choir activity is linked to better social engagement and more recently commenced choir activity to better general health.","output":"Beneficial effects of choir singing on cognition and well-being of older adults: Evidence from a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a rapidly emerging approach to gallbladder disease.

METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we simulated the weekly use of a prediction model for estimating the then-current ILI incidence across the 2017/18 influenza season solely based on Google search query data. We used weekly ILI data as reported to The European Surveillance System (TESSY) each week, and we removed the then-last 4 weeks from our dataset. We then fitted a prediction model based on the then-most-recent search query data from Google Trends to fill the 4-week gap (Nowcasting). Lasso regression, in combination with cross-validation, was applied to select predictors and to fit the 52 models, one for each week of the season. RESULTS: The models provided accurate predictions with a mean and maximum absolute error of 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.09C1.75) and 6.36 per 10,000 population. The onset, peak and end of the epidemic were predicted with an error of 1, 3 and 2 weeks, respectively.

The present research focuses on the emerging phenomenon of community-led initiatives for vernacular heritage rehabilitation and adaptive reuse in Oman. Through an examination of three case studies, its aim is to describe this process and its modes of action and discuss its effects on vernacular settlement transformations. A mixed research methodology was designed to include (A) analyses of relevant primary and secondary data, (B) documented onsite observations, (C) interviews with local community representatives and key players in the operations of rehabilitation, and (D) extractions and analyses of quantitative data from a hotel booking website. The research sheds light on unsuspected interrelations within and between the projects being implemented in these settlements and their operating modes. It reveals the focal role of a local community in a kind of bottom-up management of its built heritage, coupled with a horizontal cooperation between the three initiatives studied in this research. Moreover, it shows that a heavily centralised and top-down policy for the field of heritage conservation and management is among the main obstacles that hinder such initiatives. Furthermore, community-led operations of vernacular heritage rehabilitation are being undertaken under insufficient regulations in terms of land use, building restoration and adaptive reuse.

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, Wuhan implemented the blockade policy on January 23, 2020. Subsequently, other cities in Hubei responded one after another. The flow of people, production and consumption activities were greatly reduced, and air pollution in some cities was obviously improved. Method We used the daily air pollution and weather data of 103 county-level units in Hubei Province from 2019 to 2020 to test whether the blockade policy affected the air quality. The method of regression discontinuity designs is adopted. And the blockade policy implemented by the government during COVID-19 is regarded as exogenous policy impact, so as to investigate whether the blockade policy will affect the air quality. Results (1) Lockdown has indeed brought about an improvement in air quality. During the lockdown period, the AQI decreased by 15.316%, and the concentrations of four air pollutants (PM10, NO2, PM2.5 and SO2) decreased by 19.607%, 12.395%, 11.448% and 1.278% respectively. (2) The improvement of air quality brought about by the blockade policy is not sustainable, and every index rebounded again about 30 days after lockdown. (3) RD estimation found that the concentrations of AQI, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 decreased by 35.402%, 29.207%, 14.809% and 7.751% respectively. This is consistent with the change trend of the above results, but the change range is obviously larger than the previous one. Conclusion Although the study confirmed that most pollutant indexes decreased during the lockdown period, the blockade policy is not applicable to the prevention and improvement of air pollution. We put forward the policy suggestions from the following two aspects: Firstly, promote green travel and reduce traffic emission sources. Secondly, promote end-of-pipe governance and improve emission reduction efficiency.","output":"Does Lockdown Improve Air Quality?

The activated effector XBP1s was found to enter the nucleus, but ATF4 was unexpectedly diverted to cytoplasmic viral replication complexes by means of nonstructural proteins nsp2/3 to promote viral RNA synthesis. RNAi knockdown of either ATF4 or XBP1s dramatically attenuated virus titers, while overexpression caused increases.

While, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent member. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 82% similar to SARSCCOV-1. The compelling evidences link the progression of viral infection of SARS-CoV-2 with excessive inflammation as a result of the exaggerated immune response and elevated production of immunocytokines resulting in cytokine storm (CS); followed by a series of events, like acute organ damage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as death. Hence attempts to reduce cytokine storm are now being considered as a new paradigm shift in the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2. Tocilizumab (IL-6 blocker), Baricitinib (JAKs and AAK1 inhibitor), TNF inhibitors (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Certolizumab) are currently being evaluated for possible block of the CS.

As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19.

Objective To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and D-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19. Methods This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier. Results We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43).

There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Methods: Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC=0.786) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC=0.635). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors -- not age and gender -- that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. Conclusions: We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.","output":"An integrated clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Building a capital market union is a core project of the European Union, facing not only brexit but also the need to recover from COVID-19 The recently published High Level Forum Report adresses these obstacles and suggests 17 precise, mutually reinforcing and interdependent recommendations for this European endeavour The paper summarizes the four substantive areas of the High Level Forum's recommendations and outlines the specific measures to create a harmonized capital market union: (i) promoting financing of business, (ii) creating a uniform market infrastructure, (iii) fostering individual investor's engagement and (iv) tackling obstacles to cross-border investment ? 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston","output":"Building a Capital Market - The Final Report of the High Level Forum on the EU Capital Market Union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to recent social demands for sustainable developments, the value of biomass as feedstocks for chemical industry is increasing.

Purpose: This study investigates how the physical activity, exercise, and lifestyles of Japanese physical education students, deeply involved in sports, changed due to the school closures and curfews associated with COVID-19. Methods: The sample consisted of 74 Japanese male and female students. Changes in sleep duration, self-assessed subjective exercise intensity, and fatigue levels were assessed by dividing the study period into three phases: April to June 2020 (participants voluntarily restricted their movements), July to September 2020 (return to normal activity levels), and October to December 2020 (three months following the initial return to normal activity levels). Participants used Google Forms to record their sleeping hours, perceived exertion rating, and fatigue daily during the study period, and the results were compared to those obtained via a questionnaire that they completed assessing these variables during the same period of the previous year. Results: We found that school closures caused: 1) a decrease in opportunities to engage in exercise such as club activities, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of physical activity performed owing to the difficulty of performing light exercise at home, and 2) a significant change in lifestyle habits such as an increase in time spent asleep and a decrease in the level of fatigue. Conclusions: Overall, school closures reduced opportunities for exercise and physical activity and led to significant changes in lifestyle habits among physical education students. Attempts should be made to provide opportunities for exercise and to discover ways to provide exercise-related instruction while ensuring that the spread of infection is curbed. ?

Mental health was assessed in 19,763 adults (16 years) using 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Latent class growth models identified discrete mental health trajectories and fixed-effects regression identified predictors of change in mental health.Findings: Average population mental health deteriorated with onset of the pandemic and did not begin improving until July 2020. Latent class analysis identified six distinct mental health trajectories up to October 2020. Three-quarters had consistently good (462%) or very good (309%) mental health. Two recovery groups (158%) initially experienced marked declines in mental health, improving to their pre-pandemic levels by October. For 48%, mental health steadily deteriorated and for 23% it was very poor throughout. These two groups were more likely to have pre-existing mental or physical ill-health, live in deprived neighbourhoods and be non-white.

Due to the time-consuming process of drug discovery, physicians have used readily available drugs and therapies for treatment of infections to minimize the death toll. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a snapshot analysis of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 Pakistani patients during the period from May to July 2020, when the first wave of COVID-19 peaked in Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed to provide an overview of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the four major tertiary-care hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of Pakistan during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country (May-July 2020). RESULTS: Antibiotics were the most common choice out of all the therapies employed, and they were used as first line of treatment for COVID-19. Azithromycin was the most prescribed drug for treatment. No monthly trend was observed in the choice of antibiotics, and these drugs appeared to be a random but favored choice throughout the months of the study. It was also noted that even antibiotics used for multidrug resistant infections were prescribed irrespective of the severity or progression of the infection. The results of the analysis are alarming, as this approach may lead to antibiotic resistance and complications in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19.

As the environment changes, it is crucial to reassess and improve the models used in monitoring banks. The financial soundness of banks is traditionally assessed based on accounting ratios. However, the incorporation of market information in these models may significantly improve its ability to predict bank distress. The present paper has two main objectives, the first is to assess if market information adds value to accounting-based monitoring models when the purpose is to detect bank distress situations. Further, it also seeks to understand if the predictive power of market signals increased with transparency requirements. To accomplish this purpose, a total of 81 distress events from a sample of 248 European banks between 2008 and 2020 were analyzed. First, a logit univariate analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of each accounting and market variable. Then, the optimal multivariate accounting-based model to predict distress events was constructed using a stepwise approach. Finally, the previous model was extended to include the relevant market variables. The results support the use of market variables in bank monitoring models. Further, the present study provides evidence that the predictive power of market variables increased after the strengthening of the information requirements set by the Basel agreements. It can be concluded that the results support the use of market information for banking supervisory purposes, especially, in transparent markets.

Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.","output":"Are college campuses superspreaders?

The study reveals that the severity of coronavirus strains correlates positively with the interaction area, surrounding hydrophobicity and interaction energy and inversely correlate with the flexibility of the binding interface. Also, we identify the conserved residues in the binding interface of spike proteins in all three strains. The systematic point mutations show that these conserved residues in the respective strains are evolutionarily favored at their respective positions.

Among the possible natural constituents is carrageenan, a polymer derived from marine algae that possesses a variety of antiviral properties. The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence supporting carrageenan subtypes' antiviral activity against the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar searches were conducted for publications using the terms carrageenan, iota carrageenan, kappa carrageenan, lambda-carrageenan, 'coronavirus', common cold, 'rhinovirus', and SARS-CoV-2 search was also done in grey literature to increase our understanding. A search for the word carrageenan was also carried out. Most of the publications were discussed in narrative. RESULTS: Carrageenan has been shown to have potent antiviral activity against both coronaviruses (coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV-2) and non-coronaviruses such as dengue virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, human papillomavirus, rabies virus, junin virus, tacaribe virus, African swine fever, bovine herpes virus, suid herpes virus, and rhinovirus. No in vivo study has been conducted using carrageenan as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. The majority of the in vivo research was done on influenza, a respiratory virus that causes common cold together with coronavirus. Thus, various clinical trials were conducted to determine the transferability of these in vitro data to clinical effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. When combined with oral ivermectin, nasally administered iota-carrageenan improved outcome in COVID-19 patients. It is still being tested in clinics for single-dose administration. CONCLUSION: Though the carrageenan exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and was used to treat COVID-19 under emergency protocol in conjunction with oral medications such as ivermectin, there is no solid evidence from clinical trials to support its efficacy.

Patients admitted to infectious diseases wards also received remdesivir. Primary outcome was duration of hospitalization after oxygen initiation. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, and death and/or transfer to the intensive care unit. To handle potential confounding by indication bias, outcome comparison was performed on propensity score-matched populations. Propensity score was estimated by a multivariable logistic model including prognostic covariates; then 1:1 matching was performed without replacement, using the nearest neighbor algorithm with a caliper of 0.10 fold the standard deviation of the propensity score as the maximal distance.

The goal of signal decomposition is to decompose a complex and nonstationary signal into a set of basic functions, usually called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In the proposed algorithm, it is assumed that each IMF has a limited bandwidth, and the frequency bands of various IMFs are disjoint. Based on this assumption, it is suggested to estimate the IMFs using a set of ideal filters designed in the frequency domain. The ideal filter bank is estimated in the proposed algorithm using penalized least-squares, where the weighted ?0-norm is utilized as the penalty term. In addition, the weighting parameters (used with the weighted ?0-norm) and the regularization parameter are calculated using techniques based on energy detection over short windows. It was found that the optimum value of the regularization parameter depends on the noise variance and the size of the windows over which the energy is calculated. To maintain the adaptivity of the proposed algorithm, two techniques are suggested for estimating the values of these two parameters from the analyzed signals.

ResultsThere were 149 and 125 patients in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts respectively. 14 patients (9.4%) had NOM in 2019 versus 31 (24.8%) in 2020 (p = 0.001). In the 2019 operative management (OM) group 125 patients (92.6%) had laparoscopic appendicectomy versus 65 (69.1%) in 2020. 59 patients (39.6%) had a CT in 2019 versus 70 (56%) in 2020. The median LOS was 4 days in 2019 and 3 days in 2020 (p=0.03). Two patients in each year who received NOM had treatment failure (14.3% in 2019 and 6.5% in 2020). Three patients in 2019 who received OM had treatment failure (2.2%). Of 95 patients tested for COVID-19 all but one tested negative.ConclusionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic there was no observed increase in severity of AA, patients had a shorter LOS and were more likely to have imaging. NOM proportionally increased with no observed change in outcomes.","output":"Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learnt From a District General Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studying the spatiotemporal distributions and differences of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) between social groups such as healthcare workers and patients can aid in formulating epidemic containment policies.

To examine changes in abortions in Louisiana before and after the COVID-19 pandemic onset and assess whether variations in abortion service availability during this time might explain observed changes. Methods. We collected monthly service data from abortion clinics in Louisiana and neighboring states among Louisiana residents (January 2018-May 2020) and assessed changes in abortions followin pandemic onset. We conducted mystery client calls to 30 abortion clinics in Louisiana and neighboring states (April-July 2020) and examined the percentage of open and scheduling clinics and median waits. Results. The number of abortions per month among Louisiana residents in Louisiana clinics decreased 31% (incidence rate ratio = 50.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.59, 0.79) from before to after pandemic onset, while the odds of having a second-trimester abortion increased (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 51.91; 95% CI = 51.10, 3.33). The decrease was not offset by an increase in out-of-state abortions. In Louisiana, only 1 or 2 (of 3) clinics were open (with a median wait >.2 weeks) through early May. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic onset was associated with a significant decrease in the number of abortions and increase in the proportion of abortions provided in the second trimester among Louisiana residents.

We aimed to determine the response of our paediatric surgical fraternity to a disease that overwhelmingly affects adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study over 6 weeks during a federally mandated lockdown. Using snowball sampling, we recruited paediatric surgeons, trainees and medical officers from paediatric surgical units in Malaysia. The anonymous online questionnaire covered sociodemographic information, changes in patient care, redeployment, concerns regarding family members, and impact on training. Mental well-being was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis was used, with significance level 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 129 eligible participants, 100(77%) responded. Junior doctors had clinically higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Age &lt;30 years was significantly associated with anxiety. Junior doctors believed that redeployment led to loss of surgical skills (p&lt;0.001) and trainees felt that clinical application of knowledge had reduced (p&lt;0.020).

Elders, especially those with diabetes, are at the highest risk of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes and mortality. This is usually linked to the comorbidities that accumulate with age, diabetes-related chronic inflammation, and the pandemic's psychosocial effects.Areas covered: We present some approaches to manage these complicated elderly patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the inpatient setting, we suggest similar (pre-pandemic) glycemic targets and emphasize the importance of using IV insulin and possible use of continuous glucose monitoring to reduce exposure and PPE utilization. Outside the hospital, we recommend optimal glycemic control within the limits imposed by considerations of safety. We also describe the advantages and challenges of using various technological platforms in clinical care.Expert opinion: The COVID-19 pandemic has lifted the veil off serious deficiencies in the infrastructures for care at both the individual level and the population level and also highlighted some of the strengths, all of which affect individuals with diabetes and COVID-19.

The dimensionless highly nonlinear differential equations (DEs) are solved via numerical scheme bvp4c. The effects of the physical parameters on heat transfer are presented in the form of graphs. The results demonstrate that the heat transfer is enhanced by using solid particle frictions (SWCNT and MWCNT). The large estimation of a magnetic parameter declines the velocity component. The current and existing results with their comparisons are shown in the tabular form for the validation of our code. The current results are in good agreement with their existing results. Generally, fuzziness or uncertainty is inherent in modeling, analysis, and experimentation. Due to the uncertain environmental conditions, fuzziness broadly exists in various engineering heat transfer problems. In this work, the nanoparticles' volume fraction of the SWCNT and MWCNT is taken as uncertain parameters in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). The TFNs are controlled by the  ? cut which has less computational effort for analyzing the fuzziness or uncertainties.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of electronic health records. SUBJECTS: Eyes prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device across 4 retinal practices in the USA. METHODS: Usage information was collected from the online ForeseeHome portal for all eyes prescribed. For a pre-determined subset of eyes, additional clinical information was collected through chart review and analyzed for clinical utility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include frequency and length of use, number of eyes that used the device, established baseline and converted to nAMD, and number of alerts. RESULTS: 775 eyes of 448 patients were prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device. 649 eyes (83.7%) used the device at least once; among this population, 478 (73.7%) established baseline. Patients who established baseline were significantly younger than those who did not establish baseline (p<0.001). Among eyes that established baseline, 126 (26.4%) had an overall inadequate frequency of use (2 tests per week), and 250 (52.3%) did not use the device as frequently as instructed by the manufacturer (3 tests per week); 112 (24.7%) discontinued use within one year. Over a mean of 20.35 months, 106 patients had 152 alerts, indicating possible conversions to nAMD. Out of the 136 eyes that established baseline among 211 eyes prescribed the device at one clinical site, 52 alerts were recorded, 3 (6.8%) correctly identified conversion to nAMD and 47 (93.2%) represented false-positive alerts. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the prospective HOME study, utility of the ForeseeHome device in the current analysis of real-world clinical-practice application was limited. A meaningful proportion of eyes never used the device or could not establish baseline. Overall frequency of use was low and continuous usage of the device decreased over time.

With the limited response time to curb the transmission, the pandemic is already in 52 countries in Africa. There is much anxiety about the devastating potential of this scourge in Africa, justifiably so because of the weak health systems, high levels of poverty, and overcrowded cities. Therefore, this report examined the association between the confirmed cases at 100 days of COVID-19 and some significant risk factors in 19 African countries that had at least 100 confirmed cases as of 09 April 2020. Materials and Methods: We evaluated four major risk factors associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases in 19 African counties with over 100 cases in 100 days after the official declaration of COVID-19 by WHO. Results: Three of the four risk factors (total population in urban areas, population age, and international exposure) correlated positively with the number of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, one (public health system) correlated negatively with the number of confirmed cases in the countries under study. International exposure was initially the main transmitter of the infection, but community transmission now becomes the driver of COVID-19 infections on the continent. Conclusion: Identification of confirmed cases, quick contact tracing with self-isolation, community engagement, and health systems measures are all-necessary to prevent the potentially harmful ramifications of an epidemic on the continent.

Based on the pattern associated with disease endotype, airway inflammation can be simplified into type 2 and type 17. Half of asthmatics have type 2 high endotype driven by IL-13/IL-4 cytokine signaling that induces goblet cell metaplasia. Other inflammatory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and sarcoidosis are associated with the type 17 cytokines IL-17 and TNF-. Recent case-control studies have suggested that asthma may protect against or at least not worsen SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effect of inflammation on COVID-19 outcomes is unclear. Although interferons and cytokine-driven inflammation may modulate antiviral response, epithelial remodeling might also affect susceptibility to viruses.We applied a singlecell RNA-seq approach to investigate responses to SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelia treated with inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that IL-13-induced type 2 inflammation and IL-17-induced type 17 inflammation would respond differently to SARS-CoV-2-infected human airway epithelia and that IL-13 would protect the epithelia from SARS-CoV-2 infection through goblet cell-secreted factors Methods: We infected primary human airway epithelia (n = 3 donors) grown at the airCliquid interface with 0.1 multiplicity of infection of SARSCoV- 2 and obtained viral titers and single-cell suspensions at 6 and 72 hours after infection. The epitheliawere pretreated with IL-13 or IL-17 plus TNF- for a short (4 days) or long (56 days) course to differentiate the early effects of cytokine response from late goblet cell metaplasia that develops over weeks. We then performed single-cell RNA-seq to analyze viral transcripts Results: We found that IL-13, but not IL17 plus TNF-, protected epithelia from SARS-CoV-2 at 72 hours after infection. Moreover, the protection seemed to be independent of interferons because interferon-stimulated genes, induced by short IL-13 exposure, failed to protect the epithelia from viral infection. Our analysis shows that the genes with the largest expression change in long-course IL-13-treated epithelia were mediated by the appearance of goblet cells andwere goblet-specific genes. Using our single-cell RNA-seq data, we analyzed how cytokines change response in each cell type after viral infection. We found that, when cells become infected, their response is not abnormal. Conclusion: IL-13 protects human airway epithelia from SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro;the protective mechanism may involve secreted products from goblet cells. IL-13-treated airway epithelial cells have an otherwise normal response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that products secreted by goblet cells may have potential therapeutic applications for respiratory viral diseases.","output":"Role of IL-13-induced Th2 inflammation in host responses to SARSCoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Particulate matters having diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5) have been linked with life threatening health issues worldwide.

We also observe average concentration dropped during the covid-19 pandemic due to lockdown. Using cross correlation analysis, we observed how spikes in PM2.5 concentration levels in one zone may correspond with peaked concentrations in a different zone a few hours later, indicating that air currents may cause the particles to move in certain directions. Our exploratory analysis serves as the first cross-country data centric study of the state and propagation patterns of PM2.5 particles within Bangladesh and our findings can serve as foundation for further research on the topic. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Seasonal, Temporal and Spatial Variation of Particulate Matter Concentration in Bangladesh: A Longitudinal Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning (DL) has drawn tremendous attention for object localization and recognition in both natural and medical images. U-Net segmentation models have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional hand-crafted feature-based methods. Medical image modality-specific DL models are better at transferring domain knowledge to a relevant target task than those pretrained on stock photography images. This character helps improve model adaptation, generalization, and class-specific region of interest (ROI) localization. In this study, we train chest X-ray (CXR) modality-specific U-Nets and other state-of-the-art U-Net models for semantic segmentation of tuberculosis (TB)-consistent findings. Automated segmentation of such manifestations could help radiologists reduce errors and supplement decision-making while improving patient care and productivity. Our approach uses the publicly available TBX11K CXR dataset with weak TB annotations, typically provided as bounding boxes, to train a set of U-Net models. Next, we improve the results by augmenting the training data with weak localization, postprocessed into an ROI mask, from a DL classifier trained to classify CXRs as showing normal lungs or suspected TB manifestations. Test data are individually derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution and other cross-institutional collections, including the Shenzhen TB and Montgomery TB CXR datasets. We observe that our augmented training strategy helped the CXR modality-specific U-Net models achieve superior performance with test data derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution and cross-institutional collections (p < 0.05).

Eight animals of each group were sacrificed at 12 weeks and the others at 26 weeks after surgery. Histological analysis was performed to analyse BIC. Results were statistically compared at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS After 12 weeks, the BIC for conventional and activated implants with or without graft showed comparable results, with mean values of 14.8%, 16.5%, 21.5% and 20.1% (P > 0.05). For ungrafted sinuses after 26 weeks, no increase in BIC was recorded (12.1% conventional surface, 15.8% activated surface; P > 0.05).

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). Since PGs play diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses, inhibiting PG production with NSAIDs could affect COVID-19 pathogenesis in multiple ways, including (i) altering susceptibility to infection by modifying expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; (ii) regulating replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells; and (iii) modulating the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate these potential roles. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates COX-2 in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2 by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. In contrast, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, NSAID treatment reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and impaired the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by reduced neutralizing antibody titers. Our findings indicate that NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication. IMPORTANCE Public health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are critical for the generation of prostaglandinslipid molecules with diverse roles in homeostasis and inflammation. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs could therefore have multiple effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that NSAID treatment reduced both the antibody and proinflammatory cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of NSAIDs to modulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has important implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis in patients. Whether this occurs in humans and whether it is beneficial or detrimental to the host remains an important area of future investigation. This also raises the possibility that NSAIDs may alter the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","output":"Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Dampen the Cytokine and Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heat stress can have an impact on parental gamete maturation and reproduction functions. According to current research, the microbial composition of the vaginal cavity is species specific. Pregnancy, menstruation, and genital diseases have been linked to the dynamics of vaginal ecology. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolites after heat stress. At the phylum level, the rabbit's vaginal microbial composition of rabbit showed high similarity with that of humans. In the Heat group, the relative abundance of the dominant microbiota Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria increased, while the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased. Furthermore, heat stress significantly increased the relative abundance of W5053, Helcococcus, Thiopseudomonas, ldiomaarina, atopostipes, and facklamia, whereas the relative abundance of 12 genera significantly decreased, including Streptococcus, UCG-005, Alistipes, [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum_group, Comamonas, RB41, Fastidiosipila, Intestinimonas, Arthrobacter, Lactobacillus, Leucobacter, and Family_xlll_AD3011_group. Besides, the relative concentrations of 158 metabolites differed significantly between the Heat and Control groups. Among them, the endocrine hormone estradiol (E2) increased in the Heat group and was positively associated with a number of metabolites such as linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T), N-acetylsphingosine, N-oleoyl glycine, trans-petroselinic acid, syringic acid, 2-(1-adamantyl)-1-morpholinoethan-1-one, 5-OxoETE, and 16-heptadecyne-1,2,4-triol. Further, the majority of the differential metabolites were enriched in steroid biosynthesis and endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption pathways, reflecting that heat stress may affect calcium metabolism, hormone-induced signaling, and endocrine balance of vaginal ecology.

The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","output":"Prevalence of Pathogens Related to Bovine Respiratory Disease Before and After Transportation in Beef Steers: Preliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This paper seeks to: provide an overview of the impacts of and responses to the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland; assess the vulnerability of the population living in rural areas to COVID-19; compare the health status of male farmers to underlying medical conditions frequently associated with those experiencing the worst impacts of the illness; and assess the implications of COVID-19 for farmers living alone and farm households with children.

We aimed to describe and compare the demographics, medical conditions, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients living with obesity (PLWO) to those of patients living without obesity. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study based on outpatient/inpatient care and claims data from January to June 2020 from Spain, the UK, and the US. We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two non-mutually exclusive cohorts of patients diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19; patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of demographics, prior medical conditions, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. RESULTS: We included 627 044 (Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336, and US: 502 650) diagnosed and 160 013 (Spain: 18 197, US: 141 816) hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of obesity was higher among patients hospitalized (39.9%, 95%CI: 39.8?40.0) than among those diagnosed with COVID-19 (33.1%; 95%CI: 33.0?33.2). In both cohorts, PLWO were more often female. Hospitalized PLWO were younger than patients without obesity. Overall, COVID-19 PLWO were more likely to have prior medical conditions, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, or require intensive services compared to COVID-19 patients without obesity. CONCLUSION: We show that PLWO differ from patients without obesity in a wide range of medical conditions and present with more severe forms of COVID-19, with higher hospitalization rates and intensive services requirements. These findings can help guiding preventive strategies of COVID-19 infection and complications and generating hypotheses for causal inference studies.","output":"Characteristics and outcomes of 627 044 COVID-19 patients living with and without obesity in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This descriptive phenomenological study examines career adaptability of parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

The semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers based on the Career Construction Theory was used to collect data after receiving expert verification on the questions. In addition, to triangulate data sources, the Participant Feedback Form filled by the participants on the day following the interview and the Researcher Diary filled by the interviewer during the data collection process were utilized. Colaizzi's seven-step method was followed to analyze the data. Four major domains emerged, highlighting traumas/changes in work-life after ASD, career adaptability, influences of COVID-19 pandemic, and post-interview awareness of this particular sample. Results from the study highlighted looking ahead, being persistent, career decision-making, career-exploration accompanied by some expectations such as more time, income and flexibility, and coping skills build upon the ASD, along with postponement and abandonment of previous career goals, alteration of future career plans, and lack of self-exploration. The results contributed to the theory by providing evidence for career adaptability of parents of children with individual differences, including career adaptability resources and needs.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the viral surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients with previous episodes of brain injuries are a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. An explanation for this finding is currently lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce the release of several inflammatory mediators that might modulate the expression levels of signaling proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following brain injury can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in different vital tissues has not been investigated. METHODS: For the induction of brain stroke, mice were subjected to a surgical procedure for transient interruption of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery for 45 min and sacrificed after 1 and 3 days for analysis of brain, lung, heart, and kidney tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1? were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. The level of soluble ACE2 in plasma and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was measured using an immunoassay. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Post-stroke pneumonia in mice was examined by bacterial cultures from lung homogenates and whole blood. RESULTS: Strikingly, 1 day after surgery, we observed a substantial increase in the protein levels of ACE2 in the lungs of stroke mice compared to sham-operated mice. However, the protein levels of ACE2 were found unchanged in the heart, kidney, and brain of these animals. In addition, we found increased transcriptional levels of alveolar ACE2 after stroke. The increased expression of ACE2 was significantly associated with the severity of behavioral deficits after stroke. The higher protein levels of alveolar ACE2 persisted until 3 days of stroke. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of soluble ACE2 in plasma but not in BAL in stroke-operated mice compared to sham mice. Furthermore, stroke-induced parenchymal and systemic inflammation was evident with the increased expression of IL-6 and IL-1?. Reduced numbers of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate specific augmented alveolar ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings suggest that patients with brain injuries may have increased binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 in their lungs which might explain why stroke is a risk factor for higher susceptibility to develop COVID-19.","output":"Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humanes SARS-Coronavirus","output":"SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The virtual interview for residency and fellowship applicants has previously been utilized preliminarily in their respective processes. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many programs to switch to a virtual interview process on short notice. In the independent plastic surgery process, which was underway when the pandemic started, applicants had a heterogeneous experience of in-person and virtual interviews. The purpose of this study was to assess if applicants prefer a virtual interview experience to an in-person interview as well as determine if virtual interview applicants had a different opinion of a program compared to the in-person interview applicants. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The 2019 to 2020 applicants who interviewed at the Indiana University Independent Plastic Surgery program were administered an anonymous online survey about their interview experience at our program. RESULTS: Our survey response was 60% (18/30). The in-person interview group (na?=a?10) rated their overall interview experience higher than the virtual interview group (na?=a?8) 8.8 vs 7.5 (pa?=a?0.0314). The in-person interview group felt they became more acquainted with the program, the faculty, and the residents more than the virtual group (4.7 vs 3.25, p < 0.0001) (4.3 vs 3.25, pa?=a?0.0194) (4.3 vs 2.75, p < 0.0001). The majority of applicants favored in-person interviews (16/18, 88.9%). The in-person interview group spent significantly more money on their interview at our program compared to the virtual interview group ($587 vs $0, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the virtual interview process was an efficient process for applicants from both a financial and time perspective. However, the virtual interview process left applicants less satisfied with their interview experience. The applicants felt they did not become as acquainted with the program as their in-person counterparts. The virtual interview process may play a large role in residency and fellowship applications in the future, and programs should spend time on how to improve the process.","output":"Virtual Interviews for the Independent Plastic Surgery Match: A Modern Convenience or a Modern Misrepresentation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been accompanied by the emergence of viral mutations, some of which may have distinct virological and clinical consequences. While whole genome sequencing efforts have worked to map this viral diversity at the population level, little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 may diversify within a host over time. This is particularly important for understanding the emergence of viral resistance to therapeutic interventions and immune pressure. The goal of this study was to assess the change in viral load and viral genome sequence within patients over time and determine if these changes correlate with clinical and/or demographic parameters. METHODS: Hospitalized patients admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were enrolled in a longitudinal study for the serial collection of nasopharyngeal specimens. Swabs were administered to patients by hospital staff every 4  1 days for up to 32 days or until the patients were discharged. RNA was extracted from each specimen and viral loads were calculated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Specimens with qRT-PCR cycle threshold values less than or equal to 30 were subject to whole viral genome sequencing by reverse transcription, multiplex PCR, and deep sequencing. Variant populations sizes were estimated and subject to phylogenetic analysis relative to publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Sequence and viral load data were subsequently correlated to available demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: 60 patients were enrolled from March 26th to June 20th, 2020. We observed an overall decrease in nasopharyngeal viral load over time across all patients. However, the temporal dynamics of viral load differed on a patient-by-patient basis. Several mutations were also observed to have emerged within patients over time. Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in serially collected nasopharyngeal swabs in hospitalized adults as determined by qRT-PCR. Samples were collected every 4  1 days (T#1C8) and viral load is displayed by log(copy number). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in the nasopharynx decrease over time and that the virus can accumulate mutations during replication within individual patients. Future studies will examine if some of these mutations may provide fitness advantages in the presence of therapeutic and/or immune selective pressures. DISCLOSURES: Michael G.

Using the Turkish nationwide centralized COVID-19 database, we sought to determine whether cTn measured within 24 h of admission may help identify 30-day all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at all hospitals in Turkey between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients (18 years) who had cTn measurements within 24 h of admission were included. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 14,855 COVID-19 patients (median age 49 years and 54% male) from 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Of these, 2020 patients (13.6%) were transferred to intensive care unit, 1165 patients (7.8%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 882 patients (5.9%) died during hospitalization. The prevalence of cTn positivity was 6.9% (n = 1027) in the hospitalized patients. cTn positivity was 5% in those patients alive at 30-day, and 44% in those who died. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, age, lactate dehydrogenase, and cTn were the strongest predictors of 30-day mortality, irrespective of cTn definition as a continuous, ordinal variable, or dichotomic variables.

METHODS Thirty four patients of mean age 14.7 years completed both pulmonary function and maximal aerobic capacity tests at 6 months. All had normal clinical examination and were asymptomatic. Their exercise responses were compared with a group of healthy controls. Complete data were collected on 27 of the original 34 cases at 15 months. RESULTS Compared with normal controls, the patient group had significantly lower absolute and mass related peak oxygen consumption (peak V o(2) (p<0.01)), higher ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (p<0.01), lower oxygen pulse (p<0.01), and a lower oxygen uptake efficiency slope (p<0.01) at 6 months. This impairment was unexpected and out of proportion with the degree of lung function abnormality. Residual high resolution computed tomography of thorax (HRCT) abnormalities were present in 14 patients. Those with abnormal HRCT findings had significantly lower mass related peak V o(2) than subjects with normal radiology (p<0.01). Absolute and mass related peak V o(2) in the patient group remained impaired at 15 months despite normalisation of lung function in all patients.

The overall aging of the working population is expected to increase the burden of disease, but temporal changes in exposures or diagnosis may also drive the global trends in MSD. We therefore conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence on the role of demographic and temporal changes in the occurrence of MSD. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of articles reporting temporal trends in MSD in the general working-age population. Only articles controlling for age in the analysis were included. The risk of bias was assessed. The main indicators extracted were age-controlled time trends in MSD incidence or prevalence. RESULTS Among 966 articles, 16 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, representing 23 results according to the indicators extracted. No study was found with a high risk of bias. Results presenting time trends in prevalence were found in 12 studies and incidence in 11. After controlling for age, the reported temporal trends varied, mostly between non-monotonic changes (N=12/23) and increases (N=10/23). One article also highlighted an increase among women and non-monotonic changes among men (N=1/23). Several factors other than aging were suggested to explain temporal trends in MSD, mainly trends in obesity, changing occupational exposures, and cultural factors regarding pain tolerance.

Pandemic crisis has been limiting the scope of movement with social distancing for participation of physical activity for health promotion. This study aimed to review studies on promoting physical activity to prevent health risks for children and adolescents since the onset of COVID-19. METHODS: Three major online databases (PubMed, Medline, and Scopus) were searched for physical activity, intervention for children and adolescents. Seven articles were selected from 1,761 articles through the inclusion and exclusion processes. RESULTS: All studies were conducted through online. One study showed that streaming services and online apps majorly promoted MVPA (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), MSE (muscle-strengthening exercise), or combined (MVPA, MSE) by 2.4, 3.1, and 4.3 folds, respectively. Another study showed that greater duration of physical activity (PA) prevented depressive symptoms during exposure to outbreak. Five intervention studies which used digital platforms to promote PA significantly encouraged PA along with the physiological, psychosocial, and academic achievement outcomes. CONCLUSION: Internet-based digital platforms may assist to promote physical activity for improved psychosocial and academic achievement in children and adolescents during the untack period.

A promising strategy to block the infection consists of using a mutant of the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a decoy to compete with endogenous ACE2 for the binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which decreases the ability of the virus to enter the host cell. Here, using a computational framework based on the 2D Zernike formalism we investigate details of the molecular binding and evaluate the changes in ACE2-Spike binding compatibility upon mutations occurring in the ACE2 side of the molecular interface. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing our results with experimental binding affinities changes upon ACE2 mutations, separating ones that increase or decrease binding affinity with an Area Under the ROC curve ranging from 0.66 to 0.93, depending on the magnitude of the effects analyzed. Importantly, the iteration of our approach leads to the identification of a set of ACE2 mutants characterized by an increased shape complementarity with Spike.

Moreover, infected spinal cord injury patients rarely present complications that require admission to an Intensive Care Unit, in contrast to the general population. Thus, there is a clear need to understand how COVID-19 affects spinal cord injury patients from a molecular perspective.

With regard to psychological consequences, accidents can cause a wide range of burdens including adjustment problems. Although adjustment problems are among the most frequent mental health problems, there are few specific interventions available. The newly developed program SelFIT (German acronym: Selber wieder fit nach einem Unfall; fit again after an accident) aims to remedy this situation by offering a low-threshold, web-based self-help intervention for psychological distress after an accident. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the SelFIT program plus care as usual (CAU) compared to only CAU. Furthermore, the programs user-friendliness, acceptance, and adherence are assessed. We expect that the use of SelFIT will be associated with a greater reduction in psychological distress, greater improvement in mental and physical well-being, and greater cost-effectiveness compared to CAU. METHODS: Adults (n=240) experiencing adjustment problems due to an accident they had between 2 weeks and 2 years before entering the study will be randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group receive direct access to SelFIT. The control group receives access to the program after 12 weeks. There are 6 measurement points for both groups (baseline as well as after 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 weeks). The main outcome is a reduction in anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms that indicate adjustment problems. Secondary outcomes include well-being, optimism, embitterment, self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotion regulation, pain, costs of health care consumption, and productivity loss, as well as the programs adherence, acceptance, and user-friendliness. RESULTS: Recruitment began in December 2019 and will continue at least until January 2021, with the option to extend this for another 6 months until July 2021. As of July 2020, 324 people have shown interest in participating, and 48 people have given their informed consent. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining a web-based self-help program designed to treat adjustment problems resulting from an accident. If effective, the program could complement the still limited offerings for secondary and tertiary prevention of psychological distress after an accident.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 M) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached 3 times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

The aim of the present study is to analyze the cytotoxic effects of a mixture of proinflammatory cytokines in the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549. The cytotoxicity of proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in A549 cells by measuring lactate dehydrogenase released into the culture medium and by crystal violet staining of surviving cells. Activation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway was evaluated by monitoring cleavage of cytokeratin 18 by caspases using enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To estimate the cytotoxic signaling pathways responsible for epithelial injury, agents with antiinflammatory or antioxidative properties were extensively screened for cytoprotective effects in the inflammation-associated epithelial injury model. The present study revealed that inflammatory cytokines exerted cytotoxicity in A549 cells. A mixture of interleukin-1beta (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and interferon-gamma (IFN-), designated as cytomix, augmented cytotoxicity compared with each individual cytokine. Treatment with glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), tetracycline-derived antiinflammatory antibiotics (minocycline or doxycycline), angiotensin II receptor blockers (losartan or telmisartan), or antioxidants (dimethyl sulfoxide, catalase) attenuated cytomix-induced cytotoxicity, including caspase activation. These results implied that inflammatory cytokines alone could cause alveolar epithelial injury in the pathophysiology of septic ALI. Caspase-dependent apoptosis was speculated to be one mechanism responsible for the cytokine-induced cytotoxicity.

RECENT FINDINGS Currently, there is a large debate on the use of antimalarials for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease based on preclinical in-vitro data, small case series and extrapolation from earlier studies of their effect on intracellular pathogens, including many viruses.

We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha), with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2 (delta) showed 3-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11).

This study assessed temporal trends in COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality among people with schizophrenia during the first year of the pandemic, the predictors for COVID-19 vaccination, postvaccination infection, admission to hospital, and mortality. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, people with schizophrenia (n=25 539) and controls (n=25 539) were assessed for COVID-19 outcomes before and after vaccination, up to April 30, 2021. Cox proportional hazard regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses were done to assess longitudinal trends. The study used the databases of Clalit Health Services, the largest health-care organisation in Israel. FINDINGS: The sample included 51 078 participants, of which 31 141 (610%) male and 19 937 (390%) female participants, with a mean age of 5194 years (SD 1562). Most of the sample was from the general Jewish population (759%), followed by the Arab (191%) and Jewish Ultraorthodox population (51%). Overall of 51 078 individuals, 356 (07%) people had been hospitalised, 133 (03%) had died, and a total of 27 400 (536%) had been vaccinated. People with schizophrenia showed a higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation (HR 481, 95% CI 357C648, p<00001) and mortality (HR 252, 95% CI 164C385, p<00001), and showed a sharper decline in survival as time progressed. The control group showed a sharper incline in probability to vaccinate (log-rank=30988, p<00001). Medical comorbidity of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or ischaemic heart disease played a significant role in predicting vaccination rates in the schizophrenia group (all p<00001), but not in the control group. Hospitalisation and mortality disparities remained higher among people with schizophrenia who had not been vaccinated in comparison to controls (incidence rate difference of 62 and 32, respectively) but substantially declined in fully vaccinated groups (incidence rate difference of 11 and ?09, respectively). INTERPRETATION: People with schizophrenia have higher hospitalisation and mortality risk, yet have lower rates of vaccination than in the general population.

The levels of IGF-1 and 25-(OH)D in the serum of children before and after treatment were tested. According to the clinical curative effect after treatment, the children were divided into good curative effect group (markedly effective + effective) and poor curative effect group (ineffective). Logistics regression analysis was applied to analyze the risk factors. RESULTS: Compared with the CG, the curative effect on the OG was evidently improved (P < 0.05). In addition, the height increment, the growth speed, and the bone age of the OG increased evidently (P < 0.05).

METHODS: We screened for clinical studies describing HCQ administration to treat or prevent COVID-19 in PubMed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized comparative cohorts, and case series studies that had all undergone peer review.

In terms of effect on mortality rates, observational studies provided conflicting results. As a whole, RCTs, including one large British RCT that has not yet been published, showed no significant effect of HCQ on mortality rates, clinical cure, and virologic response. The use of HCQ as a post-exposure prophylactic agent was found to be ineffective in one RCT. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence supporting HCQ for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.

Methods: From mid-May, we recruited firefighters from 13 fire services as they returned from the fire. In October 2016 we extended recruitment to all Alberta-based firefighters deployed to the fire. In December 2017-May 2018 we sent a first online follow-up: this concentrated on mental health supports. The second follow-up, in October 2018-January 2019, included screening scales for respiratory ill-health and PTSD. All three contacts included visual analogue scales for chest symptoms and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We estimated exposure to PM2.5, and calculated an exposure mitigation index from reports of respiratory protective equipment (RPE). Results: We recruited 1,234 firefighters and examined the relation of respiratory symptoms to estimated particulate exposure. The relation was strong immediately post fire but weakened over time. We found less chest tightness and cough in those whose RPE in the first week mitigated exposure by at least 10%. We examined the relation between particulate exposure and mental ill-health from screening questionnaires and found those with high exposure (reflecting the ferocity of the fire) had poorer mental health scores. Firefighters reporting their \\"worst moment during the fire\\" was life threatening were more anxious at second follow-up. Overall both anxiety and depression scores increased at successive contacts, more so in those with mental ill-health recorded in physician billing records before the fire. Discussion: The results from this study overall suggest on-going fire-related health effects in a substantial minority of firefighters, similar to those reported in the longitudinal follow-up of firefighters after the collapse of the World Trade Centre. Self-reports of both respiratory symptoms and mental ill-health were strongly related, soon after the fire, to estimated particulate exposures. Anxiety increased over time since the fire in those who felt their life or safety had been threatened, underlining the need for ongoing support.

Amino acid 159 of the envelope (E) protein is reportedly implicated in the different levels of neurovirulence in mice infected with WNV NY99 or Eg101. We investigated the role of amino acid 159 of the E protein in the pathogenesis of WNV infection. We produced recombinant WNV with the structural proteins of the NY99 or Eg101 strain (NY-WT or EgCME-WT) and mutant viruses with substitutions of amino acid 159 of the E protein (NY-E-V159I or EgCME-E-I159V). The NY-WT and NY-E-V159I or EgCME-WT and EgCME-E-I159V titers in culture supernatant were similar. The mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with NY-WT or NY-E-V159I were also similar. In contrast, the mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intracranially with EgCME-E-I159V were significantly higher than those of mice inoculated with EgCME-WT. The numbers of CD3-positive and CD8-positive T cells were greater in brains inoculated with EgCME-E-I159V than in those inoculated with EgCME-WT.

Much of the research on health and marriage has conceptualized marital quality in a unidimensional way, with high levels of either positivity or negativity. This conceptualization may not fully capture the nuanced benefits of marital relationships. Pupillometry is an innovative method which captures the effects of marital stress buffering on the bodys autonomic nervous system in real time; pupil dilation occurs within 200ms to stress exposure. Additionally, this method records hundreds of readings per second, providing precision and sensitivity. This preregistered experiment aimed to conceptually replicate previous pupillometry stress buffering results and extend the previous findings by including a generalizable, real-life stressorviewing a horror movieand multidimensional relationship quality effects. Eighty-three couples (166 participants) were quasi-grouped, based on a self-reported multidimensional relationship quality scale, to either supportive or ambivalent marital relationship conditions. They were then randomly assigned to either a spousal support (i.e., handholding) or non-support (spousal absence) condition and watched clips from both horror and nature movies while pupil dilation was measured. Tonic pupillary response results revealed that the horror video clips elicited a stress response and there were significant differences between the support and non-support conditions, as well as marital relationship quality conditions. These results frame the precision, speed, and sensitivity of pupillometry as a potentially fruitful method to investigate the causal mechanisms linking stress buffering and supportive marital relationships.","output":"Spousal emotional support and relationship quality buffers pupillary response to horror movies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high risk of malnutrition, primarily in older people; assessing nutritional risk using appropriate screening tools is critical.

Based on the empirical formulas, standard thermodynamic properties of formation and growth have been calculated and reported for the Delta and Omicron strains. Moreover, standard thermodynamic properties of binding have been reported for Wild type (Hu-1), Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron strains. For all the strains, binding phenomenological coefficients and antigen-receptor (SGP-ACE2) binding rates have been determined and compared, which are proportional to infectivity. The results show that the binding rate of the Omicron strain is between 1.5 and 2.5 times greater than that of the Delta strain. The Omicron strain is characterized by a greater infectivity, based on the epidemiological data available in the literature. The increased infectivity was explained in this paper using Gibbs energy of binding. However, no indications exist for decreased pathogenicity of the Omicron strain. Pathogenicity is proportional to the virus multiplication rate, while Gibbs energies of multiplication are very similar for the Delta and Omicron strains. Thus, multiplication rate and pathogenicity are similar for the Delta and Omicron strains. The lower number of severe cases caused by the Omicron strain can be explained by increased number of immunized people. Immunization does not influence the possibility of occurrence of infection, but influences the rate of immune response, which is much more efficient in immunized people. This leads to prevention of more severe Omicron infection cases.","output":"Strain wars 3: Differences in infectivity and pathogenicity between Delta and Omicron strains of SARS-CoV-2 can be explained by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of binding and growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study of a prospectively collected database. OBJECTIVES: In a cohort of patients with traumatic spine injury (TSI) in Tanzania who did not undergo surgery, we sought to: (1) describe this nonoperative population, (2) compare outcomes to operative patients, and (3) determine predictors of nonoperative treatment. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: All patients admitted for TSI over a 33-month period were reviewed. Variables included demographics, fracture morphology, neurologic exam, indication for surgery, length of hospitalization, and mortality. Regression analyses were used to report outcomes and predictors of nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: 270 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 145 were managed nonoperatively. Demographics between groups were similar. The nonoperative group was young (mean = 35.5 years) and primarily male (n = 125, 86%). Nonoperative patients had 7.39 times the odds of death (p = 0.003). Patients with AO type A0/1/2/3 fractures (p < 0.001), ASIA E exams (p = 0.016), cervical spine injuries (p = 0.005), and central cord syndrome (p = 0.016) were more commonly managed nonoperatively. One hundred and twenty-four patients (86%) had indications for but did not undergo surgery. After multivariate analysis, the only predictor of nonoperative management was sustaining a cervical injury (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-six percent of nonoperative TSI patients had an indication for surgery. Nonoperative management was associated with an increased risk of mortality. Cervical injury was the single independent risk factor for not undergoing surgery. The principle reason for nonoperative management was cost of implants. While a causal relationship between nonoperative management and inferior outcomes cannot be made, efforts should be made to provide surgery when indicated, regardless of a patients ability to pay.","output":"Nonoperative treatment of traumatic spinal injuries in Tanzania: who is not undergoing surgery and why?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Legionella pneumophila can cause pneumonia, leading to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of its harsh growth requirements, limited detection methods, and non-specific clinical manifestations, diagnosing Legionella pneumonia remains still challenging. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology has increased the rate of detection of Legionella. This study describes a patient who rapidly progressed to severe ARDS during the early stage of infection and was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Although his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was negative for infection and his serum was negative for anti-Legionella antibody, mNGS of his BALF and blood showed only the presence of Legionella pneumophila (blood mNGS reads 229, BALF reads 656). After antibiotic treatment and weaning from ECMO, however, he developed a secondary Aspergillus and Klebsiella pneumoniae infection as shown by mNGS. Mechanical ventilation and antibiotic treatment were effective. A search of PubMed showed few reports of secondary Aspergillus infections after Legionella infection. Severe pneumonia caused by any type of pathogenic bacteria may be followed by Aspergillus infection, sometimes during extremely early stages of infection. Patients with severe pneumonia caused by Legionella infection should undergo early screening for secondary infections using methods such as mNGS, enabling early and precise treatment, thereby simplifying the use of antibiotics and improving patient prognosis.","output":"Early Detection of Legionella pneumophila and Aspergillus by mNGS in a Critically Ill Patient With Legionella Pneumonia After Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Treatment: Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM There is no known specific biomarker or genetic signal for quadruple wild-type (qWT) gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs).

The outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and the treatment with mechanical ventilation (MV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 72 years; 55.1% were female. Most (74.5%) had at least one underlying condition. Overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 20.4%, and median time to death after admission was 8 days. The CFR was 6.1% among patients aged 65C69 years, 22.7% among those aged 70C79 years, and 38.1% among those aged  80 years. The CFR among patients who required MV was 43.8%, and the proportion of patients received MV/HFNC was 28.6%. Nosocomial acquisition, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, and chronic neurologic diseases were significant risk factors for both death and MV/HFNC. Hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status on admission were also associated with poor outcome.

Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in ?-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E ?-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with ?-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in ?-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of ?3-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with ?-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent ?-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent ?-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with ?-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent ?-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent ?-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.","output":"A comprehensive review of hydroxyurea for ?-haemoglobinopathies: the role revisited during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is highly contagious.

Several communications claimed in the first weeks of March 2020 that the mitigation in air pollution observed at that time was actually related to these lockdown measures without considering that seasonal variations in emissions and meteorology also influence air quality. To determine the specific impact of lockdown measures on air quality in northern Italy, we compared observations from the European Commission Atmospheric Observatory of Ispra (regional background) and from the regional environmental protection agency (ARPA) air monitoring stations in the Milan conurbation (urban background) with expected values for these observations using two different approaches. On the one hand, intensive aerosol variables determined from specific aerosol characterisation observations performed in Ispra were compared to their 3-year averages. On the other hand, ground-level measured concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, PM10, O3, NO, SO2) were compared to expected concentrations derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Regional (CAMS) ensemble model forecasts, which did not account for lockdown measures. From these comparisons, we show that NO2 concentrations decreased as a consequence of the lockdown by -30 % and-40 % on average at the urban and regional background sites, respectively. Unlike NO2, PM10 concentrations were not significantly affected by lockdown measures. This could be due to any decreases in PM10 (and PM10 precursors) emissions from traffic being compensated for by increases in emissions from domestic heating and/or from changes in the secondary aerosol formation regime resulting from the lockdown measures. The implementation of the lockdown measures also led to an increase in the highest O3 concentrations at both the urban and regional background sites resulting from reduced titration of O3 by NO. The relaxation of the lockdown measures beginning in May resulted in close-to-expected NO2 concentrations in the urban background and to significant increases in PM10 in comparison to expected concentrations at both regional and urban background sites.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution at regional and urban background sites in northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 the world has faced the pandemic situation with COVID-19 that caused a vast amount of challenges for many spheres of human life including the system of higher education Students and faculty members of higher educational institutions were forced to critically change their learning style using distant technologies, Zoom and Moodle platforms which was not always perceived positively Nevertheless, the existing situation of restrictions revealed larger opportunities for an increase in English learning and education through English One of the most popular directions is English as a medium of instruction (EMI) The international character and popularity of English are undisputable, that's why it is widely used to teach specific subjects in non-native English-speaking countries Institutions of higher education all over the world start offering educational programs in English for disciplines in different training directions whether it is management or agriculture The article aims at focusing on implementing EMI in two institutions of higher education in the Siberian Federal District where faculty members teach in English within modern European internationalization trend of offering courses and Master degree programs in English The authors make an attempt to reveal advantages and disadvantages of EMI implementation and introduction Based on the works and experiments of foreign scientists and having some experience in using English as a medium of instruction, the authors draw the conclusion that the EMI implementation in its pure form has certain imperfections Consequently, the authors suggest the set of measures to make this process more effective: First, to search for opportunities for the foreign language additional study by students in the Bachelor's degree, via elective courses, or Language Learning Business Centers;secondly, to use the so-called CLIL-ised EMI;thirdly, to provide faculty members with English-training courses and ensure the access to the resources for the development of methodological materials ?

Clinical data and in-hospital death were collected. The risk for malnutrition was assessed using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) via objective parameters at admission. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-five patients were enrolled, including 66 severe patients and 41 critically ill patients. Twenty-five deaths were observed, making 8.47% in the whole population and 37.88% in the critically ill subgroup. Patients had significant differences in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory biomarkers among three types of disease severity. Patients with lower GNRI and PNI, as well as higher CONUT scores, had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

However, U.S. policymakers have raised several concerns about the practical use of these models. In this review paper, we examine the extent to which the current literature already addresses these concerns and identify means of enhancing the current models for higher operational use. METHODS: We surveyed PubMed and other sources for published research literature on simulation models for influenza pandemic preparedness. We identified 23 models published between 1990 and 2010 that consider single-region (e.g., country, province, city) outbreaks and multi-pronged mitigation strategies. We developed a plan for examination of the literature based on the concerns raised by the policymakers. RESULTS: While examining the concerns about the adequacy and validity of data, we found that though the epidemiological data supporting the models appears to be adequate, it should be validated through as many updates as possible during an outbreak. Demographical data must improve its interfaces for access, retrieval, and translation into model parameters. Regarding the concern about credibility and validity of modeling assumptions, we found that the models often simplify reality to reduce computational burden. Such simplifications may be permissible if they do not interfere with the performance assessment of the mitigation strategies. We also agreed with the concern that social behavior is inadequately represented in pandemic influenza models. Our review showed that the models consider only a few social-behavioral aspects including contact rates, withdrawal from work or school due to symptoms appearance or to care for sick relatives, and compliance to social distancing, vaccination, and antiviral prophylaxis. The concern about the degree of accessibility of the models is palpable, since we found three models that are currently accessible by the public while other models are seeking public accessibility. Policymakers would prefer models scalable to any population size that can be downloadable and operable in personal computers. But scaling models to larger populations would often require computational needs that cannot be handled with personal computers and laptops. As a limitation, we state that some existing models could not be included in our review due to their limited available documentation discussing the choice of relevant parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: To adequately address the concerns of the policymakers, we need continuing model enhancements in critical areas including: updating of epidemiological data during a pandemic, smooth handling of large demographical databases, incorporation of a broader spectrum of social-behavioral aspects, updating information for contact patterns, adaptation of recent methodologies for collecting human mobility data, and improvement of computational efficiency and accessibility.","output":"A systematic review to identify areas of enhancements of pandemic simulation models for operational use at provincial and local levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carotid free-floating thrombus is an uncommon entity that usually presents with neurologic symptoms.

We collected normal colorectal mucosa and blood from 481 subjects and assessed mucosal gene expression using Illumina HumanHT-12v4 arrays in relation to germline genotype. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were explored by anatomical location of sampling. The rs3087967 genotype (chr11q23.1 risk variant) exhibited significant site-specific effects - risk of distal CRC (OR=1.20, P=8.20x10-20 ) with negligible effects on proximal CRC risk (OR=1.05, P=0.10). Expression of 1261 genes differed between proximal and distal colonic mucosa (top hit PRAC gene, fold-difference=10, P=3.48x10-57 ). In eQTL studies, rs3087967 genotype was associated with expression of 8 cis- and 21 trans-genes. Four of these (AKAP14, ADH5P4, ASGR2, RP11-342M1.7) showed differential effects by site, with strongest trans-eQTL signals in proximal colonic mucosa (e.g. AKAP14, beta=0.61, P=5.02x10-5 ) and opposite signals in distal mucosa (AKAP14, beta=-0.17, P=0.04). In summary, genetic variation at the chr11q23.1 risk locus imparts greater risk of distal rather than proximal CRC and exhibits site-specific differences in eQTL effects in normal mucosa. Topographical differences in genomic control over gene expression relevant to CRC risk may underlie site-specific variation in CRC. Results may inform individualised CRC screening programmes.

For instance, CT and MRI have advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore, robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods. For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is used to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either training or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in routine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other baseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19 dataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual differences are observed. Similarly, the proposed method achieves the best performance.","output":"Cross-Domain Segmentation with Adversarial Loss and Covariate Shift for Biomedical Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although the corona virus is responsible in the majority of cases for mild symptoms, there are sometimes severe and even lethal forms of this disease. Our study aimed to identify clinical and para-clinical predictors of mortality related to COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted from March 2020 to December 2020 at intensive care unit department of Mohamed VI University Hospital Oujda, Morocco including 600 patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 600 patients, the mortality rate was 32.50%, the predictors of mortality identified in our study were: associated heart disease (RR: 1.826; CI: [1.081C3.084]; p:0.024), high D-dimer level at admission (RR:1.027; CI: [1.011C1.047]; p:0.001), need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 4.158; CI: [2.648C6.530]; p: <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we were able to identify 3 predictors of COVID 19 mortality (associated heart failure, high D-dimer level on admission, and need for mechanical ventilation). These predictors could help clinicians to identify early patients with high risk of lethality in order to reduce mortality related to corona virus.","output":"Predictive factors of mortality related to COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study of 600 cases in the intensive care unit of the university hospital of Oujda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Business schools aim to educate and train tomorrow's managers, who will be responsible to lead their organizations towards success.

In hypoxia/reoxygenation- (H/R-) treated H9C2 cardiomyocytes, melatonin treatment upregulated OPA1 mRNA and protein expression, thereby enhancing mitochondrial fusion. Melatonin also suppressed apoptosis in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by increased cell viability, diminished caspase-3 activity, and reduced Troponin T secretion; however, silencing OPA1 abolished these effects. H/R treatment augmented mitochondrial ROS production and repressed antioxidative molecule levels, while melatonin reversed these changes in an OPA1-dependent manner. Melatonin also inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, but OPA1 silencing prevented these outcomes.

Data were analysed regarding therapy-associated differences in gene expression and protein levels by comparing responders (defined by improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction 20 % relative and 5 % absolute) and non-responders. Responders to IA/IgG showed a decrease in serum N-terminal proBNP levels in comparison with baseline which was accompanied by a decreased expression of heart failure markers, such as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or periostin.

DCs have a superior capacity for acquiring, processing, and presenting antigens to T cells and they express costimulatory or coinhibitory molecules that determine immune activation or anergy. For these reasons, cell-based therapeutic approaches using DCs have been explored in cancer and infectious diseases but with limited success. In humans, DCs are divided into heterogeneous subsets with distinct characteristics. Two major subsets are CD11c+ myeloid (m)DCs and CD11c- plasmacytoid (p)DCs. pDCs are different from mDCs and play an essential role in the innate immune system via the production of type I interferons (IFN). However, pDCs are also able to take-up antigens and effectively cross present them. Given the rarity of pDCs in blood and technical difficulties in obtaining them from human blood samples, the understanding of human pDC biology and their potential in immunotherapeutic approaches (e.g. cell-based vaccines) is limited. However, due to the recent advancements in cell culturing systems that allow for the generation of functional pDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), studying pDCs has become easier. In this mini-review, we hypothesize about the use of pDCs as a cell-based therapy to treat HIV by enhancing anti-HIV-immune responses of the adaptive immune system and enhancing the anti-viral responses of the innate immune system.

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters have a low rate of fatal mechanical complications when compared to non-tunnel central venous catheters. However, as peripherally inserted central venous catheter access requires a smaller vein, there is a high risk of thrombosis. The axillary vein (confluence of the basilic and brachial veins) can serve as an access for cannulation. Moreover, as this vein is larger than the basilic or brachial vein, it might be a superior option for preventing thrombosis. The risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection should be considered when the puncture site is at the axillary fossa. The aim of this study was to present our new protocol involving peripherally inserted central venous catheters (non-tunneled/tunneled) and a tunneling technique and assess its feasibility and safety for improving cannulation and preventing thrombosis and infection. METHODS The study included 20 patients. The axillary vein in the upper arm was used for peripherally inserted central venous catheters in patients with a small-diameter basilic vein (<3 mm). When the puncture site was in the axillary fossa, a subcutaneous tunnel of about 3 cm was constructed easily using a peripheral venous catheter. RESULTS The observed catheter duration was 645 days (median  standard deviation, 26  22.22 days). Catheterization was successful in all cases, however, two accidental dislodgements were identified. No fatal or serious complications were observed after catheterization. CONCLUSION Our new protocol for axillary peripherally inserted central venous catheters/tunneled axillary peripherally inserted central venous catheters use for a small-diameter basilic vein is safe and feasible.","output":"A novel technique of axillary vein puncture involving peripherally inserted central venous catheters for a small basilic vein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 encodes the Mac1 domain within the large nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3), which has an ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity conserved in other coronaviruses. The enzymatic activity of Mac1 makes it an essential virulence factor for the pathogenicity of coronavirus (CoV). They have a regulatory role in counteracting host-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation, which is unique part of host response towards viral infections. Mac1 shows highly conserved residues in the binding pocket for the mono and poly ADP-ribose. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 enzyme is considered as an ideal drug target and inhibitors developed against them can possess a broad antiviral activity against CoV.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, because of their closer contact with patients. The present study aimed to analyze HCWs knowledge, practices, and attitude towards COVID-19. Methods: We set up a cross-sectional survey through SurveyMonkey? and circulated the link in Facebook and Whatsapp closed groups. It was conducted in Italy from the end of February to the first week of May 2020. The study participants were general practitioners, pediatricians and other health professionals. Data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire including demographic, scope of knowledge, awareness and practice assessment section. Results: A total of 958 participants were included. Of these, 320 (33.4%) were general practitioners, 248 (25.9%) were pediatricians and 390 (40.7%) were other health professionals. The highest response rate was from Northern Italy (48.1%), followed by the Center (29.9%) and Southern Italy (22.0%). The reported risk of having contact with a patient affected by Covid-19 was higher in the lockdown period than the pre-lockdown period (19.4% vs 10.2%, p=0.002). Respondents reported to have changed their clinical practice, more during lockdown period (81.1%) than in the pre-lockdown (46.3%). Particularly, they increased the use of masks (87.1%, p<0.001), disinfection and sanitization of doctors offices (75.8%, p<0.001), the use of protective glasses (71.2%, p<0.001), alcoholic hand solution (71.2%, p<0.001), and hand washing (31.8%, p=0.028). Conclusions: The majority of HCWs felt prepared to face the pandemic, and increased significantly their knowledge on infection prevention and control measures less known in the routine clinical practice (such as use of protective glasses and alcoholic hand solution), compared to other well-known measures (such as hand washing). HCWs are at high risk of infection and need extensive knowledge and awareness of the disease to take adequate precautionary measures and they are crucial to disseminate good practices.","output":"Knowledge and Perception of COVID-19 Pandemic During the First Wave (Feb-May 2020): a Web Based Survey Among Italian Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the importance of microbiology results on patient care, high quality standards are expected. Internal quality assurance (IQA) could mitigate the limitations of internal quality control, competency assessment and external quality assurance, adding a longitudinal insight, including pre- and post-analytical steps.

One-hundred-and-twenty-one out of 123 (98.4%) serological analyses and 112 out of 122 (91.8%) molecular analyses were concordant. Among the discordances in molecular biology analyses, 6 results were low positive samples that turned out negative, likely due to stochastic repartition of nucleic acids. Moreover, one identified retranscription error led us to implement automated results transmission from the Applied Biosystems instruments to the laboratory information system (LIS). Regarding Gram stain microscopy, 560 out of 745 (75.2%) of compared parameters were concordant. As many as 67 out of 84 (79.8%) pairs of culture results were similar, including 16 sterile pairs, 27 having identical identification or description and semi-quantification and 24 only showing variations in semi-quantification with identical description or identification of colonies. Seventeen pairs had diverging identification or description of colonies. Culture was twice only done for one member of the pairs. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing, a major discrepancy was observed in 5 out of 48 results (10.4%). In conclusion, serological tests were highly reproducible. Molecular diagnosis also revealed to be robust except when the amounts of nucleic acids present in the sample were close to the limits of detection. Conventional microbiology was less robust with major discrepancies reaching 39.5% of the samples for microscopy. Similarly, culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were prone to discrepancies.

MSCs have been studied in clinical trials of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, refractory GvHD and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MSCs can be isolated and expanded from multiple tissues, including umbilical cord (UC). A number of clinical studies demonstrated safety and feasibility of UCMSCs therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 ARDS. UC-derived MSCs are easily available and can be quickly expanded to relevant numbers. UC-MSCs have an extended population doubling capacity and express low levels of class I and class II leukocyte antigen, which may reduce alloreactivity. To meet clinical manufacture demands, UC-MSC production requires an innovative, scaled-up manufacturing platform. We describe the manufacturing strategy developed in support of a double-blind, randomized, controlled UC- MSC clinical trial in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS. Methods, Results & Conclusion: UC-MSC Final Product was manufactured from the master cell bank (MCB) derived from subepithelial lining of a UC from a healthy term delivery, in cGMP conditions. Utilizing a 2D culture xenogeneic protein-free process, UC-MSC MCB was culture-expanded during 3 expansion cycles, in tissue culture treated vessels with increased surface area for each expansion, in commercially available tissue culture media supplemented with platelet lysate. Cells were harvested during log phase, at 75-80% confluence. The manufacturing process yielded ~ 300x increase in total viable cells at the end of the last expansion cycle. The Final Product was cryopreserved using a controlled rate freezer. Each subject in the treatment group received two doses of 100106 UC-MSCs. A single UC-MSC Final Product batch was sufficient to treat all subjects randomized to the treatment group and complete the trial. The final product was tested for identity (label verification), effectiveness by viable cell dose and cell viability (>80%), safety by assessment of endotoxin (<1.65 EU/ml), Mycoplasma (negative), 14-day Sterility (negative) and purity by [Figure presented] FLOW cytometry (CD90/CD105?>90%, CD34/CD45 <10%). UC-MSC cell doses prepared for infusion produced similar results to UC-MSC Final Product when tested to confirm product identity, effectiveness, safety and purity.

In medical schools, the COVID-19 pandemic required a complete switch to e-learning without any direct patient contact despite early reports showing that medical students preferred face-to-face teaching in clinical setting. We designed close to real-life patient e-learning modules to transmit competency-based learning contents to medical students and evaluated their responses about their experience. METHODS: Weekly e-learning cases covering a 10-week leading symptom-based curriculum were designed by a team of medical students and physicians. The internal medicine curriculum (HeiCuMed) at the Heidelberg University Medical School is a mandatory part of clinical medical education in the 6th or 7th semester. Case-design was based on routine patient encounters and covered different clinical settings: preclinical emergency medicine, in-patient and out-patient care and follow-up. Individual cases were evaluated online immediately after finishing the respective case. The whole module was assessed at the end of the semester. Free-text answers were analyzed with MaxQDa following Mayring\`s principles of qualitative content analyses.

Individual participant data were pooled from two retrospective cohorts: (1) The Moli-LOCK cohort consists of 1501 adults, a portion of the larger Moli-sani study (n 24 325; 2005-2010) who were administered a phone-based questionnaire to assess lifestyles and psychological factors during confinement and (2) the Analysis of Long Term Risk of Covid-19 Emergency is a web-based survey of 1491 individuals distributed throughout Italy who self-responded to the same questionnaire by using Google forms.UPF was defined according to NOVA classification based on degree of food processing. An UPF score was created by assigning 1 point to increased consumption, -1 to decreased and 0 point for unchanged intakes of nineteen food items, with higher values indicating an increase in UPF during confinement. RESULTS: Overall, 375 % of the population reported some increase in UPF (UPF score &#8805;1).

This research has laid a strong foundation for translation of these findings into patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Research has indicated that patients with pneumonia and sepsis have low vitamin C status and elevated oxidative stress. Administration of vitamin C to patients with pneumonia can decrease the severity and duration of the disease. Critically ill patients with sepsis require intravenous administration of gram amounts of the vitamin to normalize plasma levels, an intervention that some studies suggest reduces mortality. The vitamin has pleiotropic physiological functions, many of which are relevant to COVID-19. These include its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immuno-modulatory functions. Preliminary observational studies indicate low vitamin C status in critically ill patients with COVID-19. There are currently a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered globally that are assessing intravenous vitamin C monotherapy in patients with COVID-19. Since hypovitaminosis C and deficiency are common in low-middle-income settings, and many of the risk factors for vitamin C deficiency overlap with COVID-19 risk factors, it is possible that trials carried out in populations with chronic hypovitaminosis C may show greater efficacy. This is particularly relevant for the global research effort since COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting low-middle-income countries and low-income groups globally. One small trial from China has finished early and the findings are currently under peer review. There was significantly decreased mortality in the more severely ill patients who received vitamin C intervention.

Optimization of the intervention protocols in future trials, e.g., earlier and sustained administration, is warranted to potentially improve its efficacy.

METHODS: We undertook a phase II trial of pembrolizumab in patients with LMM from solid tumors. Eligible patients had radiologic/cytologic LMM and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0C1. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at 200 mg q3W until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was central nervous system (CNS) response after four cycles, defined radiologically/cytologically/clinically. Serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assessed for tumor-derived DNA (t-DNA) aneuploidy and cytokines. RESULTS: Thirteen of a planned 16 patients were treated between April 2017 and December 2019. The study closed early for poor accrual. Median age was 57 years (range: 22C79). Sixty-two percent of patients had tumors not traditionally ICI-responsive (hormone-receptor (HR)-positive breast carcinoma=39%; high-grade glioma=23%), while 38% had ICI-responsive tumors (non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)=23%, head and neck carcinoma=8%, cutaneous squamous carcinoma (CSC)=8%). CNS response was observed in 38% of patients at 12 weeks (95% CI 13.9% to 68.4%) by pre-defined criteria and LM-RANO, and 2 achieved durable complete responses (CSC=1, overall survival (OS) 3+ years; NSCLC=1, OS 9 months). Median CNS progression-free survival and OS was 2.9 months (95% CI 1.3 to NR) and 4.9 months (95% CI 3.7 to NR), respectively. Grade 3+ treatment-related adverse events occurred in 15% of patients. Sensitivity for LMM detection by t-DNA and cytopathology was 84.6% (95% CI 54.6% to 98.1%) and 53.9% (95% CI 25.1% to 80.8%), respectively. Pre-therapy and on-therapy CSF cytokine analysis demonstrated complete responders clustered together. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab conferred a 38% CNS response rate in patients with LMM, a tolerable safety profile, and deep responses in selected patients with ICI-responsive tumors. CSF t-DNA may be sensitive for LMM detection, and immunologic subsets of CNS response warrant further study.

DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interview study. SETTING: Participants homes. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults living in Uganda (aged 60+). MEASUREMENTS: Older adults in Uganda were interviewed over the phone and asked about their lives before and since COVID-19, and how public health restrictions have affected their lives. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Transcripts were thematically analyzed and themes generated in discussion. RESULTS: In total, 30 older adults participated in the study. Five themes were identified: (1) economic impacts; (2) lack of access to basic necessities; (3) impact on healthcare utilization; (4) social impacts and (5) violent reinforcement of public health restrictions. COVID-19 public health restrictions had severe impacts on their lives, with many people having not enough food to eat due to lack of income, and being unable to pay their grandchildrens school fees. Steep rises in public transport fares and an overall avoidance of transport also resulted in a lack of access to healthcare services and difficulty in getting food. Restrictions were violently reinforced by security guards. CONCLUSIONS: Public health restrictions have a severe impact not only on older adults but also on the whole family in Uganda.

However, not all patients who receive long-term, high-dose steroids develop osteonecrosis, indicating that there are individual differences in occurrence. We explored the relationship between polymorphisms and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) incidence with variables. We used a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, which is an expansion of logistic regression, for each type of steroid, primary disease, drug dose, applied duration, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We also conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to analyze the cumulative dosage and SONFH risk in mutation carriers. There were significant correlations between the ABCB1 rs1045642 mutant and SONFH in the prednisone-use and methylprednisolone/prednisone-use populations. The ABCB1 rs2032582 mutant homozygote had a protective effect in the methylprednisolone/prednisolone renal transplant population. For ApoB rs693, mutation increased the incidence of SONFH in prednisone-use and methylprednisolone/prednisolone-use populations and renal transplant patients. For ApoB rs1042031, mutation increased the risk of SONFH in the prednisone-use population. The PAI-1 rs1799768 mutation had a protective effect on the SONFH risk prednisone-use and renal transplant populations. ABCB1 rs1045642 mutations have a protective effect against SONFH, and ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 increase the SONFH risk. Cumulative dosage and treatment duration had little effect on the results.

In Portugal, the consequences on emergent pacemaker implantation rates are largely unknown. We sought to analyze the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on emergent pacemaker implantation rate and patient profile. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical profile of the 180 patients who had pacemakers implanted in our hospital in an emergent setting from March 18, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (lockdown) and May 19 to July 17, 2020 (postlockdown). This data was then directly compared to the homologous periods from the year before. RESULTS: Urgent pacemaker implantation rates during \\"lockdown\\" was lower than its homologous period (?23.7%), and cases in \\"postlockdown\\" were significantly increased (+106.9% vs. \\"lockdown\\"; +13.2% vs. MayCJuly 2019). When comparing lockdown and postlockdown, there was a tendency for a higher number of temporary pacemaker use (p = .076). Patients during lockdown were 7.57 times more likely to present with hypotension/shock (odds ratio 7.57; p = .013). We also noted a higher tendency for hypotension on presentation during lockdown (p = .054) in comparison to 2019. In comparison to its homologous 2019 period, postlockdown saw more patients presenting with bradycardia (p = .026). No patients were admitted to the emergency department during \\"lockdown\\" for anomalies detected on ambulatory tests.

The introduction of intravitreal injection of melphalan has enabled more eyes to be salvaged safely but with definite retinal toxicity. Intensive treatment with high-dose intravitreal topotecan may be a strategy to control tumor burden because of its cell cycle-dependent cytotoxicity and the proven safety in humans. Therefore, we evaluated the ocular and systemic safety of repeated high-dose intravitreal injections of topotecan in rabbits. Systemic and ocular toxicity was assessed in non-tumor-bearing rabbits after four weekly injections of three doses of topotecan (10g, 25g, and 50g) or vehicle alone. Animals were evaluated weekly for general and ophthalmic clinical status. One week after the last injection, vitreous and plasma samples were collected for drug quantification and the enucleated eyes were subjected to histological assessment. Weight, hair loss, or changes in hematologic values were absent during the study period across all animal groups. Eyes injected with all topotecan doses or vehicle showed no signs of anterior segment inflammation, clinical or histologic evidence of damage to the retina, and ERG parameters remained unaltered throughout the study. Vitreous and plasma topotecan lactone concentrations were undetectable. Four weekly intravitreal injections of topotecan up to 50g in the animal model or a 100g human equivalent dose were not toxic for the rabbit eye.

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40C83) and 9 (6C17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89C0.99). These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data.

The identification of co-localized molecules in MSI data is crucial to the understanding of biochemical pathways. One of key challenges in molecular colocalization is that complex MSI data are too large for manual annotation but too small for training deep neural networks. Herein, we introduce a self-supervised clustering approach based on contrastive learning, which shows an excellent performance in clustering of MSI data. We train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using MSI data from a single experiment without manual annotations to effectively learn high-level spatial features from ion images and classify them based on molecular colocalizations. We demonstrate that contrastive learning generates ion image representations that form well-resolved clusters. Subsequent self-labeling is used to fine-tune both the CNN encoder and linear classifier based on confidently classified ion images. This new approach enables autonomous and high-throughput identification of co-localized species in MSI data, which will dramatically expand the application of spatial lipidomics, metabolomics, and proteomics in biological research.","output":"Self-supervised clustering of mass spectrometry imaging data using contrastive learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Residents of nursing homes (NH) are at high risk of COVID-19 related morbidity and death and may respond poorly to vaccination because of old age and frequent comorbidities. Methods Forty residents and forty staff members either naive or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited in two NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30g BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), spike domains S1 and S2, RBD Ab avidity, and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351 variant were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49. Results SARS-CoV-2 naive residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than naive staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all domains of the vaccine antigen, lower avidity of RBD IgG, and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No naive resident had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. High and comparable Ab responses were observed in residents and staff previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Clustering analysis revealed that poor vaccine responders not only included naive residents but also naive staff, emphasizing the heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population. Conclusions The poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection naive residents and in some naive staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with variants of concern.

OBJECTIVE: To survey the extent of COVID-19 lockdownCrelated lifestyle changes, their differences by child age and family socioeconomic status, and the potential association with child adiposity 1 year after lockdown. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A self-administered, electronic survey was introduced to 2 ongoing child cohorts (the Singapore Preconception Study of Long-term Maternal and Child Outcomes [S-PRESTO] cohort of preschool children aged 1-4.5 years and the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes [GUSTO] cohort of primary school children aged 9-10.7 years) from July 8, 2020, to September 5, 2020, which was 1 to 3 months after the end of strict universal movement restrictions (duration of 73 days ending on June 19, 2020). All active participants from S-PRESTO and GUSTO, 2 population-based, longitudinal, parent-offspring cohorts in Singapore, were invited to participate and monitored through June 15, 2021. EXPOSURES: Exposures included family income before and after the COVID-19 lockdown, changes in child outdoor play or exercise, and COVID-19Crelated life events; all data were self-reported by parents and school-aged children 1 to 3 months after the lockdown. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were self-reported COVID-19Crelated life events and changes in child online socialization, outdoor play or exercise, and intrafamily relationships. Study staff measured childrens weight, height, and skinfold thickness before and up to 1 year after lockdown. Body mass indices (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and World Health OrganizationCstandardized scores were computed. Differences before and after lockdown were compared using baseline-adjusted linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 604 parents (53% of active cohort participants) and 356 school-aged children completed the survey and were similar to source cohorts. This represents 373 of 761 eligible children in the GUSTO cohort (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [0.4] years; 197 girls [52.8%]) and 231 of 370 eligible children in the S-PRESTO cohort (mean [SD] age, 2.6 [0.8] years; 121 boys [52.6%]). The COVID-19Crelated life changes were prevalent and varied (eg, 414 of 600 children [69.0%] reported changes in social activities). More than one-third of primary schoolCaged children (122 of 356 [34.3%]) and one-quarter of preschool-aged children (56 of 229 [24.5%]) eliminated any outdoor play after the lockdown. Lower family income before the lockdown was associated with increased odds of elimination of outdoor play (adjusted odds ratio per 1000 Singapore dollars [$730 US dollars] decrease, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19). Complete elimination of outdoor activity (vs continued outdoor activity) was associated with an increase in body mass index of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.03-0.94) and a body mass index z score of 0.18 units (95% CI, 0-0.37) in school-aged children approximately 1 year after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that 1 to 3 months after a brief, strict lockdown, a large proportion of parents and school-aged children reported elimination of outdoor play, which was more prevalent in lower-income families.

Second, how does profound cognitive impairment affect the balance of positives and negatives in a childs future life? Third, if the life of a child with life-limiting illness is prolonged, how much suffering will she experience and can any of it be alleviated? Is there a risk that negative experiences for such a child (suffering) will remain despite the provision of palliative care? We argue that both the subjective and objective components of well-being for children could be greatly reduced if they are anticipated to have a short life that is affected by profound cognitive impairment. This does not mean that their overall well-being will be negative, but rather that there may be a higher risk of negative overall well-being if they are expected to experience pain, discomfort, or distress. Furthermore, we point to some of the practical limitations of therapies aimed at relieving suffering, such that there is a risk that suffering will go partially or completely unrelieved.

DESIGN: A cross sectional survey including a self-administered questionnaire in one of the three main spoken languages in Israel was administered to patients in 17 hospital hematology outpatient clinics between May 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: About 52% of 385 patients that participated in the survey preferred home transfusions to hospital transfusions. Gender, age, education, or type of disease were not associated with preference for home transfusions, nor were hospital location or its size. The likelihood to prefer home transfusions was significantly higher among the Hebrew-speakers and those who had not experienced adverse effects previously. The most significant factor associated with preference of home transfusions was a perceived negative effect of hospital-based transfusion on quality of life. The main reason to reject home transfusions was fear of possible adverse effects and concerns over losing contact with the medical staff at the treating hospital.

METHODS This study used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and linked national mortality data in England from 2000 to 2019 to investigate immortal time bias for a specific life-long condition, intellectual disability. Life expectancy (Chiang's abridged life table approach) was compared for 33,867 exposed and 980,586 unexposed individuals aged 10+ years using five methods: (1) treating immortal time as observation time; (2) excluding time before date of first exposure diagnosis; (3) matching cohort entry to first exposure diagnosis; (4) excluding time before proxy date of inputting first exposure diagnosis (by the physician); and (5) treating exposure as a time-dependent measure. RESULTS When not considered in the design or analysis (Method 1), immortal time bias led to disproportionately high life expectancy for the exposed population during the first calendar period (additional years expected to live: 2000-2004: 65.6 [95% CI: 63.6,67.6]) compared to the later calendar periods (2005-2009: 59.9 [58.8,60.9]; 2010-2014: 58.0 [57.1,58.9]; 2015-2019: 58.2 [56.8,59.7]).

Neuroimaging characteristics may correlate with thrombus composition. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between the hyperdense artery sign (HAS) on imaging and thrombus composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS Acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent endovascular thrombus retrieval from 2010-2012 were prospectively recruited. One blinded pathologist prepared the histology sections of retrieved thrombi whereby staining with haematoxylin and eosin and CD34 immunostain were performed. Histology sections were categorised into 4 phases of thrombus formation: red blood cell (RBC) dominant, RBC proportion equal to fibrin, fibrin dominant and organised fibrin. Computed tomography (CT) brain scans were assessed for HAS. Fisher's exact test was performed to identify an association between HAS and thrombus composition. RESULTS Forty patients were included. The mean age was 65.612.9 years and 67.5% were male. Atrial fibrillation was detected in 19 (47.5%) patients, diabetes mellitus in 6 (15.0%), hypercholesterolaemia in 11 (27.5%), hypertension in 20 (50.0%) and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack in 8 (20.0%) patients. Of the retrieved thrombi, 11 (27.5%) were RBC dominant, 11 (27.5%) RBC proportion was equal to fibrin, 7 (17.5%) fibrin dominant and 11 (27.5%) organised fibrin pathology. HAS was present in 29 (72.5%) patients and was significantly associated with thrombus early phase pathology (P<0.05). CONCLUSION HAS was significantly associated with early phase thrombus composition. This may enable the prediction of thrombus composition and allow for targeted selection of therapeutic modality.","output":"Thrombus composition in acute ischemic stroke: a histopathological study of thrombus extracted by endovascular retrieval."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universal rotavirus (RV) vaccination is expected to reduce hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis (GE) of children by eliminating most of severe RVGE, but it does not have any effect on norovirus (NV), the second most common causative agent of GE in children. After the introduction of the RV vaccine into the National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Finland in 2009, we conducted a prospective 2-year survey of GE in children seen in Tampere University Hospital either as outpatients or inpatients and compared the results with a similar 2-year survey conducted prior to NIP in the years 2006C2008. Compared with the pre-NIP 2-year period, in 2009C2011, hospitalizations for RVGE were reduced by 76 % and outpatient clinic visits were reduced by 81 %. NVGE showed a slight decreasing trend and accounted for 34 % of all cases of GE seen in hospital in pursuance of RVGE having decreased to 26 % (down from 52 %). In cases admitted to the hospital ward, RV accounted for 28 % and NV accounted for 37 %.The impact of RV vaccination was reflected as a 57 % decrease in all hospital admissions and 62 % decrease in all outpatient clinic visits for GE of any cause.

We examine characteristics and ratings of care among Veterans with telehealth hub visits compared to usual primary care (PC) during the pilot program.Our objectives are to:Understand Veteran experiences with access, care coordination, comprehensiveness and primary care provider (PCP) communication during a telehealth pilot program.Examine Veteran characteristics associated with telehealth hub visits during a pilot program.Study DesignRegression analysis of a cross\\\\sectional data: VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients C Patient\\\\Centered Medical Home (SHEP\\\\PCMH), which uses Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) questionnaires to survey Veterans on their healthcare experiences. We derived dichotomous outcomes from SHEP\\\\PCMH composite indices, indicating optimal experiences with access, care coordination, PCP communication, comprehensiveness (based on the percentages of responses that fall in the top category (Always or Yes) and PCP rating (9 or 10 out of 10). Key predictors were telehealth hub v. usual care index visit and proportion of telehealth hub visits in 6 months prior to the index visit. Other covariates included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, number of PC visits in past year, self\\\\rated overall and mental health, and year of visit. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to predict optimal care experiences, controlling for demographics, healthcare use, health status and year.Population StudiedVeterans receiving care at VA PC clinics offering telehealth hub visits during FY2018\\\\2019.Principal FindingsIn FY2018\\\\2019, 3201 out of 57,793 Veterans had a telehealth hub index visit. Telehealth hub utilization 6 months prior to index visit: 0.25% usual care v. 83% telehealth. Compared to usual care, the telehealth hub group was significantly older (age  65: 60% telehealth, 50.5% usual care), had fewer PC visits (0C1 visits: 69% telehealth, 56% usual care). In multivariate models, we failed to detect statistically significant difference between telehealth hub and usual care groups for the composite measures of Veteran experiences.

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are commonly used recently for improved patient comfort and safety. We compared centrally inserted central catheters (CICC) and PICC insertions and examined their safety. Methods : We retrospectively investigated complications at the catheter insertion and post-insertion for 199 patients' esophageal cancer treatment (CICC : 45, PICC : 154) from 2013 to 2018. In addition, we summarized the results of catheter tip culture. Results : No serious complications occurred at the catheter insertion in either group. The rate of complications at catheter insertion was 5.8% for PICC and 6.7% for CICC patients. Post-insertion complications were observed in 6.5% and 11.1% of patients with PICC and CICC, respectively, and this difference was not significant. The incidence of catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was significantly lower in PICC than CICC patients (0.3 vs. 1.8 / 1,000 catheter-days ; p = 0.029). Catheter-related thrombosis was observed in PICC : 0.5 and CICC : 0.6, and occlusion due to blood flow reversal was observed in PICC : 0.5 and CICC : 0.6. Conclusion : PICCs are safer and more effective than CICCs for the treatment of esophageal cancer, and reduce the incidence of CRBSI.

Specifically, we aimed to investigate whether the proportion of FIT-negative CRC missed by a single FIT test in symptomatic patients could be reduced by duplicate FIT testing. DESIGN: A retrospective service evaluation cohort study of the diagnostic accuracy of duplicate FIT testing. SETTING: Patients referred from primary care with suspected CRC to four secondary care trusts in North-West England. PARTICIPANTS: 28 622 patients over 18-years-old with lower gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of CRC who completed two FIT samples. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The performance of duplicate FIT for detecting CRC at a threshold of 10 gHb/g. RESULTS: The sensitivity if either test was >10 gHb/g was 0.978 (0.955C0.989), specificity was 0.662 (0.657C0.668), positive predictive value 0.031 (0.028C0.035) and negative predictive value 1.00 (0.999C1.00). Despite two-thirds of patients (18952) being negative following two tests, at this threshold only seven CRC were missed over a 26-month period. All seven patients had other high-risk features which should have prompted investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in routine NHS practice, a duplicate FIT sample strategy together with clinical evaluation for evidence of anaemia and weight loss is superior to a single FIT sample alone and would allow symptomatic patients to be managed in primary care without the need for urgent referral to secondary care for urgent colonic imaging.","output":"A cohort study of duplicate faecal immunochemical testing in patients at risk of colorectal cancer from North-West England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: State cannabis laws are changing rapidly. Research is inconclusive about their association with rates of self-harm and assault. Existing studies have not considered variations in cannabis commercialization across states over time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of state medical and recreational cannabis laws with self-harm and assault, overall and by age and sex, while considering varying degrees of commercialization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a cohort design with panel fixed-effects analysis, within-state changes in claims for self-harm and assault injuries before and after changes in cannabis laws were quantified in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Comprehensive claims data on commercial and Medicare Advantage health plan beneficiaries from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2017, grouped by state and month, were evaluated. Data analysis was conducted from January 31, 2020, to January 21, 2021. EXPOSURES: Categorical variable that indexed the degree of cannabis legalization in each state and month based on law type (medical or recreational) and operational status of dispensaries (commercialization). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Claims for self-harm and assault injuries based on International Classification of Diseases codes. RESULTS: The analysis included 75 395 344 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 47 [22] years; 50% female; and median follow-up, 17 months [interquartile range, 8-36 months]). During the study period, 29 states permitted use of medical cannabis and 11 permitted recreational cannabis. Point estimates for populationwide rates of self-harm and assault injuries were higher in states legalizing recreational cannabis compared with states with no cannabis laws, but these results were not statistically significant (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] assault, recreational dispensaries: 1.27; 95% CI, 0.79-2.03;self-harm, recreational dispensaries aRR: 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89-1.50). Results varied by age and sex with no associations found except for states with recreational policies and self-harm among males younger than 40 years (aRR <21 years, recreational without dispensaries: 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11-2.61; aRR aged 21-39 years, recreational dispensaries: 1.46; 95% CI, 1.01-2.12). Medical cannabis was generally not associated with self-harm or assault injuries populationwide or among age and sex subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recreational cannabis legalization appears to be associated with relative increases in rates of claims for self-harm among male health plan beneficiaries younger than 40 years. There was no association between cannabis legalization and self-harm or assault, for any other age and sex group or for medical cannabis. States that legalize but still constrain commercialization may be better positioned to protect younger male populations from unintended harms.","output":"Evaluation of State Cannabis Laws and Rates of Self-harm and Assault"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policymakers need clear, fast assessment of the real spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in each of their respective countries. Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths.

Different countries diagnose differently and present very distinctive reported case fatality ratios. Similar levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying pictures.

The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empirical. The key assumption of the method is that the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19 in Europe is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor to the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol is dynamic, and it has been yielding converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as from mid-April, 2020. Using this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain Effective Potential Growth updated every day, providing an unbiased assessment of the countries at greater risk of experiencing an uncontrolled situation.

METHODS Thirty anesthesiologists and experienced residents (\\"operators\\") were instructed to perform the 3 airway techniques in 10 F4L, 10 formalin-fixed cadavers, and 1 manikin. The order of the model type was randomized per operator. Primary outcomes were the operators' ranking of each model type as a teaching model (total rank), ranking of the model types per technique, and an operator's average verbal rating score for suitability and realism of learning the technique on the model. Secondary outcomes were the percentages of successfully performed procedures per technique and per model (success rates in completing the respective airway maneuvers). For each of the airway techniques, the Friedman analysis of variance was used to compare the 3 models on mean operator ranking and mean verbal rating scores. RESULTS Twenty-seven of 30 operators (90%) performed all airway techniques on all of the available models, whereas 3 operators performed the majority but not all of the airway maneuvers on all models for logistical reasons. The total number of attempts for each technique was 30 on the manikin, 292 in the F4L, and 282 on the formalin-fixed cadavers. The operators' median total ranking of each model type as a teaching model was 1 for F4L, 2 for the manikin and, 3 for the formalin-fixed cadavers (P < .001). F4L was considered the best model for mask ventilation (P = .029) and had a higher mean verbal rating score for realism in laryngeal mask airway insertion (P = .043). The F4L and manikin did not differ significantly in other scores for suitability and realism. The formalin-fixed cadaver was ranked last and received lowest scores in all procedures (all P < .001).

Data from Istituto Superiore di Sanit (ISS, Italy) show that more than 68.3% of patients had hypertension, 28.2% ischemic heart disease, 22.5% atrial fibrillation, while 30.1% T2DM. Several authors suggested that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus are linked to endothelial dysfunction, and all of them are strictly related to aging. Considering the impact of the gender on the COVID-19 epidemic, even if confirmed cases from each nation are changing every day, epidemiological data clearly evidence that in men the infection causes worse outcomes compared to women. In Italy, up to 21 May, in the age range of 60-89 years, male deaths were 63.9% of total cases. The reason behind this difference between genders appears not clear; however, the diversity in sex-hormones and styles of life are believed to play a role in the patient's susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. It is known that the activation of endothelial estrogen receptors increases NO and decreases ROS, protecting the vascular system from angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, inflammation, and ROS production.

We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being a high-risk person for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with a high-risk person for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior 2 weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior 2 weeks, being pessimistic about the vaccine and working in healthcare, were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we found reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction, advanced bedtime and wake-up time, and a shift to morningness, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers (~60%) and severe depression (~20%) in a context of increased perceived stress. The present study showed a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been considered a crucial contributor to maladaptive repair in acute kidney injury. Treatment with FG-4592, an inhibitor of hypoxia inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase, is emerging as a new approach to attenuate renal damage; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The current research demonstrated the protective effect of FG-4592 against renal dysfunction and histopathological damage on the 7th day after FA administration. FG-4592 accelerated tubular repair by promoting tubular cell regeneration, as indicated by increased proliferation of cell nuclear antigen-positive tubular cells, and facilitated structural integrity, as reflected by up-regulation of the epithelial inter-cellular tight junction molecule occludin-1 and the adherens junction molecule E-cadherin. Furthermore, FG-4592 ameliorated tubular functional recovery by restoring the function-related proteins aquaporin1, aquaporin2, and sodium chloride cotransporter. Specifically, FG-4592 pretreatment inhibited hypoxia inducible factor-1 activation on the 7th day after folic acid injection, which ameliorated ultrastructural abnormalities, promoted ATP production, and attenuated excessive reactive oxygen species production both in renal tissue and mitochondria. This was mainly mediated by balancing of mitochondrial dynamics, as indicated by down-regulation of mitochondrial fission 1 and dynamin-related protein 1 as well as up-regulation of mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1. Moreover, FG-4592 pretreatment attenuated renal tubular epithelial cell death, kidney inflammation, and subsequent interstitial fibrosis. In vitro, TNF--induced HK-2 cells injury could be ameliorated by FG-4592 pretreatment.

Methods: : Fifty-three discharged COVID-19 patients were enrolled at Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, from Jan 21 to Mar 10, 2020. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between CT scores and laboratory indicators. Patients were divided into Wuhan (lived in/or traveled to Wuhan, 30 cases) and nonWuhan group (close contacts or unknown exposure, 23 cases). The CT and laboratory findings were compared between and within groups during the clinical process. Results: : Fever (88.7%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (34%), and abnormal laboratory indicators, including lymphopenia, reduced albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), were mainly observed. Subpleural ground-glass opacities (86.8%) were usually detected at admission. The CT scores were highly correlated with lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G at initial and follow-ups (all p <0.05). Four days after admission, most patients (66.7% Wuhan, 47.8% nonWuhan) showed progression, and the CT scores of Wuhan significantly increased ( p =0.015). Eight days after admission, the vast majority of patients (69.2% Wuhan, 100% nonWuhan , p =0.006) presented improvement, and the CT scores of nonWuhan were significantly lower than Wuhan ( p =0.006).

Fourteen filter media types and eight combinations were evaluated for filtration efficiency, breathing resistance (pressure drop), and liquid penetration. Additional testing was conducted to evaluate two filter media disinfection methods in the event that the filters were reused in a hospital setting. Efficiency testing was conducted in accordance with the procedures established for approving an N95 FFR. One apparatus used a filter-holding device and another apparatus employed a manikin head to which the 3D-printed mask could be sealed. The filter media and combinations exhibited collection efficiencies varied between 3.9% and 98.8% when tested with a face velocity comparable to that of a standard N95 FFR at the 85 L min-1 used in the approval procedure. Breathing resistance varied between 10.8 to >637 Pa (1.1 to > 65 mm H2O). When applied to the 3D-printed mask efficiency decreased by an average of 13% and breathing resistance increased 4-fold as a result of the smaller surface area of the filter media when held in that mask compared to that of an N95 FFR.

METHODS: Four hundreds and thirty nine adult patients who are admitted through (June and July 2020) in Assiut and Aswan University Hospitals were included in the study. All participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Egyptian Ministry of Health guidance as definite case or Probable case. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done by (TaqMana? 2019-nCoV Control Kit v1 (Cat. No. A47532) supplied by QIAGEN, Germany on the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast RT PCR System, USA. RESULTS: Patients with comorbidities represented 61.7% of all cases. Constitutional symptoms especially myalgia and LRT symptoms such as dyspnea were significantly higher in patients with comorbidities (P < 0.05). Patients with comorbidities had significantly worse laboratory parameters. ICU admission was higher in patients with comorbidities (35.8%). Among different comorbidities 45.4% of CVD cases were admitted in ICU followed by DM cases (40.8%). Also, patients with comorbidities needed invasive mechanical ventilation more than those without comorbidity (31 vs. 10.7%, P<0.001). Significant lower frequency of recovery was found in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities (59% vs. 81%, P<0.001) and death rate was significantly higher in cases with comorbidities (P< 0.001). The survival rates in cases with pre-existing CVD and neurological diseases were lower than those without disease (P<0.002 and 0.001 respectively).

A total of 5 studies met criteria for inclusion and described dosing errors of antimicrobials, anesthetics, and paracetamol in overweight and obese pediatric patients. Two of the 5 studies compared medication errors in obese to nonobese children, and both found that medication errors (both over- and underdosing) were generally more common among obese children. The identified reasons for medication errors included incorrect dosing weight, incorrect dosing strategy, over- and underdosing with weight-based and flat-fixed dosing, and inapposite use of age-based dosing schemas.

Whole genome sequences from one positive farm were generated and genetic relatedness was established. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on a breeder farm with stock of 5,850 mink.

The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the 'forecast' package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models.

The early and NC1 viruses had KM91-like backgrounds, but the recurrent viruses had QX-like genomic backgrounds. The absence of pure QX-like viruses before the appearance of the early viruses suggests that the viruses were introduced from other countries after recombination, but the NC1 viruses originated in Korea. The recent prevalence of recurrent viruses with different genomic backgrounds and spike genes from the early and the NC1 viruses may indicate the repeated introduction of different infectious bronchitis viruses from other countries and their successful evasion of vaccine immunity in the field. Furthermore, a 1ab gene-based phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct lineages: North America-Europe, China/Taiwan, and China.

This work addresses the gap by introducing new machine learning software tools for high-throughput screening (Floodlight) and subsequent pattern analysis (Searchlight). A recursive workflow for chemical prioritization suitable for both manual curation and machine learning is introduced as a means of controlling the level of effort and equalizing sample loading while retaining key chemical signatures. Manual curation and machine learning were comparable with the mask materials clustering into three groups. The majority of the chemical signatures could be characterized by chemical class in seven categories: organophosphorus, long chain amides, polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, n-alkanes, olefins, branched alkanes and long-chain organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. The olefin, branched alkane, and organophosphorus components were primary contributors to clustering, with the other chemical classes having a significant degree of heterogeneity within the three clusters. Machine learning provided a means of rapidly extracting the key signatures of interest in agreement with the more traditional time-consuming and tedious manual curation process. Some identified signatures associated with plastics and flame retardants are potential toxins, warranting future study to understand the mask exposure route and potential health effects.","output":"Nontargeted Analysis of Face Masks: Comparison of Manual Curation to Automated GCxGC Processing Tools."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented public health challenge that is having a devastating economic impact on households. Using a sample of 230,540 respondents to an online survey from 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the study shows that the economic impacts are large and unequal: 45 percent of respondents report that a household member has lost their job and, among households owning small businesses, 59 percent of respondents report that a household member has closed their business. Among households with the lowest income prior to the pandemic, 71 percent report that a household member lost their job and 61 percent report that a household member has closed their business.

After initial return to work (RTW) following a work injury, many workers with permanent impairment face RTW interruption (breaks in ongoing employment due to reinjury, poor health, disability, lay-off, etc.). Most RTW and reinjury research has focused on worker-level risk factors, and less is known about contextual factors that may be amenable to workplace or workers' compensation (WC)-based interventions. The aim of this study was to identify modifiable organizational and psychosocial workplace factors associated with (i) RTW interruption and (ii) reinjury among workers with a permanent impairment. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included WC claims data and survey data for 567 injured workers who RTW at least briefly after a work-related injury that resulted in permanent impairment. Workers were interviewed once by phone, 11-15 months after WC claim closure with a PPD award. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between each workplace factor of interest and each outcome, controlling for whole body impairment percentage, gender, age, nativity, educational level, State Fund versus self-insured WC coverage, employer size, union membership, industry sector, and employment duration of current/most recent job. RESULTS Twelve percent of workers had been reinjured in their current or most recent job, 12% of workers were no longer working at the time of interview, and <1% of workers reported both outcomes. The most frequently reported reason for RTW interruption was impairment, disability, and/or pain from the previous work injury. Lower reported levels of safety climate, supervisor support, and ability to take time off work for personal/family matters were significantly associated with both RTW interruption and reinjury. Inadequate employer/health care provider communication, perceived stigmatization from supervisors and/or coworkers, and lower levels of coworker support were significantly associated with RTW interruption but not with reinjury. Discomfort with reporting an unsafe situation at work, absence of a health and safety committee, and higher job strain were significantly associated with reinjury, but not with RTW interruption. Inadequate safety training and lack of needed job accommodations were not significantly associated with either outcome. There were no notable or statistically significant interactions between workplace factors and degree of impairment, and no consistent direction of association. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that several potentially modifiable organizational and psychosocial factors are associated with safe and sustained RTW among injured workers with work-related permanent impairment. The lack of interaction between any of these workplace factors and degree of impairment suggests that these findings may be generalizable to all workers, and further suggests that workplace interventions based on these findings might be useful for both primary and secondary prevention. Though primary prevention is key, secondary prevention efforts to sustain RTW and prevent reinjury may reduce the considerable health, economic, and social burden of occupational injury and illness.","output":"Workplace Organizational and Psychosocial Factors Associated with Return-to-Work Interruption and Reinjury Among Workers with Permanent Impairment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This paper seeks to: provide an overview of the impacts of and responses to the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland; assess the vulnerability of the population living in rural areas to COVID-19; compare the health status of male farmers to underlying medical conditions frequently associated with those experiencing the worst impacts of the illness; and assess the implications of COVID-19 for farmers living alone and farm households with children.

Using available items from previous studies to derive a social frailty scale as guided by the Bunt social frailty theoretical framework, we aimed to examine the association of social frailty, independently of physical frailty, with salient outcomes of mood, nutrition, physical performance, physical activity, and lifeCspace mobility. We studied 229 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 67.22 years; 72.6% females) who were non-frail (defined by the FRAIL criteria). Using exploratory factor analysis, the resultant 8-item Social Frailty Scale (SFS-8) yielded a three-factor structure comprising social resources, social activities and financial resource, and social need fulfilment (score range: 0C8 points). Social non-frailty (SNF), social pre-frailty (SPF), and social frailty (SF) were defined based on optimal cutoffs, with corresponding prevalence of 63.8%, 28.8%, and 7.4%, respectively. In logistic regression adjusted for significant covariates and physical frailty (Modified Fried criteria), there is an association of SPF with poor physical performance and low physical activity (odds ratio, OR range: 3.10 to 6.22), and SF with depressive symptoms, malnutrition risk, poor physical performance, and low physical activity (OR range: 3.58 to 13.97) compared to SNF. There was no significant association of SPF or SF with lifeCspace mobility. In summary, through a theory-guided approach, our study demonstrates the independent association of social frailty with a comprehensive range of intermediary health outcomes in more robust older adults.

The Delphi method was adopted to determine the evaluation indices at all levels, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process was used to calculate the weights of the indices at all levels. Twenty experts from different medical fields were involved in the 2 rounds study. Altogether, 7 primary, 14 secondary, and 37 tertiary indices were included in the evaluation system.

Our study enriches scholarly understanding of this mass response by investigating both generic and pandemic-specific anxiety that explain preventive health behavior. METHODS: In our two-phase, mixed-methods study, pandemic-specific anxiety items elicited during the qualitative phase from March 2C8, 2020 were then tested in the quantitative phase from March 16C22, 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. or U.K. residents aged 18C65. RESULTS: Of the 1,400 participants, 52% met the criteria for moderate to severe anxiety. In addition to anxiety over possible personal COVID-19 infection, participants were also anxious about others health, others reactions (e.g., panic-buying, discrimination), societal problems (e.g., economic slowdown, healthcare system breakdown), and personal finances. The positive association between generic anxiety and hygiene practice frequency was explained by two interpersonal-oriented forms of pandemic-specific anxiety: anxiety over others health (b = 0?0040, 95% CI: 0?0031C0?0050) and others reactions (0?0031, 0?0021C0?0042). LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted with participants from developed countries at an early stage of the pandemic, and the results were not necessarily generalizable to developing countries or other stages of the pandemic. Also, hygiene practices was the sole behavior of interest, and the findings may differ for other behaviors.

However, few studies examined the most recent changes in PM(2.5) concentrations and questioned if the previous PM(2.5) declining trend was sustained or not. This study took a deep dive into the PM(2.5) trend for 136 northern cities of China from 2015 to early 2020 before the coronavirus disease 2019 (the COVID-19 hereafter) crisis, using ground-based PM(2.5) data notably adjusted for a key measurement method change. We find that mean PM(2.5) concentrations in northern China increased by 5.16 g/m(3) in 2019, offsetting 80% of the large reduction achieved in 2018. The rebound was more significant during the heating seasons (HS; Nov to next Mar) over the 2 years: 10.49 g/m(3) from the 2017 HS to the 2019 HS. A multiple linear regression analysis further revealed that anthropogenic factors contributed to around 50% of the PM(2.5) rebound in northern cities of China. Such a significant role of anthropogenic factors in driving the rebound was tightly linked to deep cuts in PM(2.5) concentrations in the previous year, systemic adjustment of policy targets and mitigation measures by the government, and the rising marginal cost of these measures. These findings suggest the need to chart a more sustainable path for future PM(2.5) emission reductions, with an emphasis on key regions during key pollution periods.

PatientCventilator asynchrony (PVA) occurs when ventilatory support does not match the needs of the patient and is associated with a series of adverse clinical outcomes. Deep learning methods have shown a strong discriminative ability for PVA detection, but they require a large number of annotated data for model training, which hampers their application to this task. We developed a transfer learning architecture based on pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and used it for PVA recognition based on small datasets. The one-dimensional signal was converted to a two-dimensional image, and features were extracted by the CNN using pretrained weights for classification. A partial dropping cross-validation technique was developed to evaluate model performance on small datasets. When using large datasets, the performance of the proposed method was similar to that of non-transfer learning methods. However, when the amount of data was reduced to 1%, the accuracy of transfer learning was approximately 90%, whereas the accuracy of the non-transfer learning was less than 80%. The findings suggest that the proposed transfer learning method can obtain satisfactory accuracies for PVA detection when using small datasets.

A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7, whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future.

Since then, Uganda has made great strides in palliative care development, including policy, education, and services implementation. This study provides an overview of the availability of palliative care services in the country and the challenges and gaps in Uganda prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic. This lays the foundation for better understanding the challenges and changes needed to support palliative care development and access in the wake of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive quantitative study of secondary data on nationwide morphine distribution, collated a list of accredited facilities, and analyzed key palliative care indicators collected through the mHealth surveillance project present at a subset of accredited facilities. Descriptive statistical analysis involved non-parametric tests using SPSS, mapping geographical distribution of available palliative care services using Geographic Information Systems software, and identification of challenges from the subset of accredited facilities. RESULTS: There were 226 accredited palliative care facilities across Ugandas 135 districts in 2020. Thirty districts lacked any accredited palliative care facility. The estimated population coverage was 88.5%. The majority (68.1%) of accredited facilities were public, and private facilities received slightly more pain-relieving morphine. There was an alternating trend in the volumes of morphine delivered to public and private facilities. More than a third of the patients were diagnosed with non-communicable diseases, highlighting their significance alongside cancer and HIV/AIDS as conditions requiring palliative care. Palliative care accredited facilities offered six types of services: outreach, home visits, psychosocial, legal, bereavement, and spiritual support, but only for an average of 7 months a year due to lack of facilitation and transportation. CONCLUSION: Palliative care in Uganda developed in quality, volume, and geographic coverage since 2009. The shift in palliative care patients primary diagnosis from HIV/AIDS to non-communicable diseases marks an important epidemiologic transition. Although accredited facilities are present in most administrative districts, more research is needed to evaluate the actual accessibility of these services. The existing services, both private and public, are limited by the amount of pain-relieving morphine, financial and transport resources. More quality data collected on key palliative care indicators is needed into geographical accessibility of palliative care services, morphine availability trends, and patient diagnoses in order to improve the provision of palliative care in Uganda.

This study investigates the effects of delayed colorectal cancer treatments during the COVID pandemic on disease progression. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 107 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer was conducted. The occurrence of cancer upstaging after initial diagnosis was assessed and compared between patients with treatment delays and patients who received treatments within the period recommended by NHS guidelines. A logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between treatment delays beyond 62 days and cancer upstaging. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 71.2 years and 64.5% of the patients were over 65 years. Treatment delays were observed in 53.3% of reviewed patients. Patients with treatment delays received cancer treatments 95.8 (31.0) days on average after referral, compared to 46.3 (11.5) days in patients who experienced no treatment delays (p-value<0.0001). 38.6% of patients with treatment delays experienced cancer upstaging by the time of treatment, compared to 20% in the non-delay group (p-value = 0.036). Patients who received treatment after sixty two days from date of referral were 3.27 times more likely to experience colorectal cancer upstaging compared to those who received timely treatments. CONCLUSION: Although an effective response to the Covid-19 pandemic requires the reallocation of healthcare resources, there is a need to ensure that treatments and health outcomes of patients with chronic diseases such as colorectal cancer continue to be prioritized and delivered in timely fashion.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer patients at an NHS Foundation Trust hospital-A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A dysregulated immune response plays a critical role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis.

This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals performance. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income ([]1500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives for this study were to (1) evaluate the effectiveness and cost of using social media news feed advertisements, a clinic-based approach method, and web-based snowball sampling to reach inadequately active adults with T1D and (2) compare characteristics of enrollees against normative data. METHODS: Participants were recruited between November 2019 and August 2020. In method #1, Facebook and Instagram news feed advertisements ran for five 1-to-8-day windows targeting adults (18 to 64 years old) in the greater New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut, areas with one or more diabetes-related profile interest. If interested, participants completed a webform so that the research team could contact them for eligibility screening. In method #2, patients 18 to 24 years old with T1D were approached in person at clinical visits in November and December 2019. Those who were interested immediately completed eligibility screening. Older patients could not be approached due to clinic restrictions. In method #3, snowball sampling was conducted by physically active individuals with T1D contacting their peers on Facebook and via email for 48 days, with details to contact the research staff to express interest and complete eligibility screening. Other methods referred participants to the study similarly to snowball sampling. RESULTS: In method #1, advertisements were displayed to 11,738 unique viewers and attracted 274 clickers (2.33%); 20 participants from this group (7.3%) volunteered, of whom 8 (40%) were eligible. Costs averaged US $1.20 per click and US $95.88 per eligible volunteer. Men had lower click rates than women (1.71% vs 3.17%; P<.001), but their responsiveness and eligibility rates did not differ. In method #2, we approached 40 patients; 32 of these patients (80%) inquired about the study, of whom 20 (63%) volunteered, and 2 of these volunteers (10%) were eligible. Costs including personnel for in-person approaches averaged US $21.01 per inquirer and US $479.79 per eligible volunteer. In method #3, snowball sampling generated 13 inquirers; 12 of these inquirers (92%) volunteered, of whom 8 (67%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible, and total costs averaged US $20.59 per eligible volunteer. Other methods yielded 7 inquirers; 5 of these inquirers (71%) volunteered, of whom 2 (40%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible, and total costs averaged US $34.94 per eligible volunteer. Demographic overrepresentations emerged in the overall cohort (ie, optimal glycemic control, obesity, and low exercise), among those recruited by news feed advertisements (ie, obesity and older age), and among those recruited by snowball sampling (ie, optimal glycemic control and low exercise). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based advertising and recruitment strategies are a promising means to attract adults with T1D to clinical trials and exercise interventions, with costs comparing favorably to prior trials despite targeting an uncommon condition (ie, T1D) and commitment to an intervention. These strategies should be tailored in future studies to increase access to higher-risk participants.

In this paper, we describe some problems that empirical bioethics researchers may face; these problems are related to a tension between the different poles on the spectrum of scientific paradigms, namely a positivist and interpretive stance. We explore the ideas of narrative construction, 'genres' in medicine and dominant discourses in relation to empirical research. We also reflect on the loss of depth and context that may occur with thematic or content analyses of interviews, and discuss the need for transparency about methodologies in empirical bioethics. Drawing on insights from narrative approaches in the social sciences and the clinical-educational discipline of Narrative Medicine, we further clarify these problems and suggest a narrative approach to qualitative interviewing in empirical bioethics that enables researchers to 'listen (and read) in new ways'. We then show how this approach was applied in the first author's research project about euthanasia decision-making. In addition, we stress the important ethical task of scrutinizing methodologies and meta-ethical standpoints, as they inevitably impact empirical outcomes and corresponding ethical judgments. Finally, we raise the question whether a 'diagnostic', rather than a 'problem-solving', mindset could and should be foregrounded in empirical ethics, albeit without losing a commitment to ethics' normative task, and suggest further avenues for theorizing about listening and epistemic (in)justice in relation to empirical (bio)ethics.","output":"Developing new ways to listen: the value of narrative approaches in empirical (bio)ethics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We recently published an article in the Journal of Chemical Education on VSEPR model kits for helping teach molecular geometry.

Here, we show that Brucella, the causative agent of brucellosis, the most prevalent bacterial zoonosis globally, subverts this immune defense pathway by activating regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of Bloc1s1 mRNA encoding BLOS1, a protein that promotes endosomeClysosome fusion. RIDD-deficient cells and mice harboring a RIDD-incompetent variant of IRE1 were resistant to infection. Inactivation of the Bloc1s1 gene impaired the ability to assemble BLOC-1-related complex (BORC), resulting in differential recruitment of BORC-related lysosome trafficking components, perinuclear trafficking of Brucella-containing vacuoles (BCVs), and enhanced susceptibility to infection. The RIDD-resistant Bloc1s1 variant maintains the integrity of BORC and a higher-level association of BORC-related components that promote centrifugal lysosome trafficking, resulting in enhanced BCV peripheral trafficking and lysosomal destruction, and resistance to infection. These findings demonstrate that host RIDD activity on BLOS1 regulates Brucella intracellular parasitism by disrupting BORC-directed lysosomal trafficking. Notably, coronavirus murine hepatitis virus also subverted the RIDDCBLOS1 axis to promote intracellular replication. Our work establishes BLOS1 as a novel immune defense factor whose activity is hijacked by diverse pathogens.","output":"Brucella activates the host RIDD pathway to subvert BLOS1-directed immune defense"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Hispanic/Latino population is the second largest racial/ethnic group in the continental United States and Hawaii, accounting for 18% (60.6 million) of the total population. An additional 3 million Hispanic Americans live in Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanic individuals in the United States using the most recent population-based data. An estimated 176,600 new cancer cases and 46,500 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanic individuals in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2021. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Hispanic men and women had 25%-30% lower incidence (2014-2018) and mortality (2015-2019) rates for all cancers combined and lower rates for the most common cancers, although this gap is diminishing. For example, the colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rate ratio for Hispanic compared with NHW individuals narrowed from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.78) in 1995 to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93) in 2018, reflecting delayed declines in CRC rates among Hispanic individuals in part because of slower uptake of screening. In contrast, Hispanic individuals have higher rates of infection-related cancers, including approximately two-fold higher incidence of liver and stomach cancer. Cervical cancer incidence is 32% higher among Hispanic women in the continental US and Hawaii and 78% higher among women in Puerto Rico compared to NHW women, yet is largely preventable through screening. Less access to care may be similarly reflected in the low prevalence of localized-stage breast cancer among Hispanic women, 59% versus 67% among NHW women. Evidence-based strategies for decreasing the cancer burden among the Hispanic population include the use of culturally appropriate lay health advisors and patient navigators and targeted, community-based intervention programs to facilitate access to screening and promote healthy behaviors.

Methods: Included were T1 and T2 breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes marked with carbon who were referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a surgery. Axillary dissection was performed only in the patients with residual axillary disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy on ultrasound or with metastases described in the sentinel or tattooed lymph nodes either intraoperatively or in the final histology. Results: Out of 62 initially included node-positive patients, 15 (24%) were spared axillary dissection. The detection rate of tattooed lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 81%. The ypN0 patients were identified with 91% sensitivity and 38% specificity using ultrasound and intraoperative assessment of both sentinel and tattooed lymph node according to the final histology. Discussion/Conclusion: Lymph node marking with carbon dye is a useful and cost-effective method, which can be successfully implemented in order to reduce the number of patients undergoing axillary dissection.

Therefore, this study combines three key factors related to active aging: environment, health and mobility, and assumes that the elderly with good health status will have environmental proactivity and a wider range of daily mobility in a poor rural built environment. This study attempts to track daily mobility by using a spaceCtime path method in time geography and then to explore the relationship between outdoor mobility and older peoples self-rated health. A 1-week mobility path survey for 20 senior citizens of Xishi Village, a typical rural village in Taiwan, was conducted by wearing a GPS sports watch.

The results show that when the built environment is unfit to the needs of daily activities, half of the participants can make adjustment strategies to go beyond the neighborhoods defined by administrative units. Correlation analysis demonstrated that mental health is associated with daily moving time and distance. In addition, men have higher self-rated health scores than women, and there are significant statistical differences between married and widowed seniors in daily outing time and distance.

This process takes advantage of the crystal structure and relative difference in etching rates between the (100) and (111) planes such that we can produce parts that have surface errors<{\\\\lambda}/4. Previous measurements indicate that chemical etching can yield a final etched blaze that slightly differs from the orientation of the (111) plane. This difference can be corrected by the mechanical mount in the case of the immersion gratings, but doing so may compromise grating throughput due to shadowing. In the case of the grisms, failure to take the actual blaze into account will reduce the brightness of the undeviated ray. We report on multiple techniques to precisely measure the blaze of our in-house fabricated immersion gratings. The first method uses a scanning electron microscope to image the blaze profile, which yields a measurement precision of 0.5 degrees. The second method is an optical method of measuring the angle between blaze faces using a rotation stage, which yields a measurement precision of 0.2 degrees. Finally, we describe a theoretical blaze function modeling method, which we expect to yield a measurement precision of 0.1 degrees.

Some patients also experience neurological signs and symptoms ranging from anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, and vomiting to confusion, encephalitis, and stroke. Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies. Most CA patients burdened by progressive neurologic deficits have substantially impaired mobility and other essential functions, for which they rely heavily on ambulatory services, including rehabilitation and psychosocial care. Cessation of these interventions because of isolation restrictions places the CA patient population at risk of further deterioration. This international panel of ataxia experts provides recommendations for neurologists caring for patients with CA, emphasizing a pro-active approach designed to maintain their autonomy and well-being: continue long-term medications, promote rehabilitation efforts, utilize the technology of virtual visits for regular contact with healthcare providers, and pay attention to emotional and psychosocial health. Neurologists should play an active role in decision-making in those CA cases requiring escalation to intensive care and resuscitation.

The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Further, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the vicinity.

One promising though underused approach is to increase the information by borrowing external data on control and/or on treatment effect, which is almost always available. However, the objectives and extent of use of such external data differ widely across studies. They may be dedicated to extrapolate from different populations (from adults to children, across geographic regions, etc.) or treatments. They may adaptively apply during an ongoing trial or be only used at the time of analysis of a trial after study enrollment is closed. They can use only outcome data from a historical control group for either a complete or partial replacement of the current control arm, or focusing on estimated treatment benefit from a whole historical sample. They make various assumptions regarding the exchangeability or commensality of the historical and current populations, with various diagnostics for checking those assumptions. Finally, they use either a frequentist or Bayesian inference, based on aggregated data or requiring individual patient data (IPD). Notably, borrowing of external data often uses Bayesian approaches, by modelling external information into a prior, with increasing complexity to face heterogeneity across populations. Similar frequentist methods based on weighted tests or joint models, have also been proposed, as well as hierarchical models, either Bayesian or frequentist, similar to a meta-analysis setting.

In a population-based prospective cohort study, from foetal life onwards, we constructed reference curves for kidney growth from the third trimester of pregnancy until early childhood, using data from 1,158 healthy children. Kidney size, defined as length, width, depth and volume, was measured in the third trimester of pregnancy and at the postnatal ages of 6 months and 24 months. Analyses were based on more than 2,500 kidney measurements. In the third trimester of pregnancy and at 6 months of age all kidney measurements were larger in boys than in girls. At 24 months of age, these gender differences were only significant for left kidney structures and right kidney length. Both groups showed trends towards smaller left kidney measurements than right kidney measurements at all ages. Gender-specific reference curves based on post-conceptional and postnatal ages were constructed for left and right kidney length, width, depth and volume. We concluded that kidney size is influenced by age and gender. Left kidney size tended to be smaller than right kidney size, except for kidney length.

Herein, using a mouse model of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection, we report that a single day of food restriction (FR) markedly increases susceptibility to attenuated enterovirus infection, replication, and disease. These \\"pro-viral\\" effects, which are rapidly-reversed by the restoration of food, are mediated by several genes whose expression is altered by FR, and which support CVB3 replication. Central to this is TFEB, a protein whose expression and activation status are rapidly increased by FR. TFEB, which regulates the transcription of >100 genes involved in macroautophagy/autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, responds similarly to both FR and CVB3 infection and plays a pivotal role in determining host susceptibility to CVB3. We propose that, by upregulating TFEB, FR generates an intracellular environment that is more hospitable to the incoming virus, facilitating its replication. This interplay between nutritional status and enterovirus replication has implications for human health and, perhaps, for the evolution of these viruses.Abbreviations: Atg/ATG: autophagy-related; CAR: Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor; Cas9: CRISPR associated protein 9; Cre: recombinase that causes recombination; CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; Ctsb/CTSB: cathepsin B; CVB3: coxsackievirus B3; DsRedCVB3: a recombinant CVB3 that encodes the Discosoma red fluorescent protein; EL: elastase; FR: food restriction; GFP: green fluorescent protein; gRNA: guide RNA; HBSS: Hanks Buffered Salt Solution; LYNUS: lysosomal nutrient sensing machinery; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; MOI: multiplicity of infection; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; Nluc: nanoluciferase; NlucCVB3: a recombinant CVB3 encoding nanoluciferase; pfu: plaque-forming unit(s); p.i.: post infection; rCVB: recombinant coxsackievirus B3; RPS6KB/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase; RT: room temperature; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TFEB: transcription factor EB; tg: transgenic; TUBB: -tubulin; UNINF: uninfected; wrt: with respect to; WT: wild type.","output":"A food-responsive switch modulates TFEB and autophagy, and determines susceptibility to coxsackievirus infection and pancreatitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Up to 20% of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) will progress to blast phase (MPN-BP). Outcomes are dismal, with intensive chemotherapy providing little benefit. Low-intensity therapy is preferred due to better tolerability, but the prognosis remains poor. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) is still the only potential for long term survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS To better evaluate the initial treatment approach in MPN-BP, we performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of 75 patients with MPN-BP treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between 2001 and 2021. Patients were stratified by initial treatment: best supportive care (BSC), hypomethylating agent (HMA)-based therapy or intensive chemotherapy (IC). RESULTS Median overall survival (mOS) for the entire cohort was 4.8 months (BSC 0.8 months, HMA 4.7 months, and IC 11.4 months). Among IC patients, improved survival was evident in those that received AHSCT (mOS 40.8 months vs. 4.9 months, p < .01). Most patients that underwent AHSCT were initially treated with IC (p < .01). All patients that underwent AHSCT had achieved complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with improved survival were receipt of therapy (HMA or IC) (P = .017), CR/CRi (P = .037) and receipt of AHSCT (p < .001). CONCLUSION We show that active treatment with IC improves survival, but it is mostly tied to receipt of AHSCT. IC is a reasonable approach in appropriate patients as it can provide an effective bridge to AHSCT.

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients due to their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and their direct antiviral ability against viruses including coronaviruses, respectively. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE and MedRxiv was conducted by three investigators from inception until July 30th 2020 and included any study type that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with Janus kinase-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clearly indicated risk estimates or those that permitted their back-calculation. Outcomes were synthesized using RevMan. RESULTS: Of 733 searched studies, we included four randomized and eleven non-randomized trials. Five of the studies were unpublished. Those who received Janus kinase-inhibitor had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39, p< 0.001) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26, p< 0.001), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95% CI, 10.68-48.54, p< 0.00001) when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.85, p< 0.05), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.00-3.59, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Janus kinase-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes in terms of mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes in regard to mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional well-conducted RCTs are needed to further elucidate the relationship between clinical outcomes and Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons in COVID-19 patients.","output":"JAK-inhibitor and type I interferon ability to produce favorable clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining wide acceptance as a single surgical treatment for obesity.

Among sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia is one of the countries that face an HIV/AIDS epidemic with an estimated 90,000 HIV-positive pregnant women, 14,000 HIV-positive births, 800,000 AIDS orphans, and 28,000 AIDS deaths annually. Thus, this study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of pregnant women towards the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dil Chora Referral Hospital among 242 pregnant women. The simple random sampling method was used to collect the data and respondents were interviewed face to face by using a standard and structured questionnaire. The quality of the data was assured by questionnaire pretesting, translation, and retranslation. After the collection of the data, each questionnaire was thoroughly reviewed for consistency, and completeness by the data collectors, supervisor, and investigators. Then, the data were inserted into Epi Info v3.5 and analyzed using SPSS v24. Descriptive statistics were employed to examine the findings, and the result was presented using tables, charts, and graphs. RESULTS: Two-third (66.7%) of the pregnant women had good knowledge and the remaining one-third (33.3%) had poor knowledge towards mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS and its prevention.

Methods COV-BARRIER (NCT04421027) was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and elevation of  1 serum inflammatory marker. In this newly completed substudy, enrolled participants (not previously reported) from 4 countries on IMV or ECMO at study entry were randomly assigned 1:1 to once-daily BARI 4-mg or placebo (PBO) for up to 14 days plus standard of care (SOC), which included baseline systemic corticosteroid use in 86% of patients. The prespecified exploratory endpoints included all-cause mortality and number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) through Day 28. Results Characteristics for 101 participants are shown in Table 1. Treatment with BARI significantly reduced all-cause mortality by Day 28 compared to PBO [39.2% vs 58.0%, respectively;hazard ratio (HR) = 0.54 (95%CI 0.31, 0.96), p=0.030, relative risk (RR) = 0.68 (95%CI 0.45, 1.02);Figure 1A]. One additional death was prevented for every six BARI-treated patients. Significant reduction in mortality was also observed by Day 60 [45.1% vs 62.0%;HR = 0.56 (95%CI 0.33, 0.97), p=0.027, RR = 0.73 (95%CI 0.50, 1.06);Figure 1B]. Patients treated with BARI showed a numerical reduction in the duration of IMV and duration of hospitalization vs PBO and more BARI treated patients recovered (Table 2). No new safety findings were observed (Table 2). Conclusion Treatment with BARI+SOC (corticosteroids) resulted in an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 19% at Day 28 and 17% at Day 60 in patients with COVID-19 who were on IMV or ECMO at enrollment. These results are consistent with the reduction in mortality observed in the less severely ill hospitalized patients in the primary COV-BARRIER study population. Disclosures E.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID admitted to an academic medical center from 2017 to 2020 for an invasive injection-related infection. Standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the effects of COVID-19 on participants. RESULTS: Among the 30 PWID interview participants, 14 reported barriers to accessing health and addiction services due to COVID-19. As facilities decreased appointment availability or transitioned to telemedicine, PWID reported being unable to access services. Social distancing led to isolation or loneliness during hospital stays and in the community. Recovery meetings and support groups, critical to addiction recovery, were particularly affected. Other participants reported that uncertainty and fear of contracting the virus generated changes in behavior that led them to avoid seeking services. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has disrupted health systems and social services, leading PWID to experience unprecedented barriers to accessing and maintaining health and addiction services in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

FINDINGS: The emerged dignifying and undignifying aspects of formal and informal care are characterised by either a successful or unsuccessful process of adjustment towards changing abilities, preferences and care needs of people with dementia. Three themes appeared as undignifying aspects of care: 'Stigmatisation and objectivation', 'Scarcity and hastiness' and 'Impending estrangement and misunderstanding'. Four themes were identified as dignifying aspect of care: 'Personalisation', 'Respect, attentiveness and encouragement', 'Attention for physical care and bodily gestures', and 'Foster belonging'.

SCAD has been mostly studied in the West, with little recognition in Asia leading to under-diagnosis and under-representation. In this review, we highlight two distinct cases occurring at our center in Singapore, affecting two Singaporean women of Malay and Chinese descent. These 2 cases highlight that pregnancy-associated SCAD is neither the most common nor only manifestation of SCAD. Through review of the literature, we emphasize the heterogeneity in case presentation paying particular attention to SCAD and its association with connective tissue disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia. SCAD remains a diagnostic challenge for many cardiologists, here we shed light and dispel myths surrounding coronary angiography and review the use of intracoronary imaging. The successful treatment of this unique group of patients requires a high index of suspicion, and management within a multidisciplinary team. The development of a recovery program with access to support groups, allied health, and cardiac rehabilitation is paramount in improving outcomes for these patients in the long term. Further research and studies in our Asian population will help to enhance our understanding of this disease and develop practices to best manage our patients.","output":"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: clinical implications and diagnostic challenges.

However, the evidence to support such transport infrastructure modifications is unclear. Previous studies on public transport use and elderly health were mostly observational studies using cross-sectional data. Few studies have examined the before-and-after effects of a new metro, for example, to see if it leads to improved elderly health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a new metro line in Hong Kong as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the metro-led public transport intervention on elderly health. In Hong Kong, more than 90% of daily travels are made by public transport. The public transport modifications consist of the new metro line with eight stations and changes in the walking environment and bus services around the stations. We will look at the before-and-after differences in public transport use and health outcomes between elderly participants living in treatment neighbourhoods (400 m walking buffered areas of the new metro stations) and in control groups (living in comparable areas but unaffected by the new metro). Questionnaire-based baseline data were collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, while some qualitative interviews are ongoing. Amid the pandemic, we conducted a quick telephone-based survey of COVID-19's potential impact on public transport use behaviours of our elderly cohort in September 2020. Note there is no lockdown in Hong Kong until the writing of the paper (January 2021). After the new metro opens, we will conduct a follow-up survey, tentatively in late 2022. We aim to investigate if the new metro and the associated changes in the built environment have any effects on public transport use behaviours, physical activity and wider health outcomes among the elderly (eg, social inclusion, quality of life, subjective well-being). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong reviewed and approved the study procedures and materials (reference number: EA1710040).

Lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes are usually the sites that are most frequently affected, but no organ is spared and CS can affect a variable portion of SA patients, up to 25% from post-mortem studies. The cardiovascular involvement is usually associated with a bad prognosis and is responsible for the major cause of death and complications, particularly in African American patients. Furthermore, the diagnosis is often complicated by the occurrence of non-specific clinical manifestations, which can mimic the effect of more common heart disorders, and imaging and biopsies are the most valid approach to avoid misdiagnosis. This narrative review summarizes the main clinical features of CS and imaging findings, particularly of CMR and 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET) that can give the best cost/benefit ratio in terms of the diagnostic approach. Imaging can be very useful in replacing the endomyocardial biopsy in selected cases, to avoid unnecessary, and potentially dangerous, invasive maneuvers.","output":"Clinical features and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a lateral flow assay (LFA) for the quantitative, fluorescence-based detection of the kidney biomarker cystatin C that features conjugates of capture antibodies and fusions of carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) with ZZ domains anchored on cellulose deposited over nitrocellulose (NC).

RESULTS: Anxiety (45.82%) and depression (50.88%) in this sample were prevalent and directly linked to COVID-19 pandemic environment. Adjusted for gender identity, age, migrant status, region, education and level of socioeconomic status, our final model showed significant positive associations between relationships of (1) COVID-19 pandemic environment and socioeconomic loss impact (?=0.62, p<0.001), (2) socioeconomic loss impact and reduction in gender affirming services (?=0.24, p<0.05) and (3) reduction in gender affirming services and poor mental health (?=0.19, p<0.05). Moreover, socioeconomic loss impact and reduction in gender affirming services were found to be partial mediators in this model.

To define the EDI trigger, a previous dataset of 10,000 simulated FMD outbreaks in New Zealand, controlled by the standard stamping-out approach, was re-analysed at various time points between days 11-35 of each response to find threshold values of cumulative detected infected premises (IPs) that indicated upper quartile sized outbreaks and estimated dissemination rate (EDR) values that indicated sustained spread. Both sets of thresholds were then parameterised within the InterSpread Plus modelling framework, such that if either the cumulative IPs or the EDR exceeded the defined thresholds, the EDI trigger would fire. A new series of simulations were then generated. The EDI trigger was like two diagnostic tests interpreted in parallel, with the diagnostic outcome positive if either test was positive at any time point between days 11-35 inclusive. The diagnostic result was then compared to the final size of each outbreak, to see if the outbreak was an upper quartile outbreak in terms of cumulative IPs and / or final duration. The performance of the EDI trigger was then evaluated across the population of outbreaks, and the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) calculated. The Se, Sp, PPV and NPV for predicting large outbreaks were 0.997, 0.513, 0.404 and 0.998 respectively. The study showed that the EDI trigger was very sensitive to detecting large outbreaks, although not all outbreaks predicted to be large were so, whereas outbreaks predicted to be small invariably were small.

In the present work, the degradation mechanisms of OH-initiated reactions of isoproturon were studied at the MPWB1K/6-311+G(3df, 2p)//MPWB1K/6-31+G(d, p) level. The calculation results display that H-atom abstraction, OH addition, and OH substitution pathways are found for OH and isoproturon reactions. For H-atom abstractions, the results show that aliphatic H atoms are more easily abstracted by OH than the aromatic H atoms, and the pathway R6 has the lowest energy barrier of 6.65 kcal mol-1, indicating that H in the -CH3 group attached to the N2 atom could be most favorably abstracted. Six pathways for OH addition to the six sites of the phenyl ring are identified with low energy barriers, which are in good accordance with the fact that the additions of OH to the phenyl ring were the important steps from experimental results. For OH substitution reactions, two pathways with high activation energies are found, and the corresponding products have been also detected from previous experimental studies, suggesting that the substitution reactions could also occur.","output":"The theoretical investigation of OH-induced degradation mechanisms of isoproturon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Terrorism has dominated the domestic and international landscape since 9/11.

RECENT FINDINGS A range of imaging techniques is available for evaluation of patients with aortic disease. Magnetic resonance blood flow imaging can identify atherosclerosis prone aortic regions and may be useful for predicting aneurysm growth. Computational modeling can demonstrate significant differences in wall stress between abdominal aortic aneurysms of similar size and may better predict rupture than diameter alone. Metabolic imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET [(FDG)-PET] can identify focal aortic wall inflammation that may portend rapid progression of disease. Molecular imaging with probes that target collagen and elastin can directly exhibit changes in the vessel wall associated with disease.

Colon is thought to be the first organ suffering from inflammation under HFD conditions due to the pro-inflammatory macrophages infiltration, however, the mechanisms concerning the induction of pro-inflammatory phenotype of colonic macrophages remains unclear. In this study, we show that HFD increased the percentage of gram-positive bacteria, especially genus Clostridium, and resulted in the significant increment of fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut microbial metabolite produced by bacteria mainly restricted to genus Clostridium. Notably, reducing gram-positive bacteria with vancomycin diminished fecal DCA and profoundly alleviated pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration in colon, whereas DCA-supplemented feedings to vancomycin-treated mice provoked obvious pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and colonic inflammation. Meanwhile, intra-peritoneal administration of DCA also elicited considerable recruitment of macrophages with pro-inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, DCA dose-dependently promoted M1 macrophage polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at least partially through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) transactivated by M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2-mAchR)/Src pathway. In addition, M2-mAchR mediated increase of TLR2 transcription was mainly achieved via targeting AP-1 transcription factor. Moreover, NF-B/ERK/JNK signalings downstream of TLR2 are involved in the DCA-induced macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our findings revealed that high level DCA induced by HFD may serve as an initiator to activate macrophages and drive colonic inflammation, thus offer a mechanistic basis that modulation of gut microbiota or intervening specific bile acid receptor signaling could be potential therapeutic approaches for HFD-related inflammatory diseases.","output":"Gut microbial bile acid metabolite skews macrophage polarization and contributes to high-fat diet-induced colonic inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People have needed mental health services more and more during Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic Due to the contagious nature of the COVID-19 virus, online counseling has been preferred more during the COVID-19 pandemic Those who need such mental health services might take actions to seek help by demanding psychological assistance from psychological counselors or mental health institutions However, these people might avoid seeking and receiving such help when they think that they have a weak personality or they somehow will be criticized by the society or experience social stigma because they seek psychological help This study aims to examine the mediating role of self-disclosure between attitudes towards online counselling and perception of social stigma due to receiving psychological help Participants of the study consist of 519 adults who live in Turkey and are older than 18 years old The data for the study were collected through Distress Disclosure Index, Online Counseling Attitudes Scale (OCAS), Stigma Scale for Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH) and Personal Information Form The hypothetical model developed in order to determine whether self-disclosure mediates in the relationship between perception of social stigma due to receiving psychological help and online psychological counselling attitudes was tested through SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) The results of the study revealed that self-disclosure play partial mediating role between perception of social stigma and value of online counselling and discomfort with online counselling ? 2021 The Author(s) Open Access - This article is under the CC BY license (https://creativecommons org/licenses/by/4 0/)","output":"Mediating role of self-disclosure in the relationship between attitudes towards online counselling and perception of social stigma due to receiving psychological help"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of testing procedures for comparing two coefficients of variation (CVs) of independent populations is not extensively explored in the Bayesian context.

Methods Electronic database were searched to identify all original articles and case reports presenting chest CT features for adult patients with COVID-19, SARS and MERS pneumonia respectively. Quality of literature and completeness of presented data were evaluated by consensus reached by three radiologists. Vote-counting method was employed to include cases of each group. Data of patients' manifestations in early chest CT including lesion patterns, distribution of lesions and specific imaging signs for the three groups were extracted and recorded. Data were compared and analyzed using SPSS 22.0. Results A total of 24 studies were included, composing of 10 studies of COVED-19, 5 studies of MERS and 9 studies of SARS. The included CT exams were 147, 40, and 122 respectively. For the early CT features of the 3 pneumonias, the basic lesion pattern with respect to mixed ground glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation, GGO mainly, or consolidation mainly was similar among the 3 groups ( 2 = 7.966, p > 0.05). There were no significant differences on the lesion distribution ( 2 = 13.053, p > 0.05) and predominate involvement of the subpleural area of bilateral lower lobes ( 2 = 4.809, p > 0.05) among the 3 groups.

METHODS Multicenter nationwide cohort study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1 to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics, occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included. Median age was 50.4 [40.6-62.9] years, 16 (45.7%) were female, and 80% were double-LT recipients. Infection was community-acquired in 25 (71.4%). Thirty-one (88.6%) required hospitalization, including 13 (41.9%) in the intensive care unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and diarrhea, present in 71.4%, 54.3%, and 31.4% of cases, respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to severe in 51.4% of cases. Among the 13 critically ill patients, 7 (53.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Thrombotic events occurred in 4 patients.

Soil acidobacteria have been reported to present a variety of strategies for their success in terrestrial environments. However, owing to lack of pure culture, information on animal-associated acidobacteria are limited, except for those obtained from 16S rRNA genes. To date, only two acidobacteria have been isolated from animals, namely strain M133T obtained from coral Porites lutea and Acanthopleuribacter pedis KCTC 12899T isolated from chiton. Genomics and physiological characteristics of strain M133T and A. pedis KCTC 12899T were compared with 19 other isolates (one strain from each genus) in the phylum Acidobacteria. The results revealed that strain M133T represents a new species in a new genus in the family Acanthopleuribacteraceae. To date, these two Acanthopleuribacteraceae isolates have the largest genomes (10.85-11.79 Mb) in the phylum Acidobacteria. Horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication influenced the structure and plasticity of these large genomes. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction and abundant secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (including eicosapentaenoic acid de novo biosynthesis) are two distinct features of the Acanthopleuribacteraceae bacteria in the phylum Acidobacteria. The absence of glycoside hydrolases involved in plant polysaccharide degradation and presence of animal disease-related peptidases indicate that these bacteria have evolved to adapt to the animal hosts. In addition to low- and high-affinity respiratory oxygen reductases, enzymes for nitrate to nitrogen, and sulfhydrogenase were also detected in strain M133T, suggesting the capacity and flexibility to grow in aerobic and anaerobic environments.

Here we show that only 0.26% of alternative codes with the block structure of the standard genetic code perform at least as well as the standard code in this property. Considering this finding within a code optimality framework suggests that this consistent effect size across the different frames may be adaptive. Here we give context for this finding and present a simple model where a trade-off between evolvability and robustness leads to an average mutation effect size which maximises population fitness.

A result of the pandemic has been the introduction of delays in the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer which are strongly associated with inferior oncologic outcomes. Efforts to minimize these delays are therefore a high priority in this patient population. Here, we report the results from one particular intervention taken at our institution - the formation of a multidisciplinary clinic (MDC) - on treatment times. Materials/Methods In July 2020, our institution initiated a pilot program establishing a MDC combining otolaryngology and radiation oncology visits. Clinics were held on a half-day every two weeks and consisted of both new patient consults and follow-up patients who had received radiation as part of their treatment course. We measured and compared treatment package time of the MDC patients with those seen at our institution in the standard clinic setting. Results A total of 25 new patients requiring radiation were seen in our MDC between 7/31/2020 and 9/3/2021. This included 8 patients who underwent definitive radiation, 12 patients who underwent adjuvant radiation, and 5 patients who underwent palliative radiation. A total of 54 patients received radiation through standard clinics during this time frame, with 21 definitive cases, 28 adjuvant cases, and 5 palliative cases. There was no difference in median radiotherapy duration between the patients seen in MDC vs standard clinics (41 vs 41 days, p = NS). In comparison, however, the patients seen in MDC started adjuvant radiotherapy sooner (median 34 vs 41.5 days, p=0.002) and had a more compact treatment package times (median 76.5 vs 84.5 days, p=0.002). Three patients in the standard clinics cohort had treatment package times exceeding 100 days while no patient seen in MDC had a treatment package time exceeding 84 days. Conclusion Despite the many challenges associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we found that patients seen in our MDC setting maintained timely treatment package times that were significantly better than those seen in our standard clinics. This is potentially due to the identification of patients likely to require adjuvant radiotherapy earlier in their clinical presentation. This in turn allowed for more advanced planning and minimization of delays in initiation of adjuvant radiotherapy. While previous studies have demonstrated improved oncologic outcomes when head and neck multispecialty care is delivered at tertiary care facilities, we found a further improvement in care delivery with colocalization of clinic visits by the treatment team.","output":"The Impact of Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Clinic on Treatment Package Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single Institutional Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the key issues in the field of technology analysis and innovation management is how new technologies origin and evolve in the presence of environmental threats.

Testing results, medication use, and comorbidities were obtained from the medical record. Following a comparison of different propensity score weighting methods, overlap propensity score weighting was used to analyze the association between medication use and COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 928 patients, of which 12% tested positive. The majority (66%) of patients had a history of chronic pulmonary diseases. There was no significant association between inhaled corticosteroid use and testing positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroid use was associated with a lower odds ratio (0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99) of testing positive for COVID-19. Similar results were noted when the analysis was restricted to those with any chronic pulmonary diseases, with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

As trans individuals may be multiply marginalized, it is necessary to examine within group differences among trans individuals of different genders, races, socioeconomic statuses, and abilities. This study examines the following research questions: (1) What is the quality of life of trans adults during the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) How does the self-reported impact of the pandemic vary across groups within the trans community? (3) What preferences do trans adults have regarding receiving a COVID-19 vaccine? Survey data were collected in August/September of 2020. Among a sample of 449 trans adults, findings suggest that the profound impact of the pandemic was not consistent across all community members. Being a woman predicted a higher self-reported impact of the pandemic while being a masc(uline) white respondent tended to predict a lower impact of the pandemic. Higher income was associated with a higher quality of life and being a disabled white respondent predicted a lower quality of life. The majority (99%) of the sample reported wanting to receive a COVID-19 vaccine should one become available. Implications for practice include the importance of considering the holistic experiences of clients and community members, as opposed to having homogenized perspectives of even subsets of the trans community. Future research related to barriers faced when attempting to access a vaccine is needed to inform future public health responses to epidemics/pandemics impacting this community.","output":"Trans Adults Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quality of Life, Pandemic Impact, and Vaccine Preferences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart-home environments enables several important applications, including the continuous monitoring of fragile subjects in their homes for healthcare systems. The majority of the approaches in the literature assume that only one resident is living in the home. Multi-inhabitant ADLs recognition is significantly more challenging, and only a limited effort has been devoted to address this setting by the research community. One of the major open problems is called data association, which is correctly associating each environmental sensor event (e.g., the opening of a fridge door) with the inhabitant that actually triggered it. Moreover, existing multi-inhabitant approaches rely on supervised learning, assuming a high availability of labeled data. However, collecting a comprehensive training set of ADLs (especially in multiple-residents settings) is prohibitive. In this work, we propose MICAR: a novel multi-inhabitant ADLs recognition approach that combines semi-supervised learning and knowledge-based reasoning. Data association is performed by semantic reasoning, combining high-level context information (e.g., residents postures and semantic locations) with triggered sensor events. The personalized stream of sensor events is processed by an incremental classifier, that is initialized with a limited amount of labeled ADLs. A novel cache-based active learning strategy is adopted to continuously improve the classifier. Our results on a dataset where up to 4 subjects perform ADLs at the same time show that MICAR reliably recognizes individual and joint activities while triggering a significantly low number of active learning queries.","output":"MICAR: multi-inhabitant context-aware activity recognition in home environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The emergence of COVID-19 by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has seen evolving data reporting infrequent infection in children and mostly mild disease for children who contract the infection.

OBJECTIVE: Here we describe the rapid rollout of capabilities by UW Medicine Information Technology Services (ITS) to support our clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide recommendations for health systems to urgently consider, as they plan their own response to this and potentially other future pandemics. METHODS: Our recommendations include establishing a hospital incident command structure that includes tight integration with IT, creating automated dashboards for incident command, optimizing emergency communication to staff and patients, and preparing human resources, security, other policies, and equipment to support the transition of all nonessential staff to telework.We describe how UW Medicine quickly expanded telemedicine capabilities to include most primary care providers and increasing numbers of specialty providers. We look at how we managed expedited change control processes to quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows. We also examine the integration of new technology such as tele-intensive care (ICU) equipment and improved integration with teleconferencing software into our EHR. To support the rapid preparation for COVID-19 at other health systems, we include samples of the UW Medicine's COVID-19 order set, COVID-19 documentation template, dashboard metric categories, and a list of the top 10 things your health care IT organization can do now to prepare.

However, the safety of early discharge after revision TJA (rTJA) remains unknown and the COVID-19 pandemic will force decreased hospitalization. This study compared 90-day outcomes in patients undergoing aseptic rTJA discharged the same or next day (early) to those discharged 2 or 3 days postoperatively (later). METHODS: In total, 530 aseptic rTJAs performed at a single tertiary care referral center (December 5, 2011 to December 30, 2019) were identified. Early and later discharge patients were matched as closely as possible on procedure type, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, age, and body mass index. All patients were optimized using modern perioperative protocols. The rate of 90-day emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions was compared between groups. RESULTS: In total, 183 early discharge rTJAs (54 hips, 129 knees) in 178 patients were matched to 183 later discharge rTJAs (71 hips, 112 knees) in 165 patients. Sixty-two percent of the sample was female, with an overall average age and body mass index of 63  9.9 (range: 18-92) years and 32  6.9 (range: 18-58) kg/m2. There was no statistical difference in 90-day ED visit rates between early (6/178, 3.4%) and later (11/165, 6.7%) discharge patients (P = .214). Ninety-day hospital admission rates for early (7/178, 3.9%) and later (4/165, 2.4%) discharges did not differ (P = .545). CONCLUSION: Using modern perioperative protocols with appropriate patient selection, early discharge following aseptic rTJA does not increase 90-day readmissions or ED visits. As hospital inpatient capacity remains limited due to COVID-19, select rTJA patients may safely discharge home the same or next day to preserve hospital beds and resources for more critical illness.","output":"Safety of Same and Next Day Discharge Following Revision Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Using Modern Perioperative Protocols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new SARS-CoV-2 virus is an RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes COVID-19 disease.

As a result, 20%-50% of the prepared drugs remain unused and are then discarded. Decreasing waste by optimizing drug use is an attractive strategy for meeting both cost containment and environmental sustainability. The primary end point of this study was to measure the actual amount of drug wastage in the operating rooms (ORs) and intensive care units (ICUs) of a Regional Health Service (RHS). The secondary end point was to analyze and estimate the economic implications of this waste for the Health Service and to suggest possible measures to reduce it. METHODS This prospective observational multicenter study was conducted across 12 hospitals, all of which belong to the same RHS in the north-east of Italy. Data collection took place in March 2018 and included patients admitted to ICUs, emergency areas, and ORs of the participating hospitals. Data concerning drug preparation and administration were collected for all consecutive patients, independent of case types and of whether operations were scheduled or unscheduled. Drug wastage was defined as follows: drugs prepared in ready-to-use syringes but not administered at all and discarded untouched. We then estimated the costs of wasted drugs for a 1-year period using the data from this study and the yearly regional pharmacy orders of drugs provided to the ORs and ICUs. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to validate the robustness of our assumptions and qualitative conclusions. RESULTS We collected data for a total of 13,078 prepared drug syringes. Drug wastage varied from 7.8% (Urapidil, an alpha-1 antagonist antihypertensive) to 85.7% (epinephrine) of prepared syringes, with an overall mean wastage rate of 38%. The estimated yearly waste was 139,531 syringes, for a total estimated financial cost of 78,060 ($92,569), and an additional quantity of medical waste amounting to 4968 kg per year. The total provider time dedicated to the preparation of unused drugs was predicted to be 1512 working hours per year. CONCLUSIONS The overall extent of drug wastage in ORs and ICUs is concerning. Interventions aimed at minimizing waste-related costs and improving the environmental sustainability of our practice are paramount. Effort should be put into designing a more efficient workflow that reduces this waste while providing for the emergency availability of these medications in the OR and ICU.","output":"Evaluation of Drug Wastage in the Operating Rooms and Intensive Care Units of a Regional Health Service."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tempo-spatial patterns of Covid-19 infections are a result of nested personal, societal, and political decisions that involve complicated epidemiological dynamics across overlapping spatial scales. High infection \\"hotspots\\" interspersed within regions where infections remained sporadic were ubiquitous early in the outbreak, but the spatial signature of the infection evolved to affect most regions equally, albeit with distinct temporal patterns. The sparseness of Covid-19 infections in the United States was analyzed at scales spanning from 10 to 2,600 km (county to continental scale). Spatial evolution of Covid-19 cases in the United States followed multifractal scaling. A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population. Instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, a kernel-modulated approach is developed to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. Multiphase Covid-19 epidemics were reasonably reproduced by the proposed kernel-modulated susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. The work explained the fact that while the reproduction number was reduced due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, social distancing, etc.), subsequent multiple epidemic waves still occurred; this was due to an increase in susceptible population flow following a relaxation of travel restrictions and corollary stay-at-home orders.

Hence, insufficient PA (IPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) among children and adolescents are relevant behavior change domains for using individualized mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on IPA and SB, with a special focus on the age and level of individualization. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and March 2021. mHealth interventions for primary prevention in children and adolescents addressing behavior change related to IPA and SB were included. Included studies were compared for content characteristics and methodological quality and summarized narratively. In addition, a meta-analysis with a subsequent exploratory meta-regression examining the moderating effects of age and individualization on overall effectiveness was performed. RESULTS: On the basis of the inclusion criteria, 1.3% (11/828) of the preliminary identified studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 1.2% (10/828) were included in the meta-analysis. Trials included a total of 1515 participants (mean age (11.69, SD 0.788 years; 65% male and 35% female) self-reported (3/11, 27%) or device-measured (8/11, 73%) health data on the duration of SB and IPA for an average of 9.3 (SD 5.6) weeks. Studies with high levels of individualization significantly decreased insufficient PA levels (Cohen d=0.33; 95% CI 0.08-0.58; Z=2.55; P=.01), whereas those with low levels of individualization (Cohen d=?0.06; 95% CI ?0.32 to 0.20; Z=0.48; P=.63) or targeting SB (Cohen d=?0.11; 95% CI ?0.01 to 0.23; Z=1.73; P=.08) indicated no overall significant effect. The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate to low, and significant subgroup differences were found between trials with high and low levels of individualization ((2)(1)=4.0; P=.04; I(2)=75.2%). Age as a moderator variable showed a small effect; however, the results were not significant, which might have been because of being underpowered. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that mHealth interventions for children and adolescents can foster moderate reductions in IPA but not SB. Moreover, individualized mHealth interventions to reduce IPA seem to be more effective for adolescents than for children. Although, to date, only a few mHealth studies have addressed inactive and sedentary young people, and their quality of evidence is moderate, these findings indicate the relevance of individualization on the one hand and the difficulties in reducing SB using mHealth interventions on the other.

However, using healthcare data for secondary purposes raises legal and ethical concerns relating to confidentiality, privacy and data protection rights. Using a linkage and anonymisation approach that processes data lawfully and in line with ethical best practice to create an anonymous (non-personal) dataset can address these concerns, yet there is no set approach for defining all of the steps involved in such data flow end-to-end. We aimed to define such an approach with clear steps for dataset creation, and to describe its utilisation in a case study linking healthcare data. METHODS: We developed a data flow protocol that generates pseudonymous datasets that can be reversibly linked, or irreversibly linked to form an anonymous research dataset. It was designed and implemented by the Comprehensive Patient Records (CPR) study in Leeds, UK. RESULTS: We defined a clear approach that received ethico-legal approval for use in creating an anonymous research dataset. Our approach used individual-level linkage through a mechanism that is not computer-intensive and was rendered irreversible to both data providers and processors. We successfully applied it in the CPR study to hospital and general practice and community electronic health record data from two providers, along with patient reported outcomes, for 365,193 patients.

Importantly, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for many family caregivers. Specifically, the restrictions put in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus may be exacerbating the challenges faced by these caregivers as they try to navigate the system. Further, studies have shown that family caregivers who are members of a racial or ethnic minority group such as African-Americans or Hispanics face unique challenges when caring for their loved ones. Additional challenges may include socioeconomic disadvantages, health disparities, and language barriers that make it more difficult to access healthcare and social services. In this study, we examined the perspectives of African-American family caregivers of older adults on the feasibility of utilizing technology as a coping strategy (including for research participation) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The research question was: What are the perspectives of African-American family caregivers of people with dementia on the feasibility, opportunities, and challenges of technology as a means to engage family caregivers during a pandemic? In-depth one-on-one interviews were conducted with 12 African-American/black family caregivers. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data yielded the following three themes: (1) Acceptance that technology will play a greater role in the world going forward, and family caregivers need to adapt; (2) Opportunities to avoid social isolation while maintaining links with critical community resources; and (3) Challenges due to possible loss of privacy and lack of physical interactions","output":"Technology Is out There for the Betterment of Us: African American Family Caregivers and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We defined the frequency of respiratory community-acquired bacterial co-infection in patients with COVID-19, i.e. patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or a COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) score  4, based on a complete clinical assessment, including prior antibiotic use, clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, chest computed tomography (CT) results and microbiological test results. METHODS: Our retrospective study was conducted within a cohort of prospectively included patients admitted for COVID-19 in our tertiary medical centres between 1-3-2020 and 1-6-2020. A multidisciplinary study team developed a diagnostic protocol to retrospectively categorize patients as unlikely, possible or probable bacterial co-infection based on clinical, radiological and microbiological parameters in the first 72 h of admission. Within the three categories, we summarized patient characteristics and antibiotic consumption. RESULTS: Among 281 included COVID-19 patients, bacterial co-infection was classified as unlikely in 233 patients (82.9%), possible in 35 patients (12.4%) and probable in 3 patients (1.1%). Ten patients (3.6%) could not be classified due to inconclusive data. Within 72 h of hospital admission, 81% of the total study population and 78% of patients classified as unlikely bacterial co-infection received antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients are unlikely to have a respiratory community-acquired bacterial co-infection.

Evidence regarding the association between mental health problems and information exposure among Thai citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between information exposure and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. METHODS: Between April 21 and May 4, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide online survey of the general population in Thailand. We categorized the duration of exposure to COVID-19-related information as follows: <1 h/day (reference group), 1-2 h/day, and &#8805;3 h/day. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Insomnia Severity Index for symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between information exposure and the risk of developing the aforementioned symptoms. An ancillary analysis using multivariable multinomial logistic regression models was also conducted to assess the possible dose-response relationship across the severity strata of mental health problems. RESULTS: Of the 4322 eligible participants, 4004 (92.6%) completed the online survey. Of them, 1481 (37.0%), 1644 (41.1%), and 879 (22.0%) participants were exposed to COVID-19-related information for less than 1 hour per day, 1 to 2 hours per day, or 3 or more hours per day, respectively. The major source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was social media (95.3%), followed by traditional media (68.7%) and family members (34.9%). Those exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day had a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.76; P=.03), anxiety (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43-2.46; P<.001), and insomnia (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.17-1.97; P=.001) than people exposed to information for less than 1 hour per day. Meanwhile, people exposed to information for 1 to 2 hours per day were only at risk of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69; P=.008). However, no association was found between information exposure and the risk of perceived stress. In the ancillary analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between information exposure of 3 or more hours per day and the severity of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that social media is the main source of COVID-19-related information. Moreover, people who are exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day are more likely to develop psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Longitudinal studies investigating the long-term effects of COVID-19-related information exposure on mental health are warranted.","output":"Exposure to COVID-19-Related Information and its Association With Mental Health Problems in Thailand: Nationwide, Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody responses are an important part of immunity after Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. However, antibody trajectories and the associated duration of protection after a second vaccine dose remain unclear. In this study, we investigated anti-spike IgG antibody responses and correlates of protection after second doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United Kingdom general population. In 222,493 individuals, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG by the second doses of both vaccines in all ages and using different dosing intervals, including the 3-week interval for BNT162b2. After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Older individuals and males had lower peak levels with BNT162b2 but not ChAdOx1, whereas declines were similar across ages and sexes with ChAdOX1 or BNT162b2. Prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life with both vaccines. Anti-spike IgG levels were associated with protection from infection after vaccination and, to an even greater degree, after prior infection. At least 67% protection against infection was estimated to last for 2C3 months after two ChAdOx1 doses, for 5C8 months after two BNT162b2 doses in those without prior infection and for 1C2 years for those unvaccinated after natural infection. A third booster dose might be needed, prioritized to ChAdOx1 recipients and those more clinically vulnerable.","output":"Antibody responses and correlates of protection in the general population after two doses of the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging but limited evidence suggests that alcohol consumption has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study assessed: (1) whether drinking behaviors changed during the pandemic; and, (2) how those changes were impacted by COVID-19-related stress.

We conducted adjusted linear regressions to assess COVID-19 stress and alcohol consumption, adjusting for gender, race, ethnicity, age, and household income. A total of 832 responded: 84% female, 85% White, and 72% ages 26-49. Participants reported consuming 26.8 alcohol drinks on 12.2 of the past 30 days. One-third of participants (34.1%) reported binge drinking and 7.0% reported extreme binge drinking. Participants who experienced COVID-19-related stress (versus not) reported consuming more drinks (? = 4.7; CI (0.2, 9.1); p = 0.040) and a greater number of days drinking (? = 2.4; CI (0.6, 4.1); p = 0.007). Additionally, 60% reported increased drinking but 13% reported decreased drinking, compared to pre-COVID-19. Reasons for increased drinking included increased stress (45.7%), increased alcohol availability (34.4%), and boredom (30.1%).

Moreover, the cultivation of cyanobacteria in controlled and confined systems, along with their metabolic plasticity, provides the possibility to improve and standardize composition and effects on plants of derived biostimulant extracts or hydrolysates, which is one of the most critical aspects in the production of commercial biostimulants. Faced with these opportunities, research on biostimulant properties of cyanobacteria has undergone a significant growth in recent years. However, research in this field is still scarce, especially as regards the number of investigated cyanobacterial species. Future research should focus on reducing the costs of cyanobacterial biomass production and plant treatment and on identifying the molecules that mediate the biostimulant effects in order to optimize their content and stability in the final product. Furthermore, the extension of agronomic trials to a wider number of plant species, different application doses, and environmental conditions would allow the development of tailored microbial biostimulants, thus facilitating the diffusion of these products among farmers.","output":"Plant Biostimulants from Cyanobacteria: An Emerging Strategy to Improve Yields and Sustainability in Agriculture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) in Indonesia is seen to be uncontrollably increasing that urges the government to leverage the capacity for the disease detections.

METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted. Outcomes of patients with different RHRs were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had RHRs of <80 bpm (beat per min), 85 had 80C99 bpm and 22 had 100 bpm as tachycardia. Those with higher RHRs had lower pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and higher temperatures, and there was a higher proportion of men upon admission (all P < 0.05). Patients with higher RHRs showed higher white blood cell counts and D-dimer, cardiac troponin I (TnI), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and hypersensitive C-reactive protein levels, but lower albumin levels (all P < 0.05) after admission. During follow-up, 26 patients died (mortality rate, 19.1%). The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with tachycardia than among the moderate and low RHR groups (all P < 0.001). KaplanCMeier survival curves showed that the risks of death and ventilation use increased for patients with tachycardia (P < 0.001). Elevated RHR as a continuous variable and a mean RHR as tachycardia were independent risk factors for mortality and ventilator use (all P < 0.05) in the multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model.

METHODS: A review of selected key reports, papers and publications related to epidemics and pandemics in Irish history was conducted. RESULTS: Viruses, epidemics and pandemics are recurring features of human history. Early Irish sources record a broad array of plagues, pandemics and epidemics including bubonic plague, typhus, cholera, dysentery and smallpox, as well as an alleged epidemic of insanity in the 19th century (that never truly occurred). Like the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-20), COVID-19 (a new coronavirus) presents both the challenge of the illness itself and the problems caused by the anxiety that the virus triggers. Managing this anxiety has always been a challenge, especially with the Spanish flu. People with mental illness had particularly poor outcomes with the Spanish flu, often related to the large, unhygienic mental hospitals in which so many were housed. CONCLUSIONS: Even today, a full century after the Spanish flu pandemic, people with mental illness remain at increased risk of poor physical health, so it is imperative that multi-disciplinary care continues during the current outbreak of COVID-19, despite the manifest difficulties involved. The histories of previous epidemics and pandemics clearly demonstrate that good communication and solidarity matter, now more than ever, especially for people with mental illness.","output":"Plagues, pandemics and epidemics in Irish history prior to COVID-19 (coronavirus): what can we learn?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We investigate the effects of Ginger, compared to the usual therapeutic regimen on clinical manifestations and paraclinical features in patients with confirmed COVID-19 that are moderately ill TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel group design PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria: 1 Patients admitted to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Departments at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas, Iran 2 Age 18 years (weight 35 kg) 3 Hospitalized 48 hours 4 Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) 5 Moderate pneumonia and lung involvement in imaging 6 Signing informed consent and willingness of study participant to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm Exclusion criteria: 1 Underlying diseases, including heart disease, chronic hypertension, severe renal failure, severe liver failure, and thyroid disorders 2 Use of warfarin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), diuretics, corticosteroids, and antiarrhythmic drugs 3 Severe and critical pneumonia 4 History of known allergy to Ginger 5 Pregnancy and breastfeeding INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention group: The standard treatment regimen for COVID-19 along with Ginger-based herbal tablets (Vomigone ?, Dineh Pharmaceutical Company, Iran) at a dose of 1000 mg three times a day for a period of seven days CONTROL GROUP: The standard treatment for COVID-19 based on the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education's protocol, along with Vomigone-like placebo tablets (Dineh Pharmaceutical Company, Iran) at a dose of two tablets three times a day for a period of seven days MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is recovery rate of clinical symptoms, including fever, dry cough, tiredness, and GI symptoms as well as paraclinical features, including thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, and C-reactive protein within seven days of randomization Time to improvement of clinical and paraclinical features along with the incidence of serious adverse events are the secondary outcomes within seven days of randomization RANDOMIZATION: An interactive web-based system will be used to allocate eligible participants, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to one of the two study arms (in a 1:1 ratio) using block randomization BLINDING (MASKING): All study participants, research coordinators, clinicians, nurses, and investigators will be blinded to the group assignment NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 84 participants will be randomized into two groups of 42 patients TRIAL STATUS: The protocol is Version 1 0, May 23, 2020 Recruitment began July 21, 2020, and is anticipated to be completed by October 30, 2020 TRIAL REGISTRATION: This clinical trial has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) The registration number is \\" IRCT20200506047323N1 \\" Registration date is 23 May 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1) In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated;this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol","output":"Effects of Ginger on clinical manifestations and paraclinical features of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Patients were stratified into low score groups (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score <10) and high score groups (MELD 10). Clinical outcomes were evaluated, including in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS). Results Our cohort of 186 COVID-19 positive patients included 88 (47%) women with a mean age of 60 years in the low score group and mean age of 73 years in the high score group. Patients in the high score group were older in age (p<0.0001) and more likely to have history of diabetes mellitus (p=0.0020), stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p=0.0013), hypertension (p<0.0001), stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (p=0.0163), asthma (p=0.0356), dementia (p<0.0001), and chronic heart failure (p=0.0055).

Hence, we conducted a retrospective study in Gadarif Hospital to evaluate the presenting manifestations, mortality rate, and the risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at Gadarif Hospital in Eastern Sudan. Medical files of the patients admitted during the period between April and July 2020 were reviewed. All the files of the adult patients (aged 18 or above), of both sexes, who had a confirmed COVID-19-positive status via laboratory testing using PCR and who were admitted during this period were reviewed. The data extracted included patients demographics and initial clinical presentation, symptoms, signs, and the laboratory and radiographic findings. The data were analyzed using SPSS v22. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were admitted with COVID-19. The median (interquartile) age was 62 (55.00C70.00) years old, and 72 (81.8%) of them were males. Most patients (75%) experienced a one-week duration of symptoms. A fever (87.5%), cough (80.68%), and shortness of breath (77.27%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Following a clinical assessment, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found to be normal in most patients, at 92.05% and 89.77%, respectively. An oxygen saturation of less than 90% was seen in 71.59% of patients. The general mortality rate was 37.5% and most deaths occurred during the first 24 h of admission (21/33 [63.64%]).

Although several vaccine candidates have shown promising results in clinical trials, resulting in expedited approval for public use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, recent polls suggest that Americans strongly distrust the vaccine and its approval process. This mistrust stems from both the unusual speed of vaccine development and reports about side effects. This article applies insights from behavioral economics to consider how the general public may make decisions around whether or not to receive a future COVID-19 vaccine in a context of frequent side effects and preexisting mistrust. Three common cognitive biases shown to influence human decision-making under a behavioral economics framework are considered: confirmation bias, negativity bias, and optimism bias. Applying a behavioral economics framework to COVID-19 vaccine decision-making can elucidate potential barriers to vaccine uptake and points of intervention for clinicians and public health professionals.","output":"A behavioral economics perspective on the COVID-19 vaccine amid public mistrust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeOrganisations have been working towards becoming more sustainable;where their efforts have been mainly on a steady state focussing on internal proactive changes.

However, hospital reimbursement data for ISA is limited. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to analyse the different perspectives of relevant stakeholders and the (dis)incentives for the administration of ISA in Germany. To that aim, the health economic effects of using ISA from a hospital management perspective were analysed. PATIENTS/METHODS Based on principal-agent theory (PAT), the perspectives of i. the patient (principal) as well as ii. physicians, iii. pharmacists and iv. hospital managers (all agents) were analysed. For the evaluation of the cost-containment and reimbursement strategies of ISA, the German diagnosis-related group (G-DRG) system was used. RESULTS Hospitals individually negotiating additional payments for innovative treatment procedures (zusatzentgelte [ZE]) within the G-DRG system is a key element of hospital management for the reduction of total healthcare expenditure. Our analysis demonstrated the beneficial role of ISA in healthcare resource utilisation, primarily due to a shortened overall length of hospital stay. Depending on underlying disease, coded G-DRG and ISA formulation, large differences in total reimbursement and the amount of ZE was shown. The PAT demonstrated disincentives for hospital managers to use innovative drugs. CONCLUSIONS Based on the PAT, beneficial, detrimental, and indifferent perspectives of different stakeholders regarding the usage of ISA were shown.

Aptamer 45e (from the G-quadruplex library) and aptamer 75a were obtained after optimization, and aptamer 45e turned out to have a higher affinity toward STX.

Our understanding of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections continues to evolve, and there is a paucity of information describing severe breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections. We conducted this study with the aim of describing breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring hospitalization and exploring factors associated with severe breakthrough infection. Methods The study included patients within our health network who received at least one dose of a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine and required hospitalization due to breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1 to August 15, 2021. We performed a descriptive analysis of vaccinated patients requiring hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression (LR) analysis was performed to explore factors associated with severe breakthrough infection. Results Out of 67,223 vaccinated individuals, 78 (0.12%) patients were hospitalized with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which 25 individuals (0.04% of those vaccinated, and 32% of all hospitalized) developed severe infection. The mean age of those with breakthrough infection was 72 years, the majority were White (60%), and dyspnea was the most common reason for hospital admission (53%), with bimodal peaks of hospitalization in January-February (40%) and July-August (34%). In LR analysis, male patients had 4.03 times the odds of developing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than female patients (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 4.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21 - 13.40), and an immunocompromising condition had 6.32 times the odds of developing severe COVID-19 disease (aOR: 6.32, 95% CI: 1.48 - 26.18).

METHODS: A national sample of parents of youth athletes from across the United States (n=236, age: 39.28.1 years, 57.2% female) were recruited to complete an online questionnaire by Qualtrics Online Samples (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) using a combination of actively managed, double-opt-in market research panels. The questionnaire focused on changes in child sport participation and family finances as a result of COVID-19 and included both close-ended and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Most parents (63.1%) reported the time their children spent participating in organized youth sports had decreased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three-quarters of parents (75.5%) reported that it was likely that their children would fully resume participating in organized youth sports within the next year. Parents whose financial situation was worsened by COVID-19 were less likely to report that their children would resume sports in the upcoming year. Three domains related to parental decision-making emerged from the open-ended responses: safety, fear, and normalcy. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the factors influencing changes in youth sport participation during the pandemic can allow systems to implement strategies for safe participation in youth sport and physical activity among children. Encouraging participation in outdoor sports with appropriate safety precautions such as masking, social distancing, and hygiene may reduce fear of participation among parents.

Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services are vulnerable to economic imbalances, including health insecurity, unmet need for healthcare, and low health expenditure. The same vulnerability influences the potential of a country to combat global outbreaks such as the COVID-19. We aimed to provide some important insights into the impacts of COVID-19 on RMNCH indicators and outcomes of the HSDP in Uganda. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study of secondary data obtained from the Ugandan government-led portals, supplemented by analyses of relevant articles published up to 06 May 2021 and deposited in PubMed. RESULTS: Through synthesizing actionable and relevant evidence, we realized that RMNCH in Uganda is highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures. The impact was across immunization, antenatal, sexual and reproductive health, emergency and obstetric, and postnatal care services. There was a decline sharply by 9.6% for under-five vitamin A coverage, 9% for DPT(3)HibHeb(3) coverage, 6.8% for measles vaccination coverage, 6% for isoniazid preventive therapy coverage, and 3% for facility-based deliveries. Maternal and under-five deaths increased by 7.6% and 4%, respectively. Outreaches were rarely conducted in the lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a multitude of questions regarding the optimal policies to mitigate the disease while minimizing the unintended detrimental consequences of RMNCH. The lockdown restrictions threatened to reverse the progress made on the national HSDP for RMNCH. In Uganda, where young women are vulnerable to early marriage, unintended pregnancies, and unsafe abortion, access to RMNCH services should continue regardless of the COVID-19 status in the country.

AIM: The purpose of the present study was to assess patient satisfaction with a virtual telephone clinic in a tertiary referral centre for otolaryngology first during the height of the SARS-Cov2 pandemic, and subsequently at a physical follow-up appointment after easing of \\"lockdown\\" measures. METHODS: Patients were enrolled prospectively via a telephone interview over a 1-week period during the height of the \\"lockdown\\" measures, and subsequently at a physical appointment when measures eased. RESULTS: Overall, patients responded very positively in the anonymised questionnaire at the time of their virtual appointment. However, at a subsequent physical appointment, there was a reduction in overall favourable responses from patients. While patients still thought virtual clinics were a good idea and convenient in the context of SARS-Cov2, we noted a reduction in satisfaction in other key aspects of their care. Notably, patients were less likely to think that virtual clinics were able to properly address their condition. CONCLUSION: While virtual clinics remain a useful tool during the height of lockdown measures during the SARS-Cov2 pandemic, we did note a significant reduction in favourable responses to virtual appointments over physical ones upon easing of lockdown measures.

The current study examined the transactional relationships between caregiver and child mental health over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Linguistically, racially, and ethnically diverse caregivers (N = 286) of young children completed measures of caregiver mental health, caregiver pandemic-related stress, and child mental health (i.e., externalizing, internalizing, prosocial behavior) across three time points in the spring of 2020. RESULTS: Using autoregressive cross-lagged analyses, impaired caregiver mental health at Time 1 (April 2020) predicted increased caregiver pandemic-related stress at Time 2 (May 2020). Caregiver pandemic-related stress at Time 1 predicted increased child internalizing symptoms at Time 2 which, in turn, predicted increased caregiver pandemic-related stress at Time 3 (July 2020).

Since schools host large numbers of students in enclosed spaces, they are feared to produce infection clusters. With school closures coming at high social and economic costs, social distancing measures within schools are needed to make them as safe as possible. One widely discussed distancing measure in the school context is to use cohorting strategies, i.e., to split larger clusters such as classrooms into smaller groups that are instructed separately. In addition to facilitating social distancing within these cohorts, cohorting strategies also aim to prevent transmission across cohorts. However, little is known about which cohorting strategies are particularly effective to prevent disease transmission between cohorts in schools. Methods Using nationally representative data on adolescents in classrooms in four European countries, we simulate how four different cohorting strategies can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in high schools. We model the effect of forming two cohorts randomly, splitting cohorts by gender, optimizing cohorts by minimizing students' out-of-school cross-cohort contacts, and approximating this optimization strategy by network chains. The rationale of all non-random cohorting strategies is to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from one cohort to the other by reducing cross-cohort out-of-school contact. We also compare the overall effect of cohorting to no cohorting and differentiate between a rota-system in which cohorts receive in-person instruction in alternating weeks and a system with separate but same-day in-person instruction for both cohorts. Data were collected between 2010 and 2011 as part of the CILS4EU project, a network panel study of 14-15-year-olds in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Across all four countries, we model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in 507 classrooms, capturing a total of 12,291 students. Findings Our simulations suggest that all four cohorting strategies reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in classrooms, but vary in their effectiveness. Relative to random cohorting, all strategies that factor in out-of-school cross-cohort ties have particularly strong effects on the frequency of cross-cohort transmission but also substantively reduce the total number of infections and the share of students in quarantine when transmission dynamics are strong. Cohorting that explicitly minimizes out-of-school contact between students in different cohorts is most effective, but network-based approximation also breaks many cross-cohort ties and thus performs well. Because adolescents' out-of-school contacts tend to be strongly segregated by gender, dividing classrooms by gender also outperforms random cohorting but is less effective than directly using network information. For all cohorting strategies, rota-systems with instruction in alternating weeks contain outbreaks more effectively than same-day in-person instruction. Interpretation Cohorting of school classes as a social distancing measure can help to effectively curb SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the school context. If schools consider splitting up classes into two smaller cohorts, factoring in out-of-school contacts can help achieve a more effective separation of cohorts. The paper proposes effective cohorting strategies that outperform naive random cohorting in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These strategies may limit outbreaks to one cohort, keep the size of infection clusters low, and reduce the number of students in quarantine if an index case occurs in the student body. Our findings thus suggest that if schools consider cohorting, they should assign students who meet after school to the same cohort. In particular, cohorting on the basis of gender or network chains is effective and may be successfully implemented within the constraints posed by the classroom context.","output":"Social network-based strategies for classroom size reduction can help limit outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in high schools.

To assess the appropriateness of the country's COVID-19 mortality surveillance, that includes long-term care facilities deaths and deaths in possible cases, the number of COVID-19 deaths was compared with the number of deaths from all-cause mortality. Mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic was also compared with historical mortality rates from the last century including those of the Spanish influenza pandemic. METHODS: Excess mortality predictions and COVID-19 mortality data were analysed for the period March 10th to June 21st 2020. The number of COVID-19 deaths and the COVID-19 mortality rate per million were calculated for hospitals, nursing homes and other places of death, according to diagnostic status (confirmed/possible infection). To evaluate historical mortality, monthly mortality rates were calculated from January 1900 to June 2020. RESULTS: Nine thousand five hundred ninety-one COVID-19 deaths and 39,076 deaths from all-causes were recorded, with a correlation of 94% (Spearman's rho, p < 0,01). During the period with statistically significant excess mortality (March 20th to April 28th; total excess mortality 64.7%), 7917 excess deaths were observed among the 20,159 deaths from all-causes. In the same period, 7576 COVID-19 deaths were notified, indicating that 96% of the excess mortality were likely attributable to COVID-19. The inclusion of deaths in nursing homes doubled the COVID-19 mortality rate, while adding deaths in possible cases increased it by 27%. Deaths in laboratory-confirmed cases accounted for 69% of total COVID-19-related deaths and 43% of in-hospital deaths. Although the number of deaths was historically high, the monthly mortality rate was lower in April 2020 compared to the major fatal events of the last century. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in all-cause mortality during the first wave of the epidemic was a key indicator to validate the Belgium's high COVID-19 mortality figures. A COVID-19 mortality surveillance limited to deaths from hospitalised and selected laboratory-confirmed cases would have underestimated the magnitude of the epidemic.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to examine how Wnt inhibition by niclosamide preferentially targets CSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The mechanistic role of niclosamide in CSC inhibition was examined in public databases, human colorectal cancer cells, colorectal cancer xenografts, and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colorectal cancer model. RESULTS Niclosamide suppresses CSC populations and their self-renewal activities in colorectal cancer cells, and this CSC-targeting effect leads to irreversible disruption of tumor-initiating potential in vivo. Mechanistically, niclosamide downregulates multiple signaling components of the Wnt pathway, specifically lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) expression, which is critical for regulating stemness. Subsequently, we identified that the doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1)-B is a target of LEF1 and upregulates cancer stemness in colorectal cancer cells. We first documented that niclosamide blocks the transcription of DCLK1-B by interrupting the binding of LEF1 to DCLK1-B promoter. DCLK1-B depletion impairs cancer stemness resulting in reduced survival potential and increased apoptosis, thus sensitizing colorectal cancer to chemoradiation. CONCLUSIONS Disruption of the LEF1/DCLK1-B axis by niclosamide eradicates cancer stemness and elicits therapeutic effects on colorectal cancer initiation, progression, and resistance. These findings provide a preclinical rationale to broaden the clinical evaluation of niclosamide for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","output":"Inhibition of LEF1-Mediated DCLK1 by Niclosamide Attenuates Colorectal Cancer Stemness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome encodes eight accessory proteins.

This interference with nuclear import requires interaction between protein 6 and cellular karyopherins, a process that typically involves nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs. Here we dissected protein 6 using site-directed mutagenesis and found no evidence for a classical NLS.

In this study, we investigate whether medical or surgical control of reflux is associated with a decreased risk of progression to dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from a cohort of Barrett's esophagus patients participating in this single-center study comprised of all patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus at NorthShore University Health System hospitals and clinics over a 10-year period. Patients were followed in order to identify those progressing from Barrett's esophagus to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. We collected information from the patient's electronic medical records regarding demographic, endoscopic findings, histological findings, smoking/alcohol history, medication use including proton-pump inhibitors, and history of bariatric and antireflux surgery. Risk-adjusted modeling was performed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS This study included 1,830 total Barrett's esophagus patients, 102 of which had their Barrett's esophagus progress to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma (confirmed by biopsy) with an annual incidence rate of 1.1%. Mean follow-up period was 5.51 years (10,083 patient-years). Compared to the group that did not progress, the group that progressed was older (69.3  13.7 vs. 63.9  13.4 years. p < 0.001) and likely to be male (75 vs. 61%, p < 0.01). In the multivariable analysis, patients who had a history of antireflux surgery (n = 44) or proton-pump inhibitor use without surgery (n = 1,641) were found to progress at significantly lower rates than patients who did not have antireflux surgery or were not taking PPI's (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09-0.36). CONCLUSIONS Reflux control was associated with decreased risk of progression to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus's capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.","output":"Multiple sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are susceptible to proteolysis by cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the world, populations of scavenger birds are declining rapidly with some populations already on the brink of extinction.

The study will cover the first 72 hours after discharge of the patient from the post-anaesthesia care unit.

Data obtained using the sensor will be compared to data obtained during the routine nurse follow-up. The primary outcome is hemodynamic abnormality. The secondary outcomes are postoperative respiratory and temperature abnormalities, artefacts and blank/null outputs from the wearable device, postoperative complications, and finally, the ease of use of the device.

We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006/07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1:40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. RESULTS: We recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers (mean age 35.7 years) and 486 non-healthcare workers (mean age 39.2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10.6%. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1.1, p = 0.70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, p = 0.005), immunization (OR 0.50, p = 0.02), and - among persons living in households without children - ownership of a car (OR 3.0, p = 0.02). Living with three or more children (OR 13.8, p < 0.01) was a greater risk than living with one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). 30% of participants with SCII reported no respiratory illness. Healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls (adjusted OR 1.3, p = 0.04, n = 850). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers, although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised. Household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients. Car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration.

While some patients infected with the disease\\\\causing virus SARS\\\\CoV2 have no or mild symptoms, others experience severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Of these more severe patients, some remain stable while others experience cytokine storm syndrome or an exaggerated immune response that has been correlated with disease severity and progression of acute respiratory deterioration. It is currently unknown why some patients with COVID\\\\19 demonstrate this response and others do not. In light of the apparent prominent role of the inflammatory mediators (i.e. cytokines) in COVID\\\\19 pathogenesis, the ability to identify screening tools not only for the SARS\\\\CoV2 virus but also for cytokines is important. The present investigation was designed to identify the urinary cytokine signature in COVID\\\\19 patients. METHODS: The study enrolled 17 COVID\\\\19 patients and 10 control subjects (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 negative) 18 years or older with glomerular filtration rate of > 60mL/min. Urine samples were collected and cytokines quantitated using the Luminex multiplex assay.

In this study, we analyzed over 580 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated information at the global, country, and U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographic regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amenable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have obviously affected peoples travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation measures, proving that Twitter-based mobility implies the effectiveness of those measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified different injuries such as chemical-induced and trauma-induced formation of NETs and investigated mechanism of the formation of NETs in vitro and in vivo during the treatment of mtDNA. RESULTS Here, we find the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and oxidized mtDNA in acute peripheral tissue trauma models or other chemically induced lung injury, and moreover, endogenous mtDNA and oxidized mtDNA induce the formation of NETs and sterile inflammation. Oxidized mtDNA is a more potent inducer of NETs. Mitochondrial DNA activates neutrophils via cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING and the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathways and increases the production of neutrophil elastase and extracellular neutrophil-derived DNA in NETs. Mitochondrial DNA also increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of the NET-associated proteins Rac 2 and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4).

An oral dose (50 or 100mg) of TRA was administered to 17 healthy volunteers. Hair samples were collected prior to drug administration and 14, 30, 60 and 120 days after ingestion. Each sample was segmented in 5mm segments and washed. The analytes were extracted from pulverized hair by incubation in extraction media for 18h at 37C. A validated UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the analytes at a LLOQ of 0.001ng/mg. Hair segments corresponding to the time of ingestion were positive for TRA and the metabolites of each sampling time point, although neighboring segments also showed positive results. The highest concentrations for both dosage groups were observed in the proximal segment of hair collected 14 days after ingestion for all subjects: 0.061-0.95ng TRA/mg, 0.012-0.86ng NDMT/mg and 0.009-0.17ng ODMT/mg (n=16). Generally, the TRA concentration was higher than the metabolites concentrations but depended on the CYP2D6 phenotype. The metabolite to TRA ratios were stable within a subject over the sampling time points, however it varied greatly between subjects. No significant differences in hair concentrations were found between the two dosage groups at each sampling time. Several confounding factors were identified such as hair pigmentation and internal sweat. We showed that analysis of 5mm segments improved the determination of the exposure time after a single ingestion of TRA.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reasons why health care workers chose to participate in the MeCOVID and EPICOS trials, as well as why they chose one over the other. METHODS: Both trials were offered to health care workers through an internal news bulletin. After an initial screening visit, all subjects were asked to respond to a web-based survey. RESULTS: In the first month, 206 health care workers were screened and 160 were randomized. The survey participation was high at 73.3%. Health care workers cited \\"to contribute to scientific knowledge\\" (n=80, 53.0%), followed by \\"to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection\\" (n=33, 21.9%) and \\"the interest to be tested for SARS-CoV-2\\" (n=28, 18.5%), as their primary reasons to participate in the trials. We observed significant differences in the expected personal benefits across physicians and nurses (P=.01).

Limited data are available on COVID-19 during pregnancy. Therefore, we searched articles published between December 2019 and May 30, 2020, in three databases: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, using MeSH words COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV. 39 articles were included, and they revealed that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of general population, and they can turn into atypical pneumonia. Only one maternal death was reported. Fetal distress, prematurity, and respiratory distress syndrome are frequent in newborns; one intrauterine death and one perinatal death were reported. The most frequent sign found was fever (77-86%). The main maternal perinatal complications were prematurity (47%) and pneumonia (40%); serious illness was rare (4.4%) and similar to the reported in the general population (5%); the most frequent route of interruption was cesarean section in 89% of the cases.

METHODS The disease evolution was modeled via a semi-Markov model. The treatment strategies compared included endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection and the Standard of Care (esophagectomy or palliative chemoradiotherapy according to disease status for high-grade dysplasia and endoscopic surveillance for low-grade dysplasia). Efficacy rates, transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from the literature. Clinical management patterns and resource use were modeled according to Spanish clinical expert opinion. Costs were expressed in euros () from 2016 reflecting the Spanish National Health System perspective. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS With respect to the Spanish Standard of Care, endoscopic treatment based on radiofrequency ablation plus endoscopic mucosal resection was a dominant strategy for high-grade dysplasia patients. When a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained was considered, this was cost-effective for low-grade dysplasia patients (12,865 per quality-adjusted life-years gained). The sensitivity analyses supported the base case analysis results and pointed towards the main drivers of uncertainty in the model.

In this article, we present two clinical observations demonstrating typical manifestations of coronavirus pneumonia (CP) in kidney transplant recipients, the COVID-19 diagnostic and verification algorithm, and the therapeutic options used to achieve a favorable outcome of CP and to prevent fatal complications. Our findings confirm that in kidney transplant recipients CP is linked to increased disease severity with rapid progression of lung damage and a high risk of developing systemic complications, including thrombotic microangiopathy. It is shown that compliance with the current recom-mendations for a rational combination of antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant and basic immunosuppressive agents in this group of patients provides good treatment outcomes and prevents kidney transplant failure.

Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability after participants collect specimens. METHODS: 153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection, packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related laboratory testing. RESULTS: A large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory analysis. There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and shipping, or confidence in samples by gender, age, race/ethnicity, or educational level.

The current study aims to test if information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak was related to acute stress disorder (ASD) over and above other psychosocial stressors. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 7800 college students throughout China from January 31 through February 11, 2020. Existing scales were modified to measure ASD and six potential stressors including information uncertainty during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to assess the unique association of information uncertainty with ASD. To minimize the effect of large sample size and also to get a sense of whether the effects of information uncertainty were similar to people at the center of the epidemic, we repeated the hierarchical regression among 10% of the students who were randomly selected from the entire sample (\\"10% random sample\\"; n = 780) and 226 students from Hubei Province where the outbreak started. RESULTS: Information uncertainty was highly prevalent among the respondents (64%). It was significantly associated with ASD beyond other key variables and potential stressors across three samples. In the hierarchical regression among the entire sample, demographic variables accounted for 9.4% of the variance in ASD. The other five stressors added 5.1% of the variance. The information uncertainty (? = .159; p < .001) explained an additional 2.1% of the variance. Likewise, the information uncertainty explained an additional 2.1 and 3.4% of the variance in ASD beyond all other variables among the 10% random sample (? = .165; p < .001) and the Hubei sample (? = .196; p < .01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Information uncertainty is a unique correlate of psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Reducing information uncertainty is essential not only for halting virus transmission but also for mitigating negative impacts of the pandemic on people's psychosocial wellbeing.

However, M41 replicated in the respiratory tracts of most inoculated pheasants and the virus was shed from their respiratory tracts in the early stages of infection (4 and 8 dpc). Similarly, the attenuated IBV H120 vaccine strain also replicated and the virus was shed from their respiratory tracts of most inoculated pheasants, whereas the pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV) I0623/17 replicated in the respiratory tracts of all challenged pheasants, which then shed virus for a long period of time. Strain M41 also replicated in selected tissues of the inoculated pheasants, including the lung, kidney, proventriculus, and cecal tonsil, although the viral titers were very low. Therefore, it was important to establish whether the H120 vaccine, which has a limited replication capacity in pheasants, induces a protective immune response to both \\"heterologous\\" M41 and \\"homologous\\" I0623/17 challenge. Vaccination with H120 induced humoral responses, and the replication of M41 was reduced or restricted in the tissues of the H120-vaccinated pheasants compared with its replication in unvaccinated birds. This implies that partial protection was conferred on pheasants by vaccination with the H120 vaccine. Prolonged viral replication and a large number of birds shedding virus into the respiratory tract were also observed in the unvaccinated pheasants after inoculation with M41. However, only limited protection against challenge with PhCoV I0623/17 was conferred on pheasants vaccinated with H120, largely because the replication of H120 in pheasants was limited, thus, limiting the immune responses induced by it. The low amino acid identity of the S1 subunit of the S proteins of H120 and I0623/17 might also account, at least in part, for the poor cross-protective immunity induced by H120.

In the high collision regime, asymptotic-preserving particle schemes are able to produce stable results. However, this stability comes at the cost of a bias in the computed results. In earlier work, the multilevel Monte Carlo method was used to reduce this bias by combining simulations with large and small time steps. This multilevel scheme, however, still has large variances when correlating fine and coarse simulations, which leads to sub-optimal multilevel performance. In this work, we present an improved correlation approach that decreases the variance when bridging the gap from large time steps to time steps of the order of magnitude of the collision rate.

Here we use phylogenomic analyses of nuclear and plastid genomes to investigate the timing and pattern of major macroevolutionary events and ancient genome-wide signatures of hybridization across Fagaceae. Innovation related to seed dispersal is implicated in triggering waves of continental radiations beginning with the rapid diversification of major lineages and resulting in unparalleled transformation of forest dynamics within 15 million years following the K-Pg extinction. We detect introgression at multiple time scales, including ancient events predating the origination of genus-level diversity. As oak lineages moved into newly available temperate habitats in the early Miocene, secondary contact between previously isolated species occurred.

Despite countries urgent and resilient public health actions against the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease is causing a large number of deaths. However, predictors of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients have not been well investigated in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital in Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based retrospective cohort design study was implemented among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital in Harar, Ethiopia from March 20 to August 20, 2021. Data of 531 admitted patients were entered using Epi-data 3.1 and exported to STATA 14.2 for analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of outcome variables with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Of the total 531 study participants, 101 deaths occurred. The mortality rate was 16.2 per 1000 person-days of observation with median survival time of 44 days with IQR [28, 74]. Smoking history [AOR=2.55, 95% CI (1.15, 5.65)], alcohol history [AOR=2.3, 95% CI (1.06, 4.97)], comorbidities [AOR=2.95, 95% CI (1.26, 6.91)], and increasing oxygen saturation [AOR=0.92, 95% CI (0.89, 0.95)], and lymphocyte count [AOR=0.90, 95% CI (0.88, 0.97)] were independent significant predictors of death from Covid-19. CONCLUSION: The incidence of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was found to be high. Devising individual, tailored management for patients with risk behaviors, comorbid conditions, and poor prognostic markers such as lymphopenia and low oxygen saturation, may reduce the incidence of death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","output":"Predictors of Mortality Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is one of the greatest health challenges affecting children of all ages and ethnicities.

The study aimed to analyze local strains of E. coli O157:H7 as a proapoptosis agent on the T47 breast cancer cell line. Methods: As many as 30 culture cells of T47D breast cancer cell line were subjected to purified extracts of Shiga-like toxin originating from 5 local isolates of E. coli O157:H7: KL-48(2), SM-25(1), SM-7(1), DS-21(4), and 1 isolate ATCC 43894 which was used as a control. Toxin production of each isolate was detected using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the treatment of cell lines was observed for 24 hours, with 2 replications; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tests and acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining assays were used for detection and analyses of apoptosis. Results: The study showed 2 local strains of E. coli O157:H7 (codes KL-48(2) and SM-25(1)) had toxins positive at titer 5 and 10 g/100 L. These titers were lower than the control isolate ATCC 43894, but they had a necrosis effect higher (P < .05), ie, 80.3%, than control isolate, ie, 63.3%. Other local strain SM-25(1) also had a good necrosis effect. It has a nondifferent necrosis effect (P > .05) with the control isolate ATCC 43894, ie, 13.0% from 13.3%. Conclusion: This study concludes that the Shiga toxin produced by E. coli O157:H7 local isolate (Indonesia) has potential as a proapoptotic and/or necrotic agent for treating T47 breast cancer cell lines, as effectively as ATCC 43894 control isolates.","output":"Shiga-Like Toxin Produced by Local Isolates of Escherichia coli O157:H7 Induces Apoptosis of the T47 Breast Cancer Cell Line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present narrative review presents emerging data regarding the association between diabetes mellitus and olfactory dysfunction and discusses the role of olfactory dysfunction in glucose metabolism.

Many studies have documented the, mostly negative, effects of maternal ill-health on functioning. Although conceptually important, measurement of functioning remains underdeveloped, and the best way to measure functioning in pregnant and postpartum populations is unknown. METHODS A cross-sectional study among women presenting for antenatal (N = 750) and postpartum (N = 740) care in Jamaica, Kenya and Malawi took place in 2015-2016. Functioning was measured through the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12). Data on health conditions and socio-demographic characteristics were collected through structured interview, medical record review, and clinical examination. This paper presents descriptive data on the distribution of functioning status among pregnant and postpartum women and examines the relationship between functioning and health conditions. RESULTS Women attending antenatal care had a lower level of functioning than those attending postpartum care. Women with a health condition or associated demographic risk factor were more likely to have a lower level of functioning than those with no health condition. However, the absolute difference in functioning scores typically remained modest. CONCLUSIONS Functioning is an important concept which integrates a woman-centered approach to examining how a health condition affects her life, and ultimately her return to functioning after delivery. However, the WHODAS-12 may not be the optimal tool for use in this population and additional components to capture pregnancy-specific issues may be needed. Challenges remain in how to integrate functioning outcomes into routine maternal healthcare at-scale and across diverse settings.","output":"Measurement of maternal functioning during pregnancy and postpartum: findings from the cross-sectional WHO pilot study in Jamaica, Kenya, and Malawi."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Asthma exacerbation is the most common cause of hospital admission in children. A study was undertaken to investigate the importance of allergen exposure in sensitised individuals in combination with viral infections and other potentially modifiable risk factors precipitating asthma hospital admission in children. METHODS Eighty four children aged 3-17 years admitted to hospital over a 1 year period with an acute asthma exacerbation (AA) were matched for age and sex with two control groups: stable asthmatics (SA) and children admitted to hospital with non-respiratory conditions (IC). Risk factors were assessed by questionnaires and determination of allergen sensitisation, home allergen exposure, pollen exposure, and respiratory virus infection. RESULTS Several non-modifiable factors (atopy, duration of asthma) were associated with increased risk. Among the modifiable factors, pet ownership, housing characteristics, and parental smoking did not differ between the groups. Regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment was significantly less common in the AA group than in the SA group (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6; p = 0.002). A significantly higher proportion of the AA group were virus infected (44%) and sensitised and highly exposed to sensitising allergen (76%) compared with the SA (18% and 48%) and IC groups (17% and 28%; both p<0.001). In a multiple conditional logistic regression (AA v SA), allergen sensitisation and exposure or virus detection alone were no longer independently associated with hospital admission. However, the combination of virus detection and sensitisation with high allergen exposure substantially increased the risk of admission to hospital (OR 19.4, 95% CI 3.7 to 101.5, p<0.001).

COVID+ patients were more frequently Latinos (64.7% versus 61.7%, P = 0.043) and African Americans (18.1% versus 11.2%, P < 0.001) and less frequently Caucasian (6.0% versus 14.1%, P < 0.001). Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander (7.8% versus 7.2%, P = 0.059) and Native American/Other/Unknown (3.4% versus 5.8%, P = 0.078) groups showed no statistical difference in COVID incidence. Mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay were similar between the groups and across patient populations stratified by the type of consultation. Logistic regression demonstrated higher odds of COVID+ infection amongst IPV patients (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.62-7.56, P < 0.001) compared to other ACS consultation types.

Several PP11-like proteins were annotated in distantly related organisms, such as worms and mammals, suggesting their involvement in evolutionarily conserved processes. Based on sequence similarity, human PP11 was included in a protein family whose characterized members are XendoU, a Xenopus laevis endoribonuclease involved in small nucleolar RNA processing, and Nsp15, an endoribonuclease essential for coronavirus replication. Here we show that the bacterially expressed human PP11 displays RNA binding capability and cleaves single stranded RNA in a Mn(2+)-dependent manner at uridylates, to produce molecules with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate ends. These features, together with structural and mutagenesis analyses, which identified the potential active site residues, reveal striking parallels to the amphibian XendoU and assign a ribonuclease function to PP11.

The inadequacy of the popular explanations of seasonality is discussed, and a simple hypothesis is proposed, called temperature dependent viral tropism (TDVT), that is compatible with the above features of respiratory illness. TDVT notes that viruses can spread more effectively if they moderate their pathogenicity (thereby maintaining host mobility) and suggests that endemic respiratory viruses accomplish this by developing thermal sensitivity within a range that supports organ-specific viral tropism within the human body, whereby they replicate most rapidly at temperatures below body temperature. This can confine them to the upper respiratory tract and allow them to avoid infecting the lungs, heart, gut etc. Biochemical and tissue-culture studies show that 'wild' respiratory viruses show such natural thermal sensitivity. The typical early autumn surge of colds and the occurrence of respiratory illness in the Tropics year-round at intermediate levels are explained by the tendency for strains to adapt their thermal sensitivity to their local climate and season. TDVT has important practical implications for preventing and treating respiratory illness including Covid-19. It is testable with many options for experiments to increase our understanding of viral seasonality and pathogenicity.","output":"Temperature dependent viral tropism: understanding viral seasonality and pathogenicity as applied to the avoidance and treatment of endemic viral respiratory illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 has been felt worldwide, yet we are still unsure about its full impact. One of the gaps in our current knowledge relates to the long-term mental and physical impact of the infection on affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the Netherlands at the end of February 2020, resulting in over 900,000 people testing positive for the virus, over 24,000 hospitalizations, and over 13,000 deaths by the end of January 2021. Although many patients recover from the acute phase of the disease, experience with other virus outbreaks has raised concerns regarding possible late sequelae of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an online tool to assess the long-term burden of COVID-19 in patients. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the process of development, assessment, programming, implementation, and use of this new tool: the assessment of burden of COVID-19 (ABCoV) tool. This new tool is based on the well-validated assessment of burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool. RESULTS: As of January 2021, the new ABCoV tool has been used in an online patient platform by more than 2100 self-registered patients and another 400 patients in a hospital setting, resulting in over 2500 patients. These patients have submitted the ABCoV questionnaire 3926 times. Among the self-registered patients who agreed to have their data analyzed (n=1898), the number of females was high (n=1153, 60.7%), many were medically diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=892, 47.0%), and many were relatively young with only 7.4% (n=141) being older than 60 years. Of all patients that actually used the tool (n=1517), almost one-quarter (n=356, 23.5%) used the tool twice, and only a small group (n=76, 5.0%) used the tool 6 times. CONCLUSIONS: This new ABCoV tool has been broadly and repeatedly used, and may provide insight into the perceived burden of disease, provide direction for personalized aftercare for people post COVID-19, and help us to be prepared for possible future recurrences.","output":"Online Tool for the Assessment of the Burden of COVID-19 in Patients: Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of 2020, a virus discovered in the province of Wuhan in China identified as SARS- COV-2, denominated COVID-19, began to spread globally, being identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on March 13 since the epidemic has spread to several countries in all the continents and affects a large number of people (WHO 2020). In Peru the entry of COVID-19 caused the Peruvian government to take different options to control its spread such as mandatory quarantines and lockdowns.

We aimed to evaluate and estimate the global prevalence of coronavirus-associated C. auris infection (CACa). METHODS: We searched related databases between December 2019 and April 2022 for studies that reported data about CACa. Meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc software version 20.104 according to the DerSimonian and Laird method applying the random-effects model. We evaluated heterogeneity using the 2 -based Q statistic (significant for p-value < .1) and the I2 statistic (>75% indicative of 'notable' heterogeneity). Moreover, if possible, an odds ratio (OR) analysis was performed for eligible data. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis includes ten eligible studies, including 1942 patients hospitalised with COVID-19; 129 were C. auris cases. The overall pooled prevalence of CACa was estimated at 5.7%. The mortality rate of CACa was estimated at 67.849%. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (59.374%), followed by diabetes mellitus (52.898%) and cardiovascular diseases (31.392%). Men with a prevalence rate of 80.012% were 3.27 (OR) times more prone to getting infected by C. auris. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the prevalence of C. auris infections decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic and the prevalence gradient changed from Asia to America. Unfortunately, there are many descriptive studies with duplicate content in the field of epidemiology of C. auris infections which are increasing every day.

Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.","output":"In silico analysis suggests less effective MHC-II presentation of SARS-CoV-2 RBM peptides: Implication for neutralizing antibody responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) has disrupted the traditional clinical services all over the world.

In this work, we consider three kinds of typical behavioral changes in epidemic process that is, self-quarantine of infected individuals, self-protection of susceptible individuals, and social distancing between them. We connect the behavioral changes with individual's social attributes by the activity-driven network with attractiveness. A mean-field theory is established to derive an analytical estimate of epidemic threshold for SIS models with individual behavioral changes, which depends on the correlations between activity, attractiveness and the number of generative links in the susceptible and infected states. We find that individual behaviors play different roles in suppressing the epidemic. Although all the behavioral changes could delay the epidemic by increasing the epidemic threshold, self-quarantine and social distancing of infected individuals could effectively decrease the epidemic size. In addition, simultaneous changes in these behaviors and the timing of implement of them also play a key role in suppressing the epidemic.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPPE on ERCP success parameters compared to standard PPE (SPPE). METHODS: ERCP procedures were evaluated retrospectively and ERCP outcomes were compared for similar time periods as before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were cannulation time, number of cannulation attempts, cannulation success rate, difficult cannulation rate, undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rate, ERCP-related adverse events, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty ERCP procedures were examined. One hundred and fifty-nine procedures were excluded due to missing data, previous sphincterotomy or altered anatomy. Of the final eligible sample size of 221 ERCPs, 93 were performed using SPPE and 128 were performed under EPPE. Indications of ERCP and demographic parameters were similar between groups. The majority of the ERCP cases included were for benign biliary obstruction of common bile duct stones (88.7%). No significant differences were detected in overall technical success (91.4% vs 92.2%, p = 0.832), cannulation success rates (94.6% vs 96.8%, p = 0.403), cannulation times (median times of both groups were 3 min, p = 0.824), difficult cannulation rates (37.6% vs 33.6%, p = 0.523), undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rates (29% vs 22.7%, p = 0.593), number of cannulation attempts (2.80 vs 2.71, p = 0.731), ERCP-related adverse events (9.7% vs 10.9%, p = 0.762), and length of hospital stay (6.63 vs 6.92 days, p = 0.768) between SPPE and EPPE groups, respectively.

In this work, we propose a methodology to extract the consumption behaviors of a large sample of customers through credit card transaction data. The main outcome of the methodology is a concise representation of the economic behavior of people residing in a city, the so-called city consumption profile. We inferred the city consumption profile from a network-based representation of the similarity among the customers in terms of purchase allocation; on top of which we applied a community detection algorithm to identify the representative consumption profiles. By applying the above methodology to a set of credit card transactions of an Italian financial group, we showed that cities, even geographically close, exhibit different profiles which makes them unique. Specifically, usage patterns focused on a single type of good/servicemono-categorical consumption profileare the main factors leading to the differences in the city profiles. Our analysis also showed that there is a group of consumption profiles common to all cities, made up by purchases of primary goods/services, such as food or clothing. In general, the city consumption profile represents a tool for understanding the economic behaviors of the citizens and for comparing different cities.

The current COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge on mental health, e.g., through increased levels of anxiety, depression and fears about the future. As most mental illnesses develop before the age of 25, young people are a critical target group for prevention. Mental health literacy (MHL) is considered to be a key determinant of positive mental health, thus, being crucial for mental health promotion and dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic. This project aims at (i) adapting an evidence-based MHL curriculum for German schools, as school-based interventions are suitable in reaching most young people, and (ii) evaluating its acceptance and effectiveness regarding MHL and stigmatizing attitudes. METHODS: An interdisciplinary team including representatives from self-help groups for mental health translated and adapted the Canadian TeenMentalHealth curriculum for German schools. The evaluation design includes a pre, post, follow-up assessment of MHL, stigmatizing attitudes, and help-seeking efficacy. RESULTS: For better applicability of the curriculum, the original program was shortened, while keeping its core contents such as knowledge and myths around mental health and illness. Written and digital material was developed and distributed to teachers, which were trained to deliver the intervention. Preliminary results show high acceptability, a significant increase in MHL and a decrease in stigmatizing attitudes, while help-seeking efficacy remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: An MHL intervention was successfully adapted for the German school setting.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of the EPaNIC follow-up cohort (NCT00512122) including 433 patients screened with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) between 1 and 5 years following ICU admission. Exercise capacity in 5-year ICU survivors (N = 361) was referenced to a historic sedentary population and further compared to demographically matched controls (N = 49). In 5-year ICU survivors performing a maximal CPET (respiratory exchange ratio > 1.05, N = 313), abnormal exercise capacity was defined as peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)peak) < 85% of predicted peak oxygen consumption (%predVO(2)peak), based on the historic sedentary population. Exercise liming factors were identified. To study the association between severity of organ failure, quantified as the maximal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score during ICU-stay (SOFA-max), and exercise capacity as assessed with VO(2)peak, a linear mixed model was built, adjusting for predefined confounders and including all follow-up CPET studies. RESULTS: Exercise capacity was abnormal in 118/313 (37.7%) 5-year survivors versus 1/48 (2.1%) controls with a maximal CPET, p < 0.001. Aerobic exercise capacity was lower in 5-year survivors than in controls (VO(2)peak: 24.0  9.7 ml/min/kg versus 31.7  8.4 ml/min/kg, p < 0.001; %predVO(2)peak: 94%  31% versus 123%  25%, p < 0.001). Muscular limitation frequently contributed to impaired exercise capacity at 5-year [71/118 (60.2%)]. SOFA-max independently associated with VO(2)peak throughout follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Critical illness survivors often display abnormal aerobic exercise capacity, frequently involving muscular limitation. Severity of organ failure throughout the ICU stay independently associates with these impairments.

These measures, however, came at a cost for older adults who faced major mental health issues because of social isolation. The impact of social isolation remains well documented in the wake of the pandemic. This paper explored the lived experiences of older adults living in the community during the Covid-19 sanitary lockdown in the small-island state of Mauritius. As a small-island state with family structures that still skew towards extended or modified extended families, it was interesting to explore whether older adults would be reporting feelings of social isolation as was being reported elsewhere. This study utilized a qualitative approach using a lifeworld hermeneutical approach with 15 older adult participants, recruited through convenience and snowball sampling, in the community. Data were collected using a narrative approach supplemented by an interview guide. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from transcribed and translated data. Six themes were discovered: Fears of the virus and fear of deprivation; Reliving and recreating bonds; Active contribution to family life; Being and feeling valued within the family; Rediscovering family time and family moments; and Fear of going back to 'normal'. The study revealed positive experiences of the lockdown period characterised by an increase bonding in the family, deepening of familial bond, and increased value despite an initial apprehension of the lockdown. A renewed sense of purpose as well as deepening of bonds was reported by older adults. Some limitations in relation to data trustworthiness and respondents bias, however, could not be avoided since the study was carried out during sanitary lockdown period. The feelings of social isolation and depression reported by older adults who lived alone were not seen in this study, suggesting that the family structure may have a role to play in mitigating these effects. There would also be a need to explore similar small-island states or similar cultures where the effects of sanitary lockdowns may be different from current literature.","output":"Lived experiences of older adults living in the community during the COVID-19 lockdown - The case of mauritius."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus is part of the flaviviruses that spread through the Aedes mosquito species and causes neurological infectious diseases.

Long-term studies on earthquake disasters show depression requires specialized psychiatric/psychological interventions. However, the pandemic characterized by long-term isolation and lockdowns, economic adversity, and disease and death may produce distinctive mental health demands for the future. This baseline survey aims to evaluate the associations of pandemic factors with depression.Methods: We surveyed 2000 participants 18 years-and-older by two-city stratified telephonic random sampling in Kazakhstan. Survey-adjusted Poisson regression analyses produced probable depression prevalence ratios (PRs) for COVID-19 death and disease related factors, and pandemic-related economic and socio-psychological factors. CESD-16 was utilized to measure depression. Findings: Pandemic factors including household suspected having-or-diagnosed with COVID-19 with depression PR=148 (95% CI 109-202;p=0013), friends/coworkers diagnosed with COVD-19 with PR=143 (104-195;p=0026), lost employment PR=180 (104-311;p=0037), and insufficient income for food PR=154 (115-206;p=0004) were independently associated with probable depression. Contrastingly, having COVID-19 deaths among family/friends or acquaintances/coworkers were not associated with depression. Neither was fear of developing disease or perceived threat of COVID-19, but family stress had a dose-response association, with PR=1342 (711-2532;p<0001) for very high stress. Associated non-pandemic factors included female sex, younger age, lower education, marriage status and chronic diseases.Interpretation: Some pandemic depression factors relate to economic survival. Disease among family, friends and others may increase awareness of risk. For deaths, bereavement is time-limited, thus appears not associated with depression. Psychopathology trajectory may be closer to that of earthquake survivors.Funding: Nazarbayev UniversityDeclaration of Interest: None to declare.

For pairwise risk spillovers, GB offers more diversification opportunities when volatility is very low. Nevertheless, the diversification benefits increase during the COVID period. The strong bidirectional risk spillovers between GB and conventional bonds imply that GB can be considered a good alternative to traditional bonds while benefiting from their diversification potential, particularly with energy and agriculture.

However, the uneven distribution of health service facilities in terms of space and size may lead to prolonged crowding during testing, thus increasing the chance of virus cross-infection. Therefore, appropriate control of crowd exposure time in large-scale virus testing should be an important goal in the layout of urban community health facilities.

Then, an agent-based simulation model was used to simulate the reasonable screening efficiency of community health service facilities during certain-exposure time at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and under different screening processes. Eventually, the screening efficiency was evaluated for all community health service centers in Wuhan. During the early period of the pandemic, 23.13% of communities failed to complete virus testing of community residents within 2 h of certain-exposure time, leaving approximately 56.07% of the population unscreened; during the later period of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 53% of communities and 75% of residents could not be screened.

This study presents a method for identifying the exact locations, emission rates, and release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources simultaneously released at constant rates, by considering sensor thresholds and measurement errors. The method uses a two-stage procedure for rapid source identification. Before the release of contaminants, only a limited number of time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations need to be conducted. After the release of contaminants, the method can be executed in real-time.

Depressive symptoms are a risk factor of early work exit and are more common in women. To extend working lives, pathways leading to these sex inequalities need to be identified. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sex and gender with depressive symptoms in older workers, and the role of working conditions in this association. METHODS: We used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (2012C2013/2015C2016, n = 313). Our outcome was depressive symptoms, measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. We included biological sex, a gender index ranging from masculine to feminine (consisting of six items measuring gender roles: working hours, income, occupation segregation, education, informal caregiving, time spent on household chores), and working conditions (physical demands, psychosocial demands, cognitive demands, autonomy, task variation, social support) in our models. We examined the differential vulnerability hypothesis, i.e., sex/gender moderates the association between working conditions and depressive symptoms, and the differential exposure hypothesis, i.e., working conditions mediate the association between sex/gender and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Female sex and feminine gender were both associated with more depressive symptoms. The differential vulnerability hypothesis was not supported by our results. We did find that femininity was negatively associated with autonomy and task variation. In turn, these working conditions were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Thus, autonomy and task variation partially mediated the association between gender and depressive symptoms, supporting the differential exposure hypothesis. Mediation effects for sex inequalities were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Older female workers and older feminine workers have more depressive symptoms than their male/masculine counterparts. Autonomy and task variation appeared to be important in C partially C explaining gender differences in depressive symptoms rather than sex differences.

Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent shelter-in-place mandates yielded an additional 29.0% reduction. Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth two to four weeks later. For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later. Given the continued reliance on social distancing policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, these results may be helpful to public health officials trying to balance infection control with the economic and social consequences of these policies.","output":"Impacts of social distancing policies on mobility and COVID-19 case growth in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whether kidney transplant recipients are capable of mounting an effective anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) adaptive immune response despite chronic immunosuppression is unknown and has important implications for therapy. Herein, we analyzed peripheral blood cell surface and intracellular cytokine phenotyping by flow cytometry along with serum antibody testing in 18 kidney transplant recipients with active coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and 36 matched, transplanted controls without COVID-19. We observed significantly fewer total lymphocytes and fewer circulating memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the COVID-19 subjects. We also showed fewer anergic and senescent CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 individuals, but no differences in exhausted CD8+ T cells, nor in any of these CD4+ T cell subsets between groups.

However, little is known about its potential effect on neuropsychiatric injuries induced or accompanied by metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids. METHODS: A nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rat model was induced via a high-fat diet (HFD), and glucolipid parameters and liver function were measured. Behavioral performance was observed via the open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM). The plasma levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) and TREM2 were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expression levels of Synapsin-1 (Syn-1), Synaptatogmin-1 (Syt-1), TREM1 and TREM2 in the hippocampus were detected using western blotting. Morphological changes in the liver and hippocampus were detected by HE and Oil red or silver staining. RESULTS: Compared with the control rats, HFD-induced NAFLD model rats presented significant metabolic dysfunction, hepatocyte steatosis, and impaired learning and memory ability, as indicated by the increased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), the impaired glucose tolerance, the accumulated fat droplets and balloon-like changes in the liver, and the increased escaping latency but decreased duration in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze. All these changes were reversed in QUE-treated rats. Moreover, apart from improving the morphological injuries in the hippocampus, treatment with QUE could increase the decreased plasma concentration and hippocampal protein expression of TREM1 in NAFLD rats and increase the decreased expression of Syn-1 and Syt-1 in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested the therapeutic potential of QUE against NAFLD-associated impairment of learning and memory, and the mechanism might involve regulating the metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids and balancing the protein expression of synaptic plasticity markers and TREM1/2 in the hippocampus.","output":"Protective effect of quercetin against the metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids and its associated learning and memory impairments in NAFLD rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The demand for charcoal in Africa is growing rapidly, driven by urbanization and lack of access to electricity. Charcoal production and use, including plastic burning to initiate combustion, release large quantities of trace gases and particles that impact air quality and climate.

While nephrologists may think that how patients do this is up to them and their insurance companies, there is growing evidence that providing advice on how to commute to dialysis is part of an integrated care plan for dialysis patients. In this issue of Clinical Kidney Journal, two reports emphasize the importance of transport modality on dialysis patient well-being and even survival. Rincon et al. report on the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Spanish haemodialysis unit. A key source of infection was related to access to healthcare or elderly care facilities. Indeed, healthcare transportation with future symptomatic [odds ratio (OR) = 3.33] or asymptomatic (OR = 4.73) COVID-19 patients increased the risk of infection. Working with transport providers to minimize cross-infection between patients during transport was one of the measures taken to stop disease transmission. Lessons learned from COVID-19 may also apply to influenza and other infections. In the second report, Yazawa et al. describe an association between transport modality to the dialysis facility and health-related quality of life (QOL) among haemodialysis patients in the Japanese Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study.

Machine learning (ML) approaches combined to chemoinformatics are of valuable input to this field. We, herein, focused on implementing multiple ML algorithms that shall learn from different molecular fingerprints (FPs) of 65 057 molecules that have been identified as active or inactive against Leishmania major promastigotes. We sought to build a classifier able to predict whether a given molecule has the potential of being anti-leishmanial or not. Using the RDkit library, we calculated 5 molecular FPs of the molecules. Then, we implemented 4 ML algorithms that we trained and tested for their ability to classify the molecules into active/inactive classes based on their chemical structure, encoded by the molecular FPs. Best performers were random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), while atom-pair and topology torsion FPs were the best embedding functions. Both models were further assessed on different stratification levels of the dataset and showed stable performances. At last, we used them to predict the potential of molecules within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs collection to present anti-Leishmania effects. We ranked these drugs according to their anti-Leishmanial probability and obtained in total seven anti-Leishmania agents, previously described in the literature, within the top 10 of each model. This validates the robustness of the approach, the algorithms, and FPs choices as well as the importance of the dataset size and content. We further engaged these molecules into reverse docking experiments on 3D crystal structures of seven well-studied Leishmania drug targets and could predict the molecular targets for 4 drugs.

The UK government introduced strict social distancing measures on 23rd March 2020, with the country put into a full lockdown to further halt the spread of the virus. The aims of this article are to ascertain whether there was a rise in the incidence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) presentations to the emergency department at a level one trauma center associated with the introduction of lockdown measures. METHOD: An observational study from a level one trauma center was carried out. Retrospective data from 23rd March 2020 to 1st May 2020 was collected and compared to the same time period in 2019. Data was collected from coded electronic patient records. RESULTS: Total attendances to the Emergency Department (ED) reduced from 2019 to 2020 (5198 and 3059 respectively). There was a significant increase in the total number of self-harm presentations between 2019 and 2020 (103 vs 113, p-value <0.001) as well as paracetamol, NSAID and opiate overdoses, with more cases requiring hospital admission in 2020 vs 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Societal lockdown measures secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant effect on the mental health of patients.

Comparative studies with other receptor-binding domain (RBD)-directed antibodies showed 10-40 to have the greatest breadth against sarbecoviruses and thus its promise as an agent for pandemic preparedness. Moreover, structural analyses on 10-40 and similar antibodies not only defined an epitope cluster in the inner face of the RBD that is well conserved among sarbecoviruses, but also uncovered a new antibody class with a common CDRH3 motif.

The goal is to achieve an effective NpC inhibitory concentration (IC) in the target airway surface liquid (ASL); (ii) We evaluate the clinical safety of such dosages, drawing on information from animal testing data and regulatory limits in the USA for such nanoparticles aerosol inhalation safety. Our analysis indicates a wide range of potentially safe and effective dosages that can be clinically explored, targeting the upper respiratory and bronchial tree system. Similar dosages can also provide antibacterial effectiveness for prophylactic treatment in hospital intensive care units to lower the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Our calculations are phenomenological, independent of mechanisms. Nevertheless, we highlight a mechanism of action by which any suitably designed NpC, with nanoparticles sized 2C10 nm and having a large negative zeta-potential, preferentially bind to viruses with predominantly positively-charged spike proteins. These will be ineffective against viruses with predominantly negatively-charged spike proteins. Accordingly, the popular silver metal base for NpC serves just as a construction ingredient, and other metal or metal-oxides which can serve to construct the noted nanoparticle properties would be similarly effective.

As we illustrate here, this virus-like particle assembly system is an ideal tool to study the interactions between the essential assembly partners M and E in molecular detail. Taking a mutagenetic approach we demonstrate that envelope assembly is critically sensitive to changes in the primary structure of both terminal domains of the M protein. The effects were most dramatically observed after mutation of the carboxy-terminal domain where the deletion of just one single amino acid at the extreme terminus abolished particle formation almost completely. But also some subtle mutations in the amino-terminal domain were severely inhibitory to the assembly process. Interestingly, mutant M proteins that were themselves incompetent to support particle formation appeared to inhibit, in a concentration dependent manner, the assembly of particles by wild-type M and E protein.","output":"Coronavirus envelope assembly is sensitive to changes in the terminal regions of the viral M protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE There are little clinical data assessing the antineoplastic effect of metformin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

METHODS An institutional database was used to identify patients with stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection between 2004 and 2013. Patients were divided into 3 cohorts: type II diabetic patients with metformin exposure (cohort A, n = 81), type II diabetic patients without metformin exposure (cohort B, n = 57), and nondiabetic individuals (cohort C, n = 77). Univariate, multivariate, and propensity-matched analyses were performed to assess progression-free and overall survivals between groups. RESULTS A total of 215 patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer treated with surgical resection were identified for analysis with a median follow-up of 19.5 months. Patients in cohort A had lower T- and N-stage tumors than those in cohorts B or C. However, on multivariate analysis adjusting for age, gender, and T and N stage, progression-free survival was greater for cohort A than cohort B (hazard ratio [HR], 0.410; 95% confidence interval, 0.199-0.874; P = .022) or cohort C (HR, 0.415; 95% confidence interval, 0.201-0.887; P = .017). Likewise, when propensity-matched analyses were performed, cohort A demonstrated a trend toward improved progression-free survival compared with cohort B (P = .057; HR, 0.44; c-statistic = 0.832) and improved progression-free survival compared with cohort C (P = .02; HR, 0.41; c-statistic = 0.843). No differences were observed in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Metformin exposure in diabetic patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer may be associated with improved progression-free survival, but no effect was seen on overall survival.

Our study focuses on this funding scheme to investigate the relevance, effects and benefits of conducting preclinical SRs on researchers and their research. METHODS: We recruited researchers who attended funded preclinical SR workshops and who conducted, are still conducting, or prematurely stopped a SR with funded coaching. We gathered data using online questionnaires followed by semi-structured interviews. Both aimed to explore the impact of conducting a SR on researchers subsequent work, attitudes, and views about their research field. Data-analysis was performed using Excel and ATLAS.ti. RESULTS: Conducting preclinical SRs had two distinct types of impact. First, the researchers acquired new skills and insights, leading to a change in mindset regarding the quality of animal research. This was mainly seen in the way participants planned, conducted and reported their subsequent animal studies, which were more transparent and of a higher quality than their previous work. Second, participants were eager to share their newly acquired knowledge within their laboratories and to advocate for change within their research teams and fields of interest. In particular, they emphasised the need for preclinical SRs and improved experimental design within preclinical research, promoting these through education and published opinion papers. CONCLUSION: Being trained and coached in the conduct of preclinical SRs appears to be a contributing factor to many beneficial changes which will impact the quality of preclinical research in the long-term.

Infants (aged <2 years) and 18C23-year-olds were most likely to be tested; there was no clear trend in testing rates by SIMD quintile. 18C23-year-olds, females, and those from the most deprived SIMD quintile were most likely to test positive. 379 participants had an admission with COVID-19, corresponding to a rate of 320 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 289C354). Females (admission rate 354 per 100 000 person-years [95% CI 309C406]) and infants (1435 per 100 000 person-years [1133C1817]) were most likely to be admitted to hospital. There was a clear gradient in hospital admissions by SIMD, with participants in the most deprived quintile (429 per 100 000 person-years [361C508]) experiencing 19 times (95% CI 13C26) the admission rate compared with those in the least deprived (226 per 100 000 person-years [169C303]). Interpretation Rates of infection and admissions with COVID-19 were associated with area-level deprivation among children and young people. Infants had a relatively low infection rate but the highest admission rate. Analyses examining risk factors, including ethnic group and long-term conditions are underway, to inform the public health response to SARS-CoV-2 in children. Although children and young people in Scotland had low COVID-19-related admission rates versus adults, a socioeconomic gradient was evident, indicating children living in more deprived areas are at increased risk of short-term, and potential long-term, health and education impacts of COVID-19.

To what extent can audiovisual information evoke the smells of a real, complex, and multimodal environment? To investigate smellscape imagination, we compared results from two studies. In the first, onsite participants (N = 15) made a sensory walk through seven locations of an open-air market. In the second, online participants (N = 53) made a virtual walk through the same locations reproduced with audio and video recordings. Responses in the form of free-form verbal annotations, ratings with semantic scales, and a smell wheel, were analysed for environmental quality, smell source type and strength, and hedonic tone. The degree of association between real and imagined smellscapes was measured through canonical correlation analysis. Hedonic tone, as expressed through frequency counts of keywords in free-form annotations was significantly associated, suggesting that smell sources might generally be correctly inferred from audiovisual information, when such imagination is required. On the other hand, onsite ratings of olfactory quality were not significantly associated with online ratings of audiovisual reproductions, when participants were not specifically asked to imagine smells. We discuss findings in the light of cross-modal association, categorisation, and memory recall of smells.","output":"Real and Imagined Smellscapes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article on p. 85 in vol. 11, PMID: 32257774.].","output":"Corrigendum to \\"Coronavirus Disease-19: The First 7,755 Cases in the Republic of Korea\\" [Osong Public Health Res Perspect 2020;11(2):85-90]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped and harbor an unusually large (30C32 kb) positive-strand linear RNA genome Highly pathogenic coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV) in humans The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infects mice and serves as an ideal model of viral pathogenesis, mainly because experiments can be conducted using animal-biosafety level-2 (A-BSL2) containment Human thymosin beta-4 (T4), a 43-residue peptide with an acetylated N-terminus, is widely expressed in human tissues T4 regulates actin polymerization and functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule and an antioxidant as well as a promoter of wound healing and angiogenesis These activities led us to test whether T4 serves to treat coronavirus infections of humans To test this possibility, here, we established a BALB/c mouse model of coronavirus infection using mouse CoV MHV-A59 to evaluate the potential protective effect of recombinant human T4 (rhT4) Such a system can be employed under A-BSL2 containment instead of A-BSL3 that is required to study coronaviruses infectious for humans We found that rhT4 significantly increased the survival rate of mice infected with MHV-A59 through inhibiting virus replication, balancing the host's immune response, alleviating pathological damage, and promoting repair of the liver These results will serve as the basis for further application of rhT4 to the treatment of human CoV diseases such as COVID-19 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Mediators of Inflammation is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Recombinant Human Thymosin Beta-4 Protects against Mouse Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is limited information describing the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized older patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective cohort study in 13 acute COVID-19 geriatric wards, from March 13 to April 15, 2020, in Paris area. All consecutive patients aged &#8805; 70 years, with confirmed COVID-19, were enrolled. RESULTS: Of the 821 patients included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 86 (7) years; 58% were female; 85% had &#8805; 2 comorbidities; 29% lived in an institution; and the median (interquartile range) Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL) score was 4 [2-6]. The most common symptoms at COVID-19 onset were asthenia (63%), fever (55%), dyspnea (45%), dry cough (45%) and delirium (25%). The in-hospital mortality was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27 to 33). On multivariate analysis, at COVID-19 onset, the probability of in-hospital mortality was increased with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.63), ADL score < 4 (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.70), asthenia (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.32), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score &#8805; 2 (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.22) and specific COVID-19 anomalies on chest computerized tomography (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.46). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information about older patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized. A quick bedside evaluation at admission of sex, functional status, systolic arterial pressure, consciousness, respiratory rate and asthenia can identify older patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 821 Older Patients With SARS-Cov-2 Infection Admitted to Acute Care Geriatric Wards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectif Le confinement de la population durant la pandmie de COVID-19 a eu des consquences sanitaires majeures parmi lesquelles le dveloppement ou la rcidive de troubles psychiques et de troubles du sommeil.
