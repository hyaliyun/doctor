In conclusion by utilising a large consecutively recruited dataset we demonstrate that liver fibrosis is infrequently screened for in patients with diabetes despite high prevalence rates of advanced fibrosis.

Nurse practitioner (NP) students need a minimum of 500 direct care hours in addition to indirect hours. Simulation experiences may not be used as direct patient care hours for NP students, but telehealth experiences may be used if the focus is on obtaining similar competencies to what would be acquired with face-to-face patient experiences. One college of nursing adapted several opportunities for NP students to acquire indirect clinical experiences and specific NP competencies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Several different clinically focused teaching methodologies were planned and implemented. These varied by NP specialty track and included complex case analyses, virtual (Zoom) rounds, well-child cases, and objective structured clinical examinations. These adapted clinical experiences are effective methods of helping students acquire clinical competencies and skills; however, they bring their own challenges. Post-COVID may be a time of new beginnings, moving nursing education forward on finding new and better ways to ensure that students acquire clinical competencies.

We have developed a novel bioluminescence-based biosensor to probe a key host-virus interaction during viral entry: the binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Derived from Nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT), the biosensor is composed of Nanoluciferase split into two complementary subunits, Large BiT and Small BiT, fused to the Spike S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. The ACE2-S1 interaction results in reassembly of functional Nanoluciferase, which catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction that can be assayed in a highly sensitive and specific manner. We demonstrate the biosensor's large dynamic range, enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. In addition, we show the biosensor's versatility towards the high-throughput screening of drugs which disrupt the ACE2-S1 interaction, as well as its ability to act as a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Results obtained with our biosensor correlate well with those obtained with a Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus assay.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents with CP (ages 10-19 years) who completed a child-modified version of the Coronavirus Disability Survey (COV-DIS). Health and behavior items were associated with the perceived lifestyle impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 101 respondents completed the survey (mean age 14  2 years). Respondents reported minimal-to-no change in general health since the COVID-19 outbreak. Basic needs were met for most families. Nearly all participants (94.1%) reported a mental health concern that resulted from COVID-19: 32.7% felt down or depressed; 47.5% felt little pleasure in doing things; and 64.4% felt isolated. Moreover, 74.3% reported decreased socialization; 51.5% reported reduced exercise participation; 43.6% reported difficulties in obtaining medical care.

We present our experience of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transplant patients in one of the most affected parts of the UK with direct comparison to waitlisted patients. METHODS: A single-center prospective study of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive waitlisted and transplant patients was undertaken to compare these groups and assess clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 60 consecutive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were identified with 32 active waitlisted patients and 28 functioning renal transplants. Demographics were similar. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in the waitlisted group was 9.9% compared to 1.9% in renal transplant patients (P < 0.001). Immunosuppression did not influence initial symptomology. Fifteen percent of patients in the waitlisted and 32% in the transplant groups died (P = 0.726). Mortality as proportion of total waitlisted (321 patients) and transplant population (1434 patients) of our centre was 1.5% and 0.6% (P < 0.001), respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) at 48 h and peak CRP were associated with mortality in both groups while quick sequential organ failure assessment score at 48 h (P = 0.036) was associated with mortality for transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of COVID-19 is higher in the waitlisted population but transplant patients have more severe disease, reflected by higher mortality. CRP at 48 h can be used as a predictive tool.

However, some experience is required to get accustomed to its unpredictable fluoroscopic visibility during injection. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of radiopacity change in a simulated embolization procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a bench-top Onyx injection experiment simulating a typical brain arteriovenous malformation embolization, nine cycles of casting modes (continuous injection) and plugging modes (injection with intermittent pauses) were performed. Radiodensity of Onyx droplets collected from the microcatheter tip and the distal head portion of the microcatheter were measured as time lapsed. Distribution of droplet radiodensity (radiodensity) and distribution of radiographic grade (grade) were analyzed and compared by repeated measurements. RESULTS Within-group analysis revealed no significant radiodensity change with time (P>0.05). The radiodensity was significantly higher in the casting mode than in the plugging mode (P<0.01). The lateral radiograph of the microcatheter showed higher radiopacity (P<0.01) and better evenness (P<0.01) in the casting mode than in the plugging mode. A significant difference in microcatheter attenuation (both radiographic grade mean and SD; P<0.01) was noted between the two modes. Radiodensity had a significant influence on the radiopacity and radiopacity evenness of the microcatheter.

In contrast, inhibition of sodium channels or activation of PKC leads to enhanced virus production in tissue culture. These diametrically opposing effects strongly support a role for PKC activity and the regulation of Na(+) currents in influenza virus replication and both may serve as targets for antiviral drugs.

While several cohorts from China have been described, there is little data describing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Irish patients with COVID-19. To improve our understanding of this infection we performed a retrospective review of patient data to examine the clinical characteristics of patients admitted for COVID-19 hospital treatment. Methods: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data on the first 100 patients admitted to Mater Misericordiae University Hospital for in-patient COVID-19 treatment after onset of the outbreak in March 2020 was extracted from patient records. Results The median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR] =34-64 years), 58% were male, and 63% were Irish nationals. Patients had symptoms for a median of five days before diagnosis (IQR=2.5-7 days), most commonly cough (72%), fever (65%), dyspnoea (37%), fatigue (28%), myalgia (27%) and headache (24%). Of all cases, 54 had at least one pre-existing chronic illness (most commonly hypertension, diabetes mellitus or asthma). At initial assessment, the most common abnormal findings were: C-reactive protein >7.0mg/L (74%), ferritin >247g/L (women) or >275g/L (men) (62%), D-dimer >0.5g/dL (62%), chest imaging (59%), NEWS Score (modified) of 3 (55%) and heart rate >90/min (51%). Supplemental oxygen was required by 27 patients, of which 17 were admitted to the intensive care unit - 14 requiring ventilation. Antiviral therapy was administered to 40 patients (most commonly hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir). Four died, 17 were admitted to intensive care, and 74 were discharged home, with nine days the median hospital stay (IQR=6-11). Conclusion Our findings reinforce the consensus of COVID-19 as an acute life-threatening disease and highlights the importance of laboratory (ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer) and radiological parameters, in addition to clinical parameters.

A major endeavor in vision science, therefore, is to uncover the image statistics that predict perceptual and cognitive function. When searching for targets in natural images, for example, it has recently been proposed that target detection is inversely related to the spatial similarity of the target to its local background. We tested this hypothesis by measuring observers sensitivity to targets that were blended with natural image backgrounds. Targets were designed to have a spatial structure that was either similar or dissimilar to the background. Contrary to masking from similarity, we found that observers were most sensitive to targets that were most similar to their backgrounds. We hypothesized that a coincidence of phase alignment between target and background results in a local contrast signal that facilitates detection when target-background similarity is high. We confirmed this prediction in a second experiment. Indeed, we show that, by solely manipulating the phase of a target relative to its background, the target can be rendered easily visible or undetectable. Our study thus reveals that, in addition to its structural similarity, the phase of the target relative to the background must be considered when predicting detection sensitivity in natural images.","output":"Spatial structure, phase, and the contrast of natural images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted in respiratory droplets and aerosol particles, which are released during talking, breathing, coughing, and sneezing.

It is our objective to assess demographic, clinical, and outcome variables of patients requiring hospitalization for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing fully vaccinated and boosted (FV&B) and unvaccinated (UV) patients. Methods: This multicenter observational cohort analysis compared demographic, clinical, and outcome variables in FV&B and UV adults hospitalized for COVID-19. A sub-analysis of FV&B patients requiring intensive care (ICU) care versus non-ICU care was performed to describe and analyze common symptom presentations, initial vital signs, initial laboratory workup, and pertinent medication use in these two groups. Results: Between August 12th, 2021 and December 6th, 2021, 4,571 patient encounters had a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 and required inpatient treatment at an acute-care hospital system in Southeastern Michigan. Of the 4,571 encounters requiring hospitalization, 65(1.4%) were FV&B and 2,935(64%) were UV. FV&B individuals were older (74 [67, 81] vs 58 [45, 70]; p <0.001) with a higher proportion of immunocompromised individuals (32.3% vs 10.4%; p<0.001). Despite a significantly higher baseline risk of in-hospital mortality in the FV&B group compared to the UV (Elixhauser 16 vs 8 (p <0.001)), there was a trend toward lower in-hospital mortality (7.7% vs 12.1%; p=0.38) among FV&B patients.

Conclusions: Fully vaccinated and boosted individuals requiring hospital-level care for breakthrough COVID-19 tended to have less severe outcomes despite appearing to be higher risk at baseline when compared to unvaccinated individuals during the same time period. Specifically, there was a trend that FV&B group had lower rates of mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, and in-hospital mortality.

Here, focal demyelinating lesions (FDLs) were generated in mice by two-point stereotactic injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the corpus callosum. Cognitive functions, sensorimotor abilities and histopathological changes were assessed for up to 28 days post-injury with or without VPA treatment. Primary OPCs were harvested and used to study the effect of VPA on OPC differentiation under inflammatory conditions. VPA dose-dependently attenuated learning and memory deficits and robustly protected white matter after FDL induction, as demonstrated by reductions in SMI-32 and increases in myelin basic protein staining. VPA also promoted OPC proliferation and differentiation and increased subsequent remyelination efficiency by day 28 post-FDL induction. VPA treatment did not affect HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC8 expression but reduced HDAC3 protein levels. In vitro, VPA improved the survival of mouse OPCs and promoted their differentiation into oligodendrocytes following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. LPS caused OPCs to overexpress HDAC3, which translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it directly interacted with the nuclear transcription factor PPAR-?3 and negatively regulated PPAR-?3 expression.

We will search the following electronic databases (from inception onwards): MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and JBI-Evidence databases. Grey literature will be identified through the Google search engine. We will include all types of literature in English, published and unpublished, including any study design, reviews, clinical practice guidelines, policy reports, and other documents. No restrictions on publication date of sources of evidence will be applied. International literature should examine structural stigma associated with BPD in any healthcare setting such as, outpatients, inpatients, primary health care, or community-based facilities. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts, and full-text citations. Quality appraisal of the included sources of evidence will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018 version. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., thematic analysis) methods. DISCUSSION This review is anticipated to enhance both identification and understanding of those structures in health systems (i.e., institutional policies, cultural norms, and practices) that manifest and perpetuate stigma experienced by consumers with BPD and their carers/families. The findings can be used to inform future research, policy, and practice relating to stigma reduction strategies that can be adopted to improve the provision of BPD-responsive services and care for this population.

The purpose of this paper is to scope the literature and synthesise findings on the inequalities and mental health within secure mental health settings.Design/methodology/approachSix electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. These were included if they examined the association between inequalities and mental health in womens secure mental health settings.FindingsOf the 608 studies reviewed, 14 met the inclusion criteria. In these papers, violence and/or abuse were described as the most prevalent inequalities. The second most frequent group of inequalities identified were socio-economic. Only three published studies researched the impact of ethnicities. Physical health, alcohol abuse and a dysfunctional family upbringing were only mentioned in one of the studies. Gender identity, transitioning and sexual orientation was not considered in any papers. These are areas, which require further investigation to determine their specific impact in this setting.Research limitations/implicationsThis review highlights the dearth of high-quality research-based evidence underpinning an understanding of the impact of inequalities on women in secure mental health settings. The existing studies suggest that inequalities have a very particular impact and that intersectionality plays a key role. Further research is required to further understand how inequalities impact the lives of women in secure mental health settings.Practical implicationsThe inequalities that women experience in relation to mental health need to be further researched in the context of intersectionality. There are also research gaps in terms of gender identity, sexual orientation and socio-economic background. Further primary research using a more complex methodological paradigm is required to explore these factors and their impact on mental health service provision.Social implicationsThe role of inequalities should be considered as part of an overall care package, including the experiences of adverse childhood experiences and this should contribute towards the development of a trauma-based care approach.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study to scope literature about inequalities experienced in womens secure psychiatric settings considering intersectionality.","output":"Inequalities in womens medium or low secure mental health settings: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fake news, misinformation, and unverifiable facts on social media platforms propagate disharmony and affect society, especially when dealing with an epidemic like COVID-19. The task of Fake News Detection aims to tackle the effects of such misinformation by classifying news items as fake or real. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that improves over the current automatic fake news detection approaches by automatically gathering evidence for each claim. Our approach extracts supporting evidence from the web articles and then selects appropriate text to be treated as evidence sets. We use a pre-trained summarizer on these evidence sets and then use the extracted summary as supporting evidence to aid the classification task. Our experiments, using both machine learning and deep learning-based methods, help perform an extensive evaluation of our approach. The results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in fake news detection to achieve an F1-score of 99.25 over the dataset provided for the CONSTRAINT-2021 Shared Task.

METHODS With informed consent obtained, members of the pedigree were subjected to clinical examination and history taking to exclude syndromic cleft lip and palate. One affected member was subjected to whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Candidate variant was verified by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis of her family members and 100 unrelated healthy individuals. RESULTS Whole-exome sequencing and co-segregation analysis showed that all affected members of this pedigree have carried a heterozygous missense c.253A>G (p.Cys85Arg) variant in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene, which has co-segregated with the phenotype and was not found among the 100 unrelated healthy individuals.

US daily deaths have numbered over one-thousand people per day for nearly 3 days (from November 18, 2020 to November 20, 2020), and total deaths have exceeded 250 000 as of November 21, 2020, which drives the medical community to search for trends to provide an early warning of rising numbers of cases and to prevent future increases. Objective: The study intended to evaluate available US COVID-19 data to determine the possibility of predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. Design: The research team collected US COVID-19 data from a time-series view and established a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to predict trends. Results: According to the spatial and temporal distribution of cumulative confirmed cases, US COVID-19 cases are mainly concentrated in areas with high population density, with that variable having a positive correlation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The correlation coefficients are 0.95 and 0.817, respectively, indicating that the transmission of COVID-19 in the USA is characterized by agglomeration. After exploring the impact of population density, the research team established a SARIMA model to predict the trends, finding that US COVID-19 cases will continue to go up. Conclusions: By combining knowledge of the statistical features of the virus with modeling findings, the study determined a method that can improve understanding of the serious pandemic, paving the way toward the development of predictive and preventative solutions.","output":"Time Series Forecasting of US COVID-19 Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health challenge worldwide, threatening the important gains that have been made in reducing mortality due to infectious diseases.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a crucial antiviral defense mechanism in eukaryotes, and numerous viruses have been found to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to evade antiviral RNAi response. However, there is little knowledge about whether and how RuV antagonizes RNAi. In this study, we identified that the RuV capsid protein is a potent VSR that can efficiently suppress shRNA- and siRNA-induced RNAi in mammalian cells. Moreover, the VSR activity of the RuV capsid is dependent on its dimerization and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding activity. In addition, ectopic expression of the RuV capsid can effectively rescue the replication defect of a VSR-deficient virus or replicon, implying that the RuV capsid can act as a VSR in the context of viral infection. Together, our findings uncover that RuV encodes a VSR to evade antiviral RNAi response, which expands our understanding of RuVChost interaction and sheds light on the potential therapeutic target against RuV.","output":"The Capsid Protein of Rubella Virus Antagonizes RNA Interference in Mammalian Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From March 2020, restrictive measures have been taken to limit the Covid-19 pandemic, thus impacting and hugely affecting the tourism industry.

The authors wanted to inform colleagues on involving nursing care delivery models in the problem-solving process during a pandemic. LOCAL PROBLEM In the pre-COVID-19 hospital practice, the nursing care delivery model of primary nursing was applied in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this situation could not be upheld because of the increased need for ICU beds and the shortages of available ICU nurses. METHODS This study used the literature of an ongoing systematic review on nursing care delivery models and expert meetings between the authors and nursing staff. RESULTS One standard nursing care delivery model and 3 alternative nursing care delivery models were discussed and compared in this case study. Theoretically, a modular system of team nursing seemed the better model to use during a pandemic. This model leads to an equal distribution of expertise and social distancing between experts. Compared with the other models, a strategic reserve can be created. CONCLUSION This case study should be primarily considered as an example on how rethinking and reorganizing the nursing care delivery model could contribute to an enlarged, qualitative capacity, which needs to be organized in a short time span.","output":"Shifting Nursing Care Models as a Solution for the Increasing Demand on Intensive Care Unit Beds During a Pandemic: A Case Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health has recently gained increasing attention on global health and development agendas, including calls for an increase in international funding. Few studies have previously characterized official development assistance for mental health (DAMH) in a nuanced and differentiated manner in order to support future funding efforts. METHODS: Data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Creditor Reporting System were obtained through keyword searches. Projects were manually reviewed and categorized into projects dedicated entirely to mental health and projects that mention mental health (as one of many aims). Analysis of donor, recipient, and sector characteristics within and between categories was undertaken cumulatively and yearly. FINDINGS: Between the two categories of official DAMH defined, characteristics differed in terms of largest donors, largest recipient countries and territories, and sector classification. However, across both categories there were clear and consistent findings: the top donors accounted for over 80% of all funding identified; the top recipients were predominantly conflict-affected countries and territories, or were receiving nations for conflict-affect refugees; and sector classification demonstrated shifting international development priorities and political drivers. CONCLUSION: Across DAMH, significant amounts of funding are directed toward conflict settings and relevant emergency response by a small majority of donors. Our analysis demonstrated that, within minimal international assistance for mental health overall, patterns of donor, recipient, and sector characteristics favor emergency conflict-affected settings. Calls for increased funding should be grounded in understanding of funding drivers and directed toward both emergency and general health settings.","output":"An analysis of funding patterns in development assistance for mental health: who, when, what, and where"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic caught the United States and the rest of the world ill-prepared, and many institutions of higher education continue to wrestle with unprecedented challenges to provide effective support services to their students.

Rapid detection of the novel H7N9 virus is urgently needed to differentiate the disease from other infections, and to facilitate infection control as well as epidemiologic investigations. In this study, a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with a lateral flow device (RT-LAMP-LFD) assay to rapidly detect H7N9 virus was developed and evaluated. The RT-LAMP primers were designed to target the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H7N9 virus. Results of 10-fold dilution series assays showed that analysis of RT-LAMP products by the LFD method was as sensitive as real-time turbidity detection, and that the analytic sensitivities of the HA and NA RT-LAMP assays were both 10 copies of synthetic RNA. Furthermore, both the assays showed 100% clinical specificity for identification of H7N9 virus. The performance characteristics of the RT-LAMP-LFD assay were evaluated with 80 clinical specimens collected from suspected H7N9 patients. The NA RT-LAMP-LFD assay was more sensitive than real time RT-PCR assay. Compared with a combination of virus culture and real-time RT-PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the RT-LAMP-LFD assay were all 100%. Overall, The RT-LAMP-LFD assay established in this study can be used as a reliable method for early diagnosis of the avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus infection.","output":"Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Novel Avian-Origin Influenza A (H7N9) Virus by Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Combined with a Lateral-Flow Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to millions of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide.

The survey investigated physiotherapists frequency of incorporating 15 different elements of physical activity counselling into their usual healthcare interactions, and 53 potential influences on their behaviour framed by the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour) model. The sample comprised 84 physiotherapists (79% female, 48% <5 years of experience). Physiotherapists reported using on average five (SD:3) elements of physical activity counselling with at least 50% of their patients who could be more active.

Although in the long-term mass vaccinations remains the most promising approach to control the pandemic, evidence suggests that new variants of the virus have emerged that may be able to evade the immune responses triggered by current vaccines. Therefore despite the recent approval of a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines there remains considerable urgency for effective treatments for COVID-19. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with a dysregulated host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with elevated levels of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) ligands including chemokine C-C ligands 3, 4, 5, as well as interleukins 6 and 10. Leronlimab, a CCR5-specific humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody originally developed for the treatment of HIV has been studied for the treatment of COVID-19. In the TEMPEST trial which compared leronlimab to placebo in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, a post hoc analysis showed that leronlimab led to improvements from baseline in National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) at Day 14 in the sub-set of people with more severe disease. Data has also been released on a further ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 registrational trial of leronlimab in 394 people with severe-to-critical COVID-19. The results show that Day 28 mortality was reduced (P=0.0319) in the subset of participants receiving leronlimab plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone administered as part of their standard of care (SOC) compared to participants receiving placebo plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone as part of their SOC.

According to several observations, agitation prevalence ranges from 30 to 50% in Alzheimer's disease, 30% in dementia with Lewy bodies, 40% in frontotemporal dementia, and 40% in vascular dementia (VaD). With an overall prevalence of about 30%, agitation is the third most common neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, after apathy and depression, and it is even more frequent (80%) in residents of nursing homes. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying agitation is represented by a frontal lobe dysfunction, mostly involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively, meaningful in selecting the salient stimuli and subsequent decision-making and behavioral reactions. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling has been observed, possibly due to a frontal lobe up-regulation of adrenergic receptors, as a reaction to the depletion of noradrenergic neurons within the locus coeruleus (LC). Indeed, LC neurons mainly project toward the OFC and ACC. These observations may explain the abnormal reactivity to weak stimuli and the global arousal found in many patients who have dementia. Furthermore, agitation can be precipitated by several factors, e.g., the sunset or low lighted environments as in the sundown syndrome, hospitalization, the admission to nursing residencies, or changes in pharmacological regimens. In recent days, the global pandemic has increased agitation incidence among dementia patients and generated higher distress levels in patients and caregivers. Hence, given the increasing presence of this condition and its related burden on society and the health system, the present point of view aims at providing an extensive guide to facilitate the identification, prevention, and management of acute and chronic agitation in dementia patients.","output":"Agitation and Dementia: Prevention and Treatment Strategies in Acute and Chronic Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The vascular enlargement (VE) pattern differs from previously described imaging patterns for pneumonia. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, computed tomography (CT) characteristics, and diagnostic value of the VE pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD: The CT data of 106 patients with COVID-19 from January 19 to February 29, 2020, and 52 patients with influenza virus pneumonia (IVP) from January 2018 to February 2020 were retrospectively collected. The incidences of the VE pattern between the two groups were compared. The CT manifestations of COVID-19 were analyzed with a particular focus on the VE pattern's specific CT signs, dynamic changes, and relationships with lesion size and disease severity. RESULTS: Peripheral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or mixed GGOs with various sizes and morphologies were typical features of COVID-19 on initial CT. The VE pattern was more common in COVID-19 (88/106, 83.02 %) than in IVP (10/52, 19.23 %) on initial CT (P < 0.001). Three special VE-pattern-specific CT signs, including central vascular sign, ginkgo leaf sign, and comb sign, were identified. Four types of dynamic changes in the VE pattern were observed on initial and follow-up CT, which were closely associated with the evolution of lesions and the time interval from the onset of symptoms to initial CT scan. The VE pattern in COVID-19 was more commonly seen in larger lesions and patients with severe-critical type (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The VE pattern is a valuable CT sign for differentiating COVID-19 from IVP, which correlates with more extensive or serious disease. A good understanding of the CT characteristics of the VE pattern may contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of the evolution of lesions.","output":"CT features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an emphasis on the vascular enlargement pattern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of appropriately recognizing and managing patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities is underscored by the poor outcomes described in complex comorbid patients.

We observed annually re-occurring geographic clusters of influenza incidences, mainly associated with net income, and independent of population density and living space. Vaccination against influenza was also mainly associated with household income and was linked to the likelihood of influenza-like illness within an urban quarter. Transmissions patterns within and between quarters were complex.

This study aims to identify the spatio-temporal pattern of TB incidence rate in Iran between 2008 and 2018. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on aggregated TB data (50,500 patients) at the provincial level provided by the Ministry of Health in Iran between 2008 and 2018. The Anselin Local Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* were performed to identify the spatial variations of the disease. Furthermore, spatial scan statistic was employed for purely temporal and spatio-temporal analyses. In all instances, the null hypothesis of no clusters was rejected at p  0.05. RESULTS The overall incidence rate of TB decreased from 13.46 per 100,000 (95% CI: 13.19-13.73) in 2008 to 10.88 per 100,000 (95% CI: 10.65-11.11) in 2018. The highest incidence rate of TB was observed in southeast and northeast of Iran for the whole study period. Additionally, spatial cluster analysis discovered Khuzestan Province, in the West of the country, having significantly higher rates than neighbouring provinces in terms of both total TB and smear-positive pulmonary TB (SPPTB). Purely temporal analysis showed that high-rate and low-rate clusters were predominantly distributed in the time periods 2010-2014 and 2017-2018. Spatio-temporal results showed that the statistically significant clusters were mainly distributed from centre to the east during the study period. Some high-trend TB and SPPTB statistically significant clusters were found. CONCLUSION The results provided an overview of the latest TB spatio-temporal status In Iran and identified decreasing trends of TB in the 2008-2018 period. Despite the decreasing incidence rate, there is still need for screening, and targeting of preventive interventions, especially in high-risk areas. Knowledge of the spatio-temporal pattern of TB can be useful for policy development as the information regarding the high-risk areas would contribute to the selection of areas needed to be targeted for the expansion of health facilities.","output":"Spatio-temporal epidemiology of the tuberculosis incidence rate in Iran 2008 to 2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is putting health-care systems under unprecedented stress to accommodate unexpected numbers of patients forcing a quick re-organization.

A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are \\"empty.\\" Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it. OBJECTIVE: This study set out to evaluate the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy theory in the future. METHODS: Twitter data related to the #FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify accounts with a higher probability of being bots. RESULTS: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network.

This study aims to analyse the recent literature on the topics of Covid-19 and sustainability and proposes to rethink and redefine sustainability with the intersection of human health as a fourth sustainable pillar. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Scopus and ISI Web of Science databases, 119 articles were analysed in detail and classified according to concepts and principles for achieving sustainable development, based on the Brundtland Report, 1987. Findings: The results indicate a high number of publications in the social dimension, with a relevant proportion of studies in the health sector. This study allows us to conclude that all sectors of society are being affected by the pandemic. However, the enormous tension and the immediate impact felt by the health sector during the pandemic reflect directly on the population, and there are clear signs that in the medium and long term, instability and uncertainty in the environmental, economic and social dimensions will remain. In national health systems, monitoring, innovating in human resource management and investing in information technology can ensure organizations reliability and sustainability. The conclusion involves the suggestion of introducing health as a new pillar for sustainability to consolidate the basis and structure of the United Nations Sustainable Development Objectives. The use of fundamental concepts is necessary and must be aligned to reassess the results obtained in studies, in comparison with observational data. Practical implications: The implications arising from the inclusion of health as a fourth pillar of sustainability are diverse. The need to build a new theoretical and conceptual framework for sustainability derives from the fact that health reflects the concern of many postulants in this field of practices. The determining or conditioning conditions of the observed effects of the pandemic by COVID-19, whether situated simply as factors and/or economic, environmental or social reflexes that precede them, requires a conceptual development that allows its approach, as a complex object, whose determinations are subject to variable degrees of uncertainty and diversity.

The secondary purpose was to compare the economic cost of those methods for the Spanish health service. METHOD A failure mode and effects analysis was carried out to attain the primary objective. For the secondary objective, an in-depth analysis was performed of the economic costs associated with each program using a cost-minimization analysis. RESULTS The failure mode and effects analysis resulted in scores of 184, 170 and 126 points for the health center collection, home delivery and community pharmacy collection programs, respectively. The economic evaluation, for its part, rendered estimated costs of 18,434.52, 11,417.08 and 7,986.52 for home delivery, health center collection and community pharmacy collection services, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study indicated that collection at the community pharmacy was the program associated to the lowest risk, most likely due to the crucial role of the pharmacist regarding the custody and preservation of medicines.

The aim was to systematically review the literature for studies investigating the diagnostic yield of 2nd generation CCE compared to SC. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Study characteristics including quality of bowel preparation and completeness of CCE transits were extracted. Per-patient sensitivity and specificity were extracted for polyps (any size;  10mm, 6 mm) and lesion characteristics. Meta-analyses of diagnostic yield were performed. RESULTS The literature search revealed 1077 unique papers and 12 studies were included. These included 2199 in total of which 1898 patients were available for analyses. The rate of patients with adequate quality of the bowel preparation varied from 40% to 100%. The rates of complete CCE transits varied from 57% to 100%. Our meta-analyses demonstrated that mean [95% confidence interval] sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio was 0.85 [0.73;0.92], 0.85 [0.70;0.93] and 30.5 [16.2;57.2], respectively for polyps of any size, 0.87 [0.82;0.90], 0.95 [0.92;0.97] and 136.0 [70.6;262.1], respectively for polyps  10mm and 0.87 [0.83;0.90], 0.88 [0.75;0.95] and 51.1 [19.8;131.8], respectively for polyps  6mm. No serious adverse events were reported for CCE. CONCLUSION In conclusion, CCE has a high sensitivity and specificity for per-patient polyps compared to SC. However, the relatively high rate of incomplete investigations limits the application of CCE in a CRC-screening setting.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy compared to colonoscopy for polyp detection: systematic review and meta-analyses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cilia are essential for the development and function of many different tissues. Although cilia machinery is crucial in the eye for photoreceptor development and function, a role for cilia in early eye development and morphogenesis is still somewhat unclear: many zebrafish cilia mutants retain cilia at early stages due to maternal deposition of cilia components. An eye phenotype has been described in the mouse Arl13 mutant, however, zebrafish arl13b is maternally deposited, and an early role for cilia proteins has not been tested in zebrafish eye development. Here we use the zebrafish dzip1 mutant, which exhibits a loss of cilia throughout stages of early eye development, to examine eye development and morphogenesis. We find that in dzip1 mutants, initial formation of the optic cup proceeds normally, however, the optic fissure subsequently fails to close and embryos develop the structural eye malformation ocular coloboma. Further, neural crest cells, which are implicated in optic fissure closure, do not populate the optic fissure correctly, suggesting that their inappropriate localization may be the underlying cause of coloboma. Overall, our results indicate a role for dzip1 in proper neural crest localization in the optic fissure and optic fissure closure.","output":"Loss of zebrafish dzip1 results in inappropriate recruitment of periocular mesenchyme to the optic fissure and ocular coloboma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Covid-19 maintains its seriousness as a global emergency with its rapid distribution worldwide. Ferritin / lymphocyte percentage ratio (FLPR) may appear as a prognostic value at the initial evaluation stage and thus can be used as a simple, effective and reliable parameter in critical patient identification with Covid-19. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study we evaluated patients over 18 years old, who were hospitalized after being evaluated as COVID-19 and whose PCR results were positive. We calculated FLPRs from complete blood counts taken during emergency department admissions and classified disease severity due to emergency initial evaluation. The relationship between the severity of the thoracic tomography findings, hospitalization and intensive care needs, and 28-day mortality with the FLPR were evaluated. Results: The difference between the groups classified according to COVID-19 severity and the FLPR means was statistically significant (x2 = 148,284;SD = 3;p = 0,000). FLPR levels were found to be high in critical and serious groups. In the ROC analysis for the FLPR level, the area under the curve (AUC) value was found to be 0.909 (95% CI 0.857-0.961). When the cut off value of FLPR was 9.80, the sensitivity was found to be 97.6%, and the specificity was 65.2%, whereas, when the cut off value for FLPR was found to be 21.11, the sensitivity was 82.9% and the specificity was 82.8%.

Methods: : In this observational cohort study, we included participants hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave (March-May 2020) of the pandemic in six regional hospitals in the Netherlands. We computed descriptive statistics and logistic regression models using sex-disaggregated data to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. Followingly, we analyzed the clinical features of female and male COVID-19 patients who had a non-ICU policy. Results: : We included 1262 patients (63.7% men) in this study. Higher age, higher LDH level, lower diastolic blood pressure, and lower peripheral oxygen saturation were associated with in-hospital mortality in female and male patients. Shorter symptom duration before admission and more comorbidities associated with in-hospital mortality only in female patients. 33.8% of the female and 30.6% of the male patients had a non-ICU policy. We identified a significant rise in this policy in female patients over the course of the first wave compared to males, which could not be explained solely by age and clinical differences.

We utilized a custom next-generation sequencing approach and allele-specific genotyping assays to detect and validate 280 biallelic variants across all 10 bovine TLR genes, including 71 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one putative nonsense SNP. Bayesian haplotype reconstructions and median joining networks revealed haplotype sharing between Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus breeds at every locus, and specialized beef and dairy breeds could not be differentiated despite an average polymorphism density of 1 marker/158 bp. Collectively, 160 tagSNPs and two tag insertion-deletion mutations (indels) were sufficient to predict 100% of the variation at 280 variable sites for both Bos subspecies and their hybrids, whereas 118 tagSNPs and 1 tagIndel predictively captured 100% of the variation at 235 variable sites for B. t. taurus. Polyphen and SIFT analyses of amino acid (AA) replacements encoded by bovine TLR SNPs indicated that up to 32% of the AA substitutions were expected to impact protein function. Classical and newly developed tests of diversity provide strong support for balancing selection operating on TLR3 and TLR8, and purifying selection acting on TLR10. An investigation of the persistence and continuity of linkage disequilibrium (r(2)0.50) between adjacent variable sites also supported the presence of selection acting on TLR3 and TLR8.

Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy, the outcomes of HSCT for XIAP deficiency remain unsatisfactory compared with those for SLAM-associated protein deficiency and familial HLH. AIM: To investigate the outcomes and adverse events of HSCT for patients with XIAP deficiency, a national survey was conducted. METHODS: A spreadsheet questionnaire was sent to physicians who had provided HSCT treatment for patients with XIAP deficiency in Japan. RESULTS: Up to the end of September 2016, 10 patients with XIAP deficiency had undergone HSCT in Japan, 9 of whom (90%) had survived. All surviving patients had received a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Although 5 patients developed post-HSCT HLH, 4 of them survived after etoposide administration. In addition, the IBD associated with XIAP deficiency improved remarkably after HSCT in all affected cases. CONCLUSION: The RIC regimen and HLH control might be important factors for successful HSCT outcomes, with improved IBD, in patients with XIAP deficiency.

Developing broad-spectrum drugs would be invaluable in responding to new, emerging coronaviruses and to address unmet urgent clinical needs. Main protease (M(pro); also known as 3CL(pro)) has a major role in the coronavirus life cycle and is one of the most important targets for anti-coronavirus agents. We show that a natural product, noncovalent inhibitor, shikonin, is a pan-main protease inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E with micromolar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values. Structures of the main protease of different coronavirus genus, SARS-CoV from the betacoronavirus genus and HCoV-NL63 from the alphacoronavirus genus, were determined by X-ray crystallography and revealed that the inhibitor interacts with key active site residues in a unique mode. The structure of the main protease inhibitor complex presents an opportunity to discover a novel series of broad-spectrum inhibitors. These data provide substantial evidence that shikonin and its derivatives may be effective against most coronaviruses as well as emerging coronaviruses of the future. Given the importance of the main protease for coronavirus therapeutic indication, insights from these studies should accelerate the development and design of safer and more effective antiviral agents. IMPORTANCE The current pandemic has created an urgent need for broad-spectrum inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease is relatively conservative compared to the spike protein and, thus, is one of the most promising targets in developing anti-coronavirus agents. We solved the crystal structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 that bound to shikonin. The structures provide important insights, have broad implications for understanding the structural basis underlying enzyme activity, and can facilitate rational design of broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus ligands as new therapeutic agents.","output":"Structure-Based Discovery and Structural Basis of a Novel Broad-Spectrum Natural Product against the Main Protease of Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People affected by conflict are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks and climate change, yet little is known about climate change adaptation in fragile contexts.

We report a prospective study designed to determine the frequency and clinical presentation of community-acquired respiratory illness in infancy associated with 8 common respiratory pathogens. METHODS Eighty-eight infants were monitored through their first winter. With each respiratory illness, infants were examined, and a nasal lavage specimen was collected. Individual reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions were performed to detect infection with picornaviruses (rhinoviruses and enteroviruses), coronaviruses (serotypes OC43 and 229E), adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses (types A and B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. RESULTS Picornaviruses were the most frequently detected pathogen identified in 46% (56 of 123) of episodes, followed by RSV (27%), parainfluenza viruses (13%) and coronaviruses (9%). Dual pathogen infections were identified in 20% of episodes, predominantly caused by picornaviruses together with either RSV or parainfluenza viruses. RSV infection was significantly associated with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. No other associations were found between pathogen and clinical diagnosis. Dual infection did not predispose infants to a more severe clinical course. CONCLUSIONS Picornaviruses are the predominant cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the first year of life.

First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associated with an increased neuronal degeneration leading to neuropathology and motor deficits in susceptible individuals.","output":"Human coronavirus OC43 infection induces chronic encephalitis leading to disabilities in BALB/C mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan and other places. Seven versions of the Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Coronavirus Disease-2019 successively issued by the Chinese government have designated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a necessary medical strategy. Based on the changes in TCM diagnosis and treatment strategies in these seven versions of Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Coronavirus Disease-2019, this paper collected data reported by the Chinese government media; analyzed the understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, syndrome differentiation, treatment methods, and prescriptions of COVID-19 by TCM and evaluated the clinical efficacy of TCM strategies. COVID-19 is associated with TCM disease of pestilence, and its pathogenesis can be summarized as an \\"epidemic pathogen invading the body, followed by entering the internal organs and transforming into heat, resulting in pathogen trapping in the interior and healthy qi collapsing, and deficiency of qi and yin\\". Pathological processes should be emphasized in syndrome differentiation. The manifestations of qi deficiency and yin deficiency are exhibited during the recovery period. TCM strategies represented by Qing Fei Pai Du Tang have shown apparent advantages in improving symptoms, promoting virus clearance, and shortening hospitalization, as well as surprising efficacy of zero patient progressing from mild to severe cases in a TCM cabin hospital. Clinical data illustrate the effectiveness of TCM strategies proposed by the Chinese government.

Notably, our laboratory recently reported that persistence of COVID-19 symptoms beyond the acute phase of the illness (i.e., beyond 4 weeks) was accompanied by macro- and micro- vascular dysfunction as measured by flow mediated dilation and reactive hyperemia, respectively. Interestingly, despite consistent reports of vascular alterations, no studies have reported changes in resting blood pressure (BP) following COVID-19. One caveat is that BP has only been measured in the laboratory setting. Indeed, to date, no studies have assessed the effect of COVID-19 on ambulatory BP, which allows for a complete assessment of daytime and nighttime BP without the potential for well known \\"white coat\\" effects on BP. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on 24-hr ambulatory BP in young adults diagnosed with COVID-19 within the preceding 6 months. We hypothesized that ambulatory BP would be greater in individuals who had COVID-19 compared to controls who never had COVID-19, and that those with symptoms would have higher BP compared to those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing. METHODS We studied 21 young healthy adults who had a positive laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 (COVID: 23  1 years [Mean  SE]; 12  1 [range: 4 to 22] weeks since diagnosis; 13 females) and 10 controls (23  1 years, 6 females) who never had COVID-19. Eleven individuals who had COVID-19 were asymptomatic at the time of testing while 10 were symptomatic. Ambulatory BP was measured using the Oscar 2 oscillometric monitor (Sun Tech Medical). Participants were instructed to perform normal daily activities but not to perform any exercise during the 24-hr period. Measurements were obtained every 20 min during daytime and every 30 min during nighttime. Average daytime, nighttime and 24-hr systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were calculated. RESULTS Daytime, nighttime, and 24-hr BPs were not different between control and COVID subjects (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Similarly, there were no differences in any of the BP assessments between control, asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID subjects (e.g., daytime SBP: control 122  4; asymptomatic 119  4; symptomatic 125  2 mmHg, P = 0.451). Interestingly, in the COVID group, daytime, nighttime, and 24-hr SBP, DBP, and MAP were inversely correlated with time since diagnosis (P < 0.05 for all with medium to large effect size). Multiple linear regression showed that after accounting for age, BMI, and physical activity (reported average exercise minutes/week), time since diagnosis was a significant predictor of daytime and 24-hr SBP, DBP, and MAP (e.g., daytime SBP: P = 0.028,  coefficient = -0.697). For nighttime BP, time since diagnosis was a significant predictor only for SBP. CONCLUSION These preliminary data suggest that the effect of COVID-19 on ambulatory BP in young adults may be dependent on the time since diagnosis with higher daytime and nighttime BP present closer to the onset of the infection, which appeared to be independent of symptomology. Longitudinal follow up studies are warranted.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Ambulatory Daytime and Nighttime Blood Pressure in Young Otherwise Healthy Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dear Readers, Time flies and it is being already six years since I began my service in the Editorial Board (EB) of the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and SystemsPart II: Express Briefs (TCAS-II), first as Deputy Editor-in-Chief (DEiC) and later as Editor-in-Chief (EiC).

METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in northeast Chongqing, China, who were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive (RT-PCR+). We stratified this cohort by normal vs abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and March 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days, and it was 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (P < .05). Nine patients (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively. The median length of time for nucleic acid to turn negative was 13 days compared with 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT scans (P < .05).

Temporary migrant workers have been labeled as the major driving force for the rising incidence of infectious diseases in cities. However, it has not been well recognized that temporary migration indeed may have tremendous impacts on the spread of infectious diseases in migrants' home villages. In this paper, by proposing a delay differential equation model, we provide a framework to study the influence of temporary migration on the transmission of infectious diseases in a migrant workers' home village. The model is shown to admit a unique positive equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable and is globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. This implies that the disease always persists at a constant level. Considering tuberculosis as an example, we explore various disease prevention and control strategies numerically to demonstrate how migration related parameters affect the early outbreak of the disease. We find that a single control strategy, such as reducing the migration time period alone, has little effect on reducing the disease endemic level. For disease prevention and control, temporary migrant workers should be identified as the top target group, and a combination of several prevention strategies should be implemented.","output":"Influence of temporary migration on the transmission of infectious diseases in a migrants' home village"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human population is currently facing the third and possibly the worst pandemic caused by human coronaviruses (CoVs). The virus was first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019 and spread within a short time to almost all countries of the world. Genome analysis of the early virus isolates has revealed high similarity with SARS-CoV and hence the new virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2. Since CoVs have the largest genome among all RNA viruses, they can adapt to many point mutation and recombination events; particularly in the spike gene, which enable these viruses to rapidly change and evolve in nature. CoVs are known to cross the species boundaries by using different cellular receptors. Both animal reservoir and intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 are still unresolved and necessitate further investigation. In the current review, different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenicity are discussed, including virus genetics and evolution, spike protein and its role in evolution and adaptation to novel hosts, and virus transmission and persistence in nature. In addition, the immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infection is demonstrated with special reference to the interplay between immune cells and their role in disease progression. We believe that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will not be the last and spillover of CoVs from bats will continue. Therefore, establishing intervention approaches to reduce the likelihood of future CoVs spillover from natural reservoirs is a priority.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: An Overview of Virus Genetics, Transmission, and Immunopathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 French centres in the period 10-31 March 2020. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 days of admission. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the prognostic value of clinical and biological features with the endpoint. ORs are reported for a 1 SD increase after standardisation. RESULTS: The current analysis focused on 1317 participants: 64.9% men, mean age 69.8  13.0 years, median BMI 28.4 (25th-75th percentile: 25.0-32.7) kg/m2; with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (88.5%). Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 46.8% and 40.8% of cases, respectively. The primary outcome was encountered in 29.0% (95% CI 26.6, 31.5) of participants, while 10.6% (9.0, 12.4) died and 18.0% (16.0, 20.2) were discharged on day 7. In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies. In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]). On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome.

The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of otosclerosis treatments have never been studied in Europe. OBJECTIVES: To compare the estimated mean costs per patient over 10 years of surgery vs hearing aids for the treatment of otosclerosis and to estimate the budget impact of an increase in the proportion of patients receiving surgical treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation analyzed French and European epidemiological data on the surgical management of symptomatic otosclerosis and compared them with data from the literature to build economic models. The analysis was conducted in January 2021. EXPOSURES: Two care pathways were considered in the treatment of otosclerosis, either hearing aid or surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs were studied over 10 years using Markov models of the 2 care pathways (hearing aid vs surgery). The budget impact analysis was performed over 5 and 10 years, assuming a 1Cpercentage point yearly increase in the proportion of patients receiving surgical treatment. RESULTS: Over 10 years, the estimated mean cost per patient was significantly lower in the surgery group compared with the hearing aid group (3446.9 vs 6088.4; mean difference, ?2641.5; 95% CI ?4064.8 to ?1379.4 [US $3913.4 vs US $6912.4; mean difference, ?US $2999.0; 95% CI, ?US $4614.9 to ?US $1566.1]).

The disease has quickly spread and reached multiple cities within a few weeks. In an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the government has implemented strict regulations. Starting March 15th, all travelers coming back to the kingdom were tested for COVID-19 and were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The same rule was applied to all positive cases identified by contact tracing. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals in a quarantine facility in the eastern province. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study on 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects who were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The study period was from March 16th until April 18th, 2020. We collected data on demographics and on clinical symptoms. Also, samples for PCR tests were collected upon admission and were repeated every 72 hours if they were still positive. All negative samples were repeated within 24 hours for confirmation. RESULTS Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI,12.4-21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7-13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P=0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is high in our study. Testing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell was the most common presentation in our mild symptomatic residents, and it might be predictive of mild disease. The persistent positive PCRs observed in the mild asymptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.","output":"Silent Disease and Loss of Taste and Smell are Common Manifestations of SARS-COV-2 Infection in a Quarantine Facility: First report from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract SARS CoV-2 infection has produced a pandemic with serious consequences for our health care system. Although liver transplant patients represent only a minority of the population, the hepatologists who follow these patients have tried to coordinate efforts to produce a protocol the management of immunosuppression during SARS Cov-2 infection. Although there are no solid studies to support general recommendations, experiences with other viral infections (hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus) suggest that management of immunosuppression without mycophenolate mofetil or m-Tor inhibitors (drugs that are also associated with leukopenia and lymphopenia) may be beneficial. It is also important to pay attention to possible drug interactions, especially in the case of tacrolimus, with some of the treatments with antiviral effect given in the context of COVID 19 (lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin). Finally, the immunosuppressive effect of immunomodulating drugs (tocilizumab and similar) administered to patients with severe lung disease should be taken into account.

As was the case with COVID-19, the world is similarly unprepared to respond to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the challenges it will produce. COVID-19 presents an opportunity to examine how the international community might better respond to the growing AMR threat. MAIN BODY: The impacts of COVID-19 have manifested in health system, economic, social, and global political implications. Increasing AMR will also present challenges in these domains. As seen with COVID-19, increasing healthcare usage and resource scarcity may lead to ethical dilemmas about prioritization of care; unemployment and economic downturn may disproportionately impact people in industries reliant on human interaction (especially women); and international cooperation may be compromised as nations strive to minimize outbreaks within their own borders. CONCLUSION: AMR represents a slow-moving disaster that offers a unique opportunity to proactively develop interventions to mitigate its impact.

This meta-analysis was performed to assess the relationship between different chest CT features and severity of clinical presentation in COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, web of science databases (WOS), Cochrane library, and Google scholar were searched up to May 19, 2020 for observational studies that assessed the relationship of different chest CT manifestations and the severity of clinical presentation in COVID-19 infection. Risk of bias assessment was evaluated applying the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects model or fixed-effects model, as appropriately, were used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using Forest plot, Cochran's Q test, and I2. Publication bias was assessed applying Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies involving 3323 patients were included.

Sequencing the viral genome as the outbreak progresses is important, particularly in the identification of emerging isolates with different pathogenic potential and to identify whether nucleotide changes in the genome will impair clinical diagnostic tools such as real-time PCR assays. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms and point mutations occur during the replication of coronaviruses, one of the biggest drivers in genetic change is recombination. This can manifest itself in insertions and/or deletions in the viral genome. Therefore, sequencing strategies that underpin molecular epidemiology and inform virus biology in patients should take these factors into account.

The protocol, termed Rapid Sequencing Long Amplicons (RSLAs) used random primers to generate cDNA from RNA purified from a sample from a patient, followed by single or multiplex PCRs to generate longer amplicons of the viral genome. The base protocol was used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of clinical samples and proved sensitive in identifying viral RNA in samples from patients that had been declared negative using other nucleic acid-based assays (false negative).

An upcoming elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) may serve as motivation for patients with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]> 40 kg/m(2)) to lose weight, as it may optimize clinical outcomes following TJA and help them become eligible for TJA since some surgeons use a BMI of 40 kg/m(2) as a cut-off for offering surgery in an effort to optimize outcomes. METHODS: The purpose of this multicenter randomized, controlled trial is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week remote dietitian (RD) supervised dietary and physical activity weight loss intervention and mobile app for 60 patients with severe obesity prior to undergoing TJA. Intervention participants will receive access to a smartphone app and connect with an RD who will contact these participants weekly or bi-weekly via video calls for up to nine video calls. Together, participants and RDs will set goals for lifestyle modifications, and RDs will check on progress towards achieving these goals using in-app tools such as food logs and text messages between video calls. All patients will be encouraged to lose at least 20 pounds with a goal BMI < 40 kg/m(2) after 12 weeks. Individuals randomized to the control group will receive clinical standard of care, such as nutritionist and/or physical therapy referrals. Outcome and demographic data will be collected from blood serology, chart review, mobile app user data, pre- and postintervention surveys, and phone interviews. The primary outcome measure will be weight change from baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include percentage of patients eligible to undergo TJA, number of sessions completed with dietitians, self-reported global health status (PROMIS Global Health scale), self-reported joint-specific pain and function (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) or Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)), and serologies such as hemoglobin A1c, total lymphocyte count, albumin, and transferrin.

For decades, chest X-ray (CXR) technologies have proven their ability to accurately detect and treat respiratory diseases. Deep learning techniques, as well as the availability of a large number of CXR samples, have made a significant contribution to the fight against this pandemic. However, the most common screening methods are based on 2D CNNs, since 3D counterparts are enormously costly and labor-intensive. In this study, a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for COVID-19 screening using CXRs has been developed. The proposed architecture consists of the incorporation of a pre-trained deep model (VGG-16) and a shallow 3D CNN, combined with a depth-wise separable convolution layer and a spatial pyramid pooling module (SPP). Specifically, the depth-wise separable convolution helps to preserve the useful features while reducing the computational burden of the model. The SPP module is designed to extract multi-level representations from intermediate ones.

While such limitations on liberties are sometimes necessary for pandemic control, many of these policies have been overly broad or have neglected to consider the costs for populations already susceptible to human rights violations. Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated preexisting inequities based on health care access, poverty, racial injustice, refugee crises, and lack of education. The worsening of such human rights violations increases the need to utilize a human rights approach in the response to COVID-19.

We analyzed the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, a classification of the Chinese medicine dialectic and treatment regimen, and promptly enacted the recommendation of Korean medicine preparations in herbal medicine covered under domestic medical insurance benefits depending on the circumstances in our country. METHOD: The clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was developed based on consensus from a group of experts. RESULTS: Two kinds of herbal medicines (HM) were recommended for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgitang, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Saengmaek-san. Two herbal preparations were recommended for people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgi-tang. Three herbal preparations were recommended for mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Galgunhaegui-tang was recommended for those without pneumonia with wind-warmth disease invading the lungs; Sosiho-tang plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san was recommended for those with dampness-heat disease in the lungs. For the recovery stage, Samchulkunbi-tang plus Saengmaek-san, or Samchulkunbi-tang plus Chungseuiki-tang was recommended. CONCLUSION: The CPG was developed to guide the use of Korean herbal medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, and it is expected that this will be the basis for providing proper treatment of similar infectious diseases in the future.","output":"A consensus guideline of herbal medicine for coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously affecting human lives and communities around the world in many ways, from cities under lockdown to new social experiences.

As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low incidence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low incidence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low incidence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.","output":"Risk of secondary infection waves of COVID-19 in an insular region: the case of the Balearic Islands, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of safe and effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains the cornerstone of controlling this pandemic.

This paper aims to review reports of stroke associated with COVID-19 vaccines and provide a coherent clinical picture of this condition. Most of such patients are women under 60 years of age and who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Most studies reported CVST with or without secondary ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and some with Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). The most common clinical symptom of CVST seen after COVID-19 vaccination was headache. The clinical course of CVST after COVID-19 vaccination may be more severe than CVST not associated with COVID vaccination. Management of CVST following COVID-19 vaccination is challenging and may differ from the standard treatment of CVST. Low molecular weight heparin is commonly used in the treatment of CVST; however, it may worsen outcomes in CVST associated with VITT. Furthermore, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose glucocorticoids have been recommended with various success rates.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, the most commonly used method for the diagnosis of COVID-19, correlate with the chest CT findings. Material and Methods: The file records of the patients with COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19 were examined retrospectively between 11 March and 30 August 2020 after the approval of the local ethics committee. Patient files were divided into 2 groups. RT-PCR negative patients were in group 1 and RT-PCR positive patients were in group 2. Combined nose and throat swab (CNTS) was used for swab sampling. Results: Of the 492 patients included in the study, 277 were men and 215 were women, with an average age of 57.45  19.83. While there were 81 (29.2%) patients with chest CT findings compatible with COVID-19 in the first group, there were 80 (37.2%) patients in the second group. While the number of patients whose chest CT findings were incompatible with COVID-19 was 196 (70.8%) in group 1, it was 135 (62.8%) in group 2. There was a poor agreement between chest CT and RT-PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 (p = 0.062). Conclusion: To diagnose the disease is the most important step in treatment management. Especially in patients with incompatible RT-RCR and chest CT, the diagnosis should be strengthened by evaluating the laboratory findings and clinical symptoms of the patient.

Vitamin C has emerged as among the most promising of the antioxidant group, with many animal and human studies having been conducted in recent years. Although many of the studies have shown encouraging results in terms of preventing OA, others have reached opposite conclusions, thus making the data controversial.

Treatments for chronic low back pain typically focus on biomedical treatment approaches. While psychosocial treatments exist, multiple barriers prevent broad access. There is a significant unmet need for integrative, easily accessible, non-opioid solutions for chronic pain. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology allowing innovation in the delivery of behavioral pain treatments. Behavioral skills-based VR is effective at facilitating pain management and reducing pain-related concerns. Continued research on these emerging approaches is needed. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we seek to test the efficacy of a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program as a nonpharmacological home-based pain management treatment for people with chronic low back pain (cLBP). METHODS: We will randomize 180 individuals with cLBP to 1 of 2 VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (8-week skills-based VR program); or (2) Sham VR (control condition). All participants will receive a VR headset to minimize any biases related to the technologys novelty. The Sham VR group had 2D neutral content in a 3D theater-like environment. Our primary outcome is average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep. Our secondary outcomes include patient-reported physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, health utilization, medication use, and user satisfaction. We hypothesize superiority for the skills-based VR program in all of these measures compared to the control condition.

However, the impact on vascular surgery trainees have not yet been determined. The goals of our study were to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on vascular surgery trainees personal and professional life and to assess stressors, coping, and support structures involved in these trainees response to the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was an anonymous online survey administered in April 12-24, 2020 during the surge phase of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It is a subset analysis of the cross-sectional Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Committee Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping and Support Survey. The cohort surveyed was Vascular surgery (VS) trainees, integrated residents and fellows, in the United States of America. Assessment of the personal impact of the pandemic on vascular surgery trainees and the coping strategies used by them were based on the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and the validated 28-time Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory. RESULTS: A total of 145 vascular surgery trainees responded to the survey, with a 23% response rate (145/638). Significant changes were made to the clinical responsibilities of VS trainees, with 111 (91%) reporting cancellation of elective procedures, 101 (82%) with call schedule changes, 34 (24%) with duties other than related to vascular surgery, and 29 (24%) participation in outpatient care delivery. Over one third (52/144) reported they had performed a procedure on a patient with confirmed COVID-19, 37 (25.7%) reported they were unaware of the COVID-19 status at the time. The majority continued to work after exposure (29/34, 78%). Major stressors included concerns about professional development, infection risk to family/friends, and impact of care delay on patients. Median score for GAD-7was 4 (IQR 1-8) which corresponds to no or low self-reported anxiety levels. VS trainees employed mostly active coping and rarely avoidant coping mechanisms, and the majority were aware and utilized social media and online support systems. No significant difference was observed between integrated residents and fellows, or by gender. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had significant impact on VS trainees. Trainees reported significant changes to clinical responsibilities, exposure to COVID-19 and pandemic-related stressors but demonstrated healthy coping mechanisms with low self-reported anxiety levels.

True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODSWe used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTSMemory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.FUNDINGNIH funding (U54CA260492, P30CA006973, P41EB028239, R01AI153349, R01AI145435-A1, R21AI149760, and U19A1088791) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

This was proceeded by several decades in which such advances were very scarce, or entirely absent, but several novel adjuvants have now been included in licensed products, including in the US. These advances have relied upon several key technological insights that have emerged in this time period, which have finally allowed an in depth understanding of how adjuvants work. These advances include developments in systems biology approaches which allow the hypotheses first advanced in pre-clinical studies to be critically evaluated in human studies. This review highlights these recent advances, both in relation to the adjuvants themselves, but also the technologies that have enabled their successes. Moreover, we critically appraise what will come next, both in terms of new adjuvant molecules, and the technologies needed to allow them to succeed. We confidently predict that additional adjuvants will emerge in the coming years that will reach approval in licensed products, but that the components might differ significantly from those which are currently used. Gradually, the natural products that were originally used to build adjuvants, since they were readily available at the time of initial development, will come to be replaced by synthetic or biosynthetic materials, with more appealing attributes, including more reliable and robust supply, along with reduced heterogeneity. The recent advance in vaccine adjuvants is timely, given the need to create novel vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, we must ensure that the rigorous safety evaluations that allowed the current adjuvants to advance are not 'short-changed' in the push for new vaccines to meet the global challenge as quickly as possible, we must not jeopardize what we have achieved, by pushing less established technologies too quickly, if the data does not fully support it.","output":"The continued advance of vaccine adjuvants - 'we can work it out'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although most norovirus outbreaks in high-income countries occur in healthcare facilities, information on associations between control measures and outbreak outcomes in these settings are lacking. METHODS We conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis of published papers to assess associations between norovirus outbreak control measures and outcomes in hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCFs), globally. Using regression analyses stratified by setting (hospital/LTCF), we compared durations, attack rates and case counts for outbreaks in which control measures were reportedly implemented to those in which they were not. RESULTS We identified 102 papers describing 162 norovirus outbreaks. Control measures were reportedly implemented in 118 (73%) outbreaks and were associated with 0.6 (95% CI: 0.3-1.1) times smaller patient case counts and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.0) times shorter durations in hospitals but 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.2), 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.1) and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0-2.6) times larger overall, resident and staff case counts, respectively, and 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0-2.0) times longer durations in LTCFs.

Those communities in rural areas, where health and communication infrastructure are often limited, face additional challenges in keeping individuals informed, safe, and healthy. Moreover, the amount of misleading information circulating is making it even more difficult to convey critical and rapidly evolving public health recommendations. Michigan Technological University is located in Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula which accounts for 30% of the State's land mass but only 3% of the total population. Our goal was to increase campus and community awareness about COVID-19 and its impact on health and society. For our rural community, we offered a 1) COVID-19 public town hall series and 2) COVID-19 university wide academic course. The public town hall series was delivered weekly and broadcasted live through a webinar (Zoom), social media, and local radio. Each week a speaker panel consisting of public health officials, clinicians, educators, and/or other local experts discussed a COVID-19 topic theme and answered questions from the community. The academic course was presented as a 1-credit seminar-based online course open to any student. Each week students explored a COVID-19 related topic, participated in the weekly town hall, and engaged in follow-up discussion and reflection. Primary course learning objectives were for students to locate credible COVID-19 information sources and describe what is known about the general health impacts of the disease. Twelve public town halls, that included more than 35 different presenters, were delivered. Number of attendees on the Zoom webinars ranged between 20-75 individuals with many others interacting with content through social media, radio, and the recorded content. Town hall themes included the role of public health to protect community health, impact of disease on physical and mental health, health disparities, mechanisms to interrupt and halt transmission, and strategies for adapting to lifestyle changes. Undergraduate and graduate students (n=37) from a variety of majors (biology, exercise science, chemistry, engineering, business, forestry) enrolled in the course. Nearly all students (96%) reported that the course increased their awareness about COVID-19 and the majority (61%) indicated that the course was the most effective way to obtain COVID-19 related information. All students recommended that other students take this course in the future. The public town hall series provided a robust platform to deliver critical, real-time health information to our campus and broader community during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, additionally it also stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF- creating a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm might be responsible for respiratory insufficiency in severe COVID-19 patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with immunosuppression and the patients are prone to get many opportunistic infections. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with severe COVID-19 have lymphopenia. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients the neutrophils exhibit decreased chemotaxis, hydrogen peroxide production, and phagocytosis. Reduction in lymphocyte count and defective neutrophil capacity renders them with COVID-19 susceptible to opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections increasing the mortality rate. The opportunistic bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients were due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella sp. In COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mucormycosis was found to be the most common fungal infection with a higher predilection to males. Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus enhances the SARS-CoV-2 replication with an adverse outcome. A strong correlation exists between the poor prognosis of COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Proper glycemic control in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus might lessen the severity of the disease.","output":"Enhanced endocytosis elevated virulence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 due to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Albeit the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients is undermined, it is still found beneficial.

METHODS The study design is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of consecutive PD patients from 2013 to 2019. Clinical variables and total hospital charges were evaluated as an unadjusted and adjusted intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS A total of 156 patients (54 OPD, 102 RPD) were identified. In the RPD group, patients were significantly older (P = 0.0304) and had shorter length of stay (mean, 7 vs 11.8 days; P < 0.0001) and longer operative times (mean, 352.7 vs 211.5 minutes; P < 0.0001) compared with OPD. There was no significant difference in 90-day readmissions, bleeding, or complications between OPD and RPD. Adjusted charge analyses show no difference in total charges (P = 0.057).

Its association with secondary autoimmune triggers was introduced through the discovery of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). Autoimmune encephalitis and systemic autoimmune diseases or other autoimmune brain diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, have also been reported to sometimes present with obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). Subgroups of patients with OCD show elevated proinflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies against targets that include the basal ganglia. In this conceptual review paper, the clinical manifestations, pathophysiological considerations, diagnostic investigations, and treatment approaches of immune-related secondary OCD are summarized. The novel concept of autoimmune OCD is proposed for a small subgroup of OCD patients, and clinical signs based on the PANDAS/PANS criteria and from recent experience with autoimmune encephalitis and autoimmune psychosis are suggested. Red flag signs for autoimmune OCD could include (sub)acute onset, unusual age of onset, atypical presentation of OCS with neuropsychiatric features (e.g., disproportionate cognitive deficits) or accompanying neurological symptoms (e.g., movement disorders), autonomic dysfunction, treatment resistance, associations of symptom onset with infections such as group A streptococcus, comorbid autoimmune diseases or malignancies. Clinical investigations may also reveal alterations such as increased levels of anti-basal ganglia or dopamine receptor antibodies or inflammatory changes in the basal ganglia in neuroimaging.

The economic impact is still to be assessed. Aims: The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for the multiple treatment options available, to consider the future of this global pandemic, and to identify some potential options that could revolutionize the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this article underscores the sheer importance of repurposing some of the available antiviral and antimicrobial agents that have long been in use so as to have an effective and expeditious response to this widespread pandemic and the need to conduct a multicenter global randomized controlled trial to find an effective single antiviral agent or a cocktail of available antimicrobial agents. Method: We thoroughly searched and reviewed various case reports, retrospective analyses, and in vitro studies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar regarding the treatment options used for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 since its outbreak in an attempt to highlight treatments with the most promising results. Conclusion: We are currently facing one of the worst pandemics in history. Although SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower mortality rate than are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, its higher infectivity is making it a far more serious threat. Unfortunately, no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or effective drug regimen for COVID-19 currently exists.

Survivors were younger (6213 vs 6812 years, p =0.033), less often overweight or usual smokers, had lower NT-proBNP and interleukin-6, and higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired O 2 (FIO 2 ) ratio (270104 vs 11757 mmHg, p <0.001). In the non-survivors, PASP was increased (4212 vs 307 mmHg, p <0.001), while TAPSE was decreased (194 vs 254 mm, p<0.001). Accordingly the TAPSE/PASP ratio was lower than in the survivors (0.510.22 vs 0.890.29 mm/mmHg, p <0.001). At univariate/multivariable analysis, the TAPSE/PASP (HR:0.026;95%CI:0.01-0.579;p:0.019) and PaO 2 /FIO 2 (HR:0.988;95%CI:0.988-0.998;p:0.018) ratios were the only independent predictors of mortality, with ROC-determined cut-off values of 159 mmHg and 0.635 mm/mmHg respectively. Conclusions: . COVID-19 ARDS is associated with clinically relevant uncoupling of right ventricular function from the pulmonary circulation;bedside echocardiography of TAPSE/PASP adds to the prognostic relevance of PaO 2 /FIO 2 in ARDS on COVID-19.","output":"Right Ventricular-Arterial Uncoupling Independently Predicts Survival in COVID-19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first step of SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the spike proteins receptor binding domain to the host cells ACE2 receptor on the plasma membrane.

Emerging evidence suggests that PHEV alters microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles, and miRNA has also been postulated to be involved in its pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not been fully explored. In this study, we found that PHEV infection upregulates miR-142a-3p RNA expression in N2a cells and in the CNS of mice. Downregulation of miR-142a-3p by an miRNA inhibitor led to a significant repression of viral proliferation, implying that it acts as a positive regulator of PHEV proliferation. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-142a-3p was found to bind directly bound to the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of Rab3a mRNA and downregulate its expression. Knockdown of Rab3a expression by transfection with an miR-142a-3p mimic or Rab3a siRNA significantly increased PHEV replication in N2a cells. Conversely, the use of an miR-142a-3p inhibitor or overexpression of Rab3a resulted in a marked restriction of viral production at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data demonstrate that miR-142a-3p promotes PHEV proliferation by directly targeting Rab3a mRNA, and this provides new insights into the mechanisms of PHEV-related pathogenesis and virus-host interactions.","output":"miR-142a-3p promotes the proliferation of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus by targeting Rab3a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Induction of immunological tolerance has been the holy grail of transplantation immunology for decades.

Here, we report the first three patients in Europe included in a clinical trial aiming at the induction of tolerance by mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism after kidney transplantation. Two female and one male patient were transplanted with a kidney and peripherally mobilized hematopoietic stem cells from their HLA-identical sibling donor. The protocol followed previous studies at Stanford University: kidney transplantation was performed on day 0 including induction with anti-thymocyte globulin followed by conditioning with 10x 1.2 Gy total lymphoid irradiation and the transfusion of CD34+ cells together with a body weight-adjusted dose of donor T cells on day 11. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A and steroids for 10 days, cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil for 1 month, and then cyclosporine A monotherapy with tapering over 9C20 months. The 3 patients have been off immunosuppression for 4 years, 19 months and 8 months, respectively. No rejection or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Hematological donor chimerism was stable in the first, but slowly declining in the other two patients. A molecular microscope analysis in patient 2 revealed the genetic profile of a normal kidney.

These variants are the B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.1.7 with the additional E484K mutation, the B.1.351 variant (South Africa) and the P.1 variant (Brazil). Understanding the binding modalities between these viral variants and the host cell receptor ACE2 allows depicting changes, but also common motifs of virus-host cell interaction. The trimeric spike protein expressed at the viral surface contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that forms the molecular interface with ACE2. All the above-mentioned variants carry between one and three amino acid exchanges within the interface-forming region of the RBD, thereby altering the binding interface with ACE2. Using molecular dynamics simulations and decomposition of the interaction energies between the RBD and ACE2, we identified phenylalanine 486, glutamine 498, threonine 500 and tyrosine 505 as important interface-forming residues across viral variants. We also suggest a reduced binding energy between RBD and ACE2 in viral variants with higher infectivity, attributed to residue-specific differences in electrostatic interaction energy. Importantly, individual amino acid exchanges not only influence the affected position, but also alter the conformation of surrounding residues and affect their interaction potential as well. We demonstrate how computational methods can help to identify changed as well as common motifs across viral variants. These identified motifs might play a crucial role, in the strategical development of therapeutic interventions against the fast mutating SARS-CoV-2 virus. Significance Statement The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has significantly changed our lives. To date, there is a lack of neutralizing drugs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2. Hope lies in newly developed vaccines that effectively prevent severe cases of acute respiratory syndrome. However, emerging viral variants escape vaccine-induced immune-protection. Therefore, identification of appropriate molecular targets across viral variants is important for the development of second- and third-generation vaccines and inhibitory antibodies. In this study, we identify residues across viral variants that are important for viral binding to the host cell. As such residues cannot be replaced without diminishing infectivity of the virus, these residues represent primary targets for intervention, for example by neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Decomposition of the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interface reveals a common trend among emerging viral variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesoporous metal nanostructures have offered multiple advantages that cannot be realized elsewhere.

This disease is characterized by profibrotic activation of resident pulmonary fibroblasts resulting in aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. However, although much is known about the pathophysiology of IPF, the cellular and molecular processes that occur and allow aberrant fibroblast activation remain an unmet need. To explore the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with aberrant activation of these fibroblasts, we used the IPF lung fibroblast cell lines LL97A (IPF-1) and LL29 (IPF-2), compared to the normal lung fibroblast cell line CCD19Lu (NL-1). Protein samples were quantified and identified using a label-free quantitative proteomic analysis approach by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). DEPs were identified after pairwise comparison, including all experimental groups. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and ProteinCProtein Interaction (PPI) network construction were used to interpret the proteomic data. Eighty proteins expressed exclusively in the IPF-1 and IPF-2 clusters were identified. In addition, 19 proteins were identified up-regulated in IPF-1 and 10 in IPF-2; 10 proteins were down-regulated in IPF-1 and 2 in IPF-2 when compared to the NL-1 proteome.

We sought to evaluate shoulder arthroplasty utilization for fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and California's associated shelter-in-place order compared to historical controls. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with historical controls, identifying patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture in California using our integrated electronic health record. The time period of interest was following the implementation of the statewide shelter-in-place order: March 19, 2020-May 31, 2020. This was compared to three historical periods: January 1, 2020-March 18, 2020, March 18, 2019-May 31, 2019, and January 1, 2019-March 18, 2019. Procedure volume, patient characteristics, in-hospital length of stay, and 30-day events (emergency department visit, readmission, infection, pneumonia, and death) were reported. Changes over time were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for usual seasonal and yearly changes and age, sex, comorbidities, and post-admission factors. RESULTS: Surgical volume dropped from an average of 4.4, 5.2, and 2.6 surgeries per week in the historical time periods, respectively, to 2.4 surgeries per week after shelter-in-place. While no more than 30% of all performed during any given week were for fracture during the historical time periods, arthroplasties performed for fracture was the overwhelming primary indication immediately after the shelter-in-place order. More patients were discharged the day of surgery (+33.2%, p=0.019) after the shelter-in-place order, but we did not observe a change in any of the corresponding 30-day events. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of shoulder arthroplasty for fracture dropped during the time of COVID-19. The reduction in volume could be due to less shoulder trauma due to shelter-in-place or a change in the indications for arthroplasty given the perceived higher risks associated with intubation and surgical care. We noted more patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for fracture were safely discharged on the day of surgery, suggesting this may be a safe practice that can be adopted moving forward.

In the first 7 days after diagnosis (first phase), sociodemographic and clinic data were collected, a symptom checklist was constructed, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Severity of Acute Stress Symptoms Scale (SASSS) were applied. After 30-35 days following the diagnosis, the SASSS and the HADS were repeated. In the first phase, the frequency of depression and anxiety were 55% and 20% in inpatients, and 39% and 18% in outpatients, respectively. In the second phase, depression scores are significantly decreased in both groups whereas anxiety scores were decreased only in inpatients. The frequencies of patients reporting sleep and attention problems, irritability, and suicide ideas decreased after 1 month. Patients with loss of smell and taste exhibit higher anxiety and depression scores in both stages. Our results revealed that the rate of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients improves within 1 month. Inpatients have a more significant decrease in both depression and anxiety frequency than do outpatients. The main factor affecting anxiety and depression was the treatment modality. Considering that all patients who were hospitalized were discharged at the end of the first month, this difference may be due to the elimination of the stress caused by hospitalization.","output":"Factors associated with progression of depression, anxiety, and stress-related symptoms in outpatients and inpatients with COVID-19: A longitudinal study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE An umbrella review summarising all safety data from systematic reviews of topical corticosteroids (TCS) in adults and children with atopic eczema. METHODS Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology map of eczema systematic reviews were searched until 7 November 2018 and Epistemonikos until 2 March 2021. Reviews were included if they assessed the safety of TCS in atopic eczema and searched >1 database using a reproducible search strategy. Review quality was assessed using version 2 of 'A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews' (AMSTAR 2 tool). RESULTS 38 systematic reviews included, 34 low/critically low quality. Treatment and follow-up were usually short (2-4 weeks). KEY FINDINGS TCS versus emollient/vehicle: No meta-analyses identified for skin-thinning. Two 2-week randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found no significant increased risk with very potent TCS (0/196 TCS vs 0/33 vehicle in children and 6/109 TCS vs 2/50 vehicle, age unknown). Biochemical adrenal suppression (cortisol) was 3.8% (95% CI 2.4% to 5.8%) in a meta-analysis of 11 uncontrolled observational studies (any potency TCS, 522 children). Effects reversed when treatment ceased.TCS versus topical calcineurin inhibitors: Meta-analysis showed higher relative risk of skin thinning with TCS (4.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 22.28, n=4128, four RCTs, including one 5-year RCT). Eight cases in 2068 participants, 7 using potent TCS. No evidence of growth suppression.Once daily versus more frequent TCS: No meta-analyses identified. No skin-thinning in one RCT (3 weeks potent TCS, n=94) or biochemical adrenal suppression in two RCTs (up to 2 weeks very potent/moderate TCS, n=129).TCS twice/week to prevent flares ('weekend therapy') versus vehicle: No meta-analyses identified. No evidence of skin thinning in five RCTs. One RCT found biochemical adrenal suppression (2/44 children, potent TCS). CONCLUSIONS W e found no evidence of harm when TCS were used intermittently 'as required' to treat flares or 'weekend therapy' to prevent flares. However, long-term safety data were limited.

Methods and Results Male C57BL/6J mice (4-6 months of age) were subjected to sham surgeries or transverse aortic constriction to produce cardiac pressure overload. Two weeks after transverse aortic constriction, empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day) or vehicle was administered daily for 4 weeks. Empagliflozin increased survival rate and significantly attenuated adverse left ventricle remodeling and cardiac fibrosis after transverse aortic constriction. Empagliflozin also attenuated left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, evaluated by echocardiography, and increased exercise endurance by 36% in mice with transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure. Empagliflozin significantly increased glucose and fatty acid oxidation in failing hearts, while reducing glycolysis. These beneficial cardiac effects of empagliflozin occurred despite no significant changes in fasting blood glucose, body weight, or daily urine volume. In vitro experiments in isolated cardiomyocytes indicated that empagliflozin had direct effects to improve cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium transients. Importantly, molecular docking analysis and isolated perfused heart experiments indicated that empagliflozin can bind cardiac glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, restore activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and inhibit activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that empagliflozin may directly bind glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, rebalance coupling between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and regulate the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway to attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling and progression of heart failure induced by pressure-overload in non-diabetic mellitus mice.","output":"Direct Cardiac Actions of the Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin Improve Myocardial Oxidative Phosphorylation and Attenuate Pressure-Overload Heart Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy in the pediatric population. The manifestations of this disease include progressive muscle weakness, gait dysfunction, and motor impairment, leading to a loss of ambulation by the age of 13 years. Molecular diagnosis is the standard diagnostic tool for DMD. This study aimed to investigate disease progression and genetic patterns in Iranian ambulant boys and to find the correlation between genotypes and motor function phenotypes. METHODS: This study was performed on 152 DMD patients. Clinical history, including the disease phenotype, steroid therapy, and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score, was taken for all the patients. Molecular diagnoses were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and next-generation sequencing tests. RESULTS: A total of 152 Iranian DMD patients were examined in this study. The mean age at the time of disease onset was 4.04  2.00 years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 5.05  2.08 years. The mean age of ambulation loss was 10.9 years. Contracture was reported in 38.9% of cases. In terms of age, the mean total NSAA score showed a peak at 4 years of age, with a mean NSAA score of 24. Annual changes in the NSAA score were determined for all cases, based on the mutation type and exon site. Deletion mutation was found in 79.1% of cases, duplication in 6.8%, nonsense in 12.8%, and splice site in 1.4%. The most common single exon deletion was exon 44 (5.3%), and the most common multiexon deletions were attributed to exons 45C50 and exons 45C52 (4.6%). The results did not indicate any correlation between the mutation type and age at the time of disease onset, loss of ambulation age, and wheelchair dependence; however, a significant association was found between contracture and mutation type. The results showed a significant difference in the NSAA score between the deletion and nonsense groups at the age of 3 years (P = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the phenotype and exon site. Overall, 91.1% of the study population had a history of corticosteroid use, and 54.1% showed compliance with rehabilitation therapy. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the phenotypes and mutational features of Iranian DMD boys and provided information regarding the natural motor history of the disease, disease progression, diagnosis, and status of DMD management in Iran.

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). AIMS: To summarise the changes in liver function tests during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of COVID-19 in patients with underlying CLD. METHODS: A literature review using online database PubMed was done using the search terms \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"liver\\", \\"cirrhosis\\" and \\"liver transplantation\\". RESULTS: COVID-19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree. Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases. Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.

The aim of this study was to establish a model of rabbit empyema infected by P. aeruginosa to determine whether it causes the formation of biofilm in the pleural cavity. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) on biofilm formation in this P. aeruginosa empyema model. Methods Twenty rabbits were used and randomly divided into five groups: PAO1, PAO1wspF, and PAO1/p lac-yhjH infection groups, and Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and turpentine control groups. A drainage catheter was implanted into the pleural cavity through thoracentesis. The three infection groups were respectively infected with PAO1, PAO1wspF, and PAO1/p lac-yhjH strains, which caused empyema. The two control groups were injected with LB or turpentine. After 4 days of infection, we sacrificed the rabbits. We evaluated the pathology of pleura through hematoxylin-eosin staining. Colony count and crystal violet assay were used to analyze the biofilm formation on the surface of catheters. Scanning electron was used to observe the biofilm on the surface of the pleura. Peptide nucleic acids-fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) was used to observe the biofilm in the fibrinous deposition. Results By the PNA-FISH assay, biofilms were observed in the fibrinous deposition of the three infection groups. The red fluorescence area of the PAO1wspF infection group was larger than that of the PAO1 and PAO1/p lac -yhjH infection groups. Through electron microscopy, we observed that PAO1 strains were embedded in an electron-dense extracellular matrix on the surface of pleural tissue, and appeared to be biofilm-like structures. For the crystal violet assay, the optical density values of different groups were significantly different: PAO1wspF > PAO1 > PAO1/p lac-yhjH > control groups (P<0.05).

Secondary outcomes were clearance of VREfm colonization at weeks 8, 16, and 24, number of VREfm infections (isolated from nonintestinal foci), and changes in fecal microbiome diversity after the intervention. The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized adult VREfm carriers. Patients were enrolled and randomized to receive 60 billion CFU of LGG daily or placebo for 4 weeks. For a subgroup of patients, rectal swabs for VREfm were collected also at 8, 16, and 24 weeks and analyzed using shotgun metagenomics.

This article retrospectively investigated the 30-day and 1-year outcomes of tailored endovascular treatment for patients with severe intracranial ICA stenosis from a single center. Methods: Between June 2014 and December 2017, 96 consecutive patients with severe atherosclerotic stenosis (70-99%) of the intracranial ICA were managed with endovascular treatment in Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Three different kinds of treatments [angioplasty with balloon dilatation alone (BD group), balloon-mounted stent (BMS group), and self-expanding stent (SES group)] were performed according to the characteristics of the lesions. The primary endpoints included any stroke or death within 30 days and ipsilateral ischemic stroke afterwards within 1 year. Secondary endpoints included the revascularization success rate (residual stenosis <30%) and the restenosis rate (stenosis  50%) within 1 year. Results: The 30-day death rate was 0, and the stroke rate of all patients was 7.3% (7/96). The stroke rate was higher in the BD group (15.8%) and SES group (9.8%) than in the BMS group (0%) (p = 0.047). Thirteen (13.5%) patients suffered at least one onset of ischemic stroke in the ipsilateral ICA territory within 1 year, and there was no significant difference among the three groups (p = 0.165). The overall revascularization success rate was 93.8%, and the revascularization success rate was significantly higher in the SES group (100%) than in the BD group (78.9%) (p = 0.006).

However, regional differences also became apparent and with the second wave of infections, the detailed characterization of COVID-19 patients is crucial to early diagnosis and disruption of chains of infections. METHODS: Handing out detailed questionnaires to all individuals tested for COVID-19, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of negative and positive tested individuals. Expression of symptoms, symptom duration and association between predictor variables (i.e. age, gender) and a binary outcome (olfactory and gustatory dysfunction) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, the most common symptoms among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were fatigue, headache, and cough. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were also reported by many SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals, more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 negative tested individuals in our study reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Independent of SARS-CoV-2 status, more females displayed symptoms of gustatory (29.8%, p = 0.0041) and olfactory dysfunction (22.9%, p = 0.0174) compared to men. CONCLUSIONS: Bringing early SARS-CoV-2 tests to the populations at risk must be a main focus for the upcoming months. The reliability of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 negative tested individuals requires deeper investigation in the future.

Aims: To describe and compare the characteristics, care management and 90-day post discharge outcomes of patients hospitalized for MI who did not have COVID-19 with those of patients with concomitant or previous hospital-diagnosed COVID-19. Methods: This population-based French study included all patients hospitalized for MI in France (30 December 2019 to 04 October 2020) from the French National Health Data System. Outcomes were described for each COVID-19 group and compared using adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 55,524 patients hospitalized for MI, 135 had previous hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 and 329 had concomitant COVID-19. Patients with previous hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 had more personal history of cardiovascular diseases than those without concomitant/previous confirmed COVID-19. In-hospital and 90-day post discharge mortality rates of patients with previous COVID-19 were 8.1% and 4.0%, respectively, compared with 3.5% and 3.0% in patients without concomitant/previous confirmed COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]adj in-hospital 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97C3.46; ORadj post discharge 0.77, 95% CI 0.28C2.13). Patients with concomitant COVID-19 had more personal history of cardiovascular diseases, but also a poorer prognosis than their no concomitant/no previous confirmed COVID-19 counterparts; they presented excess cardiac complications during hospitalization (ORadj 1.62, 95% CI 1.29C2.04), in-hospital mortality (ORadj 3.31, 95% CI 2.32C4.72) and 90-day post discharge mortality (ORadj 2.09, 95% CI 1.24C3.51). Conclusions: In-hospital and 90-day post discharge mortality of patients hospitalized for MI who had previous hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 did not seem to differ from those hospitalized for MI alone. Conversely, concomitant COVID-19 and MI carried a poorer prognosis extending beyond the hospital stay.

Here, we analyzed the effects of the plant compound silvestrol, a specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, on viral translation using a dual luciferase assay and virus-infected primary cells. Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. We found that silvestrol is also a potent inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. EC(50) values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM silvestrol were determined for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively. For the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Silvestrol strongly inhibits the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. Furthermore, potential antiviral effects against human rhinovirus (HRV) A1 and poliovirus type 1 (PV), representing different species in the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae), were investigated. The two viruses employ an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation mechanism. For PV, which is known to require the activity of eIF4A, an EC(50) value of 20 nM silvestrol was determined in MRC-5 cells. The higher EC(50) value of 100 nM measured for HRV A1 indicates a less critical role of eIF4A activity in HRV A1 IRES-mediated translation initiation. Taken together, the data reveal a broad-spectrum antiviral activity of silvestrol in infected primary cells by inhibiting eIF4A-dependent viral mRNA translation.","output":"Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol against corona- and picornaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 37-year-old man was presented with incidental findings of neutropenia, atypical lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia and deranged liver parenchymal enzymes.

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-&#945; and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-&#945; and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-&#945; levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality.

They are, however, associated with negative patient experiences and outcomes, including an adverse impact on mental health and lower quality of care due to limited interaction with healthcare workers. In this study, we explore the lived experience and perceptions of patients in isolation with COVID-19 in an Australian healthcare setting. METHODS: Using a phenomenological approach from a Heideggerian hermeneutical perspective, we conducted individual semi-structured interviews with the first eleven COVID-19 patients admitted to a designated COVID-19 facility in Australia. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo 12 for coding and analysis. RESULTS: Participants' lived experience and perceptions of COVID-19 were represented by five themes: 'Knowing about COVID-19', 'Planning for, and responding to, COVID-19', 'Being infected', 'Life in isolation and the room', and 'Post-discharge life'. Within these, participants conveyed both positive and negative lived experiences of infection, isolation and illness. The contextual aspects of their social and physical environment together with their individual resources contributed to the framing of their planning for, and response to, the outbreak, and were important mediators in their experience. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide a valuable insight into the lived experiences of patients with COVID-19, which reflect those of patients with other infectious diseases who require isolation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19: The lived experience and perceptions of patients in isolation and care in an Australian healthcare setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although urological diseases are not directly related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), urologists need to make comprehensive plans for this disease.

This study looks at the use of Urostentz smartphone application (app) for stent procedures and whether it improved patient communication and safety during the lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Urostentz app was used for patients who underwent ureteric stent after ureteroscopy (URS) or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedure. It is a smartphone app developed to improve patient safety, facilitate data collection, and provide an efficient interface to simplify ureteral stent tracking and patient communication. It also helps clinicians track stent-related symptoms (SRS) and provide digital remote assistance. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients registered with a mean age of 47.8 years (range:18C80) and a male: female ratio of 4.5:1. Of these, 29 (87.9%) used the Urostentz app, and 55.2% had SRS. The number of effective communication episodes ranged from 1C7/patient. Based on the symptoms and communication, stent was removed during lockdown (n = 2), within 1 week of lockdown lifted (n = 24) and within 2 weeks of lockdown lifted (n = 5). None of the patients suffered any stent-related complications and there were no cases of forgotten stents or readmissions despite the lockdown and lack of communication using standard practices. CONCLUSIONS: The Urostentz app proved to an effective medium of communication to provide guidance and personalized digital remote healthcare. It also allowed prompt removal of stents avoiding prolonged stent symptoms or forgotten stents. Such apps can have a much wider application in the post-COVID-19-era to reduce unnecessary post-procedural visits and reduce health care costs.","output":"Use of ureteric stent related mobile phone application (UROSTENTZ App) in COVID-19 for improving patient communication and safety: a prospective pilot study from a university hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for stroke experts to advance the care of their patients, yet current approaches are outmoded and have not been successful.

We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions, we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future.

This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IMMUNO-COV? assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in convalescent plasma therapy studies.","output":"Development and validation of IMMUNO-COV?: a high-throughput clinical assay for detecting antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first recorded in China in December 2019, quickly spread to other countries and in a short period of time, the local outbreak escalated into a pandemic. There are significantly more cases of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in European countries than in East Asia, where the disease was first detected. Such population differences are unique, especially for SARS-CoV-2 and are due to both socio-behavioral differences and features of the gene pool of the population of different countries. For infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, an important point is the genetic characteristics of individuals, which can determine its resistance or susceptibility to infection. Therefore, studies of the factors of hereditary predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as severity and mortality are extremely relevant. After genotyping among the healthy population of Ukraine and collecting relevant data from some European countries, we determined the correlation between morbidity, mortality from COVID-19 and the prevalence of genotype II (ACE1, I/D polymorphism) in the populations of Ukraine and several European countries. There was a negative correlation between the carrier of genotype II and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection per one million population (R = C0.53, p < 0.05), so individuals with genotype II can be considered more resistant to infection SARS-CoV-2. Further study of the role of allelic variants of the ACE1 gene in the development of severity and complications affected patients of COVID-19, are promising for identified of genetic markers for development of personalized therapy.","output":"Relationship between the Prevalence of ACE1 I/D Polymorphism Genotype II and Covid-19 Morbidity, Mortality in Ukraine and in Some Europe Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir was shown to inhibit RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (RdRp) from distinct viral families such as from Filoviridae (Ebola) and Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS).

Super-pixels are the meaningful group of pixels of the image, bunched together based on the color and proximity of singular pixel. Computation of super-pixels is highly affected in terms of accuracy if the image has high pixel intensities, i.e., a semi-dark image is observed. For computation of super-pixels, a widely used method is SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering), due to its simplistic approach. The SLIC is considerably faster than other state-of-the-art methods. However, it lacks in functionality to retain the content-aware information of the image due to constrained underlying clustering technique. Moreover, the efficiency of SLIC on semi-dark images is lower than bright images. We extend the functionality of SLIC to several computational distance measures to identify potential substitutes resulting in regular and accurate image segments. We propose a novel SLIC extension, namely, SLIC++ based on hybrid distance measure to retain content-aware information (lacking in SLIC). This makes SLIC++ more efficient than SLIC. The proposed SLIC++ does not only hold efficiency for normal images but also for semi-dark images. The hybrid content-aware distance measure effectively integrates the Euclidean super-pixel calculation features with Geodesic distance calculations to retain the angular movements of the components present in the visual image exclusively targeting semi-dark images. The proposed method is quantitively and qualitatively analyzed using the Berkeley dataset. We not only visually illustrate the benchmarking results, but also report on the associated accuracies against the ground-truth image segments in terms of boundary precision. SLIC++ attains high accuracy and creates content-aware super-pixels even if the images are semi-dark in nature.

Hourly traffic, air pollutants, and meteorological data on/near a major freeway in the downtown of Seattle, Washington, were collected for five weeks before and ten weeks after the Washington Stay Home Order (SHO) was enacted, respectively (February 17CMay 31, 2020). The pollutants between pre- and post-SHO periods were compared, and their differences were statistically tested. Besides, first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models were developed to reveal the impacts specific to the change of traffic due to the COVID-19 responses while controlling for meteorological conditions. Results indicate that compared with those in the post-SHO period, the median traffic volume and road occupancy decreased by 37% and 52%, respectively. As for pollutants, the median BC and PM2.5 levels significantly decreased by 25% and 33%, relatively, while NO, NO2, NOx, and CO decreased by 33%, 29%, 30%, and 17%, respectively. In contrast, neither size-resolved UFPs nor total UFPs showed significant changes between the two periods, although larger particles (115.5 nm) decreased by 4C29%. Additionally, significant differences were found in meteorological conditions between the two periods. Based on the MAR(1) models, controlling for meteorological conditions, the COVID-19 responses were associated with significant decreases in median levels of traffic-related pollutants including 11.5C154.0 nm particles (ranging from ?3% [95% confidence interval (CI): ?1%, ?4%] to ?12% [95% CI: ?10%, ?14%]), total UFPs (?7% [95% CI: ?5%, ?8%]), BC (?6% [95% CI: ?5%, ?7%]), PM2.5 (?2% [95% CI: ?1%, ?3%]), NO, NO2, NOx (ranging from ?3% [95% CI: ?2%, ?4%] to ?10% [95% CI: ?18%, ?12%]), and CO (?4% [95% CI, ?3%, ?5%]). These findings illustrate that the conclusion of the COVID-19 impacts on urban traffic-related air pollutant levels could be completely different in scenarios whether meteorology was adjusted for or not. Fully adjusting for meteorology, this study shows that the COVID-19 responses were associated with much more reductions in traffic-related UFPs than PM2.5 in the Seattle region, in contrast to the reverse trend from the direct empirical data comparison.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 responses on traffic-related air pollution in a Northwestern US city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) Delta was first detected in India in October 2020. The first imported cases of the Delta variant in Brazil were identified in April 2021 in the Southern region, followed by more cases in different country regions during the following months. By early September 2021, Delta was already the dominant variant in the Southeastern (87%), Southern (73%), and Northeastern (52%) Brazilian regions. This work aimed to understand the spatiotemporal dissemination dynamics of Delta in Brazil. To this end, we employed a combination of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods to reconstruct the evolutionary relationship of 2,264 of VOC Delta complete genomes (482 from this study) recovered across 21 out of 27 Brazilian federal units. Our phylogeographic analyses identified three major transmission clusters of Delta in Brazil. The clade BR-I (n = 1,560) arose in Rio de Janeiro in late April 2021 and was the major cluster behind the dissemination of the VOC Delta in the Southeastern, Northeastern, Northern, and Central-Western regions. The clade BR-II (n = 207) arose in the Parana state in late April 2021 and aggregated the largest fraction of sampled genomes from the Southern region. Lastly, the clade BR-III emerged in the Sao Paulo state in early June 2021 and remained mostly restricted to this state. In the rapid turnover of viral variants characteristic of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Brazilian regions seem to occupy different stages of an increasing prevalence of the VOC Delta in their epidemic profiles. This process demands continuous genomic and epidemiological surveillance toward identifying and mitigating new introductions, limiting their dissemination, and preventing the establishment of more significant outbreaks in a population already heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Emergence and Spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern Delta Across Different Brazilian Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deubiquitinating enzymes, or DUBs, comprise a family of proteases that regulate ubiquitination dynamics.

Studies treating HIV-1-infected individuals with latency reactivation agents to reduce their latent HIV-1 reservoirs indicated that their HIV-1-specific immune responses were insufficient to effectively eliminate the reactivated latent HIV-1-infected T cells. Mobilization of ADCC may facilitate elimination of reactivated latent HIV-1-infected cells to deplete the HIV-1 reservoir and contribute to a functional HIV-1 cure. The most effective antibodies for controlling and eradicating HIV-1 infection would likely have the dual capacities of potently neutralizing a broad range of HIV-1 isolates and effectively mobilizing HIV-1-specific ADCC to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells.

Modern databases provide transactions with various semantics corresponding to different trade-offs between consistency and availability. Since a weaker consistency model provides better performance, an important issue is investigating the weakest level of consistency needed by a given program (to satisfy its specification). As a way of dealing with this issue, we investigate the problem of checking whether a given program has the same set of behaviors when replacing a consistency model with a weaker one. This property known as robustness generally implies that any specification of the program is preserved when weakening the consistency. We focus on the robustness problem for consistency models which are weaker than standard serializability, namely, causal consistency, prefix consistency, and snapshot isolation. We show that checking robustness between these models is polynomial time reducible to a state reachability problem under serializability. We use this reduction to also derive a pragmatic proof technique based on Liptons reduction theory that allows to prove programs robust.

Areas covered: This review highlights the drug-drug interactions between antiepileptics and aminophylline, some antidepressant, antiarrhythmic (class I - IV), selected antihypertensive drugs and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics (ketamine, propofol, etomidate, and alphaxalone). The data were reviewed mainly from experimental models of seizures. Whenever possible, clinical data were provided. PUBMED data base was the main search source. Expert opinion: Aminophylline generally reduced the protective activity of antiepileptics, which, to a certain degree, was consistent with scarce clinical data on methylxanthine derivatives and worse seizure control. The only antiarrhythmic with this profile of action was mexiletine when co-administered with VPA. Among antidepressants and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics, trazodone, mianserin and etomidate or alphaxalone, respectively, negatively affected the anticonvulsant action of some antiepileptic drugs.

The smoothed time series of polarity proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion, enhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical immunization topics, should never be used for political consensus. This is especially true given the increasing role of online social media as information source, which might yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is worsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.","output":"Evidence of disorientation towards immunization on online social media after contrasting political communication on vaccines.

However, our world is dynamic, evolves over time, and our models' knowledge becomes outdated. To study how semi-parametric QA models and their underlying parametric language models (LMs) adapt to evolving knowledge, we construct a new large-scale dataset, StreamingQA, with human written and generated questions asked on a given date, to be answered from 14 years of time-stamped news articles. We evaluate our models quarterly as they read new articles not seen in pre-training. We show that parametric models can be updated without full retraining, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. For semi-parametric models, adding new articles into the search space allows for rapid adaptation, however, models with an outdated underlying LM under-perform those with a retrained LM. For questions about higher-frequency named entities, parametric updates are particularly beneficial.

Three broad components of gaming motivation have been proposed: achievement, immersion, and social. Achievement-oriented players are motivated by gaining in-game rewards, immersion-oriented players are motivated by the experience of immersion in the virtual world, and social-oriented players are motivated by the need to socialize with other players through gaming. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) quantitatively synthesize the growing body of literature to systematically examine the discrepancies in the magnitude of associations between various components of gaming motivation and IGD and (2) examine the moderating role of cultural dimension on the association between escapism gaming motivation and IGD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of multiple databases between 2002 and 2020. Studies were included if they (1) included quantitative data, (2) used measures assessing both gaming motivation and IGD, and (3) contained sufficient information for effect size calculation. RESULTS: The findings revealed IGD to have a stronger association with achievement motivation (r=0.32) than with immersion (r=0.22) or social motivation (r=0.20), but the strongest such association was found to be with escapism motivation (r=0.40), a subcomponent of immersion motivation. Our cross-cultural comparison further showed a stronger association between escapism motivation and IGD in studies conducted in individualistic (vs collectivistic) regions. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis highlights the importance of acknowledging the discrepancies among different components of gaming motivation with respect to their role in the development of IGD, as well as the potential cultural variations in the strength of such associations.","output":"The Associations Between Gaming Motivation and Internet Gaming Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community pharmacists are one of the most accessible healthcare professionals and are often served as the first point of contact when it comes to minor ailments and health advice. As such, community pharmacists can play a vital role in a country's response to various preventative and public health measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the essential nature of community pharmacy as a health service, community pharmacies are unlikely to shut down in any foreseeable lockdown scenario. It is therefore important to assess the preventative measure directives for community pharmacies that are in place to safeguard community pharmacy personnel from SARS-CoV-2 in the various parts of the world. Upon reviewing the recommendations of 15 selected countries across five continents (Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, and Africa) on social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in community pharmacies, we found inconsistencies in the recommended social distance to be practiced within the community pharmacies. There were also varying recommendations on the use of PPE by the pharmacy personnel. Despite the differences in the recommendations, maintaining recommended social distance and the wearing of appropriate PPE is of utmost importance for healthcare workers, including community pharmacy personnel dealing with day-to-day patient care activities, though full PPE should be worn when dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients.","output":"Social distancing and the use of PPE by community pharmacy personnel: Does evidence support these measures?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Battling a widespread pandemic is an arms race between our mitigation efforts, e.g., social distancing or vaccination, and the pathogen's evolving persistence. This is being observed firsthand during the current COVID-19 crisis, as novel mutations challenge our global vaccination race. To address this, we introduce here a general framework to model epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution, finding that mutations can fundamentally alter the projection of the spread. Specifically, we detect a new pandemic phase - the mutated phase - in which, despite the fact that the pathogen is initially non-pandemic (R0 < 1), it may still spread due to the emergence of a critical mutation. The boundaries of this phase portray a balance between the epidemic and the evolutionary time-scales. If the mutation rate is too low, the pathogen prevalence decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other hand, if mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and, once again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we observe a broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen will eventually gain prevalence. This is especially relevant during vaccination, which creates, as it progresses, increasing selection pressure towards vaccine-resistance. To overcome this, we show that vaccination campaigns must be accompanied by fierce mitigation efforts, to suppress the potential rise of a resistant mutant strain.","output":"Epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time dependent SIR model is extended to simulate infection across spatial boundaries.

The redistribution of resources and suspension of elective procedures and other services has placed a financial stress across all service lines. The financial impact on the practice of vascular surgery has not yet been quantified. This study hypothesized that vascular surgery divisions have experienced losses affecting the hospital and professional side that will not be recoupable without significant productivity increases. Administrative claims data for clinical services performed by the vascular surgery division at a tertiary medical center from March-April 2019 and March-April 2020 were analyzed. These claims were separated into two categories: Hospital claims (Inpatient and Outpatient) and Professional claims (professional reimbursement for all services provided). Medicare reimbursement methodologies were utilized to assign financial value: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) for inpatient services, Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) for outpatient services, and Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for professional reimbursement and work relative value units (wRVU). Reimbursements and productivity (wRVU) were compared between the two time periods. A financial model was created to determine the increase in future productivity over baseline required to mitigate losses incurred during the pandemic. A total of 11,317 vascular surgery claims were reviewed. Hospital reimbursement during the pandemic decreased from $4,982,114 to $2,649,521, -47% (inpatient: $3,505,775 to $2,128,133, -39%; outpatient $1,476,339 to $521,388, -65%) while professional reimbursement decreased from $933,897 to $430,967, -54% when compared to the same time period in 2019. Professional productivity as measured by wRVUs sustained a similar decline from 10478 wRVU to 5386 wRVU, -51%. Modeling sensitivity analyses demonstrated that if a vascular division were able to increase Inpatient and Outpatient revenue, above pre-pandemic levels, by 10%, 5%, or 3%, it would take 9 months, 19 months, or 31 months, respectively, for the hospital to recover pandemic-associated losses. Similarly, professional reimbursement recovery would require 11 months, 20 months, or 36 months for a similar increase in productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and lasting impact on the world in terms of lives lost and financial hardships. The financial impact on a vascular surgery division has resulted in losses ranging from 39% to 65% when compared to pre-pandemic period the previous year. Because complete mitigation of losses is not feasible in the short-term, alternative and novel strategies are needed to financially sustain the vascular division and hospital during a prolonged recovery period.","output":"Financial Implications of COVID-19 on a Tertiary Academic Vascular Surgery Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a challenge worldwide.

This study aimed to evaluate the peak value of serum KL-6 during hospitalization for COVID-19 to discover a more useful biomarker for predicting prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we analyzed the data of 147 hospitalized patients who required supplemental oxygen, high-flow oxygen therapy, or invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19 from March 2020 to February 2021. We extracted data on patient sex, age, comorbidities, treatment, and biomarkers including the initial and peak values of KL-6. Inclusion criteria were examination of the studied biomarkers at least once within 3 days of admission, then at least once a week, and at a minimum, at least twice during the entire hospitalization. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was analyzed to determine the accuracy of several biomarkers including KL-6 and LDH for predicting poor prognosis defined as survivors requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for over 28 days or non-survivors of COVID-19. Univariable and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the prognostic value of the baseline characteristics and biomarkers. RESULTS: Among the 147 patients, 108 (73.5%) had a good prognosis and 39 (26.5%) had a poor prognosis. The AUC analysis indicated that peak KL-6 showed precise accuracy in the discrimination of patients with poor prognosis (AUC 0.89, p < 0.001). The best cut-off value for KL-6 concentration was 966 U/mL (sensitivity 81.6%, specificity84.3%). After adjustment, increasing peak values of KL-6 or LDH were associated with a high risk of poor prognosis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.35 for peak value of KL-6, per 100 U/mL increase (95% CI 1.17C1.57, p < 0.001) and 2.16 for peak value of LDH, per 100 U/L increase (95% CI 1.46C3.20, p < 0.001).

As prior works revealed, the efficacy of Parkinson's medicines and antiviral flavonoid herbs was strongly governed by their bioenergy-stimulating proficiency. METHODS: Herbal extracts were prepared by using a traditional Chinese decoction pot. After filtration and evaporation, crude extracts were used to prepare sample solutions for various bioassays. The phytochemical content and bioactivities of AHEs were determined via ELISA microplate reader. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were used as a novel platform to evaluate bioenergy contents with electron-transfer characteristics for antiviral drug development. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Regarding 18 TCM herbal extracts for the prevention of SARS and H1N1 influenza, comparison on total polyphenol, flavonoid, condensed tannins and polysaccharides were conducted. Moreover, considerable total flavonoid contents were detected for 11 herb extracts. These AEHs were not only rich in phytonutrient contents but also plentiful in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Herbs with high polyphenol content had higher antioxidant activity.

Objective: To evaluate physical and mental well-being, subjective mental health, and need for updated psychiatric management plans in a sample of patients with severe mental illness during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional study of structured telephone assessments conducted between April 23 and June 30, 2020. Setting: Regional psychiatric outpatient care centre in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants: Patients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric clinic between April 9 and April 23, 2020. A total of 1071 patients were contacted by phone. Exposures: Occurrence of respiratory symptoms, changes in psychiatric symptoms, and the need for updated psychiatric management plans, as determined by the telephone assessors. Subjective mental health rated 0-100 by patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-rated physical, respiratory and psychiatric symptoms according to a semi-structured interview. Subjective mental health rated on a scale from 0-100. Results: Patients (n = 1071) were on average 45 years old (SD = 16.9), of which 570 (53%) were female. Neurodevelopmental disorders, psychotic disorders, and bipolar disorder were the most common diagnostic categories. The majority of respondents reported no respiratory symptoms (86%), and few reported light (10%) or severe (4%) respiratory symptoms. Similarly, most patients reported no worsening in psychiatric symptoms (81%). For those who reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms (19%), the psychiatric management plans that were already in place were deemed appropriate in most cases (16.5%), whereas 22 patients (2.5%) reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms that warranted an earlier or immediate follow-up by their psychiatric clinic.

This definition represents broader understanding of most contributing factors to SI and supports the concepts of reduced communication and socialization experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic served to heighten this problem, including communication challenges, and brought negative outcomes of SI to light. The overall research question examined the impact of communication challenges and SI on OAs with Alzheimer's disease, related dementias, and subjective cognitive changes (2020-2021). This scoping literature review was developed to compare the psychosocial and mental health of older adults between prepandemic and pandemic lockdown of 2020-2021. DESIGN AND METHODS This review followed the procedures for scoping review reporting as stated by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). In collaboration with an expert scientific information specialist assigned to the college of nursing, the literature was queried through MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process, In-Data-Review & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily 1946 to September 02, 2021; APA PsycInfo 1806 to August Week 5 2021; and Embase Classic+Embase 1947 to 2021 September 02.

FINDINGS Quantitative data informed outcomes through increased depression and anxiety, higher rates of depression during the pandemic than prepandemic, and increased symptomology in neuropsychiatric profiles. Further, COVID19-related restrictions, including impaired communication streams, seemed to be the origin of stress-related cognitive changes and symptomology. Communication challenges in residents with dementia may lead to feelings of social isolation. Qualitative evidence supports that dementia has a social, psychological, material, and socio-demographic impact. Further, the lockdown disrupted the existing flow of communication between all stakeholders and residents, resulting in heightened perceptions of SI and a profound sense of loss.

MiRNAs from dietary plants are conventionally thought to be degraded during the gastrointestinal digestion process. A few recent reports suggest that dietary microRNAs may exhibit resistance to this process, enter systemic circulation and exert biological effects on animal physiology. Scope and approach The horizontal transfer of miRNAs into systemic circulation is not feasible for all dietary miRNAs due to lack of bioavailability. Hence, this is a highly debated proposition with conflicting data presented in literature. Dietary miRNAs may exhibit such cross-kingdom regulation if present in extracellular vesicles which increases their bioavailability. These vesicular structures from plants are known as edible nanoparticles (ENPs). ENPs have been isolated from several edible plants. These nano-sized vesicles are filled with bioactives, proteins, lipids and miRNAs, in a bioavailable form. ENP-derived miRNAs are gaining attention due to their relative stability and resistance to degradation. ENP-derived miRNAs may enter systemic circulation and target mRNAs in recipient cells. With the COVID-19 pandemic threat worldwide, it appears that ENP-derived miRNAs could also be exploited for targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Key findings and conclusions ENP-derived miRNAs are probably more bioavailable and are spontaneously absorbed in intestinal epithelium to suppress target transcripts in human/microbial/viral kingdoms. Such cross-kingdom regulation exhibited by dietary miRNAs, if properly investigated and validated, may aid in the development of non-toxic and cost-effective therapeutics to treat human diseases.","output":"Inter-kingdom regulation of human transcriptome by dietary microRNAs: Emerging bioactives from edible plants to treat human diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With much of the global economy now in some form of lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, we expect world GDP to contract by about 7% in H1 2020.

However, viable deployment demands a minimal quarantine burden on the general public. That is, consideration must be given to unnecessary quarantining imposed by a contact tracing policy. Previous studies have modeled the role of contact tracing, but have not addressed how to balance these two competing needs. We propose a modeling framework that captures contact heterogeneity. This allows contact prioritization: contacts are only notified if they were acutely exposed to individuals who eventually tested positive. The framework thus allows us to address the delicate balance of preventing disease spread while minimizing the social and economic burdens of quarantine. This optimal contact tracing strategy is studied as a function of limitations in testing resources, partial technology adoption, and other intervention methods such as social distancing and lockdown measures. The framework is globally applicable, as the distribution describing contact heterogeneity is directly adaptable to any digital tracing implementation.","output":"To quarantine, or not to quarantine: A theoretical framework for disease control via contact tracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination yields the direct individual benefit of protecting recipients from infectious diseases and also the indirect social benefit of reducing the transmission of infections to others, often referred to as herd immunity This research examines how prosocial concern for vaccination, defined as people's preoccupation with infecting others if they do not vaccinate themselves, motivates vaccination in more and less populated regions of the United States. A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.","output":"Concerns for others increases the likelihood of vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 more in sparsely rather than densely populated areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The patient concerns inventory (PCI) is a prompt list allowing head and neck cancer (HNC) patients to discuss issues that otherwise might be overlooked. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of using the PCI at routine outpatient clinics for one year after treatment on health-related QOL (HRQOL). METHODS: A pragmatic cluster preference randomised control trial with 15 consultants, 8 using and 7 not using the PCI intervention. Patients treated with curative intent (all sites, disease stages, treatments) were eligible. RESULTS: Consultants saw a median (inter-quartile range) 16 (13C26) patients, with 140 PCI and 148 control patients. Of the pre-specified outcomes, the 12-month results for the mean University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOLv4) social-emotional subscale score suggested a small clinical effect of intervention of 4.6 units (95% CI 0.2, 9.0), p = 0.04 after full adjustment for pre-stated case-mix. Results for UW-QOLv4 overall quality of life being less than good at 12 months (primary outcome) also favoured the PCI with a risk ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.66, 1.06) and absolute risk 4.8% (? 2.9%, 12.9%) but without achieving statistical significance. Other non-a-priori analyses, including all 12 UWQOL domains and at consultant level also suggested better HRQOL with PCI. Consultation times were unaffected and the number of items selected decreased over time. CONCLUSION: This novel trial supports the integration of the PCI approach into routine consultations as a simple low-cost means of benefiting HNC patients.

Many have speculated on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of these disturbances; however, no definite answers have been produced on the topic. With this systematic review, we aimed to collect all the available evidence regarding the prevalence of OGD, the timing of their onset and their resolution, their rate of recovery and their role as diagnostic and prognostic tools for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: A systematic review comprising all the observational studies that reported the prevalence and/or the longitudinal trajectories of OGD in COVID-19 patients, as self-reported by patients or measured through objective psychophysical tests. Results: After the selection process, 155 studies were included, with a total of 70920 patients and 105291 not-infected individuals. Prevalence reports were extremely variable across studies, with wide ranges for OD (0% - 98%) and GD (0-89%) prevalence. OGD occurred early during the disease course and only rarely preceded other symptoms; out of 30 studies with a follow-up time of at least 20 days, only in 5 studies OGD fully resolved in more than 90% of patients. OGD had low sensitivity and high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accuracy of OD and GD for infection identification was higher than 80% in 10 out of 33 studies and in 8 out of 22 studies considered, respectively. 28 out of 30 studies that studied the association between OGD and disease severity found how OGD were associated with lower rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality. Conclusions: OGD seem to be highly prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They occur early, concomitantly with other symptoms and often persist after recovery, in some cases for months; whether a full recovery eventually occurs in all cases is not clear yet. OGD are good predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with a milder disease course.","output":"OLFACTORY AND GUSTATORY DYSFUNCTIONS IN SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. More than 95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p<0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p<0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.

We analyzed the impact of surgical margins in laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) for CRLM, using the parenchymal-sparing approach on overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). METHODS From January 2005 to October 2012, 114 first LLR for CRLM were performed and retrospectively analyzed. The ultrasonic aspirator was used for parenchyma division. R1 margins were defined when the tissue width was <1 mm. RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 30.9  1.71 months, OS was 97.1-73.9-58.9% and the RFS 64.2-35.2-31% at 1-3-5 years, respectively. The major resection rate was 7%. The median margin width was 3 (0-40) mm, and R1 resection was recorded in 14 (12.3%) cases. Twenty-two patients (33.3%) with hepatic recurrence underwent a repeat hepatectomy. R1 margins were significantly related to lower RFS survival (p = 0.038) but did not affect OS. Multivariate analysis showed that lesions located in postero-superior segments (HR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.24-4.61, p = 0.009) as well as blood loss (HR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.23-7.99, p = 0.012) were independent risk factors for tumor recurrence. The carcinoembryonic antigen level >10 mcg/L affected OS (HR = 4.2 95% CI 2.02-16.9, p = 0.001), and the resection of more than two tumors was significantly associated with R1 margins (HR = 9.32, 95% CI 1.14-32.5, p = 0.037). DISCUSSION Laparoscopic parenchymal-sparing surgery of CRLM does not compromise the oncological outcome, allowing a higher percentage of repeat hepatectomy.

Although most children appear to have mild or asymptomatic infections, infants and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of experiencing more severe illness and requiring hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The recent but uncommon association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with development of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome has heightened the importance of understanding paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Paediatric Emergency Research Network-COVID-19 cohort study is a rapid, global, prospective cohort study enrolling 12 500 children who are tested for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. 47 emergency departments across 12 countries on four continents will participate. At enrolment, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results, all children will have the same information collected, including clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, imaging and outcome data. Interventions and outcome data will be collected for hospitalised children. For all children, follow-up at 14 and 90 days will collect information on further medical care received, and long-term sequelae, respectively. Statistical models will be designed to identify risk factors for infection and severe outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Sites will seek ethical approval locally, and informed consent will be obtained. There is no direct risk or benefit of study participation. Weekly interim analysis will allow for real-time data sharing with regional, national, and international policy makers. Harmonisation and sharing of investigation materials with WHO, will contribute to synergising global efforts for the clinical characterisation of paediatric COVID-19.

Several CNN architectures like VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, DenseNet 201, Xception, and InceptionResnet-v2 have been implemented and comparative analysis is presented. DenseNet 201 CNN architecture is found to be most accurate in detecting COVID-19 for both X-ray and CT-scan images. The quantitative results suggest promising results for the COVID-19 detection task.","output":"Detection of COVID-19 virus using deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Returning universities to full on-campus operations while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing has been a controversial discussion in many countries. The risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits of in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such as vaccination coverage and efficacy, number of contacts and adoption of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the virus, universities often lack sufficient scientific insight to base these decisions on. To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven agent-based simulation of transmission dynamics of 10755 students and 974 faculty members in a medium-sized European university. We use a co-location network reconstructed from student enrollment data and calibrate transmission risk based on outbreak size distributions in education institutions. We focus on actionable interventions that are part of the already existing decision-making process of universities to provide guidance for concrete policy decisions. Here we show that, with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even a reduction to 25% occupancy and universal mask mandates are not enough to prevent large outbreaks given the vaccination coverage of about 80% recently reported for students in Austria. Our results show that controlling the spread of the virus with available vaccines in combination with NPIs is not feasible in the university setting if presence of students and faculty on campus is required.","output":"Assessment of the effectiveness of Omicron transmission mitigation strategies for European universities using an agent-based network model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming an important part of epidemiological investigations of infectious diseases due to greater resolution and cost reductions compared to traditional typing approaches. Many public health and clinical teams will increasingly use WGS to investigate clusters of potential pathogen transmission, making it crucial to understand the benefits and assumptions of the analytical methods for investigating the data. We aimed to understand how different approaches affect inferences of transmission dynamics and outline limitations of the methods. METHODS: We comprehensively searched electronic databases for studies that presented methods used to interpret WGS data for investigating tuberculosis (TB) transmission. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Due to considerable methodological heterogeneity between studies, we present summary data with accompanying narrative synthesis rather than pooled analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria. Despite the range of interpretation tools, the usefulness of WGS data in understanding TB transmission often depends on the amount of genetic diversity in the setting. Where diversity is small, distinguishing re-infections from relapses may be impossible; interpretation may be aided by the use of epidemiological data, examining minor variants and deep sequencing. Conversely, when within-host diversity is large, due to genetic hitchhiking or co-infection of two dissimilar strains, it is critical to understand how it arose. Greater understanding of microevolution and mixed infection will enhance interpretation of WGS data. CONCLUSIONS: As sequencing studies have sampled more intensely and integrated multiple sources of information, the understanding of TB transmission and diversity has grown, but there is still much to be learnt about the origins of diversity that will affect inferences from these data. Public health teams and researchers should combine epidemiological, clinical and WGS data to strengthen investigations of transmission.

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by means of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before each official game.Patients (or Participants)Three Belgian professional male soccer teams (84 players in total) participated.Interventions (or Assessment of Risk Factors)Regression analysis was performed to identify the risk of developing a muscle strain injury after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Main Outcome MeasurementsMuscle strain injury, COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantine duration.ResultsEighteen players developed a muscle strain injury during the study period (June 2020- January 2021), of which 11 players were diagnosed with COVID-19. Regression analysis showed a significant association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of muscle strain injuries (p=0.010). The athletes that developed a muscle strain injury after COVID-19 diagnosis were all injured within the first month (15.71  11.74 days) after sports resumption and showed a longer quarantine duration (14.57  6.50 days) compared to the SARS-CoV-2 infected players that did not develop a muscle strain injury (11.18  5.25 days).ConclusionThis study demonstrated a five-time higher risk to develop a muscle strain injury after a SARS-CoV-2 infection in elite soccer players. Although this should be examined further, it seems possible that short-term detraining effects due to quarantine are associated with a higher risk of muscle strain injury and could possibly be related to lower physical readiness and higher rates of fatigue.","output":"The association between COVID-19 and muscle strain injury occurrence in elite soccer players: a prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, hypoxic patients were immediately intubated for fear of decompensation and aerosolizing the virus with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) Reports revealed a high mortality for intubated patients, prompting NIV such as high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) The literature lacks description of the outcomes between patients who were intubated immediately versus only after failing NIV We describe the characteristics of patients who were intubated ?early,? defined as being intubated without NIV attempts, versus ?delayed?, defined as intubated after failed initial NIV use METHODS: A prospective registry was created of all COVID-19 patients admitted to our urban academic medical center from March 2020 to July 2020 We analyzed this database to investigate escalation of respiratory support Variables of interest included intubation, use of HFNC, NIPPV, and mortality Logistic regression explored associations with mortality RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were initiated on NIV 102 began on HFNC and 7 on NIPPV A total of 47 patients were intubated early Of those started on HFNC, 24 (23 5%) were escalated directly to intubation 23 (22 5%) received NIPPV, of which 16 (69 6%) required intubation Of those started on NIPPV initially, 5 required intubation and 2 were downgraded to HFNC Comparing early versus delayed intubation, the odds ratio for surviving intubation, adjusted for age and BMI, with a trial of NIV prior to intubation was 0 057 (0 002 - 0 562) For NIPPV, 94 4% (17 of 18) of patients intubated ?delayed? died, while 69 2% (27 of 39) patients intubated ?early? died Unadjusted odds ratio for surviving intubation when having HFNC prior to intubation was 0 289 (0 081- 0 923), but lost statistical significance when adjusted for age and BMI 64 patients (58 7%) who were started on NIV were never intubated during admission CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NIV may be useful in the treatment of hypoxemia secondary to COVID-19 to prevent intubation, however the likelihood of survival decreases in those who fail NIV Delayed intubations are associated with mortality when adjusted for age and BMI Further research is needed to investigate who may benefit most from NIV as a supportive measure to prevent intubation","output":"Staving off intubation: Characteristics of outcomes in early versus delayed intubation in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the key drivers of cities international action lies in the commitment of local governments in offering innovative, world-class services to citizens through the introduction of new technologies.

In this study, we discuss the imbalance of multiple systems during the infection and the importance of therapeutic choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of cardiac and anti-coagulant therapies in COVID-19 patients. The crosstalk between angiotensin, kinin-kallikrein system, as well as inflammatory and coagulation systems plays an essential role in COVID-19. Cardiac complications and coagulopathies imply the crosstalks between the mentioned systems. We believe that the blockage of bradykinin can be a good option in the management of COVID-19 and CVD in patients and that supportive treatment of respiratory and cardiologic complications is needed in COVID-19 patients. Ninety-one percent of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to hospital with a prolonged aPTT were positive for lupus anticoagulant, which increases the risk of thrombosis and prolonged aPTT. Therefore, the question that is posed at this juncture is whether it is safe to use the prophylactic dose of heparin particularly in those with elevated D\\\\dimer levels. It should be noted that timing is of high importance in anti-coagulant therapy; therefore, we should consider the level of D-dimer, fibrinogen, drug-drug interactions, and risk factors during thromboprophylaxis administration. Fibrinogen is an independent predictor of resistance to heparin and should be considered before thromboprophylaxis. Alteplase and Futhan might be a good choice to assess the condition of heparin resistance.

Consequently, institutional surveillance of cleft concepts is essential. In addition to subjective expert rankings, three-dimensional (3D) photogrammetry of the face has become the gold standard for evaluation and objective assessment of facial structures. We evaluated cleft configuration preoperatively to determine the influence thereof on the long-term facial appearance/averageness of unilateral cleft lip patients. Methods: Plaster models of the patient's labio-oral region and nose were made preoperatively, digitized, and cleft configuration assessed (cleft width, cleft-columella angle, nasal projection, heminasal width ratio, transverse lip length, labial height). Between 4 and 12 years after surgery, stereophotogrammetry (3D face scans) were captured to determine the patients' individual facial averageness index (FAI) as a deviation from the population mean, using proportion indices (PIs) of facial landmarks and reference data provided by Farkas and FaceBase. Results: Cleft width (r = 0.77) and columella length correlated strongly with long-term facial averageness (r = 0.52). Decreasing FAI was seen with increasing patient age (r = -0.42), indicating increasing facial averageness. Other cleft properties showed weaker correlations. Cleft alveolus did not have any impact on FAI. Conclusions: The presented method allows objective measurement of facial appearance/averageness as well as preoperative cleft properties. It might be superior to subjective assessments of facial attractiveness/appearance. Objective cleft measurements are strong predictors for future facial averageness.

This study aimed to identify if non-face-to-face interaction affects depressive symptoms and frailty in older adults. METHODS: We included 3834 older adults (age: 71.1  6.9 [mean  standard deviation] years; range: 60C96 years; 2153 women) from the National Center for Geriatrics and GerontologyCStudy of Geriatric Syndromes. Interaction status was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were categorized into: both interactions (both face-to-face and non-face-to-face interactions), face-to-face only (only face-to-face interactions), non-face-to-face only (only non-face-to-face interactions), no interactions (neither face-to-face nor non-face-to-face interactions) groups. Depressive symptoms and frailty were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and Kihon Checklist, respectively. RESULTS: Potential confounding factors-adjusted odds ratios for both, face-to-face only and non-face-to-face only groups for developing depressive symptoms were 0.39 (95%CI, 0.26C0.57; p<0.001), 0.56 (95%CI, 0.38C0.84; p=0.004), and 0.51 (95%CI, 0.27C0.96; p=0.038), respectively, and those for development of frailty were 0.44 (95%CI, 0.30C0.65; p<0.001), 0.59 (95%CI, 0.39C0.87; p=0.008), and 0.63 (95%CI, 0.34C1.15; p=0.128), respectively.

METHODS In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and CINAHL from inception to October 17, 2019. We included studies comparing diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ED patients by ML models to usual care methods (triage-based scores, clinical prediction tools, clinician judgment) using predictor variables readily available to ED clinicians. We extracted commonly reported performance metrics of model discrimination and classification. We used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020158129. RESULTS The search yielded 1,656 unique records, of which 23 studies involving 16,274,647 patients were included. In all seven diagnostic studies, ML models outperformed usual care in all performance metrics. In six studies assessing in-hospital mortality, the best-performing ML models had better discrimination (AUROC 0.74-0.94) than any clinical decision tool (AUROC 0.68-0.81). In four studies assessing hospitalization, ML models had better discrimination (AUROC 0.80-0.83) than triage-based scores (AUROC 0.68-0.82). Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Most studies had high risk of bias due to lack of external validation, low event rates, and insufficient reporting of calibration.

SUMMARY: MTM clinical pharmacists at JHHCG collaborate with patients to identify barriers to adherence, review medications, and develop plans for improvement. Through improved medication adherence, the goals for this program are to reduce adverse effects, patient cost, and medical visits or hospital admissions. Central to this practice is the belief that strong patient relationships are necessary to uncover the root cause of medication nonadherence. In Postgraduate Year-1 (PGY-1) community-based pharmacy residency training, new pharmacists learn the value of building relationships with patients and working through complex problems during this clinical experience. By assisting patients with complex medical conditions and social situations, new pharmacists gain skills in patient care, pharmacy operations, and medication access challenges. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the discontinuation of face-to-face interactions in this setting, rotation experiences for residents were adapted with the goal of continuing high-impact patient interactions and keeping everyone involved safe. CONCLUSION: Although considerable changes were made to the MTM rotation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were still able to provide meaningful clinical care telephonically and continued to learn valuable patient care skills. Most importantly, high quality care was still delivered to the patients despite considerable challenges. The major challenge for the residents' clinical experiences as a result of the adjustments has been finding an impactful volume of complex patients to enhance their skills. Other residency programs are encouraged to consider three recommendations to improve their rotations moving forward.","output":"A Medication Therapy Management Residency Rotation Adjusts to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU have high incidence of AKI requiring prolonged renal replacement therapy and often necessitate the placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC).

This study investigated distributions and details related to the signing of DNR orders, as well as the completeness of various DNR order forms. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were performed. We screened all charts from a teaching hospital in Taiwan for patients who died of cancer during the period from January 2010 to December 2011. A total of 829 patient records were included in the analysis. The details of the DNR order forms were recorded. RESULTS: The DNR order signing rate was 99.8 %. The percentage of DNR orders signed by patients themselves (DNR-P) was 22.6 %, while the percentage of orders signed by surrogates (DNR-S) was 77.2 %. The percentage of signed DNR forms that were completely filled out was 78.4 %. The percentage of DNR-S forms that were completed was 81.7 %, while the percentage of DNR-P forms that were completely filled out was only 67.6 %. CONCLUSION: Almost all the cancer patients had a signed DNR order, but for the majority of them, the order was signed by a surrogate. Negative attitudes of discussing death from medical professionals and/or the family members of patients may account for the higher number of signed DNR-S orders than DNR-P orders. Moreover, early obtainment of signed DNR orders should be sought, as getting the orders earlier could promote the quality of end-of-life care, especially in non-oncology wards.","output":"Insights into Chinese perspectives on do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders from an examination of DNR order form completeness for cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) is considered the primary receptor for CoV-2 cell entry, recent reports suggest that alternative pathways may contribute. This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways, with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes, endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance, binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state, perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets, could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virionCintegrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors, including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding, resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant, B.1.1.7 (or VUI 202012/01), includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement, N501Y, that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins, with consequent clinical impacts.","output":"Biological and Clinical Consequences of Integrin Binding via a Rogue RGD Motif in the SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Smell/taste disturbances are a common but underrated, under\\\\researched and under treated sensory loss and an independent risk factor for reduced longevity.

Methods Using the WHO TDR list, we aimed to determine from our clinic database;the prevalence of TDR, non-B subtype and associated features in our large tertiary HIV department (2500 patients) from 2014-2020. Results Of the 218 new diagnoses, 217 had a resistance test attempted (1 stored due to COVID-19). 212/217 had an available genotype (5 failed to amplify).. 191/212(90%) were MSM, 12/212(6%) cis-female, 80/212(38%) non-UK born and the median age was 36 years (IQR=29-46). The overall prevalence of TDR was 17/212(8%;95%CI=5.0-12.4), seven (3%) had a NRTI mutation, six (3%) had at least one nNRTI mutation and 4(2%) had a PI mutation. There were no dual/triple class/INI mutations. There was no significant change in the prevalence of TDR over the study period. The overall prevalence of non-B subtype was 53/212(25%;95% CI=19.6-31.2), and was not more frequently seen in non- UK born individuals (OR=1.24;CI=0.66-2.33,p=0.51).

Although overall rates of bacterial STIs was high (34%), having a bacterial STI was not associated with TDR (OR=1.77;95%CI=0.66-4.82,p=0.26). Conclusion TDR is associated with age and non-B subtype in our population. HIV TDR is not decreasing locally and remains a small but significant concern despite effective HIV prevention strategies, which may not reach hidden populations affected by HIV.

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar using specified title search terms \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" or \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"venous thromboembolism\\" and \\"anticoagulation\\" among others to identify peer-reviewed journal articles published between June 22, 2019, and June 22, 2020. Data were systematically extracted and synthesized using Microsoft Excel for analysis. The main outcome was VTE incidence, and measures included patient characteristics, anticoagulation, and clinical outcomes with assessment for associations. RESULTS: In total, 14 studies were included comprising 1677 patients. Most patients (n=1306, 82.4%) received anticoagulation (either VTE prophylaxis or treatment). VTE incidence was 26.9% (SE 3.1; 95% CI 20.8-33.1) and was correlated with systematic screening (r2=0.34, P=.03) and study duration (r2=-0.33, P=.03).

So far, risk models for severe COVID outcomes have included age but have not been optimized to best serve the needs of either older or younger adults. Additionally, existing risk models have been limited to either small sample sizes, or modeling mortality over an entire hospital admission. Further, previous models were developed on data from early in the pandemic, before improvements in COVID-19 treatment, the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, and vaccination. There remains a need for early, accurate identification of patients who may need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or die, considering multiple time horizons. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from 6,906 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 from a community health system with 51 hospitals and 1085 clinics across five states in the western United States. Risk models were developed to predict mechanical ventilation illness or death across one to 56 days of hospitalization, using clinical data collected available within the first hour after either admission with COVID-19 or a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The relative importance of predictive risk factors features for all models was determined using Shapley additive explanations. Findings: The percentage of patients who required mechanical ventilation or died within seven days of admission to the hospital due to COVID-19 was 10.82%. For the seven-day interval, models for age [] 18 and < 50 years reached AUROC 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.89) and models for age [] 50 years reached AUROC 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.88). Models revealed differences in the statistical significance and relative predictive value of risk factors between older and younger patients, including age, BMI, vital signs, and laboratory results. In addition, sex and chronic comorbidities had lower predictive value than vital signs and laboratory results. Interpretation: For hospitalized adults, baseline data that is readily available within one hour after hospital admission or a first positive inpatient SARS-CoV-2 test can predict critical illness within one day, and up to 56 days later.

METHODS: We approached how to reinstate the programme with three distinct but intertwined projects, as in the following: (1) a survey of effects of the pandemic on training opportunities for anaesthesiology trainees, (2) proposals for methods of reinstating simulation were developed under the headings avoidance, compromise, accommodation and collaboration. A small online video-assisted simulation pilot was carried out to test the compromise method, (3) having opted for combined accommodation (onsite with smaller participant numbers and safety measures) and collaboration (with other regional centres), a postreinstatement evaluation during a 4-month period was carried out. RESULTS: (1) Eighty-five per cent of 64 trainees surveyed felt that they had missed out not only just on simulation-based education (43%) but also on other training opportunities, (2) when five trainees were asked to state on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree and strongly agree) whether online video-assisted simulation was similar to face-to-face simulation in four categories (realism, immersion, sense of crisis and stress), only 9 (45%) of the 20 answers agreed they were similar, (3) When onsite simulation was reinstated, the majority of trainees felt that training was similar to prepandemic and were happy to continue with this format.

Respiratory samples of the patients were tested for influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA The reverse-transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was conducted and serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG/IgM is performed by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit.ResultsWe reported two related clusters of COVID-19 cases. The first cluster is a nosocomial infection of four health care providers at early January in one ward of university hospital. One of them made sequential familial cluster of infection. For total six cases, four of them (66.7%) showed negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients received either self-quarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at recovery stage.ConclusionsOur study provides a cautionary warning that negative results of nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers. Serologic detection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM is an important test in the assistant diagnosis of COVID-19.","output":"One nosocomial cluster following with a familial cluster of COVID-19 cases: the potential transmission risk in patients with negative swab tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical benefits to be expected from intraoperative nociception monitors are currently under investigation.

METHODS A retrospective cohort study compared telehealth patients with matched controls seen in the office. The feasibility of a thorough patient evaluation in a single telehealth visit without a follow-up office visit was assessed. Both groups were also compared for completeness of physical exam, management, follow-up recommendations, and correlation of physical exam findings with intraoperative findings. RESULTS 100 children [mean age (SD) = 20.7 (15.6) months] with a chief complaint of recurrent acute otitis media and 128 children [5.4 (3.2) years] with a chief complaint of sleep-disordered breathing were evaluated. Recommendations for surgery, additional studies, or routine follow-up were similar between telehealth and office-based groups. Physical exam feasibility was significantly different for the nasal cavity, oropharynx, and middle ear (P < .001). Patients who underwent office-based consultation were much more likely to have findings of middle ear fluid at the time of tympanostomy tube placement (79.3% vs 39.3%, P = .002). There was no significant difference between preoperative and intraoperative tonsil size discrepancies (P = .749). CONCLUSION Telehealth can be used successfully for the evaluation of pediatric patients with sleep-disordered breathing; however, reliance on history alone may result in unnecessary tympanostomy tube placement in patients with recurrent acute otitis media.

SUMMARY: The aim of this review was to evaluate the receptors and pathogenetic link between diabetes and COVID-19. Both disease conditions involve inflammation with the release of inflammatory markers. The roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme molecule and dipeptidyl peptidase were explored to show their involvement in COVID-19 and diabetes. Pathogenetic mechanisms such as impaired immunity, microangiopathy, and glycemic variability may explain the effect of diabetes on recovery of COVID-19 patients. The effect of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, invasion of the pancreatic islet cells, drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, and the lockdown policy may impact negatively on glycemic control of diabetic patients. The outcome studies between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19 were also reviewed.

Several factors may underpin this, including reduced transmission of seasonal viruses and improved use of or adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This study aims to investigate whether ICS use has changed during the pandemic for patients with asthma.MethodsUsing the OpenPrescribing database, we analysed prescribing patterns of ICS, salbutamol and peak flow meters from January 2019 to January 2021 across England. Additionally, using a sample asthma cohort from 3 primary care practices, we assessed individual prescription patterns and ICS adherence across the two-year period. ICS adherence has been defined according to the medication possession (MPR) ratio: good (75%), sub-optimal (50C74%), poor (25C49%) and non-adherence (<25%).ResultsA sharp increase in national ICS prescriptions was observed at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 representing a 50% increase compared to February 2020. Thereafter national ICS prescription rates appear to have returned to normal levels. The sample asthma cohort included 1132 patients (762 patients treated with ICS across 2019 and 2020). Overall, adherence to ICS improved in 2020 (P<0.001), with the proportion of patients meeting good adherence (75%) increasing from 34% to 42% (P<0.001). Analysis of this cohort suggested the March 2020 spike predominantly reflected improved adherence rather than a hoarding effect of multiple inhalers or new prescriptions for ICS-na?ve individuals. Increasing age was associated with higher levels of ICS adherence. A similar spike in salbutamol occurred in March 2020, however, an overall reduction in salbutamol prescriptions was seen in 2020 (P=0.039). National figures highlighted a progressive increase in prescription of peak flow meters over 2020.ConclusionA marked spike in national ICS prescriptions occurred in March 2020. This increase appears to reflect improved adherence in patients with low levels of adherence rather than a hoarding effect or large-scale initiation in ICS-na?ve patients. Despite a comparable spike in salbutamol prescriptions, 2020 saw an overall reduction in salbutamol prescriptions. Prescription of peak flow meters steadily increased over 2020 in keeping with the need for more remote monitoring.","output":"Prescribing patterns and treatment adherence in patients with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outcomes 1.

Describe three ways that home-based medical and palliative care practices are positioned to support end-of-life care for homebound older adults during emergencies Importance COVID-19 end-of-life research has focused primarily on patients who died in hospitals and nursing homes. Less is known about homebound patients receiving home-based primary and palliative care (HBMC) in the community. Objective(s) To describe characteristics and end-of-life care experiences of patients in an HBMC practice who died during New York City's initial 2020 COVID-19 surge. Method(s) Mixed-methods, retrospective quantitative and narrative analysis of demographic, clinical, and end-of-life data from unstructured electronic medical record notes for all patients who died between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Results 112 (9%) of the practice's 1,300 patients died during this period, with the average monthly mortality rate doubling in April 2020, the peak of the NYC surge. Thirty-four (30.4%) had confirmed or probable COVID-19. 58 (52%) were referred to hospice, and 50 enrolled. Eighty-two patients (73%) died at home. Our qualitative analysis found that COVID-19 disrupted regular caregiving routines, often requiring new or inexperienced caregivers to step in; rapidly evolving COVID-19 knowledge and protocols complicated access to services (e.g., requiring patients to present a negative COVID-19 test to begin hospice despite testing shortages); avoiding hospitals and emergency departments became an urgent concern due to visitor restrictions and families fears of loved ones dying alone; and COVID-19 complicated ongoing care for complex conditions (e.g., continuing dialysis for COVID+ patients). Throughout the surge, the HBMC team drew on their collaborative practice and longstanding relationships with patients, families, and hospice and home care providers to navigate service disruptions and provide comfort and emotional support. Conclusion(s) Overall, COVID-19 created severe disruptions and barriers to necessary care, further complicating care for this very high-risk, high-needs population.

Furthermore, the investigation of travel reason is useful for the aforementioned selection, also correlating with the different age groups and gender. There is a growing need for young people to access university campuses but the transport supply is often not adapted to student needs. This problem involves compromising not only accessible status but also sustainability and therefore the environmental, economic and social aspect. In this way, it emerges that is necessary to adapt to the growing transport services with student economic availability, travel distance and waiting times. This work explored the accessibility of a university campus (school node), through interviews considering a current transport offer and homeCschool reason. It was also linked to the availability of parking lots adjacent to the campus and the occupancy rates of the various neighbouring car parks were also calculated, monitoring the aforementioned areas for about a month using video cameras and sensors. The research investigated both travel distances in Euclidean and network terms and both travel times through the use of a micro-simulation tool and a linear equation. The study shows as a first research step that the shared mobility solution saves time but also highlights the critical issues of the service that should be better adapted to the students needs in terms of rate, type of car and subscription.","output":"The Evaluation of Home-School Itineraries to Improve Accessibility of a University Campus Trough Sustainable Transport Modes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main goal in gene therapy and biomedical research is an efficient transcription factors (TFs) delivery system.

The clinical usefulness of D-dimer values, trends, and more intensive anticoagulation remains an area of clinical interest. OBJECTIVES: Assess the outcomes and laboratory trends in COVID-19 patients stratified by intensity of anticoagulation at time of admission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively review the differences in clinical outcomes and laboratory trends in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Lifespan Health System. RESULTS: Between 27 February and 24 April 2020, 468 patients were hospitalized. Initial use of high-intensity thromboprophylaxis was associated with improved 30-day mortality (adjusted RR 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.97; p = 0.045) without a significant increased rate of bleeding (p = 0.11). In severe COVID-19, D-dimer significantly increased during hospitalization with standard thromboprophylaxis (p < 0.001) but remained stable or decreased with high-intensity prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation.

ABSTRACT: The current paper develops a probabilistic theory of causation using measure-theoretical concepts and suggests practical routines for conducting causal inference. The theory is applicable to both linear and high-dimensional nonlinear models. An example is provided using random forest regressions and daily data on yield spreads. The application tests how uncertainty in short- and long-term inflation expectations interacts with spreads in the daily Bitcoin price. The results are contrasted with those obtained by standard linear Granger causality tests. It is shown that the suggested measure-theoretic approaches do not only lead to better predictive models, but also to more plausible parsimonious descriptions of possible causal flows. The paper concludes that researchers interested in causal analysis should be more aspirational in terms of developing predictive capabilities, even if the interest is in inference and not in prediction per se. The theory developed in the paper provides practitioners guidance for developing causal models using new machine learning methods that have, so far, remained relatively underutilized in this context.","output":"Conducting Causal Analysis by Means of Approximating Probabilistic Truths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent a family of environmental toxicants that have infiltrated the living world.

Access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and facilities is a fundamental right for all, and is vital in stopping the transmission of COVID-19. However, people with disabilities often face difficulties accessing WASH. Various international organisations have published guidance and recommendations on WASH service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this must include information of relevance to people with disabilities. This study aimed to investigate the inclusion of core concepts of rights for people with disabilities in guidance on WASH during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We used the EquiFrame content analysis tool to analyse the inclusion of 21 core concepts of rights for people with disabilities in international guidance documents on WASH during the pandemic. 29 documents were included from multilateral entities, international consortiums and non-governmental organisations. Key information from the included guidance documents was extracted for each of the 21 core concepts. RESULTS: One-third of the WASH guidance did not include any reference to the rights of people with disabilities, and the majority of information was provided by just one guidance document. Most commonly referenced across all was access to WASH, including details on accessible infrastructure (eg, handwashing stations) and communication strategies. Information on many important rights and considerations, such as the affordability of services and caregiver support, was rarely included. CONCLUSION: Although some information is provided in international WASH guidance, this often has a narrow focus on access, rather than the full array of rights and considerations that are important for people with disabilities.

One included 44,531 medical admissions examining trend in Vitalpac Early Warning Score weighted vital signs. They stated that vital sign trends increased detection of clinical deterioration. Critical appraisal was performed using evaluation tools. The studies had moderate risk of bias, and a low certainty of evidence. Additionally, four studies examining trends in early warning scores, otherwise eligible for inclusion, were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS This review illustrates a lack of research in intermittently monitored vital sign trends. The included studies, although heterogeneous and imprecise, indicates an added value of trend analysis. This highlights the need for well-controlled trials to thoroughly assess the research question.","output":"The value of vital sign trends in predicting and monitoring clinical deterioration: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior work demonstrates that an additive serotonergic multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) predicts amplified risk for depression following significant life stress, and that it interacts with elevations in the cortisol awakening response to predict depression. The serotonin system and HPA-axis have bidirectional influence, but whether this MGPS predicts acute cortisol reactivity, which might then serve as a mechanism for depression, is unknown. Our prior work suggests that depression risk factors predict blunted cortisol reactivity to explicit negative evaluative lab-based stress. Thus, we hypothesized that a 4-variant serotonergic MGPS (three SNPs from the original 5-variant version plus 5HTTLPR) would predict blunted cortisol reactivity to explicit negative evaluative stress versus a control. In Sample 1, growth curve modeling showed that the MGPS predicted heightened cortisol reactivity (p = 0.0001) in an explicitly negative evaluative Trier Social Stress Test variant (TSST) versus a control condition among non-depressed emerging adults (N = 152; 57% female). In Sample 2, 125 males completed the Socially Evaluative Cold Pressor Test (SECPT), an ambiguously negative evaluative manipulation; findings displayed a similar pattern but did not reach statistical significance (ps.075-.091). A participant-level meta-analysis of the two samples demonstrated a significant effect of negative evaluation severity, such that the MGPS effect size on reactivity increased linearly from control to SECPT to an explicitly negative evaluative TSST. Findings indicate that this MGPS contributes to sensitivity to social threat and that cortisol dysregulation in the context of social stress may be one mechanism by which this MGPS contributes to depression.","output":"Additive serotonergic genetic sensitivity and cortisol reactivity to lab-based social evaluative stress: Influence of severity across two samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of August 30, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported 24,822,800 COVID-19 infections world wide. Severe disease and deaths occur especially in older people with chronic illnesses. Residents of nursing homes are considered to be the most vulnerable group. In this paper, the experiences with COVID-19 in nursing homes in Frankfurt will be presented and discussed. Materials and methods: Based on the data of the statutory reporting obligation, the reported COVID-19 cases are presented and incidences are calculated in different age groups and among residents of nursing homes. Outbreaks in various homes are described in detail based on the documentation from the public health department. Results: By August 28, 2020, 2,665 COVID-19 infections were reported in Frankfurt am Main (incidence 351/100,000 inhabitants), including 116 (4.3%) residents of nursing homes (2,416/100,000 residents). Almost half (39%) of all deaths in Frankfurt (n=69; incidence 9.1/100,000) were among nursing home residents (n=27; incidence 558/100,000 nursing home residents), with 22 of them in just one long-term care facility (LTCF). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in nursing homes did not increase in the first half of 2020. In one home, 75% of residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 25% died; in two other homes, 6.7% and 14.1% of the residents became infected, and the mortality rate was 0.5% and 1%, resp. In the other 42 homes in the city (3,906 beds), the infection rate remained below 1% and the death rate was 0.1%. Discussion: In many countries, 30-70% of all deaths occur among nursing home residents, including Frankfurt (39%). An increase in overall mortality compared to previous years was not observed in Frankfurt as a whole or in the nursing homes in the city specifically. Due to the measures taken (monitoring of residents and staff, nursing care in protective clothing, prohibition or restriction of visits, physical distancing, isolation of infected people and quarantining of contact persons), only individual cases of COVID-19 illnesses occurred in nursing home residents in most homes and the outbreaks in the three homes could be stopped. We do not recommend regular nontargeted testing in nursing homes, but rather vigilance and the implementation of good hygiene as well as immediate targeted testing if COVID-19 is suspected in residents or staff. In order to mitigate the considerable negative effects of these measures on the residents, a good balance should be sought between infection prevention and the goal of ensuring self-determination and the residents' quality of life.","output":"COVID-19 in long-term care facilities in Frankfurt am Main, Germany: incidence, case reports, and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a rare immune-related adverse event and appears to be more common with anti-PD1/PDL1 than anti-CTLA4.

Moreover, the health monitoring system is preferred to be realized in a small form factor for convenient mass deployments. A CMOS-integrated coherent sensing platform is proposed to achieve the goal, which synergetically leverages quadrature coherent photoacoustic (PA) detection and radar sensing for versatile healthcare. By utilizing configurable mixed-signal quadrature coherent PA detection, high sensitivity and enhanced specificity can be achieved. In-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) templates are specifically designed to accurately sense and precisely reconstruct the target PA signals coherently. By mixed-signal implementation leveraging an FPGA to generate template waveforms adaptively, accurate capturing and precise reconstruction on the target PA signal can be attained. The multiplication between the received PA signal and the templates is implemented efficiently in analog-domain by the Gilbert cell on-chip. In vivo temperature monitoring was realized based on the integrated PA sensing platform fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. With the help of an integrated radar sensor deployed in the indoor scenario, noncontact monitoring on respiration and heartbeat rates can be attained. By complementary usage of PA-EM sensing, comprehensive and cognitive health status monitoring and remote disease diagnostics can be achieved for the current global COVID-19 pandemic and the future pervasive healthcare in the Internet of Everything (IoE) era.","output":"A Mixed-Signal Chip-Based Configurable Coherent Photoacoustic-Radar Sensing Platform for In Vivo Temperature Monitoring and Vital Signs Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Italy had the highest number of deaths in Europe; most occurred in the Lombardy region. Up to 4% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit because they developed a critical illness (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Numerous patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who had been admitted to the intensive care unit required rescue therapy like prone positioning. OBJECTIVES: To describe the respiratory management of and the extensive use of prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit hub in Lombardy, Italy. METHODS: A total of 89 patients (67% male; median age, 59 years [range, 23-80 years]) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted between February 23 and March 31, 2020, were enrolled in this quality improvement project. RESULTS: Endotracheal intubation was required in 86 patients (97%). Prone positioning was used as rescue therapy in 43 (48%) patients. Significantly more younger patients (age &#8804; 59 years) were discharged alive (43 of 48 [90%]) than were older patients (age &#8805; 60 years; 26 of 41 [63%]; P < .005).

It remains unknown whether HIV patients are at a greater risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, despite their immunocompromised status. We present a systematic review of the literature reporting cases of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, and examine trends of clinical outcomes among coinfected patients. We systematically compiled 63 reports of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, published as of January 22, 2021.

Despite scattered evidence, reports indicate a favorable prognosis for HIV patients with strict adherence to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, the presence of comorbidities was associated with a poorer prognosis in HIV/SARS-CoV-2 patients, despite cART and viral suppression. Studies were limited by geographic coverage, small sample size, lack of patient details, and short follow-up durations. Although some anti-HIV drugs have shown promising in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, there is no conclusive evidence of the clinical efficacy of any anti-HIV drug in the treatment of COVID-19.

With an observed discordance between the concept and practice of altruism, and increasing attention to pathologic altruism, the role of altruism is blurred in present day medical care. In this background, the required balance of altruistic attitude which needs to be fostered in medical students needs clarity. This problem may be best addressed by the practicing clinicians. The objectives of this study were to explore clinicians understanding of altruism in the clinical context and to identify the key concepts of altruism which they felt, must be included in clinical practice. METHODS: It was an exploratory qualitative study to identify clinicians understanding of altruism and the key practice points for altruism. Online semi-structured interviews were conducted from 18 clinicians through Zoom and transcribed using Otter. Open coding of interview transcripts was done using Atlas ti 8 and grouped by commonalities under sub themes and themes. RESULTS: The main concepts regarding the clinicians understanding of altruism were prioritizing patients interest above oneself, favouring patients beyond routine duty and organized team work for practicing altruism. The essential practice areas identified for altruism were finding a balance between altruistic tendency and self/family life, identifying ones individual capacity for altruism, establishing teamwork for developing a workplace altruistic attitude, and facilitating patients beyond routine duty. CONCLUSIONS: Altruism is an important professionalism attribute for clinicians, however prioritizing patients interest requires a balanced approach so that it is effective and sustainable.

In view of the fact that there is an association between MYBL2 expression and the clinicopathological features of human cancers, most studies reported so far are limited in their sample size, tissue type and discrete outcomes. Furthermore, we need to verify which additional cancer entities are also affected by MYBL2 deregulation and which patients could specifically benefit from using MYBL2 as a biomarker or therapeutic target. We characterized the up-regulated expression level of MYBL2 in a large variety of human cancer via TCGA and oncomine database. Subsequently, we verified the elevated MYBL2 expression effect on clinical outcome using various databases. Then, we investigate the potential pathway in which MYBL2 may participate in and find 4 TFs (transcript factors) that may regulate MYBL2 expression using bioinformatic methods. At last, we confirmed elevated MYBL2 expression can be useful as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target of poor patient prognosis in a large variety of human cancers. Additionally, we find E2F1, E2F2, E2F7 and ZNF659 could interact with MYBL2 promotor directly or indirectly, indicating the four TFs may be the upstream regulator of MYBL2. TP53 mutation or TP53 signaling altered may lead to elevated MYBL2 expression. Our findings indicate that elevated MYBL2 expression represents a prognostic biomarker for a large number of cancers.

Given the uncertainty regarding the severity and time-path of the infections and related conditions, we examine three scenarios, ranging from a relatively moderate event to a disaster. The study considers a comprehensive list of causal factors affecting the impacts, including: mandatory closures and the gradual re-opening process; decline in workforce due to morbidity, mortality and avoidance behavior; increased demand for health care; decreased demand for public transportation and leisure activities; potential resilience through telework; increased demand for communication services; and increased pent-up demand. We apply a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, a state-of-the-art economy-wide modeling technique. It traces the broader economic ramifications of individual responses of producers and consumers through supply chains both within and across countries. We project that the net U.S. GDP losses from COVID-19 would range from $3.2 trillion (14.8%) to $4.8 trillion (23.0%) in a 2-year period for the three scenarios. U.S. impacts are estimated to be higher than those for China and the ROW in percentage terms. The major factor affecting the results in all three scenarios is the combination of Mandatory Closures and Partial Reopenings of businesses. These alone would have resulted in a 22.3% to 60.6% decrease in U.S. GDP across the scenarios. Pent-up Demand, generated from the inability to spend during the Closures/Reopenings, is the second most influential factor, significantly offsetting the overall negative impacts.","output":"The Impacts of the Coronavirus on the Economy of the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The epidemiological characteristics, in-hospital treatments and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 among older patients have not been fully evaluated in Japan.

By unsupervised self-organizing map clustering, four patterns of innate myeloid response were identified and linked to varying levels of systemic inflammation, altered cellular iron trafficking and the severity of disease. These alterations of the myeloid leukocyte compartment during acute COVID-19 may be hallmarks of inefficient viral control and immune hyperactivation and may help at risk prediction and treatment optimization.","output":"Alterations of blood monocyte subset distribution and surface phenotype are linked to infection severity in COVID-19 inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 on are not yet predictable.

FIPV exposure also is associated with social difficulties such as low socioeconomic status, legal issues, poor access to employment and education, housing instability, and difficulty meeting other basic needs. As a biopsychosocial problem, one discipline alone cannot adequately address FIPV. While individuals who experience FIPV traditionally seek respite, care and safety through domestic violence shelters, social services or courts, they also often present to health care settings. Building on the medical-legal partnership model with critical input from a community advisory board of individuals with lived experiences of FIPV, we implemented a person-centered approach in the health care context to cohesively integrate legal, safety, social, psychological and physical health needs and concerns. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Healing through Health, Education, Advocacy and Law (HEAL) Collaborative for individuals who have experienced psychological abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect related to child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and/or elder abuse, and review our real-world challenges and successes. We describe our interprofessional team collaboration and our pragmatic biopsychosocial framework for bringing together: professional and stakeholder perspectives; psychological, medical, legal, and personal perspectives; and clinical, evidence-based, and educational perspectives. There is no doubt that creating a program with biopsychosocial components like HEAL requires professionals appreciating each other's contributions and the need to begin working from a common goal. Furthermore, such a program could not be successful without the contributions of individuals with the lived experience we seek to treat, coupled with the external health care clinicians' input.

This study aims to find a simple model to describe the outbreak pattern of SARS cases by using SARS case data commonly released by governments. The outbreak pattern of cumulative SARS cases is expected to be a logistic type because the infection will be slowed down due to the increasing control effort by people and/or due to depletion of susceptible individuals. The increase rate of SARS cases is expected to decrease with the cumulative SARS cases, as described by the traditional logistical model, which is widely used in population dynamic studies. The instantaneous rate of increases were significantly and negatively correlated with the cumulative SARS cases in mainland of China (including Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin, Shanxi, the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia) and Singapore. The basic reproduction numberR (0) in Asia ranged from 2.0 to 5.6 (except for Taiwan, China). TheR (0) of Hebei and Tianjin were much higher than that of Singapore, Hongkong, Beijing, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, indicating SARS virus might have originated differently or new mutations occurred during transmission. We demonstrated that the outbreaks of SARS in many regions of Asia were well described by the logistic model, and the control measures implemented by governments are effective.

There has been a lack of structured monitoring efforts to quantify the emerging trend of improperly disposed of PPE debris. In this study, we present a baseline monitoring survey to describe the spatial distribution of PPE debris during the COVID-19 pandemic from the metropolitan city of Toronto, Canada. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify PPE debris types among surveyed areas and; (2) identify PPE debris densities and accumulation of surveyed areas. A total of 1306 PPE debris items were documented, with the majority being disposable gloves (44%), followed by face masks (31%), and disinfecting wipes (25%). Of the face masks, 97% were designed for single use while only 3% were reusable.

The WHODAS instrument was utilized to measure disability as the degree of functional impairment due to emotional/behavioral problems experienced by the respondent. Multinomial logistic regression models were built to assess the magnitude and direction of the association between severity of mental health-related disability with opioid use and abuse/dependency in the past year. RESULTS: Approximately 30% of pregnant women suffered from moderate/severe mental health-related disability, and 2% reported opioid abuse/dependency. Compared to those with no opioid use, the odds of opioid use in the past year for individuals with moderate/severe mental health-related disability were 1.73 (95% CI 1.36, 2.21) times higher than those with no/mild disability. Similarly, the odds of opioid abuse/dependency were at least three times higher (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.80, 6.84) among those with moderate/severe mental health-related disability relative to pregnant women with no/mild disability.

The spike (S) protein, and particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), mediates the interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells and may be modulated by its structural features. Therefore, well-characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional post translational modifications), a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection, and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, a higher level of sialylation, and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, using an alternative approach based on N-terminal cleavage of the O-glycosylation, the previously unknown O-glycosylation site was localized at T323. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to the ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results.

This study conducted iterative Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with boundaries (L-BFGS-B) to utilize the numerical parameter estimation of MGWNBR. MGWNBR identified that the adjacent regions tend to group in 8 clusters containing the same significant determinants. Through MGWNBR, the comorbid prevalences (acute respiratory infection, pneumonia, and diabetes) were positively associated with the Covid-19 increasing cases in most regions. The unemployment rate and the number of health care facilities were negatively related to the increase of Covid-19 cases in some regions. MGWNBR was better than GWNBR in terms of AIC, deviance, and pseudo R-sq. The residual map also suggested that MGWNBR produced a more accurate projection than GWNBR.

Activation of both the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are associated with NASH progression. Here, we tested whether dual-targeting inhibition of hepatic CB1R and iNOS improves  in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice were treated for 14 days with (S)-MRI-1867, a peripherally-restricted hybrid inhibitor of CB1R and iNOS. (R)-MRI-1867, the CB1R-inactive stereoisomer which retains iNOS inhibitory activity and JD-5037, a peripherally-restricted CB1R antagonist were used to assess the relative contribution of the two targets to the effects of (S)-MRI-1867. (S)-MRI-1867 reduced hepatic steatosis, the rate of hepatic VLDL secretion, upregulated hepatic LDLR expression and reduced the circulating levels of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The decrease in VLDL secretion could be attributed to CB1R blockade while the reduction of PCSK9 levels and the related increase in LDLR resulted from iNOS inhibition via a mTORC1-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, this approach based on the concomitant inhibition of CB1R and iNOS represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia.","output":"Simultaneous Inhibition of Peripheral CB1R and iNOS Mitigates Obesity-Related Dyslipidemia Through Distinct Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden breakout of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread across the globe, leaving no country behind in being affected by the global pandemic in the year 2019C20.

Methods Prospective audit comparing bacterial co-/secondary infections and their treatment during the first two waves of the pandemic in a single centre teaching hospital ICU. Data on demographics, daily antibiotic use, clinical outcomes, and culture results in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were collected over 11 months. Findings From 9/3/20 to 2/9/20 (Wave 1), there were 156 patients and between 3/9/20 and 1/2/21 (Wave 2) there were 235 patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to intensive care. No significant difference was seen in mortality or positive blood culture rates between the two waves. The proportion of patients receiving antimicrobial therapy (93.0% vs 81.7%;p<0.01), and the duration of meropenem use (median (interquartile range): 5 (2-7) vs 3 (2-5) days;p=0.01) was lower in Wave 2. However, the number of patients with respiratory isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/156 vs 21/235;p<0.01) and bacteraemia from a respiratory source (3/156 vs 20/235 p<0.01) increased in Wave 2, associated with an outbreak of infection. There was no significant difference between waves with respect to isolation of other pathogens. Conclusions Reduced broad spectrum antimicrobial use in the second wave of COVID-19 compared with the first wave was not associated with significant change in mortality.","output":"Comparison of Antibiotic Use between the First Two Waves of COVID-19 in an Intensive Care Unit at a London Tertiary Centre: reducing broad-spectrum antimicrobial use did not adversely affect mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is concern about the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 novel mutant strains VOC-202012/01 and 501Y V2 VOC-202012/01 has increased in the United Kingdom, and various analyses suggest that it is more infectious than previous strains, but the association with severe symptoms is unclear 501Y V2 has been increasing in South Africa, and the proportion of 501Y V2 in the epidemic strains has been increasing, but the association with increased infectivity and severe symptoms is unknown In Japan, no mutant strains have been detected so far, but after December 25, VOC-202012/01 was detected in several people who had traveled to the UK and this close contact, and has been placed under control The viral gene mutations in domestic and quarantine cases are being monitored continuously It is recommended to strengthen the control system for people who have traveled to countries or regions where there is an association between the spread of infection and an increase in VOC-202012/01 or 501Y V2, and to continue monitoring and collecting information on mutated strains","output":"[A New Mutant Strain of SARS-CoV-2 with Increased Infectivity (3rd Report)]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, with 10%-20% of severe cases and over 508 000 deaths worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from \\"nonsevere\\" toward \\"nonsurvived\\" via \\"severe and survived\\" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings may be helpful in predicting disease progression and clinical outcome of severe patients.","output":"Clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics and risk factors for severity and mortality of 289 hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Safe surgical care, including anesthesia, obstetrics, and trauma, is an essential component of a functional health system, yet five billion people lack access to high-quality, timely and affordable surgical care.

The review aims to see whether homoeopathy can help COVID-19 survivors recover from its consequences and improve their quality of life. CONTENT: A systematic search of published articles for post-COVID sequelae and the impact of Homoeopathy were conducted. For the literature search, the major electronic bio-medical database PubMed/MEDLINE was used. In addition, supplementary searches were conducted through the references of those published articles. SUMMARY: A total of 113 records were identified of which 61 studies included for this review. Homoeopathy is effective in the treatment of mental disorders including anxiety and depressive disorder (ADD), some research studies have found, although systematic reviews disagree. Likewise, some medical societies denounce homoeopathy for pain management; other literature shows that it can be used to treat pain effectively. Homoeopathy can aid in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as Crataegus, a homoeopathic medication, was found to be just as effective as a standard angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretic treatment for minor cardiac insufficiency. The outcomes for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Influenza, and Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIs) are also promising. OUTLOOK: Based on the results of homoeopathy in non-COVID conditions, it can be thought of in the management of post-COVID-19 outcomes. Consequently, we propose that while investigating post-COVID-19 patient rehabilitation, homoeopathic management may be included as part of the follow-up route and as much data as possible in the context of homoeopathy should be collected, so that in future, the role of homoeopathy in dealing with it can be better demonstrated.","output":"Exploring the scope of homoeopathy in combating the unfortunate consequences of post-COVID-19 survivors based on non-COVID conditions: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitochondria are the key organelles of FeCS cluster synthesis. They contain the enzyme cysteine desulfurase, a scaffold protein, iron and electron donors, and specific chaperons all required for the formation of FeCS clusters.

Mitochondrial FeCS cluster biogenesis components are required in the cytosolic ironCsulfur cluster assembly machinery for cytosolic and nuclear cluster supplies. Clusters that are the key components of FeCS proteins are vulnerable and prone to degradation whenever exposed to oxidative stress. However, once degraded, the FeCS cluster can be resynthesized or repaired. It has been proposed that sulfurtransferases, rhodanese, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, responsible for sulfur transfer from donor to nucleophilic acceptor, are involved in the FeCS cluster formation, maturation, or reconstitution. In the present paper, we attempt to sum up our knowledge on the involvement of sulfurtransferases not only in sulfur administration but also in the FeCS cluster formation in mammals and yeasts, and on reconstitution-damaged cluster or restoration of enzymes attenuated activity.","output":"Sulfur Administration in FeCS Cluster Homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) models require large datasets which may be siloed across different healthcare institutions.

OBJECTIVE: Using federated learning, a ML technique that avoids locally aggregating raw clinical data across multiple institutions, we predict mortality within seven days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patient data was collected from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. RESULTS: LASSO-federated outperformed LASSO-local at three hospitals, and MLP-federated performed better than MLP-local at all five hospitals as measured by area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC). LASSO-pooled outperformed LASSO-federated at all hospitals, and MLP-federated outperformed MLP-pooled at two hospitals.

Hydrocarbon thermal machinery such as Spark Ignition-Compression Ignition engines, Gasoline-Diesel generators, Coal-Lignite gasifiers, residential diesel-powered heating systems, Pyrolysis units and so on, are commonly met all around the planet. Such technology practically oxidizes Hydrocarbons to produce either heat, steam or useful mechanical work depending on the application, though energy losses are not, by any means, insignificant. Advanced material processing is an industrial sector whos energy demand is significant and it is important for the general public to come to terms with the fact that by implementing Hydrogen technology to power such plant while at the same time improving the energy equilibrium of houses(advanced materials), communities would be taking major steps towards Climate Change effects debilitation. The downside of Hydrocarbon thermochemical exploitation can be described by the limited resources-reserves and the gaseous pollutant emissions (CO2, CO, NOx, SOx). In recent years, the Industrial zone as a whole has began taking a turn towards Electrification without having established the necessary infrastructure to support such a transition. Indicatively, at current rate of production, dead Lithium-Ion batteries are projected to reach as high as 11,000 metric tons by 2030, yet there is no recycling scheme in place, not to mention the prospect of that number rising even more, given the recent e-mobility trend.

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31  109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29  109/L).

OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence, causes, and outcomes of VAE during the COVID-19 pandemic year versus prepandemic years and among ventilated patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated adults at four academic and community hospitals in Massachusetts, we compared VAE incidence rates between March 1 and August 31 for each year from 2017 to 2020 (corresponding to the time frame of the pandemic first wave in 2020) and among COVID-19Cpositive and COVID-19Cnegative patients in 2020. The medical records of 200 randomly selected patients with VAEs in 2020 (100 with COVID-19 and 100 without COVID-19) were analyzed to compare conditions precipitating VAEs in patients with versus without COVID-19. RESULTS: VAEs per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation were more common in 2020 than in prior years (11.2 vs. 6.7; P < 0.01) but the rate of VAEs per 1,000 ventilator-days was similar (14.2 vs. 12.7; P = 0.08). VAEs were more frequent in COVID-19Cpositive patients than in COVID-19Cnegative patients in 2020 (29.0 vs. 7.1 per 100 ventilator episodes [P < 0.01] and 17.2 vs. 12.2 per 1,000 ventilator-days [P < 0.01]). Compared with patients without COVID-19 with VAEs, patients with COVID-19 and VAEs had similar rates of infection-related ventilator-associated complications, longer median durations of mechanical ventilation (22 vs. 14 d; P < 0.01), and similar in-hospital mortality (30% vs. 38%; P = 0.15). Progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounted for 53% of VAEs in patients with COVID-19, whereas it accounted for 14% of VAEs among patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: VAE rates per 100 episodes of mechanical ventilation and per 1,000 ventilator-days were higher among COVID-19Cpositive patients than among COVID-19Cnegative patients. Over 50% of VAEs in patients with COVID-19 were caused by progressive ARDS, whereas less than 15% of VAEs in patients without COVID-19 were caused by progressive ARDS.

This plan calls countries to develop national actions to address AMR. The province of Qubec, Canada, adopted a new regulation on the 25(th) of February 2019, to limit the use in food animals of antimicrobials of very high importance in human medicine. We aimed to establish the impact of this regulation by comparing the AMR situation in dairy cattle in Qubec ~2 years before and 2 years after its introduction. We sampled calves, cows, and the manure pit in 87 farms. Generic and putative ESBL/AmpC E. coli were tested for susceptibility to 20 antimicrobials. Logistic regression was used to investigate whether the probability of antimicrobial resistance differed between isolates obtained from the pre and post regulation periods by sample type (calves, cows, manure pit) and in general. To identify AMR genes dissemination mechanisms, we sequenced the whole genome of 15 generic isolates. In the generic collection, at the herd level, the proportion of multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates, decreased significantly from 83 to 71% (p = 0.05). Folate inhibitor and aminoglycoside resistances demonstrated a significant decrease. However, when analyzed by sample type (calves, cows, manure pit), we did not observe a significant AMR decrease in any of these categories. In the ESBL/AmpC collection, we did not detect any significant difference between the two periods. Also, the general resistance gene profile was similar pre and post regulation. We identified both clonal and plasmidic dissemination of resistance genes. In conclusion, as early as 2 years post regulation implementation, we observed a significant decrease in MDR in the dairy industry in Quebec in the generic E. coli collection with folate inhibitor and aminoglycoside resistances showing the most significant decrease. No other significant decreases were yet observed.","output":"Impact of a Regulation Restricting Critical Antimicrobial Usage on Prevalence of Antimicrobial Resistance in Escherichia coli Isolates From Fecal and Manure Pit Samples on Dairy Farms in Qubec, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 wreaks havoc across the world, countries in South and South-East Asia and Latin America are faced with the prospect of a second epidemic: dengue.

Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for dyslipidemia of each serum calcium level and albumin-corrected calcium levels, which were sorted into quartiles. The restricted cubic spline model was fitted for the dose-response analysis. An L-shaped dose-response relation between calcium levels and the probability of dyslipidemia was found after the adjustment for multiple potential confounding factors, p for non-linear < 0.001. Results: Using the middle category of calcium level as the reference, multivariable-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of the lowest and the highest quartile categories were 0.96 (0.82C1.12) and 1.29 (1.12C1.48), respectively, for total serum calcium levels and 1.06 (0.91C1.23) and 1.39 (1.21C1.60) for albumin-corrected calcium levels.

In this study, we described, according to seasons, ages and clinical units, the results obtained in children (<15 years old) by multiplex-PCR (mPCR) tests allowing a quick and wide range detection of all respiratory viruses. These results were also compared with RSV specific detection. METHODS: All nasopharyngeal mPCR and RSV tests requested by clinicians in our French teaching hospitals group between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively included. All repeated samples for the same children in the same month were discarded. RESULTS: Of the 381 mPCR tests (344 children) performed, 51.4% were positive. Positivity and viral co-infection rates were higher in the 6C36 months old strata (81% and 25%, p<0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). Viral distribution showed strong variations across ages. During specific influenza epidemic periods, only 1/39 (2.5%) mPCR tests were positive for influenza and 19/39 (48.7%) for other viruses. During specific RSV epidemic periods, only 8/46 (17.4%) mPCR tests were positive for RSV and 14/46 (30.4%) for other viruses. 477/1529 (31.2%) of RSV immunochromatography-tests were positive. Among the negatives immunochromatography-test also explored by mPCR, 28/62 (31%) were positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: This study provides a wide description of respiratory viruses distribution among children in hospital settings using mPCR over 3 years. It emphasizes the number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses according to the current diagnosis practice in France and gives a better picture of respiratory viruses identified in hospital settings by mPCR all over the year in France.","output":"Usefulness of multiplex PCR methods and respiratory viruses distribution in children below 15 years old according to age, seasons and clinical units in France: A 3 years retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article was to propose a modified emergency department (ED) stroke code for the evaluation of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 A stroke code used in COVID-19 patients with a time-sensitive condition such as AIS needs to ensure not only a rapid patient management, but also stroke team safety and the optimal and safe use of scan rooms and angio-suites In the pre-pandemic times, many EDs have adopted an Acute Stroke Code, an algorithm facilitating rapid assessment of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of AIS The stroke code triggers the activation of the stroke team, which comprises of an ED specialist, neurologist, radiographers, and radiologist During the COVID-19 pandemic, a need arose for a modified stroke code that would include COVID-19 screening To minimize the risk for health care workers during patient assessment and management, all personnel should wear adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintain a distance of at least two from the patient, unless strictly necessary Since stroke evaluation does not generate aerosols, the use of a positive air purified respirator may depend on its availability and institutional policy The stroke team should comprise of a minimum number of health care providers and use telemedicine to review the evaluation process Emergency physicians must have a high level of suspicion to identify AIS as an initial presentation of COVID-19 To address the challenges during this pandemic, a modified stroke code with a dedicated workflow needs to be established for screening, evaluation, and safe, coordinated management of AIS patients in the ED The implementation of a strict screening process in the ED can help identify suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patients The adherence to infection control measures by all members of the stroke team, a dedicated facility for neuro-imaging, and subsequent intervention in the angio-suite can ensure timely, safe, and optimal stroke management This article proposes a modified stroke code addressing all these issues that can be individualized and adopted based on local institutional practice","output":"A modified stroke code for acute ischemic strokes during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey study compares features of self-reported symptoms of major depression in adults with or without a prior COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Factors Associated With Self-reported Symptoms of Depression Among Adults With and Without a Previous COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: COVID-19 patients present a high hospitalization rate with a high mortality risk for those requiring intensive care. When these patients have other comorbid conditions and older age, the risk for severe disease and poor outcomes after ICU admission are increased. The present work aims to describe the preliminary results of the ongoing NUTRICOVID study about the nutritional and functional status and the quality of life of adult COVID-19 survivors after ICU discharge, emphasizing the in-hospital and discharge situation of this population. METHODS: A multicenter, ambispective, observational cohort study was conducted in 16 public hospitals of the Community of Madrid with COVID-19 survivors who were admitted to the ICU during the first outbreak. Preliminary results of this study include data retrospectively collected. Malnutrition and sarcopenia were screened at discharge using MUST and SARC-F; the use of healthcare resources was measured as the length of hospital stay and requirement of respiratory support and tracheostomy during hospitalization; other study variables were the need for medical nutritional treatment; and patients functional status (Barthel index) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in this preliminary analysis. Most patients were male and older than 60 years, who suffered an average (SD) weight loss of 16.6% (8.3%) during the hospital stay, with a median length of stay of 53 (27C89.5) days and a median ICU stay of 24.5 (11C43.5) days. At discharge, 83.5% and 86.9% of the patients were at risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, respectively, but only 38% were prescribed medical nutrition therapy. In addition, more than 70% of patients had significant impairment of their mobility and to conduct their usual activities at hospital discharge.

Crocin administration significantly attenuated TAA-induced cancerous lesions with concomitant attenuation of impaired liver functions. This was associated with significant enhancement in hepatic Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression with parallel suppression in Keap-1 expression. Inline, crocin induced a significant improvement in hepatic oxidative status with enhanced antioxidant batteries. Crocin administration significantly suppressed the hepatic content of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK) with significant upregulation in TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and caspase-8 protein expression as well as p53 gene expression; biomarkers of apoptosis. Moreover, hepatic expression of the apoptotic BAX significantly increased and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 significantly decreased in the liver specimen; biomarkers of intrinsic apoptosis. In conclusion; crocin attenuates experimentally induced hepato-carcinogenesis via modulation of oxidative/apoptotic signaling.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of tobacco smoke exposure with the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease severity accounting for possible confounders. METHODS: The nationwide self-administered cross-sectional EPICOVID19 web-based survey was performed in an Italian population of 198,822 voluntary adults who filled in an online questionnaire between April 13 and June 2, 2020. For the present study, we analyzed 6857 individuals with known NPS test result. The associations of smoking status and the dose-response relationship with the positivity to NPS test and infection severity were calculated as odds ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (OR, 95%CI) by means of analyzed using logistic and multinomial regression models adjusting for socio-demographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Out of the 6857 individuals (mean age 47.9 years, 65.9% females), 63.2% had never smoked, 21.3% were former and 15.5% were current smokers. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers were younger, more educated, less affected by chronic diseases, reported less frequently COVID-like symptoms, were less hospitalized and tested for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis current smokers had almost halved odds of a positive NPS test (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65) compared to non-smokers. We also found a dose-dependent relationship with tobacco smoke: mild smokers (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55-1.05), moderate (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.73) and heavy smokers (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53).

Two recent systematic reviews and 1 meta-analysis reviewing the CT chest findings of COVID-19 did not reveal cavitation as a common finding with a recent retrospective review estimating the prevalence to be around 3.3%. Among the published examples, about half are solitary cavitary lesions. Most common causative organisms include staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella, and Enterobacter cloacae complex. A recently published case series described 6 cases of co-infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with COVID-19 causing cavitary lung disease. We report a case of Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) infection causing cavitary lung disease as a complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: 39 year old female with type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism. She presented with worsening cough, hemoptysis and left sided chest pain.CT Chest on admission showed a 7cm left lower lobe abscess with an associated pleural effusion and a left lower lobe pulmonary embolism along with scattered ground glass and consolidative opacities. Initial hospital treatment included prednisone, levofloxacin, and apixaban. One week after discharge she was readmitted with worsening left sided chest pain with scant hemoptysis.On readmission, workup included mycobacterial, fungal, auto-immune and HIV tests which were all negative. Patient improved significantly on broad-spectrum antibiotics which included Cefepime and Metronidazole. Laboratory work-up was significant for ESR > 100, CRP of 6 mg/dl. Patient continued to be on room air with improved symptoms and was discharged on oral Augmentin for 4 weeks with plans for outpatient follow-up CT chest. On follow-up, CT chest showed no significant difference in the cavity size and continued to have significant left sided pleuritic chest pain. Her antibiotic course was extended due to the persistence of the cavity and symptoms. At the conclusion of 8 weeks of antibiotics with persistent symptoms, a bronchoscopy was done with a BAL performed in the left lower lobe. AFB cultures grew Mycobacterium Avium Complex. DISCUSSION: Lung cavitation in COVID-19 is an uncommon and so far under-reported consequence/complication. Considering that it might present as a late complication, as in the above case, it is imperative to follow-up these patients closely and consider a broad and appropriate workup. The mechanism of lung cavitation is probably multifactorial, including lung necrosis from the initial pulmonary embolism, effect of initial SARS-CoV2 infection, secondary bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial infection and immunosuppression from initial steroid course.

Methods & Materials In this descriptive-analytical study with a cross-sectional design, 200 elderly people aged >= 60 years participated who were selected from daycare rehabilitation centers and retirement centers in Kerman, Iran in 2020 using a convenience sampling method. Data were collected using a demographic form (Surveying age, gender, education, occupation, marital status, income, and media use), and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Results The mean age of participants was 66.60 +/- 5.08 years. More than three-quarters of them were following the latest COVID-19 news via media (Local radio and television). Most of them (77.4%) had poor mental health status. Higher educational level (P<0.001), employment (p=0.003), and low frequency of media use (P<0.001) were the protective factors against poor mental health. High-frequency media use was a risk factor for the mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion The mental health of community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic is affected by media use and its frequency.

The patients used the telemedicine solution for an average of 27.3 days. 140,260 measurements were taken while monitoring the geriatric syndromes of the entire patient group. 4675 measurements were recorded per patient for geriatric disorders and risks. 319 measurements were recorded per patient per day. The telemedicine solution emitted a total of 1245 alerts while monitoring the geriatric syndromes of the entire patient group. In terms of sensitivity, the results were 100% for all geriatric risks and extremely satisfactory in terms of positive and negative predictive values. Survival analyses showed that gender played no role in the length of the hospital stay, regardless of the reason for the hospitalization (decompensated heart failure (p = 0.45), deterioration of general condition (p = 0.12), but significant for death (p = 0.028)). The analyses revealed that the length of the hospital stay was not affected by the number of alerts. The results concerning the predictive nature of alerts are satisfactory. Conclusions: The MyPredi? telemedicine system allows for the generation of automatic, non-intrusive alerts when the health of a COVID-19 elderly patient deteriorates due to risks associated with geriatric syndromes.","output":"Results of the Second Phase of the GER-e-TEC Experiment concerning the Telemonitoring of Elderly Patients Affected by COVID-19 Disease to Detect the Exacerbation of Geriatric Syndromes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about itch related to the use of face masks.

A total of 2,315 replies were received, of which 2,307 were included in the final analysis. Of the respondents, 1,393 (60.4%) reported using face masks during the previous week, and, of these, 273 (19.6%) participants reported having itch. Subjects who reported sensitive skin and atopic predisposition, and those with facial dermatoses (acne, atopic dermatitis or seborrhoeic dermatitis) were at significantly higher risk of itch development. The high-est rating of itch for the whole group on the Itch Numeral Rating Scale was 4.07  2.06 (itch of moderate intensity). Responders who wore masks for longer periods more frequently reported itch. Almost 30% of itchy subjects reported scratching their face without removing the mask, or after removing the mask and then scratching. Wearing face masks is linked to development of itch, and scratching can lead to incorrect use of face masks, resulting in reduced protection.","output":"Face Mask-induced Itch: A Self-questionnaire Study of 2,315 Responders During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple studies have been done for the identification of pairwise distant kinship and several targeted panels have been constructed. For most of such constructions, pedigree analysis was applied to evaluate the system effectiveness of a certain panel. However, such analyses were hard to be compared to each other and could be affected by many factors, such as sample size and sampling randomness. A new indicator named predicted area under ROC curve (AUCP), where ROC curve stood for receiver operating characteristic curve, was derived applying binomial distribution theory and analyzed with simulated and real cases in this study. After comparing between the values of AUCPs and results of pedigree analyses with different loci sets and kinship types, the ability of these two methods evaluating the system effectiveness was proved to be close to each other. The implementation of AUCP was much easier than pedigree analysis, because a secondary sampling or simulation was not needed. Therefore, AUCP can be a better indicator for panels targeted to pairwise distant kinship identification and we are recommending it as an indicator calculated by default for such panels.","output":"AUCP: An indicator for system effectiveness of panels in pairwise distant kinship identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has stressed healthcare systems and workers worldwide. GPs, as first points of contact between suspected cases and the healthcare system, have assumed frontline roles in this crisis. While the prevalence of mental health problems and illnesses arising in healthcare workers (HCWs) from tertiary care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic is well-examined,1 the impact on GPs remains understudied. AIM: To describe the prevalence and predictors of anxiety, burnout, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among GPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN & SETTING: Survey of GPs operating in Singapore primary care clinics. METHOD: GPs completed a survey that comprised of four validated psychometric instruments. Open-ended questions asked about responders' challenges and their envisaged support. Data were analysed with multiple logistic regression with demographic data as covariates; concepts of grounded theory were used to analyse the qualitative responses. RESULTS: A total of 257 GPs participated. Fifty-five (21.4%) met the scales' criteria for anxiety, 211 (82.1%) for burnout, 68 (26.6%) for depression, and 23 (8.9%) for PTSD. Multivariate regression analysis showed working in a public primary care setting was associated with anxiety and depression. Qualitative analyses uncovered possible stressors: changes to clinical and operational practices; increased workloads; and financial difficulties. CONCLUSION: Mental health issues were found to be present in Singaporean GPs during the pandemic. Prevalence of anxiety, burnout, and depression were found to be higher than those reported pre-COVID-19. The findings also provide determinants of the issues that serve as possible foci for targeted interventions.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Singaporean GPs: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, a novel emerging infectious disease - COVID-19 - became a global pandemic and prompted unprecedented social distancing measures. We examined the associations of voluntary stay-at-home (SAH) orders during the COVID-19 pandemic with vulnerability assessments and precautionary intentions (e.g. social distancing, hand washing). A quasi-experimental study using an online adult sample was conducted in U.S. states with and without voluntary SAH orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-report surveys assessed vulnerability assessments and precautionary intentions. Participants living in states with SAH orders showed inflated vulnerability assessments for contracting COVID-19, and this association was stronger for affect-laden than cognitively-based assessments. Moreover, only affect-laden vulnerability assessments were uniquely associated with precautionary intentions and accounted for the relationship between SAH orders and precautionary intentions. Our study was among the first to explore the impact of voluntary SAH orders on vulnerability assessments and precautionary intentions.

Regular PA supports physical, cognitive, and psychological/social health among school-aged children. Successful implementation of school-based daily physical activity (DPA) programs is therefore important for all children and crucial for children who attend schools in lower socioeconomic settings. The purpose of this study is to uncover what worked, for whom, how, and why during the three-year implementation period of a new flexible DPA program, while paying particular attention to the socioeconomic setting of the participating schools. METHODS: This study is a realist evaluation using mixed methods for data generation. Longitudinal data were collected in 415 schools once a year during the three-year implementation period of the program using questionnaires. Data analysis was completed in three steps and included qualitative thematic analysis using a mixed inductive and deductive method and chi-square tests to test and refine context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations. RESULTS: Giving the school teams autonomy in the choice of strategies appropriate to their context have allowed schools to take ownership of program implementation by activating a community empowerment process, which resulted in a cultural shift towards a sustainable DPA provision in most settings. In rural underprivileged settings, the mobilization of local resources seems to have successfully created the conditions necessary for implementing and maintaining changes in practice. In disadvantaged urban settings, implementing local leadership structures (leader, committee, and meetings) provided pivotal assistance to members of the school teams in providing new DPA opportunities. However, without continued external funding, those schools seem unable to support local leadership structures on their own, jeopardizing the sustainability of the program for children living in disadvantaged urban areas. CONCLUSION: By exploring CMO configurations, we have been able to better understand what worked, for whom, how and why during the three-year implementation period of the Active at School! program. When implementing DPA policies, decision makers should consider adjusting resource allocations to meet the actual needs of schools from different backgrounds to promote equal PA opportunities for all children.

Mechanistic studies and drug discovery have focused on RNA synthesis by the highly conserved RdRp. The second active site, which resides in a Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain, is poorly characterized, but both catalytic reactions are essential for viral replication. One study showed that NiRAN transfers NMP to the first residue of RNA-binding protein nsp9; another reported a structure of nsp9 containing two additional N-terminal residues bound to the NiRAN active site but observed NMP transfer to RNA instead. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp NMPylates the native but not the extended nsp9. Substitutions of the invariant NiRAN residues abolish NMPylation, whereas substitution of a catalytic RdRp Asp residue does not. NMPylation can utilize diverse nucleotide triphosphates, including remdesivir triphosphate, is reversible in the presence of pyrophosphate, and is inhibited by nucleotide analogs and bisphosphonates, suggesting a path for rational design of NiRAN inhibitors. We reconcile these and existing findings using a new model in which nsp9 remodels both active sites to alternately support initiation of RNA synthesis by RdRp or subsequent capping of the product RNA by the NiRAN domain.","output":"NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) grows with each passing day worldwide, and the number of infections is increasing.

We investigated seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies in the serum samples in 2011C2021, including a cohort study of 2019C2021, to evaluate the vaccination and anti-IgG-SARS-CoV-2CS1 RBD-positive statuses to assess the resistance and severity of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-specific antibodies were assayed in the serum samples (N = 565) randomly selected from various cohorts previously recruited from 2011 to 2021 from the city of Moscow and Moscow Region. Among them there were the participants (N = 310) recruited in 2019C2021 with an endpoint of 30 October 2021 when these participants were interviewed over phone with relevant questionnaire. Results: Obtained data indicated a percentage of 3C6% of SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-specific antibodies detected in participants recruited in 2011C2019. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2-S1 RBD-specific antibodies was increased to 16.5% in 2020 and to 46% in 2021.

Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning.","output":"An examination of school reopening strategies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The DePEC-Nutrition trial is a complex dietary and behavioural intervention of salt intake reduction combined with increased high-nitrate vegetable consumption among Malaysian middle-aged and older adults with elevated blood pressure.

In particular, the radiometrically calibrated PRISMA Level 1 TOA radiances were compared to the TOA radiances simulated with a radiative transfer code, starting from in situ measurements of water reflectance. In situ data were obtained from a set of fixed position autonomous radiometers covering a wide range of water types, encompassing coastal and inland waters. A total of nine match-ups between PRISMA and in situ measurements distributed from July 2019 to June 2020 were analysed. Recognising the role of Sentinel-2 for inland and coastal waters applications, the TOA radiances measured from concurrent Sentinel-2 observations were added to the comparison. The results overall demonstrated that PRISMA VNIR sensor is providing TOA radiances with the same magnitude and shape of those in situ simulated (spectral angle difference, SA, between 0.80 and 3.39; root mean square difference, RMSD, between 0.98 and 4.76 [mW m(?2) sr(?1) nm(?1)]), with slightly larger differences at shorter wavelengths.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 has important proteins used for its infection and development, namely the protease and spike glycoprotein. The RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) of spike glycoprotein (RBD-S) can bind to the ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2) receptor at the protease domain (PD) (PD-ACE2) of the host cell, thereby leading to a viral infection. This study aims to reveal the potential of compounds contained in Curcuma sp., Citrus sp., Alpinia galanga, and Caesalpinia sappan as anti SARS-CoV-2 through its binding to 3 protein receptors. The study was conducted by molecular docking using the MOE 2010 program (licensed from Faculty of Pharmacy UGM, Indonesia). The selected protein targets are RBD-S (PDB ID:6LXT), PD-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1), and SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB ID:6LU7). The affinities of bonds formed is represented as a docking score. The results show that hesperidin, one of the compounds in Citrus sp., has the lowest docking score for all three protein receptors representing the highest affinity to bind the receptors. Moreover, all of the citrus flavonoids possess good affinity to the respected receptors as well as curcumin, brazilin, and galangin, indicating that those compounds perform inhibitory potential for the viral infection and replication. In general, the results of this study indicate that Citrus sp. exhibit the best potential as an inhibitor to the development of the SARS-CoV-2, followed by galangal, sappan wood, and Curcuma sp. that can be consumed in daily life as prophylaxis of COVID-19.","output":"Revealing the Potency of Citrus and Galangal Constituents to Halt SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES We aimed to characterize the combined impact of federal, state, and institutional policies on barriers to expanding medication and telemedicine abortion care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic in the abortion-restrictive states of Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. STUDY DESIGN We analyzed four state policies, two COVID-related state executive orders, and clinic-level survey data on medication abortion provision from fourteen abortion facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia from December 2019 to December 2020. We calculated the percent of medication abortions provided at these facilities during the study period by state, to assess changes in medication abortion use during the pandemic. RESULTS We ascertained that COVID-19-executive orders in Ohio and West Virginia that limited procedural abortion in Spring 2020 coincided with an increase in the overall number and proportion of medication abortions in this region, peaking at 1613 medication abortions (70%) in April 2020. Ohio and West Virginia, which had executive orders limiting procedural abortion, saw relatively greater increases in April compared to Kentucky. Despite temporary lifting of the mifepristone REMS, pre-pandemic regulations banning telemedicine abortion in Kentucky and West Virginia and requiring in-person clinic visits for medication abortion distribution in Ohio limited clinics' ability to adapt to offer medication abortion by mail. CONCLUSIONS Our findings illustrate how restrictive medication and telemedicine abortion policies in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia created additional obstacles for patients seeking medication abortion during the pandemic. Permanently lifting federal regulations on in-clinic distribution of mifepristone would only advantage abortion seekers in states without restrictive telehealth and medication abortion policies. State policies that limit access to comprehensive abortion services should be central in larger efforts toward dismantling barriers that impinge upon reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATION STATEMENT We find that abolishing the REMS on mifepristone would not be enough to expand access to patients in abortion-restrictive states with telemedicine and medication abortion laws. While the REMS is a barrier, it represents one of several hindrances to the expansion of telemedicine abortion distribution across the US.","output":"Federal, State, and Institutional Barriers to the Expansion of Medication and Telemedicine Abortion Services in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To determine the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 and the vaccination campaign on the seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors in Jordan.

Given the recent success in machine learning, it is interesting to investigate how we can leverage deep learning to filter out application layer attack requests.

Offline unsupervised learning methods can sidestep these hurdles by learning an anomaly detector $N$ from the normal-day traffic \${\\\\mathcal N}$.

RESULTS In this study, the redox proteome of sugar beet M14 roots under salt stress was investigated. Using iTRAQ reporters, we determined that salt stress caused significant changes in the abundance of many proteins (2305 at 20 min salt stress and 2663 at 10 min salt stress). Using iodoTMT reporters, a total of 95 redox proteins were determined to be responsive to salt stress after normalizing again total protein level changes. Notably, most of the differential redox proteins were involved in metabolism, ROS homeostasis, and stress and defense, while a small number play a role in transport, biosynthesis, signal transduction, transcription and photosynthesis. Transcription levels of 14 genes encoding the identified redox proteins were analyzed using qRT-PCR. All the genes were induced by salt stress at the transcriptional level.

Functional MRI (fMRI) could bring added value to the diagnosis of DMC in difficult situations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: IMAGISION is a prospective, monocentric, single-arm study evaluating fMRI compared with clinical assessment of DMC. The study will begin during Fall 2021 and should be completed by Spring 2023. Participants will be recruited from a memory clinic where they will come for an assessment of their cognitive abilities due to decision-making needs to support ageing in place. They will be older people over 70 years of age, living at home, presenting with a diagnosis of mild dementia, and no exclusion criteria of MRI. They will be clinically assessed by a geriatrician on their DMC, based on the neuropsychological tests usually performed. Participants will then perform a behavioural task in fMRI (Balloon Analogue Risk Task) to analyse the activation areas. Additional semistructured interviews will be conducted to explore real life implications.

Method This cross-sectional study included outpatient, day-patient and inpatient facilities caring for patients with spinal disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was designed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of inpatients and outpatients with spinal disorders and to assess the economic ramifications in the various settings. Results All members of the Spine Section (n = 134) were invited to participate in the questionnaire consented by BVOU and BDNC. The questions were answered anonymously, and the personal data entered did not permit any de-anonymisation. All in all, 68% (n = 91) of the respondents completed the survey in full.

Evidence in animal models of CDD showed that absence of CDKL5 negatively affects neuronal survival, as well as neuronal maturation and dendritic outgrowth; however, knowledge of the substrates underlying these alterations is still limited. Neuroinflammatory processes are known to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death. Recent evidence shows a subclinical chronic inflammatory status in plasma from CDD patients. However, to date, it is unknown whether a similar inflammatory status is present in the brain of CDD patients and, if so, whether this plays a causative or exacerbating role in the pathophysiology of CDD. METHODS: We evaluated microglia activation using AIF-1 immunofluorescence, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and signaling in the brain of a mouse model of CDD, the Cdkl5 KO mouse, which is characterized by an impaired survival of hippocampal neurons that worsens with age. Hippocampal neuron survival was determined by DCX, NeuN, and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining in Cdkl5 KO mice treated with luteolin (10 mg/kg), a natural anti-inflammatory flavonoid. Since hippocampal neurons of Cdkl5 KO mice exhibit increased susceptibility to excitotoxic stress, we evaluated neuronal survival in Cdkl5 KO mice injected with NMDA (60 mg/kg) after a 7-day treatment with luteolin. RESULTS: We found increased microglial activation in the brain of the Cdkl5 KO mouse. We found alterations in microglial cell morphology and number, increased levels of AIF-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of STAT3 signaling. Remarkably, treatment with luteolin recovers microglia alterations as well as neuronal survival and maturation in Cdkl5 KO mice, and prevents the increase in NMDA-induced cell death in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neuroinflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of CDD and imply the potential usefulness of luteolin as a treatment option in CDD patients.

METHODS: Data about symptoms of COVID-19 were collected through a telephone survey in the cohort of 913 older volunteers of the Vallecas Project, aged 75C90 years, most of them (902) home-dwelling, in Madrid, Spain. The association of demographic and anthropometric measures, genetic polymorphisms, comorbidities, life habits, type of residence, and frailty surrogates were explored as potential risk factors for the incidence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 in the older population.

However, the SDG agenda is not without flaws. Even before the pandemic, progress towards achieving the SDGs has been too slow. COVID-19 presents a stress test for the SDG approach. The SDG agenda provides three logics that could help transform towards sustainable societies: (1) a governance logic that sets goals, adopts policies, and tracks progress to steer impacts; (2) a systems (nexus) logic that manages SDG interactions; and (3) a strategic logic that enables (micro-level) companies to develop strategies that impact (macro-level) policy goals. We discuss key hurdles that each of these SDG logics face. Transforming towards sustainable societies beyond COVID-19 requires that multinational enterprises and policymakers (better) apply these logics, and that they address operational challenges to overcome flaws in the present approach to the SDGs.","output":"Beyond COVID-19: Applying SDG logics for resilient transformations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is a complex public health issue that requires community and environmental factors be addressed.

Inhaled Nitric Oxide offers itself as a potential tool in this context. The aim of this systematic review was to depict previous in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrating an antiviral role for NO Method: ology: Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Central Register were used to search for specific keywords such as Nitric oxide AND Antiviral activity for relevant publications up to 1 st of June 2021. The systematic review was performed using PRISMA protocol Results: : Twenty-one studies were identified depicting an antiviral role for Nitric Oxide. Those studies involved sixteen viruses. Only four of the depicted studies were clinical trials, while three were performed on a murine model. The remainder of the studies involved in vitro experimentation of the role of NO in halting viral replication of several viruses including SARS-CoV-2 Conclusion: While early reports of NO role in the treatment of COVID-19 suggested its use for the treatment of established ARDS, NO seems to have a much earlier and more efficient prophylactic role. It inhibits a protease needed for canonical viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, namely Furin, by decreasing calcium's cytosolic levels.

However, N95 mask causes discomfort breathing with marked reduction in air exchange. This study was designed to investigate whether the use of N95 mask affects rescuer's fatigue and chest compression quality during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). METHODS: After a brief review of CPR, each participant performed a 2-minute continuous chest compression on a manikin wearing N95 (N95 group, n = 40) or surgical mask (SM group, n = 40). Compression rate and depth, the proportions of correct compression rate, depth, complete chest recoil and hand position were documented. Participants' fatigue was assessed using Borg score. RESULTS: Significantly lower mean chest compression rate and depth were both achieved in the N95 group than in the SM group (p < 0.05, respectively). In addition, the proportion of correct compression rate (61  19 vs. 75  195, p = 0.0067), depth (67  16 vs. 90  14, p < 0.0001) and complete recoil (91  16 vs. 98  5%, p = 0.0248) were significantly decreased in the N95 group as compared to the SM group. At the end of compression, the Borg score in the N95 group was significantly higher than that in the SM group (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Wearing a N95 mask increases rescuer's fatigue and decreases chest compression quality during CPR. Therefore, the exchange of rescuers during CPR should be more frequent than that recommended in current guidelines when N95 masks are applied.","output":"Wearing a N95 mask increases rescuer's fatigue and decreases chest compression quality in simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers the simultaneous activation of innate inflammatory pathways including the complement system and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) generating in the process potent vasoactive peptides that contribute to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and multi-organ failure. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins C the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. However, the role of these proteins in either binding to or activation of the complement system and/or the KKS is still incompletely understood. In these studies, we used: solid phase ELISA, hemolytic assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques to examine if recombinant proteins corresponding to S1, N, M and E: (a) bind to C1q, gC1qR, FXII and high molecular weight kininogen (HK), and (b) activate complement and/or the KKS. Our data show that the viral proteins: (a) bind C1q and activate the classical pathway of complement, (b) bind FXII and HK, and activate the KKS in normal human plasma to generate bradykinin and (c) bind to gC1qR, the receptor for the globular heads of C1q (gC1q) which in turn could serve as a platform for the activation of both the complement system and KKS. Collectively, our data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 viral particle can independently activate major innate inflammatory pathways for maximal damage and efficiency. Therefore, if efficient therapeutic modalities for the treatment of COVID-19 are to be designed, a strategy that includes blockade of the four major structural proteins may provide the best option.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Exacerbates COVID-19 Pathology Through Activation of the Complement and Kinin Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidrug-resistant bacteria have become a public health problem worldwide, reducing treatment options against several pathogens. If we do not act against this problem, it is estimated that by 2050 superbugs will kill more people than the current COVID-19 pandemic. Among solutions to combat antibacterial resistance, there is increasing demand for new antimicrobials. The antibacterial activity of binary combinations containing bioAgNP (biogenically synthesized silver nanoparticles using Fusarium oxysporum), oregano essential oil (OEO), carvacrol (Car), and thymol (Thy) was evaluated: OEO plus bioAgNP, Car plus bioAgNP, Thy plus bioAgNP, and Car plus Thy. This study shows that the mechanism of action of Thy, bioAgNP, and Thy plus bioAgNP involves damaging the membrane and cell wall (surface blebbing and disruption seen with an electron microscope), causing cytoplasmic molecule leakage (ATP, DNA, RNA, and total proteins) and oxidative stress by enhancing intracellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation; a similar mechanism happens for OEO and Car, except for oxidative stress. The combination containing bioAgNP and oregano derivatives, especially thymol, shows strategic antibacterial mechanism; thymol disturbs the selective permeability of the cell membrane and consequently facilitates access of the nanoparticles to bacterial cytoplasm. BioAgNP-treated Escherichia coli developed resistance to nanosilver after 12 days of daily exposition. The combination of Thy and bioAgNP prevented the emergence of resistance to both antimicrobials; therefore, mixture of antimicrobials is a strategy to extend their life. For antimicrobials alone, minimal bactericidal concentration ranges were 0.3C2.38 mg/ml (OEO), 0.31C1.22 mg/ml (Car), 0.25C1 mg/ml (Thy), and 15.75C31.5 g/ml (bioAgNP). The time-kill assays showed that the oregano derivatives acted very fast (at least 10 s), while the bioAgNP took at least 30 min to kill Gram-negative bacteria and 7 h to kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All the combinations resulted in additive antibacterial effect, reducing significantly minimal inhibitory concentration and acting faster than the bioAgNP alone; they also showed no cytotoxicity. This study describes for the first time the effect of Car and Thy combined with bioAgNP (produced with F. oxysporum components) against bacteria for which efficient antimicrobials are urgently needed, such as carbapenem-resistant strains (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and MRSA.","output":"Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles Strategically Combined With Origanum vulgare Derivatives: Antibacterial Mechanism of Action and Effect on Multidrug-Resistant Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect the physical and mental health and the well-being of people globally The physicians and nurses on the frontline of patients care will be among the most affected in their psychosocial well-being, being exposed to trauma consequences and burnout syndrome It is still unknown whether the COVID-19 infection will have direct neuropsychiatric consequences The impact of the quarantine lockdown on mental health, too, has to be taken into account The inclusion of mental health as part of national public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory in assisting all those in need","output":"Mental health and the covid-19 pandemic: A call for action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using real-time register data we document the magnitude, dynamics and socio-economic characteristics of the crisis-induced temporary and permanent layoffs in Norway.

This study aims to compare the mean titers, duration, and efficacy of generating protective anti-RBD IgG antibody response among recipients of Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, we aimed to compare the susceptibility of getting COVID-19 breakthrough infections after various types of vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 2065 blood bank donors and healthcare workers at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) were collected between February and September 2021. Anti-Spike/RBD IgG levels were measured using Chemiluminescent microparticle-immunoassay (CMIA) (ARCHITECT IgG II Quant test, Abbott, USA). RESULTS: The mean titer of anti-RBD IgG levels was significantly diverse among different types of vaccines. The highest titer level was seen in participants who took a third booster vaccine shot, followed by Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinopharm vaccine. The mean titer levels of anti-RBD IgG antibodies in the Pfizer vaccinated group was the highest after vaccination but started to drop after 60 days from vaccination unlike AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccine-induced antibodies where the mean titers continued to be stable until 120 days but their levels were significantly lower. Most of the breakthrough infections were among the Sinopharm vaccinated group and these breakthroughs happened at random times for the three main types of vaccines.

So far no written analyses have been issued and the single cases that happen are resolved by administrative courts on an ad causam basis. Despite the fact that the administrative proceedings digitalization process has been going on for over 20 years, its importance has actually been confirmed now, during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially due to the necessity of meeting the sanitary measures, avoiding gatherings, limited or suspended operations of the public institutions on site which makes the electronic communication between the participants of administrative proceedings attractive. For this reason, electronic administrative proceedings have become an attractive solution in this difficult and unpredictable period. The authors formulated here a hypothesis that malfunctions of technical devices or ICT networks used for submitting applications or motions may result even in failure to submit the said applications.

In terms of size, Bogura is equivalent to most of the major cities in Bangladesh, yet no thermal and ecological assessment has ever been conducted here. This study uses multitemporal Landsat satellite images between 2001 and 2020 to investigate the thermal and ecological conditions of Bogura Sadar (sub-district). Land surface temperature (LST) is obtained from Landsat images using the widely used radiative transfer equation. The thermal and ecological conditions are evaluated by computing urban heat island (UHI) and urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) from LST data. The influence of vegetation, built-area, water-body, and bare soil on LST are examined using land cover indices through pixel-level multivariate linear regression analysis. According to the findings of this sub-district-scale (urban and rural areas) study, the mean LST has increased by 0.62 C in the last 20 years. As per local administrative-wise findings, LST has increased in most areas, regardless of their urban or rural function. The difference between the urban area and the rest of the surroundings was significant (1.74 C) in 2020. In 2001, UHI affected area was 5.65 km(2), which expanded to 8.84 km(2) in 2020. Thermal and ecological conditions are worse in urban areas than its surrounding areas. The regression models of the LST and land cover indices could explain more than half (R(2): 0.66 to 0.73) of LST variation over the years.

HPeV3 ribonucleic acids (RNAs), other viral RNAs, and clinical stool samples were used to confirm whether the designed primers would allow the detection of HPeV3 with the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique. RESULTS: Three combinations of primers were created and it was confirmed that all primer sets allowed the detection of HPeV3 RNAs. The primer sets had cross-reactivity with HPeV type 1 (HPeV1), but all sets showed negative results when applied to coxsackievirus, echovirus, enterovirus, norovirus, and adenovirus genomes.

METHODS: We conducted two dedicated anonymous questionnaire completed at the end of the first lockdown period in France about the HF patients'symptoms and the cardiologists'pratice. In parallel, data from the SNDS (Systme National des Donnes de Sant) were collected concerning the practices of cardiologists. RESULTS: Regarding HF patients, 1156 participated and filled the questionnaire. 53% were men, aged 61 15 yo in men and 5312 yo in women; 13% declared feeling bad during the pandemic period. 36% declared they had more dyspnea, 14% more oedema, 45% a gain of weight and 57% were more tired. 45% of patients declared having spent more than 4 weeks without any appointment with a medical doctor. Regarding Cardiologists, they proposed to perform a remotely follow-up (teleconsultation including visio, phone call management) in 23% of cases. In parallel, data from the SNDS showed that 19% of cardiologist used teleconsultations.

In our methodology the only information required for estimating these parameters is the time series of deceased people; due to the number of asymptomatic people produced by the COVID-19, it is not possible to know the actual number of infected people at any given time. Therefore, among the different time series that quantify the pandemic we consider just the number of deceased people to minimize the square sum of errors. The time series of deaths considered runs from March to the end of September and is divided into four sub-periods reflecting the different isolation measures taken by the Spanish government. The parameters that we can estimate are the time from the beginning of the disease, the transmission rate, and the recovery rate; these last two ratios are estimated in each of the different sub-periods. In this way the model considered has 2x4+1=9 parameters that are estimated jointly over the whole period from the data of deceased. Given the complexity of the model, to estimate the parameters that minimize the square sum of errors, a Genetic Algorithm is used.

Synchronous annual breeding and shorter incubation periods did not allow filovirus persistence, whereas bi-annual breeding and longer incubation periods, such as reported for Egyptian fruit bats and EBOV in experimental studies, allowed persistence in colony sizes often found in nature.

However, the duration and effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response remains to be assessed in population-based samples. To estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositive individuals as compared to seronegative controls we conducted a retrospective longitudinal matched study. METHODS: A seroprevalence survey including a representative sample of the population was conducted in Geneva, Switzerland between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Seropositive participants were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, BMI, smoking status and education level. Each individual was linked to a state-registry of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our primary outcome was confirmed infections occurring from serological status assessment to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021). RESULTS: Among 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (SD 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of whom 5 (1.0%) were classified as reinfections. In contrast, the infection rate was higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar follow-up period (mean 34.7 [SD 3.2] weeks), corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P<0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositives. CONCLUSIONS: Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection against reinfection lasting at least 8 months. These findings could help global health authorities establishing priority for vaccine allocation.","output":"Risk of reinfection after seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2: A population-based propensity-score matched cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mixing gestating sows implies hierarchy formation and has detrimental consequences on welfare. The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups. We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order on 20 groups of 46C91 animals. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P = 0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P = 0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions.","output":"Social status and previous experience in the group as predictors of welfare of sows housed in large semi-static groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global medical systems and economies, and rules our daily living life. Controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the most important and urgent strategies throughout the whole world. As of October, 2020, there have not yet been any medicines or therapies to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, rapid and sensitive diagnostics is the most important measures to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Homogeneous biosensing based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is one of the most promising approaches for rapid and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. This paper proposes an approach for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized MNPs via the measurement of their magnetic response in an ac magnetic field. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows the rapid detection of mimic SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 0.084 nM (5.9 fmole).

The covid-19 7098 AA large polyprotein was degraded into sixteen proteins and last nsp16 protein was found an RlmE type rRNA methyltransferase. Nsp16 has no similarity to bacterial RlmABCD but has 25 percent similarity to the bacterial RlmE protein which methylates the U2551 2-hydroxy group of Ribose. The nsp16 proteins of different corona viruses like covid-19, bat-coronavirus, SARS and MERS have strong homology. Mrm2 and Dim1 like yeast and mammalian rRNA methyltransferases have 26-33 percent homologies but not with 2-O-capping MTase as reported previously. Rrp8 MTases also has no similarity to nsp16. We postulated that mitochondrial rRNA methylation of bronchial cells were mediated by the nsp16 protein causing inhibition of protein synthesis due to poor assembly of aminoacyl-tRNA or mRNA and peptidyl transferase at the PTC. This is one of the new molecular mechanism of corona virus cellular tropism and different than ACE-2 mediated blockage of cellular signalling to inhibit aldesterone biosynthesis with abnormal Na+ ions in cells.

Appropriate glycemic management contributes to a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes in acute illness but also requires intensive patient interactions for bedside glucose monitoring, intravenous and subcutaneous insulin administration, as well as rapid intervention for hypoglycemia events. These tasks are required at a time when minimizing patient interactions is recommended as a way of avoiding prolonged exposure to COVID-19 by health care personnel who often practice in settings with limited supplies of personal protective equipment. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance for clinicians for reconciling recommended standards of care for infected hospitalized patients with diabetes while also addressing the daily realities of an overwhelmed health care system in many areas of the country. The use of modified protocols for insulin administration, bedside glucose monitoring, and medications such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine that may affect glycemic control are discussed. Continuous glucose monitoring systems have been proposed as an option for reducing time spent with patients, but there are important issues that need to be addressed if these are used in hospitalized patients. On site and remote glucose management teams have potential to provide guidance in areas where there are shortages of personnel who have expertise in inpatient glycemic management.","output":"A Pragmatic Approach to Inpatient Diabetes Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The morbidity and mortality of stroke is disproportionately high in developing countries owing to the poor health care system and poor neurologic interventions. Though a number of studies were conducted to estimate the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia, the lack of a nationwide study that determines the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke is an important research gap. Meta-analysis is key to improve the accuracy of estimates through the use of more data sets. Thus, this study was aimed to determine the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia. METHODS This study was conducted following the PRISMA checklist. We searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for studies. Each of the original studies was assessed using a tool for the risk of bias adapted for cross-sectional studies. Data were pooled and a random effect meta-analysis model was fitted to provide the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke. Also, the subgroup analyses were performed to examine how the in-hospital mortality rate varies across different groups of studies. RESULTS In this study, the overall magnitude of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation among stroke patients were 47% (95%CI: 40-54), 8% (95CI%:6-12), and 10% (95%CI: 5-19), respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality of stroke in Ethiopia was 18% (95%:14-22). The highest magnitude of in-hospital mortality of stroke was observed in SNNPR and the lowest was noted in Tigray region. In addition, the magnitude of the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke was 15.1% (95%CI: 11.3-19.4), and 19.6%(95%CI: 14.1-25.7), among studies published before and after 2016, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our pooled result showed that nearly one-fifth of stroke patients have died during hospitalization. The most common risk factor of stroke among the included studies was hypertension followed by atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus. There is a need for a better understanding of the factors associated with high blood pressure, especially in countries with a high risk of stroke.","output":"Magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality of stroke in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the massive spread of a new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), many European governments enacted rules and legislations in order to reduce social interactions and contain the spread of the virus. German authorities put in force a lockdown of all non-essential infrastructure, starting on 22 March 2020. These policies included the closing of sports clubs, fitness centres and community sports grounds. Most federal states prohibited social gatherings of more than two people, thereby further restricting opportunities to play sport and exercise together. The paper addresses how Germans adapted their leisure time sport and exercise (LTSE) activities in this unprecedented situation. Based on survey data representing the adult population (? 14 years, N=1001, data collection 27 March to 6 April 2020), the paper shows a significant decline in LTSE activities at population level. Overall, 31% of Germans reduced their LTSE, while 27% maintained and 6% intensified their LTSE level. A share of 36% was not engaged in LTSE, either before or at the beginning of the lockdown. Younger age groups were more likely to maintain LTSE levels compared with older ones. Comparisons of reducers and maintainers/ intensifiers indicate that the latter group increased home-based workouts and outdoor endurance sports, while reducers did not find adequate substitutes for their sporting routines.","output":"Sport and exercise in times of self-quarantine: How Germans changed their behaviour at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To counteract the shortage of nurses in the workforce, healthcare organizations must encourage experienced nurses to extend their working lives. Intensive care (IC) has higher nurse-to-patient ratios than other settings, which includes a particular susceptibility to staff shortage. This qualitative study investigated how older IC nurses experienced their working life and their reflections on the late-career and retirement. Semi-structured interviews with 12 IC nurses in Sweden (aged 55C65 years) were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. The results showed that nurses planned to continue working until the age of 65 and beyond. When reflecting on their late-career decisions, nurses considered nine areas covering individual, work, and organizational factors as being central to their ability and willingness to stay. Overall, the nurses had good health and were very satisfied and committed to their job and to the organization. They mentioned having both the job and personal resources required to cope with the physical and mental job demands, which were perceived as motivational challenges, rather than hinders. They also reflected on various human resource management practices that may promote aging-in-workplace.

It has been proposed that the newly learned locomotor program may be stored separately from the baseline program. However, how locomotor performance evolves with repeated sessions of walking with the perturbation is not yet known. To address this question, 10 healthy subjects walked on a treadmill on 4 consecutive days. Each day, locomotor performance was measured using kinematics and surface electromyography (EMGs), before, during, and after exposure to a perturbation, produced by an elastic tubing that pulled the foot forward and up during swing, inducing a foot velocity error in the first strides. Initial movement error decreased significantly between days 1 and 2 and then remained stable. Associated changes in medial hamstring EMG activity stabilized only on day 3, however. Aftereffects were present after perturbation removal, suggesting that daily adaptation involved central command recalibration of the baseline program. Aftereffects gradually decreased across days but were still visible on day 4. Separation between the newly learned and baseline programs may take longer than suggested by the daily improvement in initial performance in the perturbing environment or may never be complete. These results therefore suggest that reaching optimal performance in a perturbing environment should not be used as the main indicator of a completed learning process, as central reorganization of the motor commands continues days after initial performance has stabilized.","output":"Effects of repeated walking in a perturbing environment: a 4-day locomotor learning study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundBedside lung ultrasound (LUS) is an affordable diagnostic tool that could contribute to identifying COVID-19 pneumonia.

They were then analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: The findings show that the architectural elements can have positive or negative effects on the health and safe environments. The quantity of doors and the use of transparent glass have largely contributed to the thermal transmission and increased indoor temperatures. The roof aluminium sheets and absence of vents inhibited indoor heat loss.

Even though we are witnessing the decline of the clinical autopsy, its importance remains unchanged as it is the most exhaustive way to investigate diseases. The identification of the virus in postmortem tissues is a fundamental step in the definition of its clinical features. OBJECTIVE.-: To investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in postmortem examination with swabs. DESIGN.-: We performed postmortem swabs in 12 autopsy cases of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Our protocol consisted of a rhinopharyngeal and a tracheal swab in order to search for the virus in the upper airways, and of 2 swabs on the parenchyma of each lung. We also performed a fifth swab on the parenchyma of both lungs in order to search for other viruses that could evolve in a clinical picture of interstitial pneumonia. RESULTS.-: Overall, we found 9 of 12 cases had at least 1 postmortem swab positive for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we evaluated the time between the antemortem and postmortem swabs, the time between death and the postmortem swabs, and the time between the postmortem swabs and acceptance to the microbiology laboratory. Of note, we did not find a relationship between the results of the swabs and either the time elapsed from their collection or the time elapsed before their acceptance in the microbiology laboratory. CONCLUSIONS.-: A thorough knowledge of the eventual persistence of pathogens in deaths related to infectious diseases is fundamental for the safety of the operators during the autopsy practice, especially when referring to emergent pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. Our study highlights the importance in performing multiple swabs in the postmortem examination, because SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity can be limited to only a single swab.","output":"Postmortem Swabs in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic: Report on 12 Complete Clinical Autopsy Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CEL NAUKOWY: Celem artyku?u jest prba umiejscowienia skupu obligacji korporacyjnych w dotychczasowym dorobku teoretycznym bankowo?ci centralnej oraz dokonanie analizy przypadku wybranych programw skupu obligacji korporacyjnych realizowanych w ostatnich latach przez europejskie banki centralne.

THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND METHODS: The first step to achieve the scientific goal was to review the activities of European central banks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following central bank have decided to extend their monetary policy instruments to include corporate bond purchase programmes: ECB, Riksbank, Bank of England and National Bank of Hungary. Due to the limited framework of the study, the programmes' of the first three central banks were subject to comparative analysis. THE PROCESS OF ARGUMENTATION: The first stage of the research is to present the theoretical background of the corporate bond purchase programs by the central bank. The next stage of the research was to conduct a case study of individual bank programs constituting the research group and their comparative analysis. RESEARCH RESULTS: Corporate bond purchase programs are one of the policies of the central bank's balance sheet. The theoretical basis for the impact of this type of programs is justified by the current scientific achievements of central banking. It should be noted that the case study showed that there are significant differences between the bond purchase programs implemented by individual central banks CONCLUSIONS, INNOVATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The central bank's policy based on direct interference with the corporate sector debt market is justified in the theory of monetary policy. However, it is a very unconventional tool and due to the risks indicated in the article, its use should be limited","output":"Banki centralne na rynku obligacji korporacyjnych C analiza przypadku programw skupu aktyww przez europejskie banki centralne"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid person-to-person transfer of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and their occasional mutations owing to the human activity and climate/ecological changes by the mankind led to creation of wrecking worldwide challenges. Such fast transferable pathogens requiring practical diagnostic setups to control their transfer chain and stop sever outbreaks in early stages of their appearance. Herein, we have addressed this urgent demand by designing a rapid electrochemical diagnostic kit composed of fixed/screen printed electrodes that can detect pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and/or animal viruses through the differentiable fingerprint of their viral glycoproteins at different voltage positions. The working electrode of developed sensor is activated upon coating a layer of coupled graphene oxide (GO) with sensitive chemical compounds along with gold nanostars (Au NS) that can detect the trace of viruses in any aquatic biological media (e.g., blood, saliva and oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab) through interaction with active functional groups of their glycoproteins. The method do not require any extraction and/or biomarkers for detection of target viruses and can identify trace of different pathogenic viruses in about 1 min. The nanosensor also demonstrated superior limit of detection (LOD) and sensitivity of 1.68  10-22 g mL-1 and 0.0048 Ag.mL-1. cm-2, respectively, toward detection of SARS-CoV-2 in biological media, while blind clinical evaluations of 100 suspected samples furtherly confirmed the superior sensitivity/specificity of developed nanosystem toward rapid identification of ill people even at incubation and prodromal periods of illness.","output":"Ultra-sensitive viral glycoprotein detection NanoSystem toward accurate tracing SARS-CoV-2 in biological/non-biological media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intestinal microbiota is crucial to intestinal homeostasis. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is high pathogenic to intestines, causing diarrhea, even death in piglets. To investigate the detailed relationship between PEDV infection and intestinal microbiota, the composition and distribution of intestinal microbiota from pigs were first analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. The results demonstrated that the composition and distribution of microbes in different intestinal segments were quite similar between 1-week-old and 2-week-old piglets but different from 4-week-old (weaned) piglets. Then piglets at different ages were inoculated with PEDV. The results showed that the 1-week-old piglets exhibited the most severe pathogenicity comparing to the other age groups. Further investigations indicated that Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, and Lactococcus in the intestinal microbiota of piglets were significantly changed by PEDV infection. These results strengthen our understanding of viruses influencing intestinal microbes and remind us of the potential association between PEDV and intestinal microbes.","output":"Acute porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection reshapes the intestinal microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The number of public health nurses has decreased consistently and significantly since the 1920s The recent COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the need for more public health nurses in the workforce The number of novice nurses entering into public health roles is declining, demonstrating a clear need to mentor pre-licensure nursing students into the public health nursing workforce Scholarly concentration (SC) programs are a method to explore specialty roles through in-depth scholarly activities, outside of core curriculum However, SC programs have not been described in the nursing literature The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a SC program to engage pre-licensure Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) students in scholarly activities related to public health nursing Program Overview This Public Health Nurse Scholars program was developed in 2014 with the goal of developing a cadre of generalist CNL students with experiences in public health nursing scholarly activities The program aimed to increase awareness of career and scholarship opportunities through mentorship with public health nursing faculty Students were encouraged to attend and present at professional conferences, participate in active scholarly projects and conduct quality improvement projects from a public health nursing perspective The program was designed to foster students' public health nursing leadership and presentation skills and enhance their self-directed learning Results To date, 46 pre-licensure nursing students were selected as Public Health Nurse Scholars Sixty-seven percent (n=31) have graduated as Public Health Nurse Scholars;thirty-three percent (n=15) are current Public Health Nurse Scholars Nine public health nursing faculty have served as mentors As a result of the program 15 scholars attended and 3 scholars presented respectively at community/public health nursing conferences, and several scholars had related professional development opportunities A majority of Public Health Nurse Scholars have designed and implemented a capstone quality improvement project with a public health nursing perspective, 15 of which were completed at community-based sites Conclusions In the face of our current global, public health crisis, there is a clear need to develop a cadre of novice nurses prepared to enter the public health nursing workforce The Public Health Nurse Scholars program shows promise towards encouraging an interest in public health nursing scholarship Schools of nursing may consider the implementation of similar SC programs as an approach to mentor pre-licensure nurses int other specialty areas such as gerontological and neonatal nursing","output":"A scholarly concentration program to promote public health nursing for generalist Clinical Nurse Leader students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection has noted derangements in coagulation markers along with significant thrombotic complications. Post-mortem examinations show severe endothelial injury and widespread thrombotic microangiopathy in the pulmonary vasculature. Early reports describing the use of prophylactic anticoagulation demonstrated improved survival, leading to the adoption of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation guided by D-dimer levels. The clinical usefulness of D-dimer values, trends, and more intensive anticoagulation remains an area of clinical interest. OBJECTIVES: Assess the outcomes and laboratory trends in COVID-19 patients stratified by intensity of anticoagulation at time of admission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively review the differences in clinical outcomes and laboratory trends in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Lifespan Health System. RESULTS: Between 27 February and 24 April 2020, 468 patients were hospitalized. Initial use of high-intensity thromboprophylaxis was associated with improved 30-day mortality (adjusted RR 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07C0.97; p = 0.045) without a significant increased rate of bleeding (p = 0.11). In severe COVID-19, D-dimer significantly increased during hospitalization with standard thromboprophylaxis (p < 0.001) but remained stable or decreased with high-intensity prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Patients who received high-intensity prophylactic anticoagulation had a downtrend in D-dimer levels and improved 30-day mortality. This suggests a role in anticoagulation in mitigating adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19; however, further randomized, prospective studies are needed.","output":"Intensity of anticoagulation and survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2030, there are still three main activity areas that a Chief Human Resource Officer must take care of: (1) People and Talent Management, (2) Organization Design & Change, and (3) Management and Leadership of the HR department.

However, there is a growing concern about the relation of dexamethasone with the unprecedented rates of ICU-acquired respiratory tract infections (ICU-RTI) observed in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study; conducted in ten countries in Latin America and Europe. We included patients older than 18 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 requiring ICU admission. A multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to determine the relation between dexamethasone treatment and ICU-RTI. RESULTS: A total of 3777 patients were included. 2065 (54.7%) were treated with dexamethasone within the first 24 h of admission. After performing the PSM, patients treated with dexamethasone showed significantly higher proportions of VAP (282/1652 [17.1%] Vs. 218/1652 [13.2%], p = 0.014). Also, dexamethasone treatment was identified as an adjusted risk factor of ICU-RTI in the multivariate logistic regression model (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.37C1.97; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing ICU-acquired respiratory tract infections after adjusting for days of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, suggesting a cautious use of this treatment.","output":"Dexamethasone as risk-factor for ICU-acquired respiratory tract infections in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has led to unprecedented utilization of digital solutions to combat the pandemic.

For the impression of cow health status, precise and quick assessment of cow feeding behaviour is critical. This research presents a method for monitoring dairy cow feeding behaviour utilizing edge computing and deep learning algorithms based on the characteristics of dairy cow feeding behaviour. Images of cow feeding behaviour were captured and processed in real time using an edge computing device. A DenseResNet-You Only Look Once (DRN-YOLO) deep learning method was presented to address the difficulties of existing cow feeding behaviour detection algorithms low accuracy and sensitivity to the open farm environment. The deep learning and feature extraction enhancement of the model was improved by replacing the CSPDarknet backbone network with the self-designed DRNet backbone network based on the YOLOv4 algorithm using multiple feature scales and the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) structure to enrich the scale semantic feature interactions, finally achieving the recognition of cow feeding behaviour in the farm feeding environment. The experimental results showed that DRN-YOLO improved the accuracy, recall, and mAP by 1.70%, 1.82%, and 0.97%, respectively, compared to YOLOv4.

The mechanical properties of the CUPOMCs can be tuned by controlling the molar ratios of pre-POMC monomers, and the ratio between the prepolymer and HDI. CUPOMCs can be crosslinked into a 3D network through polycondensation or free radical polymerization reactions. The tensile strength and elongation at break of CUPOMC synthesized under the known conditions range from 0.730.12MPa to 10.910.64MPa and from 72.919.09% to 300.4121.99% respectively. Preliminary biocompatibility tests demonstrated that CUPOMCs support cell adhesion and proliferation. Unlike the pre-polymers of other crosslinked elastomers, CUPOMC pre-polymers possess great processability demonstrated by scaffold fabrication via a thermally induced phase separation method. The dual crosslinking methods for CUPOMC pre-polymers should enhance the versatile processability of the CUPOMC used in various conditions.

With students pulled from clinical sites, funding deficits, SRFCs' voluntary nature, and no best practices for telehealth SRFCs, many have been forced to close. This report shares a systematic approach for implementing a telehealth clinic along with initial outcomes from the Dedicated to Aurora's Wellness and Needs (DAWN) SRFC. Methods We utilized pilots with students, community volunteers, and patients to identify a telehealth platform. We implemented weekly plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to develop a feasible interprofessional telehealth model. Key PDSA cycle goals included seamless utilization of platform, identification of necessary team members, appropriate scheduling of patients and volunteers, integration of interprofessional learners, positive patient and volunteer experience, and process for identifying and addressing patient social needs. Measured outcomes included total visits, no-show rates, and chief complaints addressed. Results Outcomes from PDSA cycles included a resultant telehealth clinic team and model, workflow for outreach for social needs screening and navigation, and team training guides. Visit data and no-show rates from January 2020 through July 2020 demonstrated total visits returned to 60% of pre-COVID numbers while no-show rates decreased significantly below pre-COVID rates. A range of acute and chronic concerns were successfully managed via telehealth. Conclusion SRFCs are poised to continue serving an important role in caring for the country's most vulnerable populations.

No published studies have compared outcomes for patients treated with different MAT for COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to compare COVID-19-related emergency room (ER) visits, admissions, and mortality at 30 days after MAT infusion for adult patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 between November 16, 2020 and February 2, 2021 who received bamlanivimab versus those who received casirivimab-imdevimab. Statistical analysis used logistic regression analysis to determine the odds ratio (OR) to evaluate the relationship between patient characteristics, MAT, and outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort included 943 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received MAT, including 658 patients who received bamlanivimab and 285 who received casirivimab-imdevimab. Outcome results between patients who received bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab showed no statistically significant difference seen in the number of COVID-19 related ER visits (3.2% vs 3.5%, p = 0.80), hospital admissions (4.6% vs 2.8%, p = 0.21), or mortality (0.5% vs 0.7%, p = 0.63). Multivariate analysis showed no statistically significant difference in outcomes between the groups when accounting for potential confounders. As reflected in the Table, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), gender, and asthma were associated with increased COVID-19 related ER visit within 30 days of infusion and age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CLL, and lupus were associated with increased risk for COVID-19 related admission within 30 days of infusion. Age and obesity with body mass index greater than 35 mg/kg(2) were associated with increased risk for COVID-19 related mortality at 30 days.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death? METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website.

Subjects: A convenience sample of parents of children aged 5-12. Measures: Survey to assess parental perceptions of changes in children's physical activity before and during stay-at-home orders, and environmental and social barriers to physical activity. Analysis: Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, and multinomial-logistic regression models with covariates of environmental factors, social factors, and frequency of factors as barriers on association with perceived physical activity change. Results: Data from 245 parents were analyzed. A majority (63.7%) of parents reported a decrease in children's physical activity during stay-at-home orders. More parents indicated social barriers (e.g., lack of access to playmates) than environmental barriers (e.g., lack of access to neighborhood play spaces) to children's physical activity. In multivariate analyses, the odds of parents reporting decreased physical activity was greater for those reporting lack of playmates (OR = 4.72; 95% CI: 1.99-11.17) and lack of adult supervision (OR = 11.82; 95% CI: 2.48-56.28) as barriers.

We retrospectively examined significant factors associated with disease severity in symptomatic COVID-19 patients (COVID-Pts) admitted to our institution between February 20 and April 30, 2020. METHODS: All patients were diagnosed based on the genetic detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Information on the initial symptoms, laboratory data, and computed tomography (CT) images at hospitalization were collected from the patients records. COVID-Pts were categorized as those with critical or severe illness (Pts-CSI) or those with moderate or mild illness (Pt-MMI). All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS: Data from 61 patients (16 PtCCSI, 45 Pt-MMI), including 58 Japanese and three East Asians, were analyzed. PtCCSI were significantly older and had hypertension or diabetes than Pt-MMI (P < 0.001, 0.014 and < 0.001, respectively). Serum albumin levels were significantly lower in PtCCSI than in Pt-MMI (P < 0.001), whereas the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein level were significantly higher in PtCCSI than in Pt-MMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In the CT images of 60 patients, bilateral lung lesions were more frequently observed in PtCCSI than in Pt-MMI (P = 0.013). Among the 16 PtCCSI, 15 received antiviral therapy, 12 received tocilizumab, five underwent methylprednisolone treatment, six received mechanical ventilation, and one died.

However, there is an absence of knowledge on the effect of long-term operation under these conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the operational conditions of an anaerobic reactor treating food waste after long-term operation without temperature control and low-intensity mixing. For this, a demonstration-scale reactor (18.8 m3) was operated for 160 days, while stability parameters were used to control the applied organic loading rate (OLR). Stability parameters indicated that the reactor was operated at stable conditions with an OLR of 0.3a? kg VS m-3 d-1, while it was overloaded at an OLR of 0.4a? kg VS m-3 d-1. This was observed through high value of intermediate and partial alkalinity ratio (IA/PA ratio), 2.5, and low values of bicarbonate alkalinity and pH, 1,800a? mg CaCO3 L-1 and 6.8, respectively. Moreover, there was a change in the concentration of intermediated metabolites, with a higher content of propionate and acetate, 1,080 and 3,775a? mg L-1, respectively. Consequently, the methane production rate was decreased from 0.12 to 0.08a? m3 CH4 m-3 d-1 and methane yield from 0.43 to 0.15a? m3 CH4 kg VS-1. The reactor instability at a relatively low OLR was most probably due to hydrodynamic factors caused by the accumulation of recalcitrant material.

We aimed to evaluate the pattern of comorbidity and frailty in a group of individuals having fatal outcomes in home healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic March to September 2020, and to assess the contribution of COVID-19 in the fatal outcomes. METHODS: A cohort of adults with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis that deceased in home healthcare between March and September 2020 were analysed in a retrospective study comprising home healthcare in 136 facilities in one Swedish county. Main outcome measures were comorbidity and frailty. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five individuals (88 women, 67 men) aged 57C106 (median 88) years were included in the analysis. Nine had considerable frailty (ability to perform various activities of daily living but confined to bed or chair on occasion) and the remaining 146 had severe frailty (unable to perform activities of daily living and/or confined to bed or chair; dementia necessitating care). Three or more diagnoses besides COVID-19 were present in 142 individuals and another eight had two diagnoses in addition to COVID-19. In 20 (13%) individuals, COVID-19 was assessed as the principal cause of death, in 100 (64.5%) a contributing cause, and for the remaining 35 (22.5%) death was probably caused by another comorbidity.

Depending on the specific enzyme involved, different types of porphyrias (i.e., chronic vs. acute, cutaneous vs. neurovisceral, hepatic vs. erythropoietic) are described, with different clinical presentations. Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) are characterized by life-threatening acute neuro-visceral crises (acute porphyric attacks, APAs), featuring a wide range of neuropathic (central, peripheral, autonomic) manifestations. APAs are usually unleashed by external \\"porphyrinogenic\\" triggers, which are thought to cause an increased metabolic demand for heme. During APAs, the heme precursors ?-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) accumulate in the bloodstream and urine. Even though several hypotheses have been developed to explain the protean clinical picture of APAs, the exact mechanism of neuronal damage in AHPs is still a matter of debate. In recent decades, a role has been proposed for oxidative damage caused by ALA, mitochondrial and synaptic ALA toxicity, dysfunction induced by relative heme deficiency on cytochromes and other hemeproteins (i.e., nitric oxide synthases), pyridoxal phosphate functional deficiency, derangements in the metabolic pathways of tryptophan, and other factors. Since the pathway leading to the biosynthesis of heme is inscribed into a complex network of interactions, which also includes some fundamental processes of basal metabolism, a disruption in any of the steps of this pathway is likely to have multiple pathogenic effects.

Methods: Utilizing a complete dataset of Sina Weibo posts published by users in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020, we constructed a time-varying social network of 3.5 million users. In combination with community detection, text analysis, and sentiment analysis, we comprehensively analyzed the evolution of the social network structure, as well as the behavioral and emotional changes across four main stages of Wuhan's experience with the epidemic. Results: The empirical results indicate that almost all network indicators related to the network's size and the frequency of social interactions increased during the outbreak. The number of unique recipients, average degree, and transitivity increased by 24, 23, and 19% during the severe stage than before the outbreak, respectively. Additionally, the similarity of topics discussed on Weibo increased during the local peak of the epidemic. Most people began discussing the epidemic instead of the more varied cultural topics that dominated early conversations. The number of communities focused on COVID-19 increased by nearly 40 percent of the total number of communities.

Older patients, patients from certain provinces such as Daegu, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsangbuk, Jeju, Jeollabuk and Jeollanam, and those contracting the disease from healthcare settings had lower recovery. Conclusions: Our study adds to the very limited evidence base on potential predictors of recovery among confirmed CoVID-19 cases. We call additional research to explore the predictors of recovery and support development of policies to protect the vulnerable patient groups.","output":"Epidemiology of CoVID-19 and predictors of recovery in the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide. Clinical manifestations range from severe cases with lethal outcome to mild or asymptomatic cases. Although the proportion of infected individuals does not differ between sexes, men are more susceptible to severe COVID-19, with a higher risk of death than women. Also, men are pointed out as more lax regarding protective measures, mask wearing and vaccination. Thus, we questioned whether sex-bias may be explained by biological pathways and/or behavioral aspects or both. METHODS: Between July 2020 and July 2021, we performed an epidemiological survey including 1744 unvaccinated adult Brazilian couples, with there was at least one infected symptomatic member, who were living together during the COVID-19 infection without protective measures. Presence or absence of infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology results. Couples were divided into two groups: (1) both partners were infected (concordant couples) and (2) one partner was infected and the spouse remained asymptomatic despite the close contact with the COVID-19 symptomatic partner (discordant couples). Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed aiming to verify a differential transmission potential between genders in couples keeping contact without protective measures. RESULTS: The combination of our collected data showed that the man is the first (or the only) affected member in most cases when compared to women and that this difference may be explained by biological and behavioral factors. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed the existence of gender differences not only for susceptibility to infection and resistance to COVID-19 but also in its transmission rate.","output":"Men are the main COVID-19 transmitters: behavior or biology?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to determine the effect of repeated hot thermal stress and cold water immersion on the endocrine system of young adult men with moderate and high levels of physical activity (PA).

Each sauna session was followed by a 6-min cool-down break during which the participants were immersed in cold water (10?11C) for 1 min. Testosterone (TES), cortisol (COR), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and prolactin (PRL) levels were measured before and after the sauna bath. The participants PA levels were evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Serum COR levels decreased significantly (p < .001) from 13.61 to 9.67 g/ml during 72 min of sauna treatment. No significant changes (p >.05) were noted in the concentrations of the remaining hormones: TES increased from 4.04 to 4.24 ng/ml, DHEA-S decreased from 357.5 to 356.82 g/ml, and PRL decreased from 14.50 to 13.71 ng/ml. After sauna, a greater decrease in COR concentrations was observed in males with higher baseline COR levels, whereas only a minor decrease was noted in participants with very low baseline COR values (r =?0.673, p <.001). Repeated use of Finnish sauna induces a significant decrease in COR concentrations, but does not cause significant changes in TES, DHEA-S, or PRL levels.

The occurrence of intradialytic hypotension and intradialytic hypertension are important risk factors for death and disability during dialysis in patients with ESRD, yet their etiology remains unclear, and some studies suggest that nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play an important role in these hemodynamic alterations. For this purpose we examined the changes in NO and ET-1 levels during hemodialysis in 30 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) after arteriovenous fistula surgery. Thirty dialysis patients were divided into group I (stable blood pressure during dialysis), group II (Intradialytic hypotension) and group III (Intradialytic hypertension) according to the change of blood pressure (BP) during hemodialysis, with 10 cases in each group. BP of MHD patients were measured Pre-dialysis (Pre-D), at 1 h of dialysis (1h-D), at 2 h of dialysis (Mid-D, 2h-D), at 3 h of dialysis (3h-D), and at the end of dialysis (Post-D); and blood samples were taken from the arterial end at Pre-D, Mid-D, and Post-D to measure NO and ET-1 levels. The results of the analysis showed that as dialysis proceeded and ended, the NO levels in the three groups gradually decreased, with significant differences compared with those before dialysis (p < 0.05); the ET-1 levels in group III gradually increased, with significant differences compared with those before dialysis (p < 0.05), while the increasing trend of ET-1 levels in group I and group II was not significant. The increasing trend of MAP in group I was not significant (p > 0.05); MAP in group II showed a gradual decrease and MAP in group III showed an increasing trend, and the difference between MAP after dialysis and before dialysis was significant (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between ET-1 levels and MAP in Group III at Mid-D (r = 0.847, p = 0.002). This shows that serum ET-1 and NO levels are significantly higher than normal in MHD patients after arteriovenous endovascular fistula surgery, and both ET-1 and NO levels are changing during dialysis, and there may be a link between their changes and blood pressure changes. It is suggested that the blood pressure fluctuations that occur during dialysis in MHD patients may be related to endothelial cell dysfunction.","output":"Correlation of NO and ET-1 Levels with Blood Pressure Changes in Hemodialysis Patients after Arteriovenous Fistula Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pregnancy is a state of great susceptibility to infectious diseases, and it is not surprising that viral infections can affect pregnancy outcomes.

However, significant barriers to access exist which necessitate the development of effective, economic, and accessible brief and remote interventions. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a therapy with demonstrated acceptability and a growing evidence base for the treatment of distress in IBD populations. The present paper trialled two brief ACT interventions via randomized multiple baseline designs. Study 1 trialled a single-session ACT intervention (delivered face-to-face and lasting approximately two hours) targeting stress and experiential avoidance, respectively. Participants were seven people with an IBD diagnosis who presented with moderate to extremely severe stress (five females, two males; M age = 39.57, SD = 5.74). The findings of study 1 indicate that a single-session ACT intervention represented an insufficient dosage to reduce stress and experiential avoidance. Study 2 investigated a brief telehealth ACT intervention (delivered via a video conferencing platform and lasting approximately four hours) targeting stress and increased psychological flexibility. Participants (N = 12 people with an IBD diagnosis and mild to extremely severe stress) completed baselines lasting from 21 to 66 days before receiving a two-session ACT telehealth intervention supplemented by a workbook and phone consultation. Approximately half of participants experienced reduced stress, increased engagement in valued action, and increased functioning. Despite shortcomings such as missing data and the context of COVID-19, the present findings suggest that brief ACT interventions in this population may be effective and economic, though further research and replications are necessary.","output":"Brief and Telehealth Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Interventions for Stress in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): A Series of Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Over the past few months, the fundamental right to privacy has started to clash with the fundamental right to health in manners never previously contemplated in Brazilian legal system The covid-19 pandemic forced public administrators to seek effective and nimble solutions to the public health crisis The technology for monitoring and tracking personal data has proven to be the most effective solution to achieve this goal This article, through the study of comparative law and existing monitoring and tracking techniques, aims to propose a method of action that helps government officials to contain the spread of covid-19, without forgetting the relevance of the right to privacy","output":"A privacidade em tempos de pandemia e a escada de monitoramento e rastreio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination has been reported.

Reopening guidance emphasized polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing for residential students and social distancing measures to reduce the frequency of close interpersonal contact, and Connecticut colleges and universities used a variety of approaches to reopen campuses to residential students. OBJECTIVE: To characterize institutional reopening strategies and COVID-19 outcomes in 18 residential college and university campuses across Connecticut. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data on COVID-19 testing and cases and social contact from 18 college and university campuses in Connecticut that had residential students during the 2020-2021 academic year. EXPOSURES: Tests for COVID-19 performed per week per residential student. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cases per week per residential student and mean (95% CI) social contact per week per residential student. RESULTS: Between 235 and 4603 residential students attended the fall semester across each of 18 institutions of higher education in Connecticut, with fewer residential students at most institutions during the spring semester. In census block groups containing residence halls, the fall student move-in resulted in a 475% (95% CI, 373%-606%) increase in mean contact, and the spring move-in resulted in a 561% (95% CI, 441%-713%) increase in mean contact compared with the 7 weeks prior to move-in. The association between test frequency and case rate per residential student was complex; institutions that tested students infrequently detected few cases but failed to blunt transmission, whereas institutions that tested students more frequently detected more cases and prevented further spread. In fall 2020, each additional test per student per week was associated with a decrease of 0.0014 cases per student per week (95% CI, C0.0028 to C0.00001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that, in the era of available vaccinations and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, colleges and universities should continue to test residential students and use mitigation strategies to control on-campus COVID-19 cases.","output":"COVID-19 Testing and Case Rates and Social Contact Among Residential College Students in Connecticut During the 2020-2021 Academic Year"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As one year is approaching since the beginning of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to acknowledge the detrimental effect that it is having on mental health at the individual, societal and public health levels The current review presents the direct and indirect psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general public, as well as on vulnerable groups, including the elderly, the young, healthcare professionals, people with pre-existing mental health issues, those infected by COVID-19, homeless people and refugees Important findings are discussed in the present review, including the social stigma in older people associated with portraying COVID-19 as the disease of the elderly, and the limited psychological impact of COVID-19 in the severely mentally ill, alongside the response of the mental healthcare systems globally to this unparalleled public health crisis The important lessons to be learnt so far can help formulate individual mental health recommendations, as well as improved intervention and prevention public health strategies","output":"COVID-19 and its consequences on mental health (Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: At the beginning of a public health crisis, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to collect information about people's knowledge, worries, and behaviors to examine their influence on quality of life and to understand individual characteristics associated with these reactions. Such information could help to guide health authorities in providing informed interventions and clear communications. Objectives: To document the initial knowledge about COVID-19 and recommended health behaviors; to assess worries (ie, one's perception of the influence of the worries of others on oneself), social appraisal, and preventive behaviors, comparing respondents from areas under different movement restrictions during the first week after the outbreak; and to understand how worries, perceived risk, and preventive behaviors were associated with quality of life and individual characteristics among Italian adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This convenience sample, nonprobablistic survey study recruited adult participants with a snowballing sampling method in any Italian region during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy from February 26, 2020, to March 4, 2020. Data were analyzed from March 5 to 12, 2020. Exposures: Information was collected from citizens living in the quarantine zone (ie, red zone), area with restricted movements (ie, yellow zone), and COVID-19-free regions (ie, green zone). Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of knowledge on the virus, contagion-related worries, social appraisal, and preventive behaviors were assessed with ratings of quality of life (measured using the Short Form Health Survey). Additionally, some individual characteristics that may be associated with worries and behaviors were assessed, including demographic characteristics, personality traits (measured using Big Five Inventory-10), perceived health control (measured using the internal control measure in the Health Locus of Control scale), optimism (measured using the Revised Life Orientation Test), and the need for cognitive closure (measured using the Need for Closure Scale). Results: A total of 3109 individuals accessed the online questionnaire, and 2886 individuals responded to the questionnaire at least partially (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [13.2] years; 2203 [76.3%] women). Most participants were well informed about the virus characteristics and suggested behaviors, with a mean (SD) score of 77.4% (17.3%) correct answers. Quality of life was similar across the 3 zones (effect size = 0.02), but mental health was negatively associated with contagion-related worries (? = -0.066), social appraisal (? = -0.221), and preventive behaviors (? = -0.066) in the yellow zone (R2 = 0.108). Social appraisal was also associated with reduced psychological well-being in the green zone (? = -0.205; R2 = 0.121). In the yellow zone, higher worries were negatively correlated with emotional stability (? = -0.165; R2 = 0.047). Emotional stability was also negatively associated with perceived susceptibility in the yellow (? = -0.108; R2 = 0.040) and green (? = -0.170; R2 = 0.087) zones. Preventative behaviors and social appraisal were also associated with the need for cognitive closure in both yellow (preventive behavior: ? = 0.110; R2 = 0.023; social appraisal ? = 0.115; R2 = 0.104) and green (preventive behavior: ? = 0.174; R2 = 0.022; social appraisal: 0.261; R2 = 0.137) zones. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, people were well informed and had a relatively stable level of worries. Quality of life did not vary across the areas, although mental well-being was challenged by the social appraisal and worries related to the contagion. Increased scores for worries and concerns were associated with more cognitive rigidity and emotional instability.","output":"Knowledge, Concerns, and Behaviors of Individuals During the First Week of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Do crises bring people together or pull them apart?

Prostate cancer (PCa) may be associated with both of these risks.

No specific therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available, and urgent treatment solutions are needed. Recent studies have found several potential molecular targets, and one of the most critical proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus work machine is the Papain-like protease (Plpro). Potential inhibitors are available, and their X-ray crystallographic structures in complex with this enzyme have been determined recently. However, their activities against this enzyme are insufficient and need to be characterized and improved to be of clinical values. Therefore, in this work, by utilizing the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulation method, we achieved multiple unbinding events of Plpro inhibitors, GRL0617, and its derivates, and captured and understood the details of the unbinding pathway. We found that residues of the BL2 loop, such as Tyr268 and Gln269, play major roles in the unbinding pathways, but the most important contributing factor is the natural movements and behavior of the BL2 loop, which can control the entire process. We believe that the details found in this study can be used to refine and optimize potential inhibitors like GRL0617 and design more efficacious inhibitors as a treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Unraveling the unbinding pathways of SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like proteinase known inhibitors by Supervised Molecular Dynamics simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apalutamide, a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor, is being increasingly used for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Methods: The study incorporated five data sources, including quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. The surveys included a time series of cross-sectional online questionnaires starting on 20 March 2020, in which 300 (3100) Danish residents were drawn every three days from three population groups: the general population (N=1046), families with children (N=1032) and older people (N=1059). These data were analysed by trend analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 people aged 24-83 throughout Denmark to provide context to the survey results and to gain insight into people's experiences of the lockdown. Results: Absolute level of worries, quality of life and social isolation were relatively stable across all population groups during the lockdown, although there was a slight deterioration in older people's overall mental health. Many respondents were worried about their loved ones' health (74-76%) and the potential long-term economic consequences of the pandemic (61-66%). The qualitative interviews documented significant variation in people's experiences, suggesting that the lockdown's effect on everyday life had not been altogether negative.

The role of melatonin in pregnancy is emerging. The enzymes needed for endogenous synthesis of melatonin have been identified in the placenta, although the contribution to circulating maternal melatonin in normal pregnancy is unclear. This work aimed to determine serum levels of melatonin and its major metabolite 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (6-OHMS) in normal pregnant women during each trimester of pregnancy, and immediately after delivery. Blood samples were obtained from a cohort of healthy pregnant women during each trimester of pregnancy (n = 26), from women scheduled for elective Cesarean section (CS) before and after delivery (n = 15), along with placental samples, and from healthy non-pregnant women as controls (n = 30). Melatonin and its major metabolite, 6-OHMS, were measured using enzyme immunoassay. Levels of serum melatonin were significantly higher during pregnancy than in non-pregnant women (P = 0.025) and increased throughout pregnancy (P < 0.0001). In women undergoing CS, serum melatonin decreased markedly 24 h after delivery (P = 0.0013). Similar results were seen for serum levels of 6-OHMS, and placental tissue 6-OHMS levels correlated with week of gestation at delivery (p = 0.018). In summary, maternal melatonin production is higher in pregnant than in non-pregnant women, increases significantly during pregnancy with highest levels in the third trimester, and decreases abruptly after delivery. These results suggest that the placenta is a major source of melatonin and supports a physiological role for melatonin in pregnancy.","output":"Maternal Serum Melatonin Increases During Pregnancy and Falls Immediately After Delivery Implicating the Placenta as a Major Source of Melatonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N-heterocyclic carbenes are of central importance in many domains of chemistry such as organometallic, catalysis and bioinorganic.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis evaluated adherence and satisfaction with EPL treatment as patient-reported outcomes and their relationship with changes in laboratory and ultrasound parameters among Russian patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Data were pooled from three observational Russian studiesMANPOWER (2015C2016), LIDER 1 (2012C2013), and LIDER 2 (2013)in which EPLs were used for at least 12 weeks in the treatment of liver diseases and which measured both subjective and objective endpoints. Only patients who had NAFLD were included in this analysis. The main endpoints were to determine treatment adherence and satisfaction with 12 weeks of EPL therapy, relationship between adherence/satisfaction and changes in the laboratory and ultrasound parameters. A secondary subgroup analysis was performed to identify patients with NAFLD who responded better (or worse) to 24 weeks of adjunctive EPL treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 3384 patients were included. A total of 82.2% of patients were adherent to 12 weeks of EPL treatment; high/very high satisfaction was reported by 15.3%/65.9% of clinicians and 15.9%/64.4% of patients. There was positive correlation between patients adherence and satisfaction and significant improvement in laboratory (transaminases, lipid profile; p < 0.001) and ultrasound (steatosis, p < 0.001) parameters, and improvement in symptoms (p < 0.001) after 24 weeks of EPL. Male patients, patients with unhealthy lifestyles, and those with more comorbidities showed a better response in laboratory and ultrasound parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NAFLD treated with adjunctive EPL therapy in real-world clinical practice in Russia showed good treatment adherence and treatment satisfaction. Improvements in laboratory and ultrasound parameters, as well as dynamics of patient symptoms, were positively correlated with adherence and satisfaction.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that they both eliminated nearly all the proteins and PNAG from the matrix. By contrast, antibiotics alone had nearly no effect on biofilm biomass and the selected one (oxytetracycline-OTC) could only slightly reduce biofilm bacteria. The combination of OTC with CaG or subtilisin A led to an additive reduction (average of 2 log10 CFU/mL) of embedded biofilm bacteria on the isolates susceptible to OTC (MBC < 10 g/mL, 11/24). Moreover, these two combinations led to a reduction of the embedded biofilm bacteria higher than 3 log10 CFU/mL for 20-25% of the isolates.

MQOAHM was characterized by means of various spectroscopic tools ESI-MS, IR, 1H &13C NMR analyses. Density Functional Theory (DFT) method, B3LYP, 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was used to optimize MQOAHM molecule. The obtained theoretical structure and experimental structure were superimposed on each other, and the correlation between them was calculated. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) were created, and the energy gap between these orbitals was calculated. For analyzing intermolecular interactions, Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) and Hirshfeld Surface Analysis were studied. For a fair comparative study, the two forms of the title compound were docked together with 18 approved drugs and N3 under precisely the same conditions. The disordered molecule structure's binding scores against 7BQY were -7.0 and -6.9 kcal/mol-1 for MQOAHM (a) and MQOAHM (b), respectively. Both the forms show almost identical superimposed structures and scores indicating that the disorder of the molecule, in this study, has no obvious effect. The high binding score of the molecule was attributed to the multi-hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the receptor's active amino acid residues.

In the best situation, the discrete-event simulation of the second scenario led to a 62.3% reduction in patient waiting time.

One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities.

Materials and methods: In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken in 80 hospitalized patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through RT-PCR at tertiary care center in Jaipur. Initially all patients were evaluated for their clinical parameters and then correlated with HRCT chest after hospitalization. CT findings correlated with duration of disease to assess progress or recovery. Results: A total of 80 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adults in the fifth and sixth decade of age group with mean age of 50.40 years. There was a male preponderance (59% male and 41% female). Out of total analyzed patients, 39 patients (48.75%) were symptomatic, among them fever (79.47%), cough (74.35%), shortness of breath (36%) and sore throat (17.94%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations. A few patients (12.82%) also had other symptoms like headache, chest pain, pain abdomen, altered sensorium etc. 54% patients had some underlying co morbid disease in sample population. The most prevalent comorbidities were Diabetes mellitus (56%), Hypertension (48.83%), COPD/K-chest (12%), CAD (9.32%) and others (11.62%) like hypothyroidism, anemia, CVA etc. The lung pathological changes were evaluated by HRCT imaging and by assigning CT severity score. We found Typical COVID findings in 50% patients, Indeterminate in 11%, Atypical in 11% and 28% patients had Negative CT chest for COVID. The clinical status of patients correlated with the CT severity score, with mild cases showing score <15/25 in 45.83% patients and severe cases showing CT severity score >15/25 in 87.50% patients. The CT features varied with duration and course of disease. Proportional GGO was higher (59.37%) in early phase and it was lower (12.5%) in later stage of disease. Conclusion: The varied spectra of COVID-19 presentation included fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat etc. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD/K-Chest and CAD were found as major comorbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease, especially if multiple. HRCT chest in COVID-19 patients had a major diagnostic and prognostic importance as positive CT findings were more prominent in symptomatic patients and co-morbid patients.

We disagree with their assessment that we mis-characterised their Model Guidance, as included in the NJ Directive, in ways that undermine our conclusions. They suggest we erroneously described their model as a two-criterion allocation framework; that recognising other operant criterion reveals it 'likely mitigate[s] rather than exacerbate[s] racial disparities during triage', and allege that concerns about inequitable outcomes are 'without evidence'. We highlight two major studies robustly demonstrating why concerns about disparate outcomes are justified. We also show that White and Lo seek to retrospectively-and counterfactually-correct the version of the Model Guideline included in the NJ Directive. However, as our facsimile reproductions show, neither the alleged four-criteria form, nor other key changes, such as dropping the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, are found in the Directive. These points matter because (1) our conclusions hence stand, (2) because the public version of the Model Guidance had not been updated to reduce the risk of inequitable outcomes until June 2021 and (3) NJ's Directive still does not reflect these revisions, and, hence, represents a less equitable version, as acknowledged by its authors.

Firstly, WASH is comprised of three interrelated components, water, sanitation, and hygiene, each of which has its own subset of indicators, priorities, and infrastructure, thus making streamlined communications and impact measurement within the sector incredibly complex. Secondly, WASH is a field that bridges many sectors, and there has historically been a lack of understanding of where responsibility lies to consistently fund and execute WASH interventions, programming, and policymaking. Additionally, public health research and funding tend to favor evaluations using randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are often referred to as the \\"gold standard.\\" RCTs, like all single evaluative methods, have limitations which may not effectively capture the complexity of WASH interventions and their subsequent multi-sectoral outcomes. In some cases \\"it may be infeasible (or unethical) to randomize communities to a [WASH] intervention\\" which would prohibit the research from reaching the current \\"gold standard\\" threshold for academic rigor and subsequent funding. A new concept called \\"Transformative WASH\\" has recently emerged in the WASH sector as a result of three RCTs and calls for a \\"comprehensive package of WASH interventions\\" to effectively improve health and social outcomes. We believe that the current definition of the \\"gold standard\\" in academic research is failing the WASH sector and does not align with \\"Transformative WASH.\\" Rather, the \\"gold standard\\" should instead be a mixed methods research toolkit that utilizes Human-Centered Design (HCD) practices, and proxy methods such as \\"participatory design\\" or \\"Behavior Centered Design theory\\" to better design and evaluate WASH interventions.","output":"Failure of the \\"Gold Standard\\": The Role of a Mixed Methods Research Toolkit and Human-Centered Design in Transformative WASH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral hepatitis remains the most common cause of liver disease and a major public health problem. Here, we focus on the role of CD4 CD8 double negative T (DN T) cells involved in the mechanisms of viral persistence in hepatitis. C3H/HeJ mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) were used to display chronic viral hepatitis. DN T cells dramatically increased in MHV-3 infected mice. Adoptive transfer of DN T cells from MHV-3 infected mice led to a significant increase in mice survival. The DN T cells with production of IFN- and IL-2 are able to kill virus-specific CD8(+) T cells via the Fas/FasL dependent pathway. The delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells may lead to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis. In short, our study identified DN T cells contributing to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis in C3H/HeJ mice, which provides a rationale for modulating DN T cells for the management of viral hepatitis.","output":"CD4CCD8-T cells contribute to the persistence of viral hepatitis by striking a delicate balance in immune modulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is much data available concerning the initiation of the immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but long-term data are scarce Methods: We thus longitudinally evaluated and compared the total and neutralizing immune response of 61 patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to eight months after diagnosis by RTCPCR using several commercial assays Results: Among the 208 samples tested, the percentage of seropositivity was comparable between assays up to four months after diagnosis and then tended to be more heterogeneous between assays (p &lt;0 05) The percentage of patients with a neutralizing titer decreased from 82% before two months postdiagnosis to 57% after six months This decrease appeared to be more marked for patients under 65 years old and those not requiring hospitalization The percentage of serology reversion at 6 months was from 11% with the WANTAI total assay to over 39% with the ABBOTT IgG assay The neutralizing antibody titers decreased in parallel with the decrease of total antibody titers, with important heterogeneity between assays Conclusions: In conclusion, serological tests show equivalent sensitivity in the first months after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their performance later, postinfection, must be considered when interpreting the results","output":"Longitudinal Analysis and Comparison of Six Serological Assays up to Eight Months Post-COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The effect of dexmedetomidine on Nociception Level Index (Medasense, Israel) antinociception to reduce intra-operative opioid requirements has not been previously investigated. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine if low-dose dexmedetomidine would reduce remifentanil requirements during Nociception Level Index-guided antinociception without increasing complications associated with dexmedetomidine. DESIGN Double-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING Two university teaching hospitals in Brussels, Belgium. PATIENTS American Society of Anesthesiologists 1 and 2 patients (n = 58) undergoing maxillofacial or cervicofacial surgery under propofol--remifentanil target-controlled infusion anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS A 30 min infusion of dexmedetomidine, or equal volume of 0.9% NaCl, was infused at 1.2 g kg h immediately preceding induction and then decreased to 0.6 g kg h until 30 min before ending surgery. Nociception Level Index and frontal electroencephalogram guided the remifentanil and propofol infusions, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES The primary outcome was the remifentanil requirement. Other outcomes included the propofol requirement, cardiovascular status and postoperative outcome. RESULTS Mean  SD remifentanil (3.96  1.95 vs. 4.42  2.04 ng ml; P = 0.0024) and propofol (2.78  1.36 vs. 3.06  1.29 g ml; P = 0.0046) TCI effect site concentrations were lower in the dexmedetomidine group at 30 min postincision and remained lower throughout surgery. When remifentanil (0.133  0.085 vs. 0.198  0.086 g kg min; P = 0.0074) and propofol (5.7  2.72 vs. 7.4  2.80 mg kg h; P = 0.0228) requirements are represented as infusion rates, this effect became statistically significant at 2 h postincision. CONCLUSION In ASA 1 and 2 patients receiving Nociception Level Index-guided antinociception, dexmedetomidine decreases intra-operative remifentanil requirements. Combined frontal electroencephalogram and Nociception Level Index monitoring can measure dexmedetomidine's hypnotic and opioid-sparing effects during remifentanil-propofol target-controlled infusion anaesthesia.

The purpose of this study was to examine potential disparities in access and utilization of telehealth services during the rapid transition to virtual clinic during the coronavirus pandemic. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Outpatient visits (in-person, telephone, virtualDoxy.me) over a 7-week period at a Level I Trauma Center orthopaedic clinic. INTERVENTION: Virtual visits utilizing the Doxy.me platform. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accessing at least 1 virtual visit (Virtual) or having telephone or in-person visits only (No virtual). METHODS: All outpatient visits (in-person, telephone, virtual) during a 7-week period were tracked. At the end of the 7-week period, the electronic medical record was queried for each of the 641 patients who had a visit during this period for the following variables: gender, ethnicity, race, age, payer source, home zip code. Data were analyzed for both the total number of visits (n = 785) and the total number of unique patients (n = 641). Patients were identified as accessing at least 1 virtual visit (Virtual) or having telephone or in-person visits only (No virtual). RESULTS: Weekly totals demonstrated a rapid increase from 0 to greater than 50% virtual visits by the third week of quarantine with sustained high rates of virtual visits throughout the study period. Hispanic and Black/African American patients were able to access virtual care at similar rates to White/Caucasian patients. Patients of ages 65 to 74 and 75+ accessed virtual care at lower rates than patients 64 (P = .003). No difference was found in rates of virtual care between payer sources. A statistically significant difference was found between patients from different zip codes (P = .028).

Using three-dimensional force plates, 16 healthy subjects were tested on the same day (test-retest reliability experiment; five test-retest assessments of right leg landings), and 76 youth skiers aged 13-15 years were tested 3 times within 2 years (main experiment; average of two trials per leg each time). The test-retest reliability experiment revealed an ICC(3,1) and 95% CI of 0.86 [0.74, 0.94] for absolute DPSI assessment. The within-subject SEM of absolute DPSI was 16.30 N [13.66 N, 20.65 N], and the standardized typical error was moderate (0.39 [0.33, 0.50]). Both absolute and relative DPSI values were comparable between male and female youth competitive alpine skiers. The mean absolute DPSI in year 1 (195.7  40.9 N), year 2 (196.5  38.9 N) and year 3 (211.5  41.3 N) continuously increased (i.e., worsened) (p < 0.001).

Absolute DPSI correlated with age and biological maturation, while no such correlations were found for relative DPSI values. Our findings suggest that DPSI is a reliable and sensitive measure of dynamic postural control during DJSLLs and that relative DPSI improves annually in competitive youth skiers when accounting for body weight. Future work should consider biological maturation testing during the growth spurt, and normalizing to body weight force could be a possible solution.","output":"Prospective Study on Dynamic Postural Stability in Youth Competitive Alpine Skiers: Test-Retest Reliability and Reference Values as a Function of Sex, Age and Biological Maturation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large adhesive multimeric protein involved in hemostasis. The larger the size (or number of VWF multimers), the greater the functionality of the protein. A deficiency or defect of VWF can lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD) and cause bleeding. Conversely, an increase in VWF may create an environment that promotes thrombosis. ADAMS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), sometimes called VWF-cleaving protease, is primarily responsible for controlling the size of VWF. The most severe deficiency (<10% of normal levels) of ADAMTS-13 arises in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition characterized by the presence of ultralarge VWF and clinically resulting in enhanced risk of thrombosis. However, ADAMTS-13 deficiency may result from other pathological processes. Of relevance is the recent finding that COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with both increased levels and activity of VWF as well as generally decreased (or occasionally normal) activity levels of ADAMTS-13. Thus, in COVID-19 there is an alteration in the VWF/ADAMTS-13 axis, most often described by increased VWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio (or reduced ADAMTS-13/VWF ratio). COVID-19 is also associated with high prothrombotic risk. Thus, the imbalance of VWF and ADAMTS-13 in COVID-19 may be providing a milieu that promotes (micro)thrombosis, in a clinical picture resembling a secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in some patients. This review therefore assesses the literature on VWF, ADAMTS-13, and COVID-19. Whenever reported in COVID-19, VWF has always been identified as raised (compared with normal reference ranges or control populations). Reports have included VWF level (i.e., VWF antigen) and in some cases one or more VWF \\"activity\\" (e.g., collagen binding; platelet glycoprotein Ib [GPIb] binding, using ristocetin cofactor or more modern versions including VWF:GPIbR [recombinant] and VWF:GPIbM [mutant]). Whenever reported, ADAMTS-13 has been reported as \\"normal\\" or reduced; however, it should be recognized that \\"normal\\" levels may still identify a relative reduction in individual cases. Some reports also discuss the raised VWF/ADAMTS-13 (or reduced ADAMTS-13/VWF) ratio, but very few provide actual numerical data.","output":"Increased VWF and Decreased ADAMTS-13 in COVID-19: Creating a Milieu for (Micro)Thrombosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC) B locus has been linked to resistance to infectious diseases. We have previously provided evidence that the MHC congenic chicken lines 331/B2 and 335/B19 differ in susceptibility to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains M41 and ArkDPI in in vivo challenge experiments. Innate immune responses can be difficult to measure in vivo because they are nonspecific and can be triggered by environmental factors. In an attempt to address this issue, we used tracheal organ cultures derived from 331/B2 and 335/B19 birds to study local cytokine production after in vitro challenge with IBV M41. Interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-10 gene expression and production were assessed. Tracheal organ cultures derived from 335/B19 birds presented an increased inflammatory response compared to 331/B2. However, it was not possible to discriminate between cytokine responses in IBV-infected and phosphate-buffered saline-treated tracheal organ cultures. Because tracheal processing entails physical damage to the trachea, it is possible that the tracheal organ cultures presented high levels of inflammation regardless of the IBV challenge. To demonstrate the effects of IBV on innate immune responses in the MHC congenic chicken lines, we performed an additional in vivo experiment that focused on cytokine gene expression and production in tracheas up to 60 hr after a challenge with IBV M41. Our results corroborate previous in vivo observations that suggest that detrimental local inflammatory responses in 335/B19 birds might be associated with their susceptibility to IBV and that inflammation does not necessarily lead to the assembly of an appropriate adaptive immune response. This work provides further insight into the increased susceptibility of 335/B19 birds to infectious bronchitis.","output":"Cytokine Responses in Tracheas from Major Histocompatibility Complex Congenic Chicken Lines with Distinct Susceptibilities to Infectious Bronchitis Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies widely, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal However, there is limited information regardi","output":"Development and Validation of the HNC-LL Score for Predicting the Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents a structure preserving nonstandard finite difference scheme to analyze a susceptible-infected-treatment-recovered (SITR) dynamical model of coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) with bimodal virus transmission in susceptible population The underlying model incorporates the possible treatment measures as the emerging scenario of covid-19 vaccines Keeping in view the fact that the real time data for covid-19 is updated at discrete time steps, we propose a new structure preserving numerical scheme for the proposed model The proposed numerical scheme produces realistic solutions of the complex bi-modal SITR nonlinear model, converges unconditionally to steady states and reflects dynamical consistency with continuous sense of the model The analysis of the model reveals that the model remains stable at the steady state points The basic reproduction number Rcovid falls less than 1 when treatment rate is increased and disease will die out On the other hand, it predicts that human population may face devastating effects of pandemic if the treatment measures are not strictly implemented","output":"Numerical analysis of a bi-modal covid-19 sitr model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pemetrexed and cisplatin is a first-line standard in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer without targetable mutations.

The aim of this study was to compare efficacy, safety and tolerability of split-dose cisplatin with the standard schedule. METHODS: Patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to up to six 21-day cycles of pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 (arm A), or pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) (day 1) and cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) (day 1 + 8, arm B), followed by pemetrexed maintenance. Primary endpoint was objective response rate. Secondary objectives were overall survival, progression-free survival, time to progression, treatment compliance, toxicity profile, and quality of life. RESULTS: We enrolled 130 patients (129 evaluable). Median cycle numbers in A and B were six (1C6) and five (1C6). Dose intensities were comparable between arms. More patients in A received pemetrexed maintenance (24.2% versus 11.1%). With 16 (24.2%) in A and 19 (30.2%) patients in B achieving objective responses [odds ratio 0.74 (0.34C1.62), p = 0.55] the primary endpoint was met.

METHODS: Disease Outbreak Response (DORS) measures implemented at our center and its satellite clinics included strict infection prevention, manpower preservation, prudent resource allocation, and adaptation of standard-of-care treatments. Critical day-to-day clinical operations, number of persons screened before entry, staff temperature monitoring, and personal protection equipment stockpile were reviewed as a dashboard at daily DORS taskforce huddles. Polymerase chain reaction swab tests performed for patients and staff who met defined criteria for testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were tracked. Descriptive statistics of outpatient attendances and treatment caseloads from February 3 to May 23, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: We performed COVID-19 swabs for 80 patients and 93 staff, detecting three cancer patients with community-acquired COVID-19 infections with no nosocomial transmission. Patients who required chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery and patients who are on maintenance treatment continued to receive timely treatment without disruption. The number of intravenous chemotherapy treatments was maintained at 97.8% compared with 2019, whereas that of weekly radiotherapy treatments remained stable since December 2019. All cancer-related surgeries proceeded without delay, with a 0.3% increase in workload. Surveillance follow-ups were conducted via teleconsultation, accounting for a 30.7% decrease in total face-to-face clinic consultations. CONCLUSION: Through the coordinated efforts of a DORS taskforce, it is possible to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmissions among patients and staff without compromising on care delivery at a national cancer center.","output":"Early Outcomes of a National Cancer Center's Strategy Against COVID-19 Executed Through a Disease Outbreak Response Taskforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Oleanolic acid has been considered a good start molecule for synthetic exploitation. Thus hundreds of oleanane triterpenoids have been synthesized and patented. Also many oleanane saponins have been patented for their biological activities and possible pharmaceutical use. Areas covered: Patents reporting the biological activities of oleanane derivatives and saponins with oleanane-type aglycones were examined. Among the synthesized oleanane derivatives, the most promising seem to be 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid derivatives which interfere with many pathways involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and cell proliferation. Regarding oleanane-type saponins, several patents claiming their antiproliferative activity or their possible use as adjuvants in vaccines, were reported. Expert opinion: Despite the great number of synthesized oleanane triterpenoids, only CDDO-Me entered clinical development as a possible drug for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but a phase 3 clinical trial was terminated due to heart-related adverse effects. Further phase 2 clinical trials of CDDO-Me are in progress for the treatment of CKD and PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) patients without heart-related risk factors. Additional investigations leading to compounds with an improved activity/toxicity profile along with well-designed preclinical and clinical trials are needed.

It has posed not only a health challenge but also an economic and a linguistic burden. Linguistic burden because many efforts are being made by stakeholders to appropriately represent or codify the manifestations of the disease in unambiguous and understandable terms. Hence, one of the major platforms where COVID19 has been variously represented is the social media. This study, therefore, focuses on a multimodal analysis of the representation of the COVID-19 pandemic on two social media platforms: Facebook and WhatsApp. The study adopts Kress's social semiotic model as theoretical framework. This model explains the meaning affordances of verbal and non-verbal semiotic resources. It examines communicators' intentions and makes meanings through multiple semiotic modes. This model is adopted because it offers a sociological perspective to the interpretation of visual texts. Twenty-five semiotic resources comprising memes and flash headlines, which were purposively sourced from Facebook and WhatsApp over a period of twelve weeks between April and July 2020, were analysed in the study. The data were subjected to both pictorial and simple descriptive linguistic analysis. The study reveals that COVID-19 memes extend economic and social concerns in Nigeria. The semiotic resources expose social problems such as poverty, insecurity and inequality in the Nigerian society which pose a threat to strict adherence to safety measures;and establish the manifestation of religion and gender issues in COVID-19 debates. Furthermore, it provides informative-cum-instructional functions in the fight against COVID-19. The study suggests that the deployment of appropriate linguistic and extralinguistic codes could guarantee effective and targeted public health enlightenment on COVID-19.","output":"Language in a pandemic: A multimodal analysis of social media representation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seismometers have detected the social response to lockdown measures implemented following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in cities around the world This long-lasting pandemic has been a particular challenge in countries such as Mexico, where the informal economy constitutes most of the working population This context motivated the monitoring of the mobility of populations throughout the various phases of lockdown measures independently of people's access to the internet and mobile technology Here we use the variation of anthropogenic seismic noise in the city of Queretaro (central Mexico) recorded by a network of low-cost Raspberry Shake seismic stations to study the spatial and temporal variation of human activity in the city throughout the pandemic and during sporting events The results emphasize the importance of densifying urban seismic networks and of tracking human activities without the privacy concerns associated with mobile technology","output":"Seismic signature of the COVID-19 lockdown at the city scale: a case study with low-cost seismometers in the city of Queretaro, Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Miller Fisher syndrome, also known as Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr syndrome, is an acute peripheral neuropathy that can develop after exposure to various viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens.

The dorsal fin of a dolphin is the portion that contains individually distinctive marks and the most commonly visible when an animal surfaces to breathe. The camera captures an image of the dorsal fin whenever it is sighted and based on the number of times an image is captured, a statistical method called captureCrecapture is used to estimate the site fidelity and the size of the population in a defined area. Here, we applied these methods to study the bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) between 2017 and 2020 at the Tiber estuary (Mediterranean Sea, Rome, Italy), a polluted major river supplying organic material to the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions. We identified 347 unique individuals, with different patterns of residency (i.e., the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area): 42 were labeled resident, 73 part-time, and 232 transient. Estimating a total population size of 529 individuals and highlighting the presence of animals with a strong site-fidelity, this study suggests developing conservation plans for this vulnerable top-predator species not only focused on areas close to the Tiber River mouths but also extended to cover a broader scale of area. ABSTRACT: Periodic assessments of population status and trends to detect natural influences and human effects on coastal dolphin are often limited by lack of baseline information. Here, we investigated for the first time the site-fidelity patterns and estimated the population size of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at the Tiber River estuary (central Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian Sea, Rome, Italy) between 2017 and 2020. We used photo-identification data and site-fidelity metrics to study the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area, and captureCrecapture models to estimate the population abundance. In all, 347 unique individuals were identified. The hierarchical cluster analysis highlighted 3 clusters, labeled resident (individuals encountered at least five times, in three different months, over three distinct years; n = 42), part-time (individuals encountered at least on two occasions in a month, in at least two different years; n = 73), and transient (individuals encountered on more than one occasion, in more than 1 month, none of them in more than 1 year; n = 232), each characterized by site-fidelity metrics. Open POPAN modeling estimated a population size of 529 individuals (95% CI: 456C614), showing that the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions surrounding the Tiber River estuary represent an important, suitable habitat for bottlenose dolphins, despite their proximity to one of the major urban centers in the world (the city of Rome). Given the high number of individuals in the area and the presence of resident individuals with strong site fidelity, we suggest that conservation plans should not be focused only close to the Tiber River mouths but extended to cover a broader scale of area.","output":"Capitoline Dolphins: Residency Patterns and Abundance Estimate of Tursiops truncatus at the Tiber River Estuary (Mediterranean Sea)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) pose major threats to global health. Diagnosis accuracy and delay have been the major drivers for the upsurge of M/XDR-TB. Pyrosequencing (PSQ) is a novel, real-time DNA sequencing for rapid detection of mutations associated with M/XDR-TB. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of PSQ for M/XDR-TB. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of PubMed, Embase, Biosis, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to March 2020. We used the QUADAS\\\\2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the quality of studies, the BRMA (bivariate random\\\\effects meta-analysis) model to synthesize diagnostic accuracies, and the Rev-Man 5.4 software to perform the meta-analyses. We analyzed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval. PROSPERO Registration ID: CRD42020200817. RESULTS: The analysis included seven studies, with a total sample of 3,165. At 95% confidence interval, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of PSQ were 89.7 (CI: 83.5C93.8) and 97.8 (CI: 94.9C99.1) for Isoniazid, 94.6 (CI: 90.9C96.8) and 98.5 (CI: 96.5C99.3) for Rifampicin, 87.9 (CI: 81.2C92.4) and 98.8 (CI: 97.2C99.5) for Fluoroquinolone, 83.5 (CI: 72.8C90.5) and 99.4 (CI: 98.3C99.8) for Amikacin, 79 (CI: 67C8-87) and 97.9 (CI: 95.5C99) for Capreomycin, and 69.6 (CI: 57C79.8) and 98.2 (CI: 95.9C99.2) for Kanamycin.

Details of the infection process in the host have significant bearings on both recovery from the disease and on the correlates of the protection from the future exposures. One of these factors is the presence and titers of neutralizing Abs (NAbs) in infected people. In the current study, we set out to investigate NAbs in the recovered subjects discharged from the hospital in full health. Serum samples from a total of 49 documented consecutive COVID-19 subjects were included in the study. All the subjects were adults, and serum samples collected during the discharge were tested in viral neutralization, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and Western immunoblot tests against viral Ags. Even though a majority of the recovered subjects had raised significant NAb titers, there is a substantial number of recovered patients (10 out of 49) with no or low titers of NAbs against the virus. In these cohorts as well as in patients with high NAb titers, viral Ag binding Abs were detectable in EIA tests. Both NAb titers and EIA detectable Abs are increased in patients experiencing a severe form of the disease, and in older patients the Ab titers were heightened. The main conclusion is that the recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection is not solely dependent on high NAb titers in affected subjects, and this recovery process is probably produced by a complex interplay between many factors, including immune response, age of the subjects, and viral pathology.","output":"Discordance between Serum Neutralizing Antibody Titers and the Recovery from COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic has changed the way allied health professionals, including recreational therapists, provide care in the nursing home setting This article aims to address concerns for older adults residing in nursing homes by reviewing the history of nursing homes, analyzing the impact regulations have had on the recreational therapy profession, and offering considerations for future practice in a COVID-19 world","output":"Recreational Therapy in Nursing Homes: History, Regulations, COVID-19, and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bio-affinity chromatography is used in the study of drug-receptor interactions.

The objective of this study was to describe the structure, practice patterns, and outcomes of these vascular access teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, self-reported study of central venous access line teams in hospitals afflicted with the COVID-19 pandemic. To participate in the study, hospitals were required to meet one of the following criteria: development of a formal plan for a central venous access line team during the pandemic; implementation of a central venous access line team during the pandemic; placement of central venous access by a designated practice group during the pandemic as part of routine clinical practice; or management of an iatrogenic complication related to central venous access in a patient with COVID-19. RESULTS: Participants from 60 hospitals in 13 countries contributed data to the study. Central venous line teams were most commonly composed of vascular surgery and general surgery attending physicians and trainees. Twenty sites had 2657 lines placed by their central venous access line team or designated practice group. During that time, there were 11 (0.4%) iatrogenic complications associated with central venous access procedures performed by the line team or group at those 20 sites. Triple lumen catheters, Cordis (Santa Clara, Calif) catheters, and nontunneled hemodialysis catheters were the most common types of central venous lines placed by the teams. Eight (14%) sites reported experience in placing central venous lines in prone, ventilated patients with COVID-19. A dedicated line cart was used by 35 (59%) of the hospitals. Less than 50% (24 [41%]) of the participating sites reported managing thrombosed central lines in COVID-19 patients. Twenty-three of the sites managed 48 iatrogenic complications in patients with COVID-19 (including complications caused by providers outside of the line team or designated practice group). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a dedicated central venous access line team during a pandemic or other health care crisis is a way by which physicians trained in central venous access can contribute their expertise to a stressed health care system. A line team composed of physicians with vascular skill sets provides relief to resource-constrained intensive care unit, ward, and emergency medicine teams with a low rate of iatrogenic complications relative to historical reports. We recommend that a plan for central venous access line team implementation be in place for future health care crises.","output":"Managing central venous access during a health care crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Vaccination is an efficient public health strategy for controlling infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic.

All participants (n = 1316) were randomly assigned into one of the four groups. RESULTS: The individuals exposed to gain-framed, loss-framed, or altruism messages exhibited a higher willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine than those exposed to non-framed information. Moreover, the loss-framed information effect on vaccination willingness was more substantial than the other two messages. However, no significant difference was observed between the gain-framed and altruism messages.

Since late April 2020, reports regarding Kawasaki-like syndrome and hyperinflammatory response in children associated with COVID-19 have rapidly emerged. Till now, no certain relationship between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Kawasaki Disease (KD) has been determined, which should be explored through continuous study. Methods: In order to synthesize key findings for the objectives of this review, we searched English literature published up to November 16, 2020 using PubMed with the following keywords: Kawasaki disease 2020, Kawasaki-like disease, MIS-C, PIMS, PMIS and PIMS-TS. Key Content and Findings: Based on current researches, KD is regarded as an immune disorder induced by multiple unidentified pathogens, while MIS-C is confirmed to be associated with the infection of COVID-19. In addition, KD is popular in East Asian children under 3 years old, while MIS-C is reported more in older adolescents from Europe and North America. On the basis of multiple cohort studies, gastrointestinal symptoms, mechanical ventilation and inotropic support are more common in MIS-C. Instead, coronary arterial damage is more pronounced in KD. Moreover, the treatment regimen for MIS-C is more aggressive than KD because the cytokine storm is more violent and lasting. Conclusions: MIS-C is likely to be a distinct immunopathogenic illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 based on current studies, which could be used as a reference to help us better understand KD. In addition, MIS-C is an emerging syndrome for pediatricians, so the lack of relevant knowledge may result in under-diagnosis.

Because ASIC currents are transient, these channels appear to be ideal sensors for detecting the onset of rapid pH changes. ASICs are involved in neuronal death after ischemic stroke, and in the sensation of inflammatory pain. Ischemia and inflammation are associated with a slowly developing, long-lasting acidification. Recent studies indicate however that ASICs are unable to induce an electrical signaling activity under standard experimental conditions if pH changes are slow. In situations associated with slow and sustained pH drops such as high neuronal signaling activity and ischemia, the extracellular K+ concentration increases, and the Ca2+ concentration decreases. We hypothesized that the concomitant changes in H+, K+, and Ca2+ concentrations may allow a long-lasting ASIC-dependent induction of action potential (AP) signaling. We show that for acidification from pH7.4 to pH7.0 or 6.8 on cultured cortical neurons, the number of action potentials and the firing time increased strongly if the acidification was accompanied by a change to higher K+ and lower Ca2+ concentrations. Under these conditions, APs were also induced in neurons from ASIC1a-/- mice, in which a pH of  5.0 would be required to activate ASICs, indicating that ASIC activation was not required for the AP induction. Comparison between neurons of different ASIC genotypes indicated that the ASICs modulate the AP induction under such changed ionic conditions. Voltage-clamp measurements of the Na+ and K+ currents in cultured cortical neurons showed that the lowering of the pH inhibited Na+ and K+ currents. In contrast, the lowering of the Ca2+ together with the increase in the K+ concentration led to a hyperpolarizing shift of the activation voltage dependence of voltage-gated Na+ channels. We conclude that the ionic changes observed during high neuronal activity mediate a sustained AP induction caused by the potentiation of Na+ currents, a membrane depolarization due to the changed K+ reversal potential, the activation of ASICs, and possibly effects on other ion channels. Our study describes therefore conditions under which slow pH changes induce neuronal signaling by a mechanism involving ASICs.","output":"Changes in H+, K+, and Ca2+ Concentrations, as Observed in Seizures, Induce Action Potential Signaling in Cortical Neurons by a Mechanism That Depends Partially on Acid-Sensing Ion Channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: About 10% of individuals who contract infectious mononucleosis (IM) have symptoms 6 months later that meet criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

All of these 106 students had data at baseline (at least 6 weeks prior to the development of IM), when experiencing IM, and 6 months following IM. Of those who did not recover from IM, there were two groups: 30 were classified as ME/CFS and 18 were classified as severe ME/CFS.

We examined predictors (e.g., pre-illness variables as well as variables at onset of IM) of those who developed ME/CFS and severe ME/CFS following IM. RESULTS: From analyses using receiver operating characteristic statistics, the students who had had severe gastrointestinal symptoms of stomach pain, bloating, and an irritable bowel at baseline and who also had abnormally low levels of the immune markers IL-13 and/or IL-5 at baseline, as well as severe gastrointestinal symptoms when then contracted IM, were found to have a nearly 80% chance of having severe ME/CFS persisting six months following IM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with emerging literature that gastrointestinal distress and autonomic symptoms, along with several immune markers, may be implicated in the development of severe ME/CFS.","output":"Predictors for Developing Severe Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Following Infectious Mononucleosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase I/II coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after vaccination with BNT162b1 from a second, non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1-50 g of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those seen in serum from a cohort of individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 serum-neutralizing antibodies on day 43 were 0.7-fold (1-g dose) to 3.5-fold (50-g dose) those of the recovered individuals. Immune sera broadly neutralized pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had T helper type 1 (TH1)-skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon-?3 was produced by a large fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest that it has the potential to protect against COVID-19 through multiple beneficial mechanisms.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b1 elicits human antibody and TH1 T cell responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prospective serosurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 1,069 healthcare workers in London, UK, demonstrated that nucleocapsid antibody titers were stable and sustained for <12 weeks in 312 seropositive participants.

While indeed committed to the person, we propose that the 'special technique' of general practice exists in the form of core clinical concepts for managing uncertainty (e.g. time as a tool, therapeutic examination, safety netting and doctor as drug). Managing clinical uncertainty calls for GPs (and trainees) to operate in a 'corridor of uncertainty', a cricketing analogy where the batter is unsure whether to play a defensive or attacking shot. For students to recognise and value these concepts requires longitudinal learning and simulation. Here we describe a GP module at Brighton medical school where core concepts are 'drip fed' through small group sessions across year 4. Formative simulated surgeries constitute a 'corridor of uncertainty' where simulated patients drive students into using concepts in practice (e.g. through shared management plans). Although recognised in postgraduate training, these concepts should be taught formally within the undergraduate curriculum. Doing so helps students distinguish general practice from hospital generalism and prepares them for clinical placements in general practice. These concepts are inherently 'soft' and founded upon the GP paradigm of understanding medicine. In the eyes of the specialist, they risk being unacknowledged, misinterpreted as ignoring guidelines or, worse still, as bad medicine. Soft core concepts constitute the tools to prepare students for managing clinical uncertainty and serve to inscribe the art of medicine within the undergraduate curriculum.","output":"The undergraduate 'corridor of uncertainty': teaching core concepts for managing clinical uncertainty as the 'special technique' of general practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) typically is used with deep hypothermia for cerebral protection during aortic arch reconstructions. The impact of ACP on cerebral oxygenation and serum creatinine at a more tepid 25 C was studied in newborns and children. METHODS Between 2010 and 2014, 61 newborns and children (<5 years old) underwent aortic arch reconstruction using moderate hypothermia (25.00.9 C) with ACP and a pH-stat blood gas management strategy. These included 44% Norwood-type operations, 30% isolated arch reconstructions, and 26% arch reconstructions with other major procedures. Median patient age at surgery was 9 days (range, 3 days-4.7 years). Cerebral oxygenation (NIRS) was monitored continuously perioperatively for 120 hours. Serum creatinine was monitored daily. RESULTS Median cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross clamp times were 181 minutes (range, 82-652 minutes) and 72 minutes (range, 10-364 minutes), respectively. ACP was performed at a mean flow rate of 466 mL/min/kg for a median of 48 minutes (range, 10-123 minutes). Cerebral and somatic NIRS were preserved intraoperatively and remained at baseline postoperatively during the first 120 hours. Peak postoperative serum creatinine levels averaged 0.70.3 mg/dL for all patients. There were 4 (6.6%) discharge mortalities. Six patients (9.8%) required ECMO support. Median postoperative length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were 16 days(range, 4-104 days) and 9 days (range, 1-104 days), respectively. Two patients (3.3%) received short-term peritoneal dialysis for fluid removal, and none required hemodialysis. Three patients (4.9%) had an isolated seizure which resolved with medical therapy, and none had a neurologic deficit or stroke. CONCLUSIONS ACP at 25 C preserved perioperative cerebral oxygenation and serum creatinine for newborns and children undergoing arch reconstruction.

We present an overview of the local experience with dialysis units management and reorganization, local epidemiology and outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak in Geneva, Switzerland. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 positive outpatients on maintenance dialysis were transferred from their usual dialysis facility to the Geneva University Hospitals dialysis unit to avoid creation of new clusters of transmission. Within this unit, appropriate mitigation measures were enforced as suggested by the institutional team for prevention and control of infectious diseases. Results: From February 25 to May 18, 2020, 19 of 246 patients on maintenance dialysis were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, representing an incidence rate of 97.6 cases per 100,000 person-days. Eighteen patients were on maintenance hemodialysis and one on peritoneal dialysis. Twelve of these infections were detected during the first two weeks after mitigation strategies were enforced. Most common symptoms were fever (89%), cough (84%) and fatigue (68%). Two patients required orotracheal intubation. Six patients on maintenance hemodialysis who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all of them male, died (32%). Five deaths were COVID-19 related and one death was due to dialysis withdrawal at the patients request.

CASE REPORT We report an otherwise healthy 38-year-old man admitted to the hospital with orthostatic headache that developed 48 h after a short-haul flight during which he sustained a neck injury due to turbulence. Neurological examination, blood analysis and computed tomography scan performed at the emergency service were normal. Brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and contrast medium egress from the subarachnoid space into the epidural space at the level of C2. The patient was treated with bed rest, hydration and 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone for 5 days, with a gradual withdrawal in the following 7 days. Complete symptomatic relief was observed after 16 days, with resolution of the pathological findings on brain and spinal MRI after 1 month, except for localized pachymeningeal enhancement. Clinical relief was maintained over time until last follow-up visit 9 months later. CONCLUSION Successful conservative treatment barely exceeds one quarter of cases of SIH. The clinical benefits of steroids may result from several mechanisms of action, for example, improving brain oedema and inflammation, determining fluid retention, and facilitating reabsorption of the CSF from extradural space. Notwithstanding that epidural blood patch remains the most successful treatment for SIH, future studies should explore the effectiveness of steroids as first-line therapy in addition to the most commonly suggested measures of bed rest and hydration.","output":"First-line steroid treatment for spontaneous intracranial hypotension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Switzerland responded to the first COVID\\\\19 wave fairly successfully by employing both public health and economic measures.

We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14(++) monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14(++)IL1(+) monocytes in the ERS. CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the na?ve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1 and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.

Methods This retrospective observational study included 117 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital between October 01, 2020, and January 31, 2021. We measured the serum 25(OH)D levels using blood specimens collected within 5 days of hospital admission using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results There were 21 (17.9%), 73 (62.4%), 19 (16.2%) and 4 (3.4%) patients with severe deficiency (<10 ng/mL), deficiency (10C<20 ng/mL), insufficiency (20C<30 ng/mL), and sufficiency (30 ng/mL) of vitamin D, respectively. In univariate logistic regression analyses, lower serum 25(OH)D levels [odds ratio (OR) 1.18 per 1 ng/mL decrease, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04C1.33, p = 0.007] were significantly associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death.

Instillation of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a positive-strand RNA virus) into the CNS of mice results in acute encephalitis followed by a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease. Antibody-mediated blocking of either IL-23 (anti-IL-23p19) or IL-12 and IL-23 (anti-IL-12/23p40) signaling did not mute T-cell trafficking into the CNS or antiviral effector responses and mice were able to control viral replication within the brain. Therapeutic administration of either anti-IL-23p19 or anti-IL-12/23p40 to mice with viral-induced demyelination did not attenuate T-cell or macrophage infiltration into the CNS nor improve clinical disease or diminish white matter damage. In contrast, treatment of mice with anti-IL-12/23p40 or anti-IL-23p19 resulted in inhibition of the autoimmune model of demyelination, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These data indicate that (1) IL-12 and IL-23 signaling are dispensable in generating a protective T-cell response following CNS infection with MHV, and (2) IL-12 and IL-23 do not contribute to demyelination in a model independent of autoimmune T-cell-mediated pathology. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of IL-12 and/or IL-23 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases may offer unique advantages by reducing disease severity without muting protective responses following viral infection.","output":"Generation of a protective T-cell response following coronavirus infection of the central nervous system is not dependent on IL-12/23 signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) which spreads through contact with an infected person has already brought a significant change in the worlds economy and human misery It has made everything so uncertain globally The crude oil war between two biggest exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia has also added fuel to fire All big investment decisions are on a halt due to this uncertain situation around the globe Not only the finance sectors are suffering but human life is at great risk which proves health is more important than wealth However, biodiversity is blooming which can help people realize how important mother nature is for all of us which may result in new sustainable development ideas In this crucial situation, India is a developing country, and has a very big opportunity at its doors to finally take the ultimate Make in India strategy at work If this strategy is handled nicely during this time it would help to create more jobs for the people of the country for now and for the future as well which will make it easier to recover from this pandemic This pandemic can be a big lesson in the country about how much they are dependent on China and other countries Many countries who earlier were dependent on China for various goods are now searching for other sources and India can take advantage of this moment very well if it takes actions accordingly Technology has also played a crucial rule Machine Learning models are used to track and efficiently deal with the spread of the virus ? 2021 IEEE","output":"The economic and technical factors during coronavirus pandemic in affected countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of flow-diversion to treat ophthalmic segment aneurysms (OSA) has not been well evaluated.

Here we propose a data-driven framework to quantify the regional resilience to such shocks of primary and secondary care in Austria via an agent-based model.

This allows us to measure regional resilience indicators describing how many physicians can be removed from a certain area before individual patients won't be treated anymore. We find that such tipping points do indeed exist and that regions and medical specialties differ substantially in their resilience. These systemic differences can be related to indicators for individual physicians by quantifying how much their hypothetical removal would stress the system (risk score) or how much of the stress from the removal of other physicians they would be able to absorb (benefit score).

MAIN TEXT: Microalgae can usefully provide many of the required vitamins in humans, more than terrestrial plants, for instance. Indeed, vitamins D and K, little present in many plants or fruits, are instead available from microalgae.

This virus originated in Wuhan City, China, and became the cause of a multiwave pandemic that has killed 3.46 million people worldwide as of May 22, 2021. The havoc intensified with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7; Alpha, B.1.351; Beta, P.1; Gamma, B.1.617; Delta, B.1.617.2; Delta-plus, B.1.525; Eta, and B.1.429; Epsilon etc.) due to mutations generated during replication. More variants may emerge to cause additional pandemic waves. The most promising approach for combating viruses and their emerging variants lies in prophylactic vaccines. Several vaccine candidates are being developed using various platforms, including nucleic acids, live attenuated virus, inactivated virus, viral vectors, and protein-based subunit vaccines. In this unprecedented time, 12 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been phased in following WHO approval, 184 are in the preclinical stage, and 100 are in the clinical development process. Many of them are directed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein (S) to inhibit viral entry through the ACE-2 receptor of host cells. Inactivated vaccines, to the contrary, provide a wide range of viral antigens for immune activation. Being an intracellular pathogen, the cytotoxic CD8(+) T Cell (CTL) response remains crucial for all viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be explored in detail. In this review, we try to describe and compare approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that are currently being distributed either after phase III clinical trials or for emergency use. We discuss immune responses induced by various candidate vaccine formulations; their benefits, potential limitations, and effectiveness against variants; future challenges, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); and vaccine safety issues and their possible resolutions. Most of the current vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2 are showing either promising or compromised efficacy against new variants. Multiple antigen-based vaccines (multivariant vaccines) should be developed on different platforms to tackle future variants. Alternatively, recombinant BCG, containing SARS-CoV-2 multiple antigens, as a live attenuated vaccine should be explored for long-term protection. Irrespective of their efficacy, all vaccines are efficient in providing protection from disease severity.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if this correlation could also be found in SPF pigs in which PMWS was experimentally reproduced and in naturally PMWS-affected pigs. RESULTS: When looking at the total anti-PCV2 antibody titres, PMWS-affected and healthy animals seroconverted at the same time point, and titres in PMWS-affected animals were only slightly lower compared to those in healthy animals. In healthy animals, the evolution of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies coincided with that of total antibodies. In PMWS-affected animals, neutralizing antibodies could either not be found (sera from field studies) or were detected in low titres between 7 and 14 DPI only (sera from experimentally inoculated SPF pigs). Differences were also found in the evolution of specific antibody isotypes titres against PCV2. In healthy pigs, IgM antibodies persisted until the end of the study, whereas in PMWS-affected pigs they quickly decreased or remained present at low titres. The mean titres of other antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2 and IgA), were slightly lower in PMWS-affected pigs compared to their healthy group mates at the end of each study. CONCLUSION: This study describes important differences in the development of the humoral immune response between pigs that get subclinically infected with PCV2 and pigs that experience a high level of PCV2-replication which in 3 of 4 experiments led to the development of PMWS.

Levels were significantly lower in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients (Ct: 22.1; IQR: 18.4-22.1), in children <2 years of age (Ct: 20.6; IQR: 17.3-27.3) and when sample collection was <4 days after symptom onset (Ct: 21.1; IQR: 18.1-27.5). In children aged >2 years, Ct values were significantly lower in symptomatic (Ct: 22.6; IQR: 18.7-29.3) than asymptomatic (Ct: 31.2; IQR: 24.5-33.3) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Children younger than 2 years with COVID-19 have lower values of Ct-as a proxy for higher viral load-than older children. Symptomatic children over 2 years of age had lower Ct values compared with asymptomatic children.","output":"COVID-19 in Children: Correlation Between Epidemiologic, Clinical Characteristics, and RT-qPCR Cycle Threshold Values"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has already infected millions of individuals and has resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands worldwide. Based on clinical features, pathology, and the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders induced by this and other highly homogenous coronaviruses, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response contribute to COVID-19 pathology; these are caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression triggering acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and often death. We and others have reported melatonin to be an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule with a high safety profile. It is effective in critical care patients by reducing their vascular permeability and anxiety, inducing sedation, and improving their quality of sleep. As melatonin shows no harmful adverse effects in humans, it is imperative to introduce this indoleamine into clinical trials where it might be beneficial for better clinical outcomes as an adjuvant treatment of COVID-19-infected patients. Herein, we strongly encourage health care professionals to test the potential of melatonin for targeting the COVID-19 pandemic.

Millions of Americans annually visit either a dental or primary care provider, but not always both as recommended, even though multiple health co-morbidities can manifest in and impact oral health. Offering multidisciplinary health services in a dental setting has potential to reach unserved populations. DESCRIPTION: Innovative partnerships between schools of dentistry, pharmacy, social work, and nursing were designed to promote integrated service delivery in the emerging workforce and the purposeful inclusion of oral health in integrated care settings. DISCUSSION: Oral complications of systemic disease and systemic complications of oral disease impose significant burdens on populations and the public health infrastructure in terms of economic cost, disability, and mortality. Exacerbated by the lack of integrated services, intersecting social, economic, and health issues perpetuate disparities and negative health outcomes.

In this time of crisis and urgency, the only hope comes from new candidate vaccines and potential antivirals. However, formulating new vaccines and synthesizing new antivirals is a laborious task. Therefore, considering the high infection rate and mortality due to COVID-19, utilization of previous information, and repurposing of existing drugs against valid viral targets has emerged as a novel drug discovery approach in this challenging time. The transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses (CoVs) which facilitates virus entry into the host cells, exists as homotrimeric form and is covered with N-linked glycans. S glycoprotein is known as the main target of antibodies having neutralizing potency and is also considered as an attractive target for therapeutic or vaccine development. Similarly, targeting of N-linked glycans of S glycoprotein envelop of CoV via carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) could serve as an attractive therapeutic approach for developing novel antivirals. CBAs from natural sources like lectins from plants, marine algae and prokaryotes and lectin mimics like Pradimicin-A (PRM-A) have shown antiviral activities against CoV and other enveloped viruses. However, the potential use of CBAs specifically lectins was limited due to unfavorable responses like immunogenicity, mitogenicity, hemagglutination, inflammatory activity, cellular toxicity, etc. Here, we have reviewed the current scenario of CBAs as antivirals against CoVs, presented strategies to improve the efficacy of CBAs against CoVs; and studied the molecular interactions between CBAs (lectins and PRM-A) with Man9 by molecular docking for potential repurposing against CoVs in general and the SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","output":"Carbohydrate-Binding Agents: Potential of Repurposing for COVID-19 Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the number of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer survivors is projected to increase in the coming years, there are currently no survivorship care models that address the specific and growing needs of this population.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect on mortality of a supervised early PR program, initiated during or within 4 weeks after hospitalization with an acute exacerbation of COPD compared with usual post-exacerbation care or no PR program. Secondary outcomes were days in hospital, COPD related readmissions, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity (walking distance), activities of daily living (ADL), fall risk and drop-out rate. METHODS We identified randomized trials through a systematic search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cocharne Library and other sources through October 2017. Risk of bias was assessed regarding randomization, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS We included 13 randomized trials (801 participants). Our meta-analyses showed a clinically relevant reduction in mortality after early PR (4 trials, 319 patients; RR = 0.58 (95% CI: [0.35 to 0.98])) and at the longest follow-up (3 trials, 127 patients; RR = 0.55 (95% CI: [0.12 to 2.57])). Early PR reduced number of days in hospital by 4.27 days (1 trial, 180 patients; 95% CI: [- 6.85 to - 1.69]) and hospital readmissions (6 trials, 319 patients; RR = 0.47 (95% CI: [0.29 to 0.75])). Moreover, early PR improved HRQoL and walking distance, and did not affect drop-out rate. Several of the trials had unclear risk of bias in regard to the randomization and blinding, for some outcome there was also a lack of power. CONCLUSION Moderate quality of evidence showed reductions in mortality, number of days in hospital and number of readmissions after early PR in patients hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation. Long-term effects on mortality were not statistically significant, but improvements in HRQoL and exercise capacity appeared to be maintained for at least 12 months. Therefore, we recommend early supervised PR to patients with COPD-related exacerbations. PR should be initiated during hospital admission or within 4 weeks after hospital discharge.","output":"Lower mortality after early supervised pulmonary rehabilitation following COPD-exacerbations: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact globally. Not much is fully understood about this disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears to be the commonest complication among patients with COVID-19. However, venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears to be a common complication among patients with COVID-19 even with adequate anticoagulation during hospitalization. VTE may confer a poor outcome on its own or may exacerbate other common complications such as ARDS or cardiac injury. There are several diagnostic dilemmas with regards confirming VTE among patients with COVID-19 as there is a move to reduce the transfer of patients for angiographic studies or even venous Doppler ultrasonography because of the high transmissibility SARS-CoV-2. There is also the risk of worsening ARDS following fluid administration to prevent contrast nephropathy after angiographic studies.

Various studies have evaluated congestion measures, however, none have identified and demonstrated a best-practice congestion metric that can compare congestion between road segments, networks, and city zones. Furthermore, no studies have proven the link between a congestion metric and traffic flow, despite suggestion by Lomax et al. in their seminal 1997 Quantifying Congestion report that an appropriate congestion metric should vary predictably according to flow. This paper aims to address these gaps in traffic congestion literature. Various congestion measures are evaluated according to standard criteria. Although this process has been followed before, this paper adds a unique criterion that requires congestion to be quantifiable from commercial floating car data (FCD), due to its extensive availability and relative affordability. The most appropriate congestion measure is evaluated to be the speed reduction index (SRI). The application of the SRI to describe spatiotemporal congestion patterns and flow dependency is then demonstrated in a case-study analysis in South Africa. This analysis exploited traffic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (particularly, the stepwise increase from severely reduced traffic flows as lockdown levels eased), to evaluate SRI. The wide range of flows enabled an unprecedented regression analysis comparing congestion level and flow. The results of the regression analysis are highly significant (p < 0.001) indicating that SRI-based congestion measurement tracks flow variation. This study further identified that unidirectional congestion, quantified by the SRI, is impacted by high bi-directional flow along arterials.

We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well.","output":"Priming COVID-19 salience increases prejudice and discriminatory intent against Asians and Hispanics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the outbreak of COVID-19 has become a severe worldwide pandemic, every country fights against the spread of this deadly disease with incredible efforts.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. METHODS: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. MEASUREMENTS: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. MAIN RESULTS: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. CONCLUSION: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios.","output":"Probabilistic analysis of COVID-19 patients individual length of stay in Swiss intensive care units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nurses and nursing students are increasingly vulnerable to workplace violence, both verbal and physical, as health care settings and clients cope with unprecedented challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, clinical learning opportunities for nursing students have been curtailed by public health restrictions and limited capacity. While virtual simulations have been promoted as an alternative to clinical hours, their effectiveness as an educational intervention on workplace violence has yet to be assessed. PURPOSE: The authors sought to evaluate a virtual, simulated code white-a set of organized responses to a client, visitor, or staff member exhibiting the potential for violence-involving 4th year undergraduate nursing students, randomly sorted into an intervention group and a control group. METHODS: Pre and post test measures of knowledge and attitudes about mental health, workplace violence and virtual simulation were collected, as well as qualitative data from focus groups. FINDINGS: While the sample size (n = 24) was insufficient to detect meaningful differences between the intervention and control groups, descriptive statistics and focus group data revealed significant gaps in participants' knowledge around managing workplace violence. Participants rated the virtual simulation highly for its realism and the opportunity to experience working in a virtual environment, while they felt the preamble and debrief were too short.

The current research efforts developed few of these models and validates its accuracy for selected countries. It becomes difficult to draw an objective comparison between the performance of these models at a global scale. This is because, the time series trend for the infection differs between the countries depending on the strategies adopted by the healthcare organizations to decrease the spread. Consequently, it is important to develop a tailored model for a country that allows healthcare organizations to better judge the effect of the undertaken precautionary measures, and provision more efficiently the needed resources to face this disease.

In the prophylaxis study a total of 57 volunteers received lozenges of either zinc gluconate (23 mg) (29 volunteers) or matched placebo (28 volunteers) every 2 h while awake during a period of four and a half days. They were challenged with 10(2) tissue culture infecting dose (TCID(50)) of human rhinovirus 2 (HRV-2) on the second day of medication, and were monitored daily for symptoms and signs of colds and laboratory evidence of infection. Zinc reduced the total mean clinical score from 8.2 in the placebo group to 5.7 and the reduction of the mean clinical score was statistically significant on the second day after virus challenge. In the therapeutic study 69 volunteers were inoculated with 10(2) TCID(50) of HRV-2 and those who developed cold symptoms were randomly allocated to receive either zinc gluconate lozenges (six volunteers) or matched placebo lozenges (six volunteers) every two hours they were awake for six days. Treatment of colds with zinc reduced the mean daily clinical score and this was statistically significant on the fourth and fifth day of medication. Similarly, medication also reduced the mean daily nasal secretion weight and total tissue count and these reductions were statistically significant on days two and six for nasal secretion weights and days four to six of medication for tissue counts when compared with placebo. There were also statistically significant reductions in the mean total nasal secretion weights and total tissue counts. Zinc, however, had no significant effect on the rate or amount of virus excreted by volunteers.

P9R can significantly protect mice from lethal challenge by A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and shows low possibility to cause drug-resistant virus. Mechanistic studies indicate that the antiviral activity of P9R depends on the direct binding to viruses and the inhibition of virus-host endosomal acidification, which provides a proof of concept that virus-binding alkaline peptides can broadly inhibit pH-dependent viruses. These results suggest that the dual-functional virus- and host-targeting P9R can be a promising candidate for combating pH-dependent respiratory viruses.","output":"A broad-spectrum virus- and host-targeting peptide against respiratory viruses including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has generated a global health crisis and more than a million deaths so far.

The review was conducted using the following online databases: Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed, and the Boolean operators AND and OR to combine the following keywords: air sampler, coronavirus, COVID-19, indoor, and SARS-CoV-2. This review included 25 published papers reporting sampling and detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments. Most of the papers focused on sampling and analysis of viruses in aerosols present in contaminated areas and potential transmission to adjacent areas. Negative results were found in 10 studies, while 15 papers showed positive results in at least one sample. Overall, papers report several sampling devices and methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, using different approaches for distance, height from the floor, flow rates, and sampled air volumes. Regarding the efficacy of each mechanism as measured by the percentage of investigations with positive samples, the literature review indicates that solid impactors are more effective than liquid impactors, or filters, and the combination of various methods may be recommended. As a final remark, determining the sampling method is not a trivial task, as the samplers and the environment influence the presence and viability of viruses in the samples, and thus a case-by-case assessment is required for the selection of sampling systems.","output":"SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review of indoor air sampling for virus detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers of youth with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a qualitative research based on an open-ended questionnaire that was conducted through an online platform for primary caregivers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Participants were asked to describe the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their caring for youth with diabetes, as well as the emotional burden that it has brought to their personal lives. Interview responses were coded and stratified by youth age: &#8804; 12 years (youth aged &#8804; 12 years) and between 13 and 18 years (youth aged > 12 years). The connections between the responses were identified based on either positive or negative content of the reported experience.

This disease is called COVID-19 and already killed over 1 million people worldwide. The clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, dizziness, generalized weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea. Unfortunately, so far, there is no validated vaccine, and its management consists mainly of supportive care. Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are highly prevalent in patients suffering from severe COVID-19. In fact, a prothrombotic state seems to be present in most fatal cases of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, causing immune-mediated tissue damage, disruption of the endothelial barrier, and uncontrolled thrombogenesis. Thrombin is the key regulator of coagulation and fibrin formation. In severe COVID-19, a dysfunctional of physiological anticoagulant mechanisms leads to a progressive increase of thrombin activity, which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome development and a poor prognosis. Protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR1) is the main thrombin receptor and may represent an essential link between coagulation and inflammation in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the potential role of PAR1 inhibition and regulation in COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Protease-activated receptor 1 as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim To investigate knowledge, attitudes and practice towards COVID-19 among selected population.

In this review we revisited clinical studies in CD patients combined with in vitro and in vivo experiments, presenting three main sections: an overview of epidemiological, economic, and clinical aspects of CD and the need for new biomarkers and treatment; a brief panorama of TGF- roles and its intracellular signaling pathways, and an update of what is known about TGF- and Chagas disease. In in vitro assays, TGF- increases during T. cruzi infection and modulates heart cells invasion by the parasite fostering its intracellular parasite cycle. TGF- modulates host immune response and inflammation, increases heart fibrosis, stimulates remodeling, and slows heart conduction via gap junction modulation. TGF- signaling inhibitors reverts these effects opening a promising therapeutic approach in pre-clinical studies. CD patients with higher TGF-1 serum level show a worse clinical outcome, implicating a predictive value of serum TGF- as a surrogate biomarker of clinical relevance. Moreover, pre-clinical studies in chronic T. cruzi infected mice proved that inhibition of TGF- pathway improved several cardiac electric parameters, reversed the loss of connexin-43 enriched intercellular plaques, reduced fibrosis of the cardiac tissue, restored GATA-6 and Tbox-5 transcription, supporting cardiac recovery. Finally, TGF- polymorphisms indicate that CD immunogenetics is at the base of this phenomenon. We searched in a Brazilian population five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (-800 G>A rs1800468, -509 C>T rs1800469, +10 T>C rs1800470, +25 G>C rs1800471, and +263 C>T rs1800472), showing that CD patients frequently express the TGF-1 gene genotypes CT and TT at position -509, as compared to noninfected persons; similar results were observed with genotypes TC and CC at codon +10 of the TGF-1 gene, leading to the conclusion that 509 C>T and +10 T>C TGF-1 polymorphisms are associated with Chagas disease susceptibility.

METHODS: ENSEMBLE PLUS is a randomized, double-blind substudy to the single-arm ENSEMBLE study (NCT03085810). In ENSEMBLE, patients with early stage relapsing-remitting MS received OCR 600 mg initially as two 300 mg IV infusions 2 weeks apart and subsequently as a single 3.5-hour 600 mg infusion every 24 weeks for 192 weeks. In ENSEMBLE PLUS, OCR 600 mg administered over the approved 3.5-hour infusion time (conventional duration) is compared with a 2-hour infusion (shorter duration). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with infusion-related reactions (IRRs) after the first randomized dose (assessed during and up to 24 hours postinfusion). RESULTS: From November 1, 2018, to September 27, 2019, 580 patients were randomized 1:1 to the conventional or shorter infusion group. After the first randomized dose, 67 of 291 patients (23.1%) in the conventional and 71 of 289 patients (24.6%) in the shorter infusion group experienced IRRs. Most IRRs were mild or moderate in both groups; one patient in each group experienced a severe IRR, and in both groups, 98.6% (136 of 138) of all IRRs resolved without sequelae. No IRRs were serious, life-threatening, or fatal. No IRR-related discontinuation occurred. During the first randomized dose, 14 of 291 (4.8%) and 25 of 289 (8.7%) patients in the conventional and shorter infusion groups, respectively, had IRRs leading to infusion slowing/interruption. CONCLUSION: The frequency and severity of IRRs were similar between conventional and shorter OCR infusions. Shortening the infusion time to 2 hours reduces the total infusion site stay time and lessens the overall patient and site staff burden.

PRS partitions the data into subsets immunologically dissimilar from one another, although internally similar. RESULTS: Regardless of the angle considered, the classic analysis ?which measured the percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils? did not distinguish outcomes (A). In contrast, non-overlapping patterns generated by the PRS differentiated 3 (left, vertical, and right) groups of patients (B). One subset was only composed of survivors (B). The remaining subsets included the highest oxygenation requirements (B). At least two immunologically interpretable, multi-cellular indicators distinguished the 3 data subsets with statistically significant differences (C, p 0.05). Survivors (the left subset) showed lower N/L and/or higher M/L ratios than non-survivors (the vertical subset, C).Therefore, PRS partitioned the data into subsets that displayed both biological and significant differences.

The pattern of infection in the population was investigated using a serial cross-sectional serological study over a 25-month period, with blood sampled from 521 individuals over six sampling sessions. Antibody titres to the virus were determined by virus neutralisation test. In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, we observed that seroprevalence gradually increased over the two years suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. Our results suggested age, pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titres were significantly higher in females than males, with the highest titres occurring in pregnant animals. Temporal variation in antibody titres suggests that herd immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings support an endemic infection pattern of henipaviruses in bat populations suggesting their infection dynamics may differ significantly from the acute, self limiting episodic pattern observed with related viruses (e.g. measles virus, phocine distemper virus, rinderpest virus) hence requiring a much smaller critical host population size to sustain the virus.

One such strategy is the expansion of routine data collection on patient Race, Ethnicity, and Language (REAL) within electronic health records (EHRs). Although previous research has examined the general views of providers and patients on REAL data, few studies consider health care workers' perceptions of this data collection directly at the point of care, including how workers understand REAL data in relation to health equity. OBJECTIVE This qualitative study examines a large integrated delivery system's implementation of REAL data collection, focusing on health care workers' understanding of REAL and its impact on data's integration within EHRs. RESULTS Providers, staff, and administrators expressed apprehension over REAL data collection due to the following: (1) disagreement over data's significance, including the expected purpose of collecting REAL items; (2) perceived barriers to data retrieval, such as the lack of standardization across providers and national tensions over race and immigration; and (3) uncertainty regarding data's use (clinical decision making vs. system research) and dissemination (with whom the data may be shared; eg, public agencies, other providers, and insurers). CONCLUSION Emerging racial disparities associated with COVID-19 highlight the high stakes of REAL data collection. However, numerous barriers to health equity remain. Health care workers need greater institutional support for REAL data and related EHR initiatives.

METHODS The transport of eight -blockers across excised sclera/sclera-choroid-RPE (SCRPE) of albino rabbit, pigmented rabbit, human, porcine, and bovine eyes was determined over 6 hours. The ex vivo transscleral -blocker transport to the vitreous at the end of 6 hours was determined in euthanatized, pigmented Brown Norway rats. The thicknesses of the sclera and SCRPE and the melanin content in choroid-RPE (CRPE) were measured to determine whether species differences in drug transport can be explained on this basis. RESULTS Solute lipophilicity inversely correlated with the SCRPE cumulative percentage of transport in all species (R(2)  0.80). The CRPE impeded the SCRPE transport of all -blockers (51%-64% resistance in the rabbits; 84%-99.8% in the bovine and porcine eyes) more than the sclera, with the impedance increasing with lipophilicity. SCRPE transport followed the trend albino rabbit > pigmented rabbit > human > porcine > bovine, and a cross-species comparison showed good Spearman's rho correlation (R(2)  0.85). Bovine (R(2) = 0.84), porcine (R(2) = 0.84), and human (R(2) = 0.71) SCRPE transport was more predictive than that in the rabbit models (R(2) = 0.60-0.61) of transscleral solute transport to the vitreous in rats. The CRPE concentrations were higher in pigmented rabbits than in albino rabbits. The melanin content of the CRPE exhibited the trend albino rabbit ? pigmented rabbit < porcine  bovine < rat. Normalization to scleral thickness abolished the species differences in scleral transport. Normalization to SCRPE thickness and melanin content significantly reduced species differences in SCRPE transport. CONCLUSIONS Owing to the presence of pigment and drug binding, choroid-RPE is the principal barrier to transscleral -blocker transport, with the barrier being more significant for lipophilic -blockers. Although different in magnitude between species, sclera/SCRPE transport can be correlated between species. Tissue thickness accounts for the species differences in scleral transport. Differences in tissue thickness and melanin content largely account for the species differences in SCRPE transport.","output":"Sclera-choroid-RPE transport of eight -blockers in human, bovine, porcine, rabbit, and rat models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To present a single-centre experience on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the assessment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-high risk of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).

This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. METHODS The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science were utilised in the review. The search included studies published from 1995 up to and including February 6, 2018 and were limited to those in the English language. Each paper was assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion. Data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers using the standardized qualitative data extraction tool from JBI. The qualitative research findings were pooled using JBI methodology. The JBI process of meta-aggregation was used to identify categories and synthesized findings. RESULTS Based on the thematic findings from the 21 studies, three synthesized findings were extracted from 10 categories and 83 findings: 1) the complexity of individual sexual experiences, 2) the clinical constructs of sexuality and 3) family and partner involvement. CONCLUSIONS Having fulfilling and satisfying sexual and relationship experiences is a fundamental human right that can enhance an individual's quality of life. Being aware of the potential stresses and challenges that having a SMI can have on a relationship and involving partners in the treatment, may help to promote intimacy and recovery. Practitioners can use these findings to guide future policy, education and developments in practice. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions that target the identified barriers and help people with SMI to fulfil their unmet sexuality and intimacy needs.","output":"Sexuality and intimacy among people with serious mental illness: a qualitative systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beyond the complex logistical task of prioritizing, distributing and safely storing millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, state and local governments must simultaneously devise and carry out transparent plans that center equity and overcome the barriers to vaccination facing minority communities. Using insights gleaned from four focus groups conducted with health care and social service professionals serving minority communities in New York State as well as from existing research on vaccination, our results emphasize that vaccine hesitancy and access barriersparticularly within minority communitiespose significant hurdles to achieving widespread uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. Overcoming barriers requires community-engaged campaigns that acknowledge and address the historical injustices and on-going inequities that drive distrust within communities of color, emphasize understandable and culturally appropriate messages that directly address people's concerns about vaccine safety and access, and tap existing community infrastructure to make full use of trusted voices to deliver timely and accurate information about vaccines. Given emerging data and changing conditions, campaigns must also be self-reflective and adaptive, assessing progress and outcomes and reevaluating strategies as needed.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a technology-enabled, dynamically adaptive protocol that can provide the accurate information needed to inform specific remedies for immune toxic effects in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open-label cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary referral center from September 6, 2019, to September 3, 2020. The median follow-up duration was 63 (interquartile range, 35.5-122) days. Fifty patients with genitourinary cancers treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: A fit-for-purpose electronic platform was developed to enable active patient and care team participation. A smartphone application downloaded onto patients personal mobile devices prompted them to report their symptoms at least 3 times per week. The set of symptoms and associated queries were paired with alert thresholds for symptoms requiring clinical action. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of this interim analysis was feasibility, as measured by patient and care team adherence, and lack of increase in care team staffing. Operating characteristics were estimated for each symptom alert and used to dynamically adapt the alert thresholds to ensure sensitivity while reducing unnecessary alerts. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients enrolled, 47 had at least 1 follow-up visit and were included in the analysis. Median age was 65 years (range, 37-86), 39 patients (83%) were men, and 39 patients (83%) had metastatic cancer, with the most common being urothelial cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma (22 [47%] patients each). After initial onboarding, no further care team training or additional care team staffing was required. Patients had a median study adherence rate of 74% (interquartile range, 60%-86%) and 73% of automated alerts were reviewed within 3 days by the clinic team. Symptoms with the highest positive predictive value for adverse events requiring acute intervention included dizziness (21%), nausea/vomiting (26%), and shortness of breath (14%). The symptoms most likely to result in unnecessary alerts were arthralgia and myalgia, fatigue, and cough. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest an acceptable and fiscally sound method can be developed to create a dynamic learning system to detect and manage immune-related toxic effects.","output":"Evaluation of Technology-Enabled Monitoring of Patient-Reported Outcomes to Detect and Treat Toxic Effects Linked to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Germany's Sartorius Ag has been working with organisations in China C supporting their work in developing a coronavirus vaccine.","output":"Sartorius supports coronavirus vaccine research in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statement of purposePreventing opioid misuse and opioid use disorder (OUD) is necessary given the opioid epidemic Prevention programs for adolescents/young adults are needed to alter risk trajectories We developed interventions using telemedicine (synchronous video conference) and a patient portal-like messaging system to address risk factors for opioid misuse/OUD among young Emergency Department (ED) patients Our presentation describes these promising interventions and their feasibility and acceptability Methods/ApproachIn Spring 2020, N = 40 ED patients ages 16C30 who were at risk for opioid misuse/OUD enrolled in a pilot trial involving screening/baseline assessments, motivational interviewing-based remote interventions (baseline telemedicine brief intervention [BI], 1-month of portal messaging), and a 1-month follow-up Before COVID-19, N = 10 enrolled in the ED (in-person cohort: IPC);during COVID-19, N = 30 recent ED patients enrolled via phone recruitment (remote cohort: RC) Feasibility data are presented by cohort;acceptability data are combined ResultsAmong the N=40, the sample had a mean age of 22 9 years Gender was: 70% female, 5% non-conforming, 25% male Race was: 75% White, 15% Black/African American, and 10% other racial identities;17 5% were Hispanic/Latinx Regarding feasibility, eligibility rates were similar (IPC: 17%, RC: 15%);consenting rates differed (IPC: 100%, RC: 56%), likely due to the RCs telephone approach Portal engagement increased from the IPC (60%) to the RC (93%), possibly due to addressing technical difficulties and IPC user feedback BI and portal satisfaction were high (M = 9 3 on a 1C10 scale and M = 8 5, respectively) Interventions exceeded motivational interviewing fidelity thresholds (adapted for portal messaging) Follow-up rates were high (IPC: 80%, RC: 93%) SignificancePreventing opioid misuse is critical to avoiding escalation of opioid use and overdoses, and emergency department patients are at increased risk This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of these intervention approaches via telemedicine for preventing future injuries","output":"0024 Feasibility and acceptability of telemedicine and patient portal interventions to prevent opioid misuse in adolescents and young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic by COVID-19 is causing a devastating effect on the health of global population.

RECENT FINDINGS: Orthopedic surgery is the surgical specialty that has seen the highest proportion of its procedures cancelled due to the pandemic. In this context and onward, telemedicine seems to be a reasonable option for the orthopedic surgeon. Multiple studies have described its safety and a similar patient satisfaction compared to in-person consultations. It has a potential to increase productivity and decrease wait times by providing easier access to the clinician and by decreasing travel-associated limitations and costs. Authors have described the possibility to conduct a reliable virtual assessment of the patient range of motion. Some of the limitations to the use of this technology are technological literacy and access to virtual consultation platforms, the inability to conduct a complete physical examination, potential reduction in identification of intimate and child abuse victims, and limited knowledge about the legal implications of this technology. SUMMARY: Telemedicine in orthopedic surgery has a potential to increase productivity, reduce costs, and increase the access to healthcare. Identified limitations include risk of misdiagnosis, required technologic literacy, unknown legal implications, and failure to identify victims of abuse. In order to use this technology judiciously, the clinician must take into consideration the patients condition and his technological literacy and be aware of the advantages and disadvantages.","output":"Orthopedic Surgery and Telemedicine in Times of COVID-19 and Beyond: a Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: A total laryngectomy involves the full and permanent separation of the upper and lower airways, resulting in the loss of voice and inability to interact vocally.

With an overall accuracy of 89.47 percent, our technique has the greatest true-positive rate of any of the tested state-of-the-art methodologies. ABSTRACT: Laryngeal carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the upper respiratory tract. Total laryngectomy provides complete and permanent detachment of the upper and lower airways that causes the loss of voice, leading to a patients inability to verbally communicate in the postoperative period. This paper aims to exploit modern areas of deep learning research to objectively classify, extract and measure the substitution voicing after laryngeal oncosurgery from the audio signal. We propose using well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied for image classification for the analysis of voice audio signal. Our approach takes an input of Mel-frequency spectrogram (MFCC) as an input of deep neural network architecture. A database of digital speech recordings of 367 male subjects (279 normal speech samples and 88 pathological speech samples) was used.

NADPH and NADH are known to interact with HRP and generate significant quantities of superoxide anion, a radical that spontaneously dismutates to form H2O2 which interferes with the AR/HRP assay. Microsomal enzymes generate H2O2 as a consequence of electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome P450 hemoproteins with subsequent oxygen activation. We found that superoxide anion formation via the interaction of NADPH with HRP was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) without affecting H2O2 generation by microsomal enzymes.

By the mid-1970s, China was already undergoing the epidemiologic transition, years ahead of other nations of similar economic status, and by 1980, life expectancy (67 years) exceeded that of most similarly low-income nations by 7 years. Almost 30 years later, Chinas 2009 health reforms were a response to deep inequity in access to affordable, quality healthcare resulting from three decades of marketization, including de facto privatization of the health sector, along with decentralized accountability and, to a large degree, financing of public health services. The reforms are built on earlier, equity-enhancing initiatives, particularly the reintroduction of social health insurance since 2003, and are planned to continue until 2020, with gradual achievement of overarching objectives on universal and equitable access to health services. The second phase of reform commenced in early 2012. Chinas health reforms remain encouragingly specific but not prescriptive on strategy; set in the decentralized governance structure, they avoid the issue of reliance on local government support for the national equity objective, leaving the detailed design of health service financing, human resource distribution and accountability, essential drug lists and application of clinical care pathways, etc. to local health authorities answerable to local government, not the Ministry of Health.

The prospective three-dimensional structure of the epitope was predicted, refined, and validated. The molecular docking analysis of multi-epitope vaccine candidates with the chicken Toll-like receptor-5 predicted effective binding. Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured high expression. Thus, the present finding indicates that the engineered multi-epitope vaccine is structurally stable and can induce a strong immune response.

Certain cardiovascular risk factors are more prevalent in women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, including traditional risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Female-specific risk factors including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia as well as non-traditional psychosocial risk factors like depressive and anxiety disorders, increased child care, and familial and home care responsibility have been shown to increase risk for cardiovascular disease events in women more so than in men, and disproportionately affect women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms may provide a method for identifying these individuals, and could be automated to directly alert providers in real time. OBJECTIVE This study applies ML techniques to electronic health record (EHR) data to identify an integrated risk-prediction model that can be deployed to predict risk of drug-induced QT prolongation. METHODS We examined harmonized data from the UCHealth EHR and identified inpatients who had received a medication known to prolong the QT interval. Using a binary outcome of the development of a QTc interval >500 ms within 24 hours of medication initiation or no ECG with a QTc interval >500 ms, we compared multiple machine learning methods by classification accuracy and performed calibration and rescaling of the final model. RESULTS We identified 35,639 inpatients who received a known QT-prolonging medication and an ECG performed within 24 hours of administration. Of those, 4,558 patients developed a QTc > 500 ms and 31,081 patients did not. A deep neural network with random oversampling of controls was found to provide superior classification accuracy (F1 score 0.404; AUC 0.71) for the development of a long QT interval compared with other methods. The optimal cutpoint for prediction was determined and was reasonably accurate (sensitivity 71%; specificity 73%).

Material and methods. We have studied the lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in Yugra over the last 21 years (1999C2019). Results. In Yugra, the lung cancer (LC) incidence rates increased by 24.7 % from 1999 to 2019, demonstrating higher rates than those in the Russian Federation (RF), where LC incidence rates decreased by 20.3 %. In 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate was 30.5 per 100,000 (22.7 for RF);the age-standardized mortality rate was 16.4 per 100,000 (18.4 for RF). The mortality rate from LC in Yugra was 9.6 times higher in males than in females (35.5 vs. 3.7 per 100,000). The cross-correlation analysis revealed a correlation between the LC incidence/mortality and air pollution in Yugra. The main carcinogens in Yugra were formaldehyde, phenol, nitrogen dioxide, and benzapyrene. The assessment of the relationship between the age-standardized LC incidence/mortality rates and the amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere revealed that their synergistic effects with tobacco smoking can double the risk of lung cancer development. The increase in the number of chest computed tomography (CT) scans performed in the context of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 infection led to an 18 % increase in the number of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules, of which 9 % of cases were diagnosed as LC. Conclusion. The LC incidence rates in Yugra tended to increase. The high rate of LC incidence is caused by man-made and natural factors, which requires the implementation of a screening program with the use of low-dose computed tomography in order to improve the early detection and prevention of this disease.","output":"Lung cancer incidence and mortality in the khanty-mansi autonomous okrug C yugra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the JobKeeper lump-sum wage subsidy introduced by the Australian government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, paying particular attention to the role of temporary layoffs in saving jobs.

Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2, a receptor of EV71 and CVA16) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections. In this study, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody, N3. A single injection of N3 effectively inhibited the HFMD-like skin scurfs in mice pre-infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 (B4 genotype) or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre-inoculated with 5746 (C2 genotype). This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain, spinal cord and limb muscles.

Because it uses parallel computing and is distributed, the security of the cloud cannot be guaranteed. Because of the large number of e-health records, hospitals have made data security a major concern. The cloud's security cannot be guaranteed because it uses parallel processing and is distributed. The blockchain (BC) has been deployed in the cloud to preserve and secure medical data because it is particularly prone to security breaches and attacks such as forgery, manipulation, and privacy leaks. An overview of blockchain (BC) technology in cloud storage to improve healthcare system security can be obtained by reading this paper. First, we will look at the benefits and drawbacks of using a basic cloud storage system. After that, a brief overview of blockchain cloud storage technology will be offered. Many researches have focused on using blockchain technology in healthcare systems as a possible solution to the security concerns in healthcare, resulting in tighter and more advanced security requirements being provided. This survey could lead to a blockchain-based solution for the protection of cloud-outsourced healthcare data. Evaluation and comparison of the simulation tests of the offered blockchain technology-focused studies can demonstrate integrity verification with cloud storage and medical data, data interchange with reduced computational complexity, security, and privacy protection. Because of blockchain and IT, business warfare has emerged, and governments in the Middle East have embraced it. Thus, this research focused on the qualities that influence customers' interest in and approval of blockchain technology in cloud storage for healthcare system security and the aspects that increase people's knowledge of blockchain. One way to better understand how people feel about learning how to use blockchain technology in healthcare is through the United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A snowball sampling method was used to select respondents in an online poll to gather data about blockchain technology in Middle Eastern poor countries. A total of 443 randomly selected responses were tested using SPSS. Blockchain adoption has been shown to be influenced by anticipation, effort expectancy, social influence (SI), facilitation factors, personal innovativeness (PInn), and a perception of security risk (PSR). Blockchain adoption and acceptance were found to be influenced by anticipation, effort expectancy, social influence (SI), facilitating conditions, personal innovativeness (PInn), and perceived security risk (PSR) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as providing an overview of current trends in the field and issues pertaining to significance and compatibility.","output":"Perceived Security Risk Based on Moderating Factors for Blockchain Technology Applications in Cloud Storage to Achieve Secure Healthcare Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aetiology of sarcoidosis is currently unknown. Due to the clinical and histological similarities between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, the role of mycobacteria has been repeatedly investigated as an aetiological agent for sarcoidosis. The current meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the available molecular evidence on the possible role of mycobacteria in the development of sarcoidosis. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, DARE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant studies published from 1980 to 2006, and studies evaluating the presence of mycobacteria using molecular techniques in biological samples of patients with sarcoidosis were included in the current analysis. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the expected proportion (of individual studies); the data was then pooled to obtain a summary success rate with 95% CI. The odds ratio (95% CI) was also calculated in order to assess the presence of mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus those from nonsarcoidosis control samples. The database search yielded 31 studies. All studies used polymerase chain reaction for nucleic acid amplification followed by identification of nucleic acid sequences specific for different types of mycobacteria. Overall, 231 out of the 874 patients were positive for mycobacteria with a positive signal rate of 26.4 (23.6-29.5%), and the odds of finding mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus controls were 9.67 (4.56-20.5%) using the random effects model and 19.49 (11.21-35.54%) using the exact method. There was methodological and statistical heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias.

The COVID-19 global pandemic is an unprecedented crisis and has exposed the pitfalls of a hyper consumption model of economic growth and development. The scale of immediate economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has shattered the myth of catch up development and perpetual growth. The Crisis has brought unintended degrowth, presenting opportunities for an economic and social reset. In terms of long-term thinking post COVID-19, it is time to change the parameters of how we imagine a trajectory going forward, to prefigure possibilities for contesting capitalist imperatives that there is no alternative. In relation to tourism, the pandemic provides an opportunity for reimaging tourism otherwise, away from exploitative models that disregard people, places, and the natural environment, and towards a tourism that has positive impacts. Non-western alternatives to neo-colonial and neoliberal capitalism, such the South American concept of Buen Vivir, can help us to shift priorities away from economic growth, towards greater social and environmental wellbeing, and meaningful human connections. Taking a Buen Vivir approach to tourism will continue the degrowth momentum, for transformative change in society within the earths physical limits. Yet Buen Vivir also redefines the parameters of how we understand limits. In limiting unsustainable practices in development and tourism, a focus on Buen Vivir actually creates growth in other areas, such as social and environmental wellbeing, and meaningful human connection. Buen Vivir can reorient the tourism industry towards localised tourism, and slow tourism because the principles of Buen Vivir require these alternatives to be small-scale, local and benefiting host communities as well as tourists to increase the wellbeing for all.","output":"Post COVID-19 ecological and social reset: moving away from capitalist growth models towards tourism as Buen Vivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the SARS-CoV-2 state of alarm (SoA), a 30C70% reduction was observed in the number of visits to Pediatric Emergency Departments (ED), as well as frequent delay in diagnosis or difficulty accessing healthcare services.

However, the rapid improvement of a child's condition after RAS administration may influence a caregiver's decision to follow this recommendation. Currently, the evidence on the effect of RAS on referral completion is limited. METHODS An observational study accompanied the roll-out of RAS in three malaria endemic settings in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda. Community health workers and primary health centres enrolled children under 5 years with suspected severe malaria before and after the roll-out of RAS. All children were followed up 28 days after enrolment to assess their treatment-seeking pathways. RESULTS Referral completion was 67% (1408/2104) in DRC, 48% (287/600) in Nigeria and 58% (2170/3745) in Uganda. In DRC and Uganda, RAS users were less likely to complete referral than RAS non-users in the pre-roll-out phase (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.77 and aOR=0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88, respectively). Among children seeking care from a primary health centre in Nigeria, RAS users were less likely to complete referral compared with RAS non-users in the post-roll-out phase (aOR=0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71). In Uganda, among children who completed referral, RAS users were significantly more likely to complete referral on time than RAS non-users enrolled in the pre-roll-out phase (aOR=1.81, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.79). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study raise legitimate concerns that the roll-out of RAS may lead to lower referral completion in children who were administered prereferral RAS. To ensure that community-based programmes are effectively implemented, barriers to referral completion need to be addressed at all levels. Alternative effective treatment options should be provided to children unable to complete referral.

Objectives: The aim is to assess emotional well-being and its associated factors in patients with RMDs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research group at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 1,800 participants were recruited by patient organisations. Data was collected between April and July 2020. Participants were divided into two groups: 1) Participants with poor wellbeing (World Health Organization-Five Wellbeing Index (WHO-5)  50), 2) Participants with good wellbeing (WHO-5 50). The Mann-Whitney and 2 tests were used to analyse possible relations between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and outdoor contact with wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine the impact of the independent variables associated with poor wellbeing. Results: 1,777 patients with 15 different RMDs were included. The mean age was 52.7, 80.2% female, 48.7% had a university degree, and 69.7% were married or in a relationship. The most frequent diagnoses were inflammatory arthritis (75.4%). 49.0% reported poor wellbeing. 57.7% of patients who belonged to a patient organisation reported good wellbeing (vs 46.3% who did not, p<0.001). Those who reported poor wellbeing had higher disease activity (51.4% vs 41.3%, p<0.001), a higher risk of anxiety (54.3% vs 41.7%, p<0.001) and depression (57.0% vs 42.1%, p<0.001), and poorer self-perceived health (53.0% vs 41.8%, p<0.001), compared to those who did not. A higher proportion of those who engaged in physical activity presented good wellbeing (54.0% vs 46.5%, p=0.012). 57.4% of the patients who were unable to attend their appointment with their rheumatologist reported poor wellbeing, compared to 48.2% who did attend (p=0.027). Patients who did not walk outside (56.2%) or who lacked elements in their home to facilitate outside contact (63.3%) experienced poor wellbeing (p<0.001). The factors associated with poor wellbeing were lack of elements in the home enabling contact with the outside world (OR=2.10), not belonging to a patient organisation (OR=1.51), risk of depression (OR=1.49), and not walking outside (OR=1.36) during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1). Conclusion: Almost half of the patients with RMDs reported poor emotional wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of elements in the home that facilitate outdoor contact, not belonging to a patient organisation, the presence of anxiety, and not walking outside during the pandemic increase the probability of poor emotional well-being. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and the role of patient organisations in addressing the effects of the pandemic and its containment measures.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on wellbeing on patients with rheumatic diseases. results from the reumavid study (phase 1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immunity is the first line of defence elicited by the host immune system to fight against invading pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and respond with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARS-CoV2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host. The review also addresses the stages of developments of various vaccines against these viral diseases and the challenges encountered by the researchers during vaccine development.","output":"RNA sensors as a mechanism of innate immune evasion among SARS-CoV2, HIV and Nipah viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: The recent emergence of the novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its international spread pose a global health emergency. The spike (S) glycoprotein binds ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unraveling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD. RESULTS: Here, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that &#954;-helix (polyproline-II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like &#954;-helix and ?-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short &#945;-helices which affect the hinge region. These conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry. Overall, this study provides guidance for the design and optimization of structure-based intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.

However, potential transmission by blood transfusion could not be definitely excluded. Two real-time SARS-specific PCR assays were assessed for their sensitivities, agreement of test results, and intra-assay variabilities. Both assays rely on reverse transcription and amplification of extracted RNA. Dilutions of gamma-irradiated cell culture supernatants of SARS CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were prepared to determine the precisions, linear ranges, and accuracies of the assays.

First, as traditional epidemical models use the accumulative confirmed cases for training, it can only predict a rising trend of the epidemic and cannot predict when the epidemic will decline or end, an improved model is built based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with daily confirmed cases training set. Second, considering the existing forecasting model based on LSTM can only predict the epidemic trend within the next 30 days accurately, the rolling update mechanism is embedded with LSTM for long-term projections. Third, by introducing Diffusion Index (DI), the effectiveness of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 is analyzed in our novel research. The trends of the epidemic in 150 days ahead are modeled for Russia, Peru and Iran, three countries on different continents. Under our estimation, the current epidemic in Peru is predicted to continue until November 2020.

This study utilizes data on patients' ethnicity, age, gender, and diagnosis as collected annually by the Riverside County Department of Mental Health from the fiscal year of 2017-2018. It compares the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the rate of utilization of mental health services by AA in the county to the data collected by the NLAAS. The total number of AA using mental health services in Riverside County is 669, which totals 1.73% of all individuals accessing the same services. The number of AA using mental health services represented 0.45% of the total AA population in Riverside County. AA in Riverside County are utilizing MH services even less than the national rates (0.45% vs 8.6% nationally from NLAAS data). The gap in care illustrated by these results exemplifies not only the disparity in utilization of MH services seen in this particular ethnic group, but portrays the stagnant results from Riverside County s attempts to address this issue. Possible reasons for the disparity include lack of access, stigma, recovery, migration, and a lack of culturally-competent care. A reimagined outreach initiative may help to better address this issue. Riverside County already has implemented an AA Task Force, holds health fairs at local churches in the communities, supports a UCR School of Medicine student-run free clinic, and is active in NAMI events.","output":"Asian-Americans Remain Low Utilizers of County Mental Health Services."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Once inside the cytoplasm of a cell, mRNA can be used to treat disease by upregulating the expression of any gene.

Wearable devices are especially useful because of their controllability regardless of location. Humidity is one of the inevitable factors in the personal environment as a preventive against infectious diseases. Although atomization devices are commonly used as a method of humidity control, at present, there are no wearable humidity control devices. Vibration of a lithium niobate (LN) device in the thickness mode is a promising piezoelectric method for miniaturization of atomization devices for humidity control. To miniaturize the atomization device, the transducer size needs to be small not so much as to decrease the atomization efficiency. However, the effect of the device area on the atomization efficiency of LN at a size suitable for mounting in wearable devices has not been studied. Here, we conducted an atomization demonstration of LN devices with different sizes to evaluate particle size and atomization efficiency. Furthermore, to reveal the relationship between vibration behavior and atomization efficiency, resonance vibration in the MHz frequency band was evaluated by the finite element method and an impedance analyzer. The results showed that the peak size of water particles atomized by each device was in the range of 3.2 to 4.2 m, which is smaller than particles produced by typical piezoelectric ceramics. Moreover, the best LN size for efficient atomization was found to be 8 mm  10 mm among the five LN device sizes used in experiments. From the relationship between vibration behavior and atomization efficiency, the size of the transducer was suggested to affect the vibration mode. The obtained result suggested that the LN device is suitable for small wearable nebulizer devices.","output":"Effect of the area of a lithium niobate transducer on the efficiency of ultrasonic atomization driven by resonance vibration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has presented huge challenges for communities across the world.

The unit of analysis was number of patients who tested negative/positive. Medical records of positive patients were reviewed to determine the presence of COVID-19 symptoms. A curve was created showing our number of positive patients per week and another one presenting the number of positive patients per day in Florida, both figures were compared.Results: A total of 7,213 patients from all specialties were preoperatively tested, out of which 85 were positive for an overall infection rate of 1.2%. In 18% (15/85) of positive patients, it was not possible to determine symptomatology. Among remaining patients, 49% (34/70) were asymptomatic while 51% (36/70) were symptomatic for COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain has shown a heterogeneous geographical pattern This study aimed to assess the influence of several climatic factors on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 among the Spanish Autonomous Communities (AA.CC.). METHODS: Data on coronavirus infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease, as well as the climatic variables were obtained from official sources (Ministry of Health and Spanish Meteorological Agency, respectively). To assess the possible influence of climate on the development of the disease, data on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) were collected during the months before the start of the pandemic. To analyze its influence on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, data on UVR, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the months of highest contagiousness to the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: From October 2019 to January 2020, mean UVR was significantly related not only to SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence -previous 14 days-  10(5) habitants, rho = ? 0.0,666; p = 0.009), but also with COVID-19 severity, assessed as hospital admissions (rho = ? 0.626; p = 0.017) and ICU admissions (rho = ? 0.565; p = 0.035). Besides, temperature (February: rho = ? 0.832; p < 0.001 and March: rho = ? 0.904; p < 0.001), was the main climatic factor responsible for the infectivity of the coronavirus and directly contributed to a different spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the Spanish regions.

Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also elicit a cytokine storm, which accounts for disease progression and ultimately the urgent need of ventilator support.. Based upon several reports, it has been argued that early treatment with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta, preferentially in the early disease stage, may prohibit disease progression. Similarly, preliminary studies have shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib or baricitinib may decrease mortality by dampening the deadly cytokine storm, which C in addition to the virus itself - also contributes to multi-organ thrombosis and multi-organ failure. Herein, we describe the rationale for treatment with IFNs (alpha2 or beta) and ruxolitinib emphasizing the urgent need to explore these agents in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 C both as monotherapies and in combination.

METHODS: Our virtual TTS used teleconferencing software alongside digital whiteboards to walk clinic stakeholders through patient scenarios. Participants reviewed and rehearsed their workflows and care practices. The goal was for staff to take ownership over gaps and codesigned solutions. After simulation sessions, follow-up interviews were conducted to collect feedback. RESULTS: These sessions helped PC staff identify and codesign solutions for clinical hazards and threats. These included the flow of patients through clinics, communications, redesignation of physical spaces, and adaptation of guidance for cleaning and personal protective equipment use. End users reported sessions provided neutral spaces to discuss practice changes and built confidence in delivering safe care during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: TTS has not been extensively deployed to improve clinical practice in outpatient environments. We show how virtual TTS can bridge gaps between knowledge and practice by offering a guided space to rehearse clinical changes. We show that virtual TTS can be used in multiple contexts to help identify hazards, improve safety and build confidence in professional teams adapting to rapid changes in both policies and practices.

Surgical bypass has historically been the primary therapeutic modality, but has been supplanted in the last decade by endovascular therapy, even with the most complex presentation of disease. Endovascular therapy has the advantage of a more favorable and rapid recovery, while preserving future treatment options. Endovascular management of FP disease, initially with \\"Plain Old\\" balloon angioplasty (POBA) has yielded over the years to bare metal stents (BMS), and more recently, to technologies seeking to limit BMS use due to difficult-to-treat patterns of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Despite a myriad number of endovascular devices and strategies, the approach to FP intervention lends itself to an algorithmic schema largely predicated on lesion length, severity of calcification, recanalization method, and clinical goals based upon individual patient status. In addition, treatment costs are a growing consideration in device selection. These criteria can be summarized into what we have termed as a \\"CADENCE\\" approach to treatment, an acronym representing the following factors: Clinical scenario, Anatomy, Device performance specifications, Experience/Ease, Novelty, Cost, and Evidence-base (Fig. 1). While the individual components of the CADENCE strategy are not always hierarchical, they combine to give a framework for reasonable interventional strategies for a given patient presentation and lesion appearance. Since there is a notable lack of prospective data for FP interventions, most notably with regard to direct device comparisons, actual practice is often experiential, and further data to guide optimal patient care are needed.","output":"Superficial Femoral Artery Intervention: Creating an Algorithmic Approach for the Use of Old and Novel (Endovascular) Technologies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to develop a prediction MammaPrint (MMP) genomic risk assessment nomogram model for hormone-receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer and minimal axillary burden (N0-1) tumors using clinicopathological factors of patients who underwent an MMP test for decision making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy.

We conducted a meta-analysis to derive generalizable, well-powered estimates of liver injury prevalence in COVID-19 patients. We also aimed to assess whether liver injury prevalence is significantly greater than the baseline prevalence of chronic liver disease (CLD). Our secondary aim was to study whether the degree of liver injury was associated with the severity of COVID-19. Materials and Methods Electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) were systematically searched in June 2020 for studies reporting the prevalence of baseline CLD and current liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Liver injury was defined as an elevation in transaminases >3 times above the upper limit of normal. For the secondary analysis, all studies reporting mean liver enzyme levels in severe versus non-severe COVID-19 patients were included. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. Proportions were subjected to arcsine transformation and pooled to derive pooled proportions and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup differences were tested for using the chi-square test and associated p-value. Means and their standard errors were pooled to derive weighted mean differences (WMDs) and corresponding 95% CIs. Results Electronic search yielded a total of 521 articles. After removal of duplicates and reviewing the full-texts of potential studies, a total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among a cohort of 8,817 patients, the prevalence of current liver injury was 15.7% (9.5%-23.0%), and this was significantly higher than the proportion of patients with a history of CLD (4.9% [2.2%-8.6%]; p < 0.001).

In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies.

Subject demographics, medical and neuropsychological characteristics, and genetic test results were abstracted. Genetic results were divided into negative or normal, variants of unknown significance, and pathogenic. Subject characteristics were compared across results. Manual chart review determined if further recommendations were made after pathogenic results.

Thus, here we sought to identify the risk factors associated with intubation and intra-hospital mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized due to hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF). RESULTS: We included retrospectively a total of 187 patients admitted to the subintensive and intensive care units of the University Hospital Maggiore della Carit of Novara between March 1st and April 30th, 2020. Based on these patients demographic characteristics, early clinical and laboratory variables, and quantitative chest computerized tomography (CT) findings, we developed two random forest (RF) models able to predict intubation and intra-hospital mortality. Variables independently associated with intubation were C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase level (p = 0.018) and white blood cell count (p = 0.026), while variables independently associated with mortality were age (p < 0.001), other cardiovascular diseases (p = 0.029), C-reactive protein (p = 0.002), lactate dehydrogenase level (p = 0.018), and invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.001). On quantitative chest CT analysis, ground glass opacity, consolidation, and fibrosis resulted significantly associated with patient intubation and mortality. The major predictors for both models were the ratio between partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen, age, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, glycemia, CT quantitative parameters, lymphocyte count, and symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our findings confirm previously reported demographic, clinical, hemato-chemical, and radiologic predictors of adverse outcome among COVID-19-associated hypoxemic ARF patients. The two newly developed RF models herein described show an overall good level of accuracy in predicting intra-hospital mortality and intubation in our study population.

CR1 levels were significantly decreased in CD patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001). The CR1 rs1704660G, rs17047661G and rs6691117G variants were significantly associated with CD and in high linkage disequilibrium. The CR1*AGAGTG haplotype was associated with T. cruzi infection (p = 0.035, OR 3.99, CI 1.1-14.15) whereas CR1*AGGGTG was related to the risk of chagasic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.028, OR 12.15, CI 1.13-113). This is the first study that provides insights on the role of CR1 in development and clinical presentation of chronic CD.","output":"Human complement receptor type 1 (CR1) protein levels and genetic variants in chronic Chagas Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global crisis, one which also influences the ways sustainability is being taught at universities. This paper undertakes an analysis of the extent to which COVID-19 as a whole and the lockdown it triggered in particular, which has led to the suspension of presence-based teaching in universities worldwide and influenced teaching on matters related to sustainable development. By means of a worldwide survey involving higher education institutions across all continents, the study has identified a number of patterns, trends and problems. The results from the study show that the epidemic has significantly affected teaching practices. The lockdowns have led to a surge in the use of on-line communication tools as a partial replacement to normal lessons. In addition, many faculty teaching sustainability in higher education have strong competencies in digital literacy. The sampled higher education educations have-as a whole-adequate infrastructure to continue to teach during the lockdowns. Finally, the majority of the sample revealed that they miss the interactions via direct face-to-face student engagement, which is deemed as necessary for the effective teaching of sustainability content. The implications of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, it describes how sustainability teaching on sustainable development has been affected by the lockdown. Secondly, it describes some of the solutions deployed to overcome the problem. Finally, the paper outlines the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic may serve the purpose of showing how university teaching on sustainability may be improved in the future, taking more advantage of modern information technologies.","output":"COVID-19: the impact of a global crisis on sustainable development teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents deep and complex analysis based on the changes of life of human society during the COVID-19 pandemic The World as never before has a global common enemy and everyone is in danger doesnt matter where he lives and what is the occupation The life new dimensions are considered as an 8-coordinate system where the new 4 coordinates C coronavirus, virus of poverty, virus of chronically ill people and scientists as new leading factor of the world It means, a simple solution for prevention and regulation of pandemic doesnt exist Countries and outbreaks are represented by 4 everlasting coordinates C three for space and for time measurement The life of human society is conditionally divided of 4 hierarchic levels Interactions between them have to be studied by scientists from all areas in order to win this word challenge where all humans are on the same side of the barricade The presented analysis could be extremely useful for explanation the errors made by leaders and to show them that the new reality requires relevant and effective decisions based on scientific complex analyzes and taking into account the four hierarchic levels of knowledge ? 2021 by the authors Licensee Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by/4 0/)","output":"Complex Analysis of New Unique Human Society Life in Eight Coordinate System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the UK regulatory authority, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, with a regimen of two standard doses given with an interval of 4-12 weeks. The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. METHODS: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5aa1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (22aa1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever &#8805;378C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24a422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17a178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 667% (95% CI 574-740), with 84 (10%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (29%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (09%) of 12a282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (11%) of 11a962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 760% (593-859). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 066 [95% CI 059-074]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 813% [95% CI 603-912] at &#8805;12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 551% [330-699] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 232 [201-268]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

Influenza surveillance provides important information to inform policy on influenza control and vaccination. While the epidemiology of influenza has been well characterized in western countries, few data exist on influenza epidemiology in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. We describe the epidemiology of influenza virus in Oman. METHODS: Using syndromic case definitions and protocols, patients from four regional hospitals in Oman were enrolled in a descriptive prospective study to characterize the burden of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza. Eligible patients provided demographic information as well as oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Specimens were tested for influenza A and influenza B; influenza A viruses were subtyped using RT-PCR. RESULTS: From January 2008 through June 2013, a total of 5,147 cases were enrolled and tested for influenza. Influenza strains were detected in 8% of cases for whom samples were available. Annual incidence rates ranged from 0.5 to 15.4 cases of influenza-associated SARI per 100,000 population. The median age of influenza patients was 6 years with children 0C2 years accounting for 34% of all influenza-associated hospitalizations. By contrast, the median age of non-influenza SARI cases was 1 year with children 0C2 years comprising 59% of SARI. Compared to non-influenza SARI cases, a greater proportion of influenza cases had pre-existing chronic conditions and underwent ventilation during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus is associated with a substantial proportion of SARI in Oman. Influenza in Oman approximately follows northern hemisphere seasonality, with major peaks in October to December and a lesser peak around April. The burden of influenza was greatest in children and the elderly. Future efforts should examine the burden of influenza in other potential risk groups such as pregnant women to inform interventions including targeted vaccination.","output":"The Burden of Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations in Oman, January 2008-June 2013"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the dynamic asset market linkages under the COVID-19 global pandemic based on market efficiency, in the sense of Fama (1970).

To establish a hyperspectral prediction model of soil organic matter (SOM) content, this study investigated a forested Eucalyptus plantation in Huangmian Forest Farm, Guangxi, China. The Ranger and Lasso algorithms were used to screen spectral bands. Subsequently, models were established using four algorithms: partial least squares regression, random forest (RF), a support vector machine, and an artificial neural network (ANN). The optimal model was then selected. The results showed that the modeling accuracy was higher when band selection was based on the Ranger algorithm than when it was based on the Lasso algorithm. ANN modeling had the best goodness of fit, and the model established by RF had the most stable modeling results. Based on the above results, a new method is proposed in this study for band selection in the early phase of soil hyperspectral modeling. The Ranger algorithm can be applied to screen the spectral bands, and ANN or RF can then be selected to construct the prediction model based on different datasets, which is applicable to establish the prediction model of SOM content in red soil plantations. This study provides a reference for the remote sensing of soil fertility in forests of different soil types and a theoretical basis for developing portable equipment for the hyperspectral measurement of SOM content in forest habitats.","output":"Hyperspectral band selection and modeling of soil organic matter content in a forest using the Ranger algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"not available.","output":"Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) in a central area of Calabria region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report considerations related with surgery through 2 cases of acute appendicitis (AA) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Citizens visiting the Land Office have reported many instances of unpleasant experiences. In response to these issues, this study attempted to investigate the challenges of NIS implementation in land administration and possible solutions. Based on in-depth interviews with citizens and public officials, as well as document analysis, the study found that the NIS has helped to modernize land administration in recent years. The Bangladesh government, with the help of young land administration officials, has undertaken several measures to resolve this crisis. However, the improvement in service delivery is, in some ways, nominal compared to the volume of corruption in land administration. The likely reason is the nature of the countrys societal patterns. In practice, local and administrative politics continue to have a significant influence. Therefore, despite good initiatives and appropriate measures, land administration officials have failed to implement the NIS properly. Several other problems are making NIS implementation challenging, such as the lack of skilled manpower and technical support, the tendency to break rules, and other forms of corruption discussed in this study. However, the study found that an alternative approach, namely, local solutions for local problems could have more success than the NIS approach. Therefore, this study argues that dynamic, sustainable, and corruption-free land administration in Bangladesh requires a combined approach involving local solutions, innovation, and NIS implementation.","output":"National integrity strategy implementation in land administration to prevent corruption in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fake news, hostility, defamation are some of the biggest problems faced in social media.

Herein we provide preclinical proof-of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large-animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH-deficient pigs received autologous hepatocyte transplantation into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes, indicating that the lymph nodes served as a source for healthy hepatocytes to repopulate a diseased liver. Ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes cures the pig model of HT1 and presents a promising approach to the treatment of liver disease in patients with pre-existing liver damage and fibrosis.

We analyzed the rate of fever in our patients to find the diagnostic value of fever and to predict PCR status in COVID-19. Methods: It was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in the Health Sciences University Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training and Research Hospital, which was a tertiary chest diseases pandemic hospital in Izmir. We included 389 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and analyzed them according to PCR status and presence of fever. Fever was defined as temperature over 38 degrees C. Results: Thirty-eight percentage of our patients complained of fever before admission. However, when they were admitted, only 13.6% of them had objective high fever. 26.5% had high fever during hospital stay. PCR-positive patients had less comorbidity. More of PCR-positive patients had fever in the course of hospitalization and their length of hospital stay was longer and mortality was higher. Although we expected to find a high sensitivity, the sensitivity of high fever in our settings was low. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of high fever at admission in predicting the positivity of the PCR test were 16.9%, 90.6%, 69.8%, and 45.8%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of high fever during hospitalization to predict the positivity of PCR test were 36.1%, 85.9%, 76.7%, and 51.0%, respectively. Conclusion: 13.6% of our COVID-19 patients had objective high fever at admission. 26.5% had high fever during hospital stay. PCR-positive patients had less comorbidity. More PCR-positive patients had fever in the course of hospitalization and their length of hospital stay was longer and mortality was higher. Although we expected to find a high sensitivity, the sensitivity of high fever in our settings was lower than expected. Temperatures <38 degrees C at admission and during hospitalization determine 90.6% and 85.9% of the PCR-negative patients, respectively.

METHODS: Three\\\\year retrospective review identified new\\\\onset IS patients. Only presumed responder to IS treatment at 2 weeks with a prolonged (>90 minutes) outpatient EEG to assess treatment response and at least 3\\\\month follow\\\\up were included. Hypsarrhythmia, electroclinical spasms, and sleep were evaluated for the first hour and for the duration of the EEG. RESULTS: We included 37 consecutive patients with new\\\\onset IS and presumed clinical response at 2 weeks posttreatment. Follow\\\\up outpatient prolonged EEGs (median: 150 minutes, range: 90\\\\240 minutes) were obtained 14 days (IQR: 13\\\\17) after treatment initiation. EEGs detected ongoing IS in 11 of 37 (30%) presumed early responders. Prolonged outpatient EEG had a sensitivity of 85% (confidence interval [CI] 55%\\\\98%) for detecting treatment failure. When hypsarrhythmia and/or electroclinical spasms were not seen, EEG had a negative predictive value 92% (CI: 75%\\\\99%) for confirming continued IS resolution.

Parents were evaluated before national lockdown (baseline) and recontacted during the SARS-CoV-2 emergency almost after a year. The changes in emotional/behavioral problems of children and parenting stress before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were assessed with Child Behaviour CheckList (CBCL) and Parent Stress Index - short form (PSI). RESULTS The analysis of the emotional and behavioral problems of children with NDDs did not show statistically significant differences between the before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period. The evaluations conducted on parents highlights an increase in parental stress during the pandemic. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found in three subscales: Parenting Distress (PD) scale, Dysfunctional Interaction Parent-Child (P-CDI) scale and Defensive responding scale (DF). CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the increase in parental stress and a more difficult parent-child interaction with NDDs in the period of lockdown due to the pandemic; identification of these risk targets can be useful for interventions in similar situations. Therefore, it is necessary to provide caregivers information to manage and overcome challenges experienced during a pandemic and providing psychological support for caregivers of children with NDDs.","output":"Psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families: evaluation before and during covid-19 outbreak among an Italian sample."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has brought the whole world stand still, locked down in their homes, infecting more than 8 million people, and many thousands (449,182) -have lost their lives across the globe Due to lack of any definitive medicine or vaccine, treatment options are supportive of oxygenation, antiviral, antiretroviral drugs, antibiotics, fluid/electrolyte, mechanical ventilation with ICU (Intensive Care Unit) support, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine have been tried to fight this infection However, mortality due to severe pneumonia, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and multiorgan failure arising from the overactive immune response (storm) mediated by cytokines remains a treatment challenge in elderly and patients with severe medical comorbidities Recently, anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, immune-modular, and healing properties of intravenous injections of culture derived stem cells have been proposed and shown to benefits in a small number of patients with severe COVID-19 infections Based on previous experience with other viral infections, convalescent plasma, and serum transfusion are being used as a source of neutralizing antibody/factors to minimize the effects of inflammatory cytokines in this infection Immunotherapy with purified monoclonal antibodies and conditioned serum with a mixture of unique cytokines are also being developed Regenerative Medicine has emerged as a crucial adjuvant tool in promoting healing and early recovery in severe COVID-19 infections and other supportive treatments ? 2020 by the Korean Society for Stem Cell Research All Rights Reserved","output":"Emerging Treatment Options of Regenerative Medicine in Severe Corona Virus/COVID 19 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this study was to analyse neurological symptoms during a Covid-19 infection and determine the pattern of symptoms by comparing outpatients with inpatients.

Reports of autopsies around the word of patients that death from COVID-19 shows severe liver damage ranging from 58.06% to 78% of the cases. There is evidence that the elevation of transaminases (ALT / AST) translates into a more serious clinical profile. Besides, the elevation of AST is related with a high risk of mortality, so it must be monitored during hospitalization. Thus, it is important to know the behavior of liver injury and mortality in our population. Aim(s): To determine transaminase levels in patients with SARS-Cov-2 and its relationship with mortality. Methods. All the patients admitted with a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR test were analyzed, the mean and standard deviation of AST, ALT, and other variables of the liver biochemistry, hemoglobin, leukocyte, fibrinogen, and TP were obtained. A Kapplan Meier curve was made for survival to compare patients with and without transaminases elevation. Result(s): We studied a total of 92 patients: 79 (86%) were male, age 56.62 +/- 13.70 years, weight 72.5 +/- 14.30 kg, height 1.63 +/- 0.10 m, BMI 27.09 +/- 5.04 kg / m2. Of the 92 patients, 68 (73%) had an elevation of transaminases at admission. Patient's whit elevation of transaminases (68): 63 (93%) were males, the mean values at admission of AST and ALT were 74.91 +/- 5.83 and 72.75 +/- 5.74, respectively. The average hospital stay was 6.1 +/- 4.1 days in de group with no elevation of transaminases and 7.25 +/- 5.3 days for the group with elevation. Other variables of liver biochemistry, hemoglobin, leukocyte, fibrinogen, and TP are presented in Table 1. The data referring to the probability of requiring ICU income. And probability of requiring mechanical ventilation are presented in Table 2. The group without and with elevated transaminases were compared to observe if elevation of transaminases could influence mortality, obtaining a non-statistically significant p.

The purpose of this study was to review and summarize the latest research on the management and treatment of women in pregnancy and childbirth in the world and management protocols available in Iran and other countries. Evidence Acquisition: In this review study, we examined Persian and English studies by searching the Pubmed, Web of Science, UpToDate, SID, Scopus, Google Scholar, and medRxiv databases with keywords pregnant, pregnancy, gravidity, coronavirus, infec-tion, COVID-19, and their Persian equivalents. Articles and reviews were on humans. After reviewing and removing duplicate and non-eligible articles, 12 articles and 11 guidelines and recommendations were obtained.

However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus.

It continues to be one of the most common diseases in chicken and probably endemic in all countries that raise chicken. The virus infection causes considerable economic losses in both commercial meat- and egg-type birds. The virus tropism includes respiratory tract, proventriculus, cecal tonsils, oviduct and kidney. Infections mainly cause respiratory distress in young chickens. In broiler chicken,the virus causes respiratory distress but some strains produce interstitial nephritis while others cause proventriculitis. In laying hens, the virus causes considerable decrease in egg production and quality. Antigen detection and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are commonly used methods for rapid virus diagnosis. RT-PCR and direct gene sequence of the S1 gene or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) are used for virus genotyping. The control strategy against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is conducted by live attenuated vaccine. To date, more than 65 genotypes and variants are characterized worldwide with poor cross protection. In addition, recombination could increase the variety of strains since live attenuated IBV vaccine viruses may recombine with virulent wild-type strains, and the resultant viruses have caused outbreaks of respiratory disease and production problems in chicken flocks.","output":"Coronaviridae: Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1624 participants of which 1397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1111 participants of which 1023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scales reliability and validity. Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores.

Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible.

This study aimed to evaluate the preparedness for the pandemic among a European network of children's hospitals and to explore the strategies to restart health care services. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed in May 2020 to the 13 children's tertiary care hospitals belonging to the European Children's Hospitals Organisation. Responses were obtained from eight hospitals (62%). Significant reductions were observed in accesses to the emergency departments (41.7%), outpatient visits (35.7%), intensive and non-intensive care unit inpatient admissions (16.4 and 13%, respectively) between February 1 and April 30, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019. Overall, 93 children with SARS CoV-2 infection were admitted to inpatient wards. All the hospitals created SARS-CoV-2 preparedness plans for the diagnosis and management of infected patients. Routine activities were re-scheduled. Four hospitals shared their own staff with adult units, two designated bed spaces for adults and only one admitted adults to inpatient wards. The three main components for the resumption of clinical activities were testing, source control, and reorganization of spaces and flows. Telemedicine and telehealth services were used before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by three hospitals and by all the hospitals during it. Conclusion: The present study provides a perspective on preparedness to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among eight large European children's hospitals, on the impact of the pandemic on the hospital activities and on the strategies adopted to restart clinical activities.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Strategies for Resumption of Activities During the Second Wave of the Pandemic: A Report From Eight Paediatric Hospitals From the ECHO Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 infection has been recognised as one important complication associated with in-hospital mortality. The potential dose-response effect of cardiac troponin (cTn) concentrations on adverse clinical outcomes has not been systematically studied. Hence, we will conduct a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between elevated cTn concentrations and in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and ISI Knowledge via Web of Science databases, as well as preprint databases (medRxiv and bioRxiv), from inception to October 2021, to identify all retrospective and prospective cohorts and randomised controlled studies using related keywords. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality during hospitalisation. The secondary outcome will be major adverse event (MAE). To conduct a dose-response meta-analysis of the potential linear or restricted cubic spline regression relationship between elevated cTn concentrations and all-cause mortality or MAE, studies with three or more categories of cTn concentrations will be included. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be conducted to compare elevated and non-elevated categories of cTn concentration. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of our results by removing each included study at one time to obtain and evaluate the remaining overall estimates of all-cause mortality or MAE.

Few studies have investigated the predictive value of chest X-ray radiological measurements for sternal complications. METHODS Several perioperative radiological measurements at chest X-ray and clinical characteristics were computed in 849 patients deemed at high risk for sternal dehiscence (SD) or More than Grade 1 Surgical Site Infection (MG1-SSI). Multivariable analysis identified independent predictors, whilst receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses highlighted cut-off values of radiological measurements for the prediction of both complications. RESULTS SD occurred in 8.8% of the patients, MG1-SSI in 6.8%. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the only independent predictor for SD (Odds Ratio, O.R. 12.1; p < 0.001); proximal sternal height (PSH) was the only independent protective factor (O.R. 0.58; p < 0.001), with a cut-off value of 11.7 mm (sensitivity 70.5%, specificity 71.0%; ROC area under the curve (AUC) = 0.768, p < 0.001). Diabetes mellitus (O.R. 3.5; p < 0.001) and COPD (O.R. 21.3; p < 0.001) were independent predictors for MG1-SSI; indexed proximal sternal height (iPSH) was as a protective factor (O.R. 0.26; p < 0.001) with a cut-off of 5.97 mm (sensitivity 70.2%, specificity 69.0%; ROC AUC = 0.739, p < 0.001). No other radiological measurements were independently correlated with SD or MG1-SS (p = N.S.).

Plasma soluble ST2 (sST2), a prognostic biomarker for heart failure, has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker of AASs outperforming D-dimer, the current diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of sST2 for AASs in the Emergency Department (ED). In 2017C2018, patients were enrolled if they had 1 red-flag symptoms (chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit) and a clinical suspicion of AAS. sST2 was detected with the Presage? assay. Adjudication was based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) or on diagnostic outcome inclusive of 30-day follow-up. 297 patients were enrolled, including 88 with AASs. The median age was 67 years. In 162 patients with CTA, the median sST2 level was 41.7 ng/mL (IQR 29.4C103.2) in AASs and 34.6 ng/mL (IQR 21.4C51.5) in alternative diagnoses (P = 0.005). In ROC analysis, the AUC of sST2 was 0.63, as compared to 0.82 of D-dimer (P < 0.001).

Data quantifying the disease burden, as well as describing clinical outcomes during hospitalization among these groups, are needed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe interim COVID-19 hospitalization rates and severe clinical outcomes by age group and race and ethnicity among US veterans by using a multisite surveillance network. METHODS: We implemented a multisite COVID-19 surveillance platform in 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers located in Atlanta, Bronx, Houston, Palo Alto, and Los Angeles, collectively serving more than 396,000 patients annually. From February 27 to July 17, 2020, we actively identified inpatient cases with COVID-19 by screening admitted patients and reviewing their laboratory test results. We then manually abstracted the patients' medical charts for demographics, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we calculated hospitalization incidence and incidence rate ratios, as well as relative risk for invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and case fatality rate after adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. RESULTS: We identified 621 laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 70 years, with 65.7% (408/621) aged 65 years and 94% (584/621) male. Most COVID-19 diagnoses were among non-Hispanic Black (325/621, 52.3%) veterans, followed by non-Hispanic White (153/621, 24.6%) and Hispanic or Latino (112/621, 18%) veterans. Hospitalization rates were the highest among veterans who were 85 years old, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic Black (430, 317, and 298 per 100,000, respectively). Veterans aged 85 years had a 14-fold increased rate of hospitalization compared with those aged 18-29 years (95% CI: 5.7-34.6), whereas Hispanic or Latino and Black veterans had a 4.6- and 4.2-fold increased rate of hospitalization, respectively, compared with non-Hispanic White veterans (95% CI: 3.6-5.9). Overall, 11.6% (72/621) of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 26.6% (165/621) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 16.9% (105/621) died in the hospital. The adjusted relative risk for invasive mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit did not differ by age group or race and ethnicity, but veterans aged 65 years had a 4.5-fold increased risk of death while hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with those aged <65 years (95% CI: 2.4-8.6). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 surveillance at the 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers across the United States demonstrated higher hospitalization rates and severe outcomes among older veterans, as well as higher hospitalization rates among Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic Black veterans than among non-Hispanic White veterans. These findings highlight the need for targeted prevention and timely treatment for veterans, with special attention to older aged, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic Black veterans.","output":"COVID-19CRelated Hospitalization Rates and Severe Outcomes Among Veterans From 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers: Hospital-Based Surveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: COVID-19 has led to unprecedented public health measures such as school and university closures across the world.

J Consult Clin Psychol 61, 686-695.]) was originally developed as a measure of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) in cardiac patients. The purpose of this study was to examine its two-factor affect model in the realm of stress, depression, and fatigue in working adults. METHODS Affect, stress, depression, and fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires in a sample of 228 adults (49.6% male; mean = 41.4 +/- 9 years) from the working population. RESULTS The GMS PA and NA scales were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = .94 and alpha = .93, respectively), and correlated in the expected direction with their corresponding mood scales from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Factor analyses of the 40 mood terms comprising the GMS and PANAS yielded one common PA-dimension, but two NA-dimensions reflecting emotional exhaustion (GMS) and anxious apprehension (PANAS) as different components of the stress process. A relatively high mean NA score of the GMS suggested that these working adults perceived terms that refer to malaise/deactivation as being relevant to describe their negative affective status. The GSM-NA scale was related to stress, depression and fatigue while the GMS-PA scale was positively associated with quality of life. LIMITATIONS This study is based on a cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS The association between the PA (negative correlation) and NA (positive correlation) scales of the GMS and perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and fatigue supports the validity of its two-factor model.

However, the realistic situation is that there are few opportunities for the junior residents, trainee doctors, and especially medical students to contact enough clinical practice and see such fracture patients. Fortunately, with the rapid development and continuous progress of 3D printing and related technologies, this situation has gradually gotten better and better. In this research, we confirmed that 3D printing technology could improve the effectiveness of fracture teaching and medical learning from multiple dimensions. We comprehensively screened and assessed 223 papers from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection on October 3, 2021, with ((3D) AND ((printing) OR (printed)) AND (fracture)) AND ((education) OR (training) OR (teaching)) as the retrieval strategy. Additionally, we used the VOSviewer software to analyze the keywords and countries and the organizations of the publications, then a series of scientometric and visualized analyses were made based on the retrieval results. Afterward, multiple databases were retrieved according to our selection criteria, we selected eight studies for the extensive literature analysis. The extracted data contained information of authors, problems solved, participants, methods, assessments, results, and benefits/limitations. These intuitive and in-depth analyses further confirmed and appraised the advantages of 3D printing in complex fracture models more objectively. In conclusion, 3D printing could improve the effectiveness and extension of fracture teaching, as well as medical learning, by providing the powerful interaction with 3D effect, wakening students learning interest, and allowing the junior residents, trainee doctors to have as realistic a virtual practice experience as possible. Through this research, it is expected that more researchers could be attracted to conduct more comprehensive and thorough studies on the application of 3D printing for training and educational propose, to promote the development of 3D technology-based medical education practice and further deepen the reform of medical education and improve the quality of fracture education and learning.","output":"3D Printing Improve the Effectiveness of Fracture Teaching and Medical Learning: A Comprehensive Scientometric Assessment and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The UK Government restrictions on non-essential work in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced millions of working aged-adults into an unplanned lifestyle change. We present data on changes in commuting behaviour in response to COVID-19 and describe the facilitators and barriers to switching commuting behaviours, with a specific focus on cycling and walking. Methods An online survey queried individuals transport mode to/from work before and when becoming aware of COVID-19, when restrictions were in place and the transport mode they may use once restrictions are lifted. Free-form text responses were collected on why they may switch to a sustainable commute mode in the future and what would help/allow them to achieve this. Quantitative and qualitative data on those who commuted by car (single occupant) and public transport (bus/rail/park & ride) were analysed and presented separately. Results Overall, 725 car and public transport commuters responded;72.4% were car commuters and 27.6% were public transport commuters before COVID-19. Of the car commuters, 81.9% may continue travelling by car once restrictions are lifted while 3.6% and 6.5% might change to walking and cycling, respectively. Of the public transport commuters, 49.0% might switch modes. From the free-form text responses three themes were identified: (a) perceived behavioural control towards cycling and walking (infrastructure and safety of roads, distance, weather) (b) key motivators to encourage a switch to cycling and walking (provision to support cycling, personal and environmental benefits);(c) the demands of current lifestyle (job requirements, family and lifestyle commitments).

SRGNet can make full use of the supervised segmentation information and then outputs multi-scale segmentation predictions. Through this, high-quality lesion-areas suggestions can be generated on the predicted segmentation maps, reducing the diagnosis cost. Simultaneously, the detection results conversely refine the segmentation map by a post-processing procedure, which significantly improves the segmentation accuracy.

METHODS We enrolled 32 high-frequency episodic migraine subjects (age 44.8  11.9 years, 11.0  2.2 migraine days, 11.5  2.1 headache days, 7 females). After a 28-day baseline period, subjects underwent 4 subsequent onabotulinum toxin-A treatments according to the phase III research evaluating migraine prophylaxis therapy (PREEMPT) paradigm, 12-weeks apart. The primary outcome was the reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline in the 12-week period following the last onabotulinum toxin-A treatment. RESULTS Onabotulinum toxin-A reduced monthly migraine days by 3.68 days (-33.1%, p < 0.01). Thirty-nine percent of the patients experienced a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days. Onabotulinum toxin-A also reduced the number of headache days (-33.9%, p < 0.01) and the intake of acute medications (-22.9%, p = 0.03). Disability and quality of life (QoL) scores improved markedly (migraine disability assessment (MIDAS) -41.7%; migraine specific questionnaire (MSQ) -31.7%, p < 0.01).

This disorder affects the connective tissue and is characterized by severe bone resorption. Hajdu-Cheney syndrome most frequently affects the head and feet bones (acroosteolysis). Case report: We present an extremely rare case of a 34-year-old male with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. The patient was admitted to the Department of Oral Surgery, Medical University of Gdask, in order to perform the extraction of three teeth. These teeth were not eligible for conservative treatment and prosthetic reconstruction. The patient was treated with denosumab (angiogenesis and receptor activator of nuclear factor-B RANK ligand inhibitor, RANKL). Discussion: Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL. This drug works through a suppression of osteoclast activity. In cases of patients in which the pathway of the RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin is dysregulated, denosumab has been approved for the treatment off-label. In patients receiving denosumab, a delayed wound healing in the oral cavity and osteonecrosis may occur. Dental procedures involving the alveolar bone process (tooth extractions and bone alveoloplasty) may be a risk factor for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Spontaneous osteonecrosis is rarely observed. MRONJ consists of the destruction of exposed bone, with the exposure persisting for a minimum of 6C8 weeks. This is the first article about an HCS patient treated with denosumab who underwent invasive oral surgery procedures.

DESIGN: This pragmatic trial compares an asynchronous form of CBT-CP that uses interactive voice response (IVR) to allow patients to participate from their home (IVR CBT-CP) with synchronous CBT-CP delivered by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinician. Veterans (n=764; 50% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4 months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change, are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be performed. SUMMARY: This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost, and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in the health system. If one of the interventions emerges as superior, resources can be directed to this modality. If both treatments are effective, patient preferences and health care system factors will take precedence when making referrals.

Two of the three peaks of infection correlated with the germicidal solar flux received in Argentina, suggesting a seasonal component and a role for the virus persisting in the environment. A massive public gathering crowding the presidential square in Buenos Aires, during which nearly half of those present were without face masks, did not alter the infection curve in that city. Comparative epidemiological data (standardized per million inhabitants) shows that COVID-19 in Uruguay, a neighboring country whose capital is at a similar latitude than Buenos Aires and who did not mandate lock-downs or curfews, progressed much slower (until vaccination started) than in Argentina. The number of yearly deaths caused by respiratory diseases and influenza in Argentina before the pandemic was similar to the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 cumulated on April 25, 2021, more than a year after the pandemic started.

Several treatment strategies for this complication are available, but the size and quality of the scientific evidence on which these strategies are based vary considerably. The aim of this Guideline document is to assist physicians in their management decisions when treating patients with space-occupying hemispheric or cerebellar infarction. These Guidelines were developed based on the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A working group identified 13 relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote evidence-based recommendations. An expert consensus statement was provided if not enough evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. We found high-quality evidence to recommend surgical decompression to reduce the risk of death and to increase the chance of a favourable outcome in adult patients aged up to and including 60 years with space-occupying hemispheric infarction who can be treated within 48 hours of stroke onset, and low-quality evidence to support this treatment in older patients. There is continued uncertainty about the benefit and risks of surgical decompression in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction if this is done after the first 48 hours. There is also continued uncertainty about the selection of patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction for surgical decompression or drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. These Guidelines further provide details on the management of specific subgroups of patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, on the value of monitoring of intracranial pressure, and on the benefits and risks of medical treatment options.

We found that in D. virilis, a species separated from melanogaster by 40 million years of evolution, all principles are active but contribute differently to X specificity. In melanogaster, the DCC subunit MSL2 evolved intrinsic DNA-binding selectivity for rare PionX sites, which mark the X chromosome. In virilis, PionX motifs are abundant and not X-enriched. Accordingly, MSL2 lacks specific recognition. Here, roX2 RNA plays a more instructive role, counteracting a nonproductive interaction of CLAMP and modulating DCC binding selectivity. Remarkably, roX2 triggers a stable chromatin binding mode characteristic of DCC.

A high level of awareness among the public will help to implement preventive measures, particularly in the most populated regions, such as Makkah, Saudi Arabia. COVID-19 is an infectious disease and the Saudi Arabian government has taken serious precautions and implemented several preventive measures. In addition, The Ministry of Health (MOH) has launched many awareness campaigns and provided COVID-19 vaccines for free. THE OBJECTIVES: To assess the Public's level of health awareness and knowledge toward SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines among residents of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Makkah region from February 23 to March 2, 2021. The questionnaire was generated using a Google form and distributed online through social platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of five sections and six hundred participants have answered and completed all questions. Then, All data were imported into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using the statistical tools SAS version 9.4 and SPSS version 25 software. RESULTS: A total of 600 participants from the Makkah region were found to have a high level of awareness and knowledge about all aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease. For example, all participants considered coronavirus to be contagious, and 89.8% of them knew that COVID-19's symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu. Most respondents showed a high level of awareness regarding the main factors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Over 98.7% of respondents were aware of the role of gatherings and events in further spread of the virus. The participants showed a good level of awareness about other preventive measures, such as maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask. However, the respondents considered COVID-19 vaccines to be effective, but some of them were not aware of their side effects, and 38.8% planned to receive a vaccine. CONCLUSION: The residents of Makkah showed a high level of awareness about these aspects; an excellent awareness level was noted for SARS-CoV-2, means of transmission, disease symptoms and prevention of viral spread. On the other hand, the participants had less knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccines; hence, more effort is required to educate people about the safety and benefits of the vaccines.","output":"Assessment of health awareness and knowledge toward SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines among residents of Makkah, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and Astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water, in recent years other viruses, such as Aichi virus (AiV), have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods. AiV belongs to the genus Kobuvirus of the family Picornaviridae. It is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded RNA genome with positive sense (8280 nucleotides) and a poly (A) chain. AiV was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions. Furthermore, several studies conducted in Japan, Germany, France, Tunisia and Spain showed a high prevalence of AiV antibodies in adults (between 80% and 99%), which is indicative of a large exposure to this virus. The aim of this review is to bring together all the discovered information about the emerging pathogen human Aichi virus (AiV), discussing the possibles routes of transmission, new detection techniques and future research. Although AiV is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent. The low percentage of AiV detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections. Further studies will be needed to clarify the real impact of AiV in human health and its importance as a causative gastroenteritis agent worldwide.","output":"A Comprehensive Review on Human Aichi Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opioid drugs are analgesics increasingly being prescribed to control pain associated with a wide range of causes. Usage of pregnant women has dramatically increased in the past decades. Neonates born to these women are at risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS, also referred termed neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, NOWS). Negative birth outcomes linked with maternal opioid use disorder include compromised fetal growth, premature birth, reduced birthweight, and congenital defects. Such infants require lengthier hospital stays necessitating rising health care costs, and they are at greater risk for neurobehavioral and other diseases. Thus, it is essential to understand the genesis of such disorders. As the primary communication organ between mother and conceptus, the placenta itself is susceptible to opioid effects but may be key to understanding how these drugs affect long-term offspring health and how poor health outcomes may be ameliorated in utero. In this review, we will consider the evidence that placental responses are regulated through an endogenous opioid system. However, maternal consumption of opioid drugs can also bind and act through opioid receptors express by trophoblast (TB) cells of the placenta. Thus, we will also discuss the current human and rodent studies that have examined the effects of opioids on the placenta.

Here, the functional effects of S mutations have been determined by analyzing their affinity for a viral receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), and their sensitivity to Ab neutralization with viral pseudotypes.

S(GD03T0013) depended less on the hACE-2 receptor and was markedly resistant to Ab inhibition. Unexpectedly, Abs that neutralized most human S glycoproteins enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus S glycoproteins. The mechanism of enhancement involved the interaction of Abs with conformational epitopes in the hACE-2-binding domain.

This paper uses social network analysis to discuss the characteristics of the collaborative innovation network of CFA comprehensive utilization technology in China. Then, this paper uses regression analysis to explore the differences in innovation performance under different research and development (R&D) backgrounds. The results show that (1) based on the network-level indicators, the collaborative innovation scale has an obvious trend of expanding. Partnerships increased from 20 to 574. Meanwhile, the network shows obvious scale-free and small-world characteristics, indicating that innovation resources are concentrated in a few organizations.

Enterprises account for the highest proportion (73%) and have the highest centrality (8.3). The betweenness centrality of the universities is 265, and only 14% of the organizations are universities which means universities play an important role in connecting different organizations in the network, but their participation in the collaborative innovation is insufficient. (3) Based on the collaborative relationship-level indicators, the cooperation is lack of depth. Only a small number of organizations, especially enterprises, have stable partners, showing the characteristic of low cooperation width and high cooperation depth, which means fewer partners but more frequently collaborative innovation.

Therefore, we extended comprehensive sex-specific, whole-body organ resolved models of human metabolism with the necessary reactions to replicate SARS-CoV-2 in the lung as well as selected peripheral organs. Using this comprehensive host-virus model, we obtained the following key results: 1. The predicted maximal possible virus shedding rate was limited by isoleucine availability. 2. The supported initial viral load depended on the increase in CD4+ T-cells, consistent with the literature. 3. During viral infection, the whole-body metabolism changed including the blood metabolome, which agreed well with metabolomic studies from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. 4. The virus shedding rate could be reduced by either inhibition of the guanylate kinase 1 or availability of amino acids, e.g., in the diet. 5. The virus variants achieved differed in their maximal possible virus shedding rates, which could be inversely linked to isoleucine occurrences in the sequences. Taken together, this study presents the metabolic crosstalk between host and virus and emphasis the role of amino acid metabolism during SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular of isoleucine. As such, it provides an example of how computational modelling can complement more canonical approaches to gain insight into host-virus crosstalk and to identify potential therapeutic strategies.","output":"Whole-body metabolic modelling predicts isoleucine dependency of SARS-CoV-2 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy faced the COVID-19 crisis in the early stages of the pandemic In the present study, a SEIR compartment mathematical model has been proposed The model considers four stages of infection: susceptible(S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered (R) Basic reproduction number R0 which estimates the transmission potential of a disease has been calculated by the next-generation matrix technique We have estimated the model parameters using real data for the Coronavirus transmission To get a dipper insight into the transmission dynamics, we have also studied four of the most pandemic affected regions of Italy Basic reproduction number stood differently for different regions of Italy i e Lombardia (2 1382), Veneto (1 7512), Emilia Romagna (1 6331), Piemonte (1 9099) and for Italy at 2 0683 The sensitivity of R0 corresponding to various disease transmission parameters has also been demonstrated via numerical simulations Besides, it has been demonstrated with the help of simulations that earlier lockdown and rapid isolation of infective individuals would have been helpful in a dual way;by substantially reducing the number of susceptible people on one hand and preponing the end of the pandemic on the other This paper also includes complete theoretical analysis of the proposed model including the epidemic feasibility of the model and existence of endemic equilibrium point We have also derived the conditions under which the disease became endemic Since the existence of an endemic equilibrium point refers to the possibility of backward bifurcation, we have given a detailed analysis regarding the same All the theoretical analysis is supported by detailed numerical simulations to understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 While analyzing different regions of Italy it was found that Lombardia was the hardest hit and had the highest number of infectives We have also forecasted the future scenario of the pandemic in Italy The model predicts that the COVID-19 epidemic shall die out from the worst affected Lombardia region by approximately by November 2020 ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"A Mathematical Model for COVID-19 in Italy with Possible Control Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spreading across the world, protective measures for containing the virus are essential, especially as long as no vaccine or effective treatment is available.

In total, 41 articles (including 23 methadone, 7 buprenorphine, 6 naltrexone, and 5 mixed modalities) were included in this review. For each primary outcome area, there was a small number of studies that produced findings suggestive of a supportive or detrimental role of concurrent cannabis use, but the majority of studies reported that cannabis use was not statistically significantly associated with the outcome. No studies of naltrexone treatment demonstrated significantly worse outcomes for cannabis users. We identified methodological shortcomings and future research priorities, including exploring the potential role of adjunct cannabis use for improving opioid craving and withdrawal during MOUD.

Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19. Methods We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications. All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs. Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission. Results Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.6513.12 and 67.7712.84 years (P=0.000), respectively. The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B. But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups. Conclusions We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups.

In the current emergent situation, drug repurposing of well-known traditional and/or approved drugs could be the most effective strategy. Herein, through computational approaches, we aimed to screen 14 natural compounds from limonoids and terpenoids class for their ability to inhibit the key therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Among these, some limonoids, namely deacetylnomilin, ichangin and nomilin, and the terpenoid ?-amyrin provided good interaction energies with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) in molecular dynamic simulation. Interestingly, deacetylnomilin and ichangin showed direct interaction with the catalytic dyad of the enzyme so supporting their potential role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication and growth. On the contrary, despite the good affinity with the spike protein RBD site, all the selected phytochemicals lose contact with the amino acid residues over the course of 120ns-long molecular dynamics simulations therefore suggesting they scarcely can interfere in SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor.

AIM: Building upon well-established models to estimate influenza-related mortality, we propose a new statistical Attributable Mortality Model (AttMOMO), which estimates mortality attributable to one or more pathogens simultaneously (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza viruses), while adjusting for seasonality and excess temperatures. METHODS: Data from Nationwide Danish registers from 2014-week(W)W27 to 2020-W22 were used to exemplify utilities of the model, and to estimate COVID-19 and influenza attributable mortality from 2019-W40 to 2020-W20. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was registered in Denmark from 2020-W09. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 in Denmark increased steeply, and peaked in 2020-W14. As preventive measures and national lockdown were implemented from 2020-W12, the attributable mortality started declining within a few weeks. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 from 2020-W09 to 2020-W20 was estimated to 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.0 to 20.4) per 100,000 person-years. The 2019/20 influenza season was mild with few deaths attributable to influenza, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 5.4) per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSION: AttMOMO estimates mortality attributable to several pathogens simultaneously, providing a fuller picture of mortality by COVID-19 during the pandemic in the context of other seasonal diseases and mortality patterns. Using Danish data, we show that the model accurately estimates mortality attributable to COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. We propose using standardised indicators for pathogen circulation in the population, to make estimates comparable between countries and applicable for timely monitoring.","output":"Estimates of mortality attributable to COVID-19: a statistical model for monitoring COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, Denmark, spring 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common clinical features of COVID\\\\19 are increasingly known but cutaneous manifestations are rarely described among healthcare workers.

Herein, we performed a systematic review and indirect meta-analysis of available literature on outcomes of fusion surgery after use of bisphosphonates or Teriparatide. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of all databases (Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus) to identify studies assessing outcomes of spinal fusion among osteoporotic patients after use of Teriparatide or bisphosphonate. Four authors independently screened electronic search results, and all four authors independently performed study selection. Two authors performed independent data extraction and assessed the studies' risk of bias assessment using standardized forms of Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). RESULTS Nineteen studies were included in the final analysis. A total of 13 studies evaluated the difference in fusion rate between bisphosphonates and Teriparatide or control group. Fusion rate was higher for bisphosphonates (effect size (ES) 83%, 95% CI 77-89%) compared with Teriparatide (ES 71%, 95% CI 57-85%), with the p value for heterogeneity between groups without statistical significance (p = 0.123).

Animal models of infection with a number of these viruses have contributed to our knowledge of their pathogenesis and have been crucial for the development of therapeutics and vaccines that have been approved for human use. Most of these models use artificially high doses of virus, ensuring lethality in pre-clinical drug development studies. However, this can have a significant effect on the immune response generated. Here I discuss how the dose of antigen or pathogen is a critical determinant of immune responses and suggest that the current study of viruses in animal models should take this into account when developing and studying animal models of disease. This can have implications for determination of immune correlates of protection against disease as well as informing relevant vaccination and therapeutic strategies.","output":"Pathogen Dose in Animal Models of Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Infections and the Potential Impact on Studies of the Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The delivery of healthy babies is the primary goal of obstetric care. Many technologies have been developed to reduce both maternal and fetal risks for poor outcomes. For 50 years, electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) has been used extensively in labor attempting to prevent a large proportion of neonatal encephalopathy and cerebral palsy. However, even key opinion leaders admit that EFM has mostly failed to achieve this goal. We believe this situation emanates from a fundamental misunderstanding of differences between screening and diagnostic tests, considerable subjectivity and inter-observer variability in EFM interpretation, failure to address the pathophysiology of fetal compromise, and a tunnel vision focus. To address these suboptimal results, several iterations of increasingly sophisticated analyses have intended to improve the situation. We believe that part of the continuing problem is that the focus of EFM has been too narrow ignoring important contextual issues such as maternal, fetal, and obstetrical risk factors, and increased uterine contraction frequency. All of these can significantly impact the application of EFM to intrapartum care. We have recently developed a new clinical approach, the Fetal Reserve Index (FRI), contextualizing EFM interpretation. Our data suggest the FRI is capable of providing higher accuracy and earlier detection of emerging fetal compromise. Over time, artificial intelligence/machine learning approaches will likely improve measurements and interpretation of FHR characteristics and other relevant variables. Such future developments will allow us to develop more comprehensive models that increase the interpretability and utility of interfaces for clinical decision making during the intrapartum period.","output":"Changing Perspectives of Electronic Fetal Monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fact that the COVID-19 fatality rate varies by sex and age is poorly understood. Notably, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly depends on the control of cytokine storm and the increasingly recognized pathological role of uncontrolled neutrophil activation. Here, we used an integrative approach with publicly available RNA-Seq data sets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, according to sex and age. Female and young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with male and elderly patients, indicating a stronger immune modulation. Among them, we found an association between upregulated cytokine/chemokine- and downregulated neutrophil-related DEGs. This was correlated with a closer relationship between female and young subjects, while the relationship between male and elderly patients was closer still. The association between these cytokine/chemokines and neutrophil DEGs is marked by a strongly correlated interferome network. Here, female patients exhibited reduced transcriptional levels of key proinflammatory/neutrophil-related genes, such as CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1?, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL, compared with male patients. These genes are well known to be protective against inflammatory damage. Therefore, our work suggests specific immune-regulatory pathways associated with sex and age of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provides a possible association between inverse modulation of cytokine/chemokine and neutrophil transcriptional signatures.","output":"The relationship between cytokine and neutrophil gene network distinguishes SARS-CoV-2-infected patients by sex and age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two carotenoid 1,2-hydratase (CrtC) genes from the photosynthetic bacteria Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Thiocapsa roseopersicina were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in an active form and purified by affinity chromatography.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the indirect impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on sociodemographic inequalities in healthcare utilisation in seven Italian areas. METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we evaluated whether COVID-19 modified the association between educational level or deprivation and indicators of hospital utilisation and quality of care. We also assessed variations in gradients by sex and age class. We estimated age-standardised rates and prevalence and their relative per cent changes comparing pandemic (2020) and pre-pandemic (2018C2019) periods, and the Relative Index of Inequalities (RIIs) fitting multivariable Poisson models with an interaction between socioeconomic position and period. RESULTS: Compared with 2018C2019, hospital utilisation and, to a lesser extent, timeliness of procedures indicators fell during the first months of 2020. Larger declines were registered among women, the elderly and the low educated resulting in a shrinkage (or widening if RII <1) of the educational gradients for most of the indicators. Timeliness of procedures indicators did not show any educational gradient neither before nor during the pandemic. Inequalities by deprivation were nuanced and did not substantially change in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The socially patterned reduction of hospital utilisation may lead to a potential exacerbation of health inequalities among groups who were already vulnerable before the pandemic.

In addition, ticks are vectors of zoonoses of public health concern, and scarce information is available from this country. In an effort to contribute to the prevention of zoonotic infectious diseases affecting humans and animals, the molecular screening of certain tick-related microorganisms collected on cattle in Angola was performed under a One Health scope. METHODS: Ticks collected from cattle in Cubal (Benguela Province, Angola) in July 2017 were analysed in pools using specific PCR assays for bacteria (Rickettsia, Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia, Coxiella and Spiroplasma) and protozoa (Theileria and Babesia) detection. RESULTS: A total of 124 tick specimens were grouped in 25 pools (two Amblyomma variegatum, three Hyalomma truncatum, 16 Rhipicephalus decoloratus, two Rhipicephalus duttoni, one Rhipicephalus evertsi mimeticus and one Rhipicephalus sp.). The amplified microorganisms were (pools): Rickettsia africae (two A. variegatum and one R. decoloratus), Rickettsia aeschlimannii (three H. truncatum), Ehrlichia spp. (six R. decoloratus), Coxiella spp. (all but H. truncatum), Francisella sp. (one H. truncatum), Spiroplasma sp. closely related to Spiroplasma ixodetis (three R. decoloratus), Babesia bigemina (two R. decoloratus) and Babesia spp. (two A. variegatum). The obtained nucleotide sequences from Ehrlichia spp., two Coxiella genotypes (from R. duttoni and Rhipicephalus sp.), Francisella sp. and Babesia spp. (from A. variegatum) reached low identities with known genetically characterized species. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the circulation in Angola of the pathogen R. aeschlimannii and potential novel tick-related microorganisms belonging to Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Francisella, Spiroplasma and Babesia spp. and corroborates the presence of R. africae and B. bigemina.

The use of viscous solutions allows a reduction in repeated injections, snare resections and procedural time. The aim was to describe the outcome of EMR of large LSTs performed at the time of index colonoscopy, using ORISE gel (Boston Scientific). METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed retrieving patients who underwent EMR of large colonic LSTs at the time of index colonoscopy. EMR was performed after dynamic injection of ORISE gel to create a submucosal cushion. Procedural parameters, together with pathological and endoscopic outcomes, were analyzed. RESULTS Five patients [three males, median age 65 (45-70) years] were included. Median LST size was 35 mm (25-40). Median procedure time was 8 min (range 3-13). En bloc resection was achieved in one out of five cases; four out of five were planned as piecemeal resections. A median of 10 mL (10-20) of viscous solution was injected. R0 resection was achieved in the single case who underwent en bloc EMR, whereas it was not assessable in the case of piecemeal resections. One self-limiting bleeding was observed. CONCLUSION The use of ORISE gel allows a well-tolerated and rapid performance of EMR of large colonic LSTs even at the time of index colonoscopy.

OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate reproducibility of the Thermo Scientific SureTect Salmonella species PCR Assay in a collaborative study using a challenging matrix, cocoa powder. To extend the scope of the method. METHOD: In the collaborative study, the candidate method was compared to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration/Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA/BAM) Chapter 5 Salmonella reference method. The candidate method used two PCR thermocyclers, the Applied Biosystems? QuantStudio? 5 Real-Time PCR instrument (QS5) and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument (7500 Fast). Fourteen participants from 9 laboratories located within the United States and Europe were solicited for the collaborative study, with 12 participants submitting valid data. Three levels of contamination were evaluated for each matrix. Statistical analysis was conducted according to the probability of detection (POD) statistical model. In addition, 11 matrix studies were performed comparing the candidate method to the FDA/BAM Chapter 5 or U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (USDA FSIS MLG) 4.10 Isolation and Identification of Salmonella from Meat, Poultry, Pasteurized Egg, and Siluriformes (Fish) Products and Carcass and Environmental Sponges reference method.

RESULTS: Of the 298 participants with physical disabilities (Age(M) = 49yr; 62% females; 66% using mobility aids), 66% reported decreased PA compared to the same period in the previous year, 45% reported declined health status due to increased pain and reduced physical functioning. Regarding psychological need satisfaction, it was primarily the change in need for autonomy and competence for PA that were associated with change in PA and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants indicated decreased PA and about half decreased Health status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS Bioinformatics analyses were performed to search the homologous proteins of the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase from the GenBank and PDB database. A 3D model of the proteinase was constructed by using homology modeling technique. Targeting to the 3D model and its X-ray crystal structure of the main proteinase (Mpro) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), virtual screening was performed employing molecular docking method to identify possible 3CL proteinase inhibitors from small molecular databases. RESULTS Sequence alignment indicated that the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase was extremely homologous to TGEV Mpro, especially the substrate-binding pocket (active site). Accordingly, a 3D model for the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase was constructed based on the crystal structure of TGEV Mpro. The 3D model adopts a similar fold of the TGEV Mpro, its structure and binding pocket feature are almost as same as that of TGEV Mpro. The tested virtual screening indicated that 73 available proteinase inhibitors in the MDDR database might dock into both the binding pockets of the TGEV Mpro and the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase. CONCLUSIONS Either the 3D model of the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase or the X-ray crystal structure of the TGEV Mpro may be used as a starting point for design anti-SARS drugs.

The difference of coagulation indicators and the incidence of DIC were compared between severe cases and nonsevere cases as well as nonsurvivors and survivors, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 22 Chinese studies involving 4,889 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients were included. The average D-dimer value of COVID-19 patients is 0.67 g/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.78), and 29.3% (95% CI: 20.1-38.5%) of patients showed elevated D-dimer values. Severe patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) compared with nonsevere patients. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher D-dimer levels, prolonged PT, and decreased platelet count compared with survivors.

It consists of two stages: the preliminary basic written test and the re-examination in form of both written tests and interviews. With the spread of COVID-19, the traditional on-site re-examination of postgraduates must be changed to online re-examination. By comparing the re-examination process and admission results of online and on-site re-examination, we studied the feasibility of online re-examination for postgraduates and measures to improve it. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from the Unified National Graduate Entrance Examination. Our sample population was the applicants to Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) who completed re-examinations. In total, 281 records were successively selected from March 2017 to May 2020. By comparing the re-examination process and admission results of the 2020 online re-examination with those of the 2017-2019 on-site re-examinations, we analyzed the process, difficulties and improvement of online re-examination. RESULTS: A total of 281 subjects were included, of whom 77.9% completed an on-site re-examination in 2017-2019 and 22.1% completed the 2020 online re-examination. In the on-site re-examinations, 70.8% of the students were admitted, and in the online re-examination, 74.2% of the students were admitted. There were no significant differences between the students who completed on-site and online re-examinations in terms of gender, recent graduation, cultivation type, graduate from a key university, and admission (P>0.05). The on-site and online re-examination results were very similar among the admitted students. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that online re-examination had no effect on student admissions. Students seeking professional degree were less likely to be admitted than those seeking academic degree, and those with a better standardized rank in medicine and a better standardized rank of re-examination score were more likely to be admitted. CONCLUSIONS: The online re-examination implemented in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic achieved the same selective effect as on-site re-examination. Effective time management, a standardized test question template, well-trained staff and effective technology are the keys to success.","output":"Online re-examination of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence to suggest that exposure to a high concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) can lead to a higher incidence of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) in children; however, such an association remains understudied in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the limited availability of exposure data. This study explored this association by using the satellite-detected tropospheric NO(2) concentrations measured by Sentinel-5 Precursor and ARI symptoms in children under age five collected in the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Senegal. METHODS: We matched the daily tropospheric NO(2) exposure with the individual ARI symptoms according to the DHS survey clusters spatially and temporally and conducted a logistic regression analysis to estimate the association of exposure to NO(2) with ARI symptoms in two preceding weeks. RESULTS: We observed a positive association between exposure to continuous levels of NO(2) and ARI symptoms after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.27 per 10 mol/m(2), 95% CI: 1.06 C 1.52). When the association was further examined by quartile exposure categories, the 4th quartile category was positively associated with symptoms of ARI after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.082.69). This suggests that exposure to certain high levels of NO(2) is associated with the increased risk of children having symptoms of ARI in Senegal. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for increased research on the effects of ambient NO(2) exposure in Africa as well as the need for more robust, ground-based air monitoring in the region. For a country like Senegal, where more than 90% of the population lives in areas that do not meet the national air quality standards, it is urgently required to implement air pollution prevention efforts to protect children from the health hazards of air pollution.","output":"Association between satellite-detected tropospheric nitrogen dioxide and acute respiratory infections in children under age five in Senegal: spatio-temporal analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected many people's psychological health. Impacts may be particularly severe among socially vulnerable populations such as college students, a group predisposed to mental health problems. Outdoor recreation and visits to greenspaces such as parks offer promising pathways for addressing the mental health challenges associated with COVID-19. During the early stages of the pandemic (MarchCMay 2020), we surveyed 1280 college students at four large public universities across the United States (U.S.) to assess how, and why, outdoor recreation and park use changed since the emergence of COVID-19. We also measured students' self-reported levels of emotional distress (a proxy for psychological health) and assessed potential demographic and contextual correlates of distress, including county-level per capita park area and greenness, using generalized linear models. We found that 67% of students reported limiting outdoor activities and 54% reported reducing park use during the pandemic. Students who reduced their use of outdoor spaces cited structural reasons (e.g., lockdowns), concerns about viral transmission, and negative emotions that obstructed active lifestyles. Students who maintained pre-pandemic park use levels expressed a desire to be outdoors in nature, often with the explicit goal of improving mental and physical health. Emotional distress among students was widespread. Models showed higher levels of emotional distress were associated with reducing park use during the pandemic and residing in counties with a smaller area of parks per capita.

The disproportionate number of foreign-born workers employed in meat and poultry processing reflects structural, social, and economic inequities that likely contribute to an increased COVID-19 incidence in this population* (5). In May 2020, the Maryland Department of Health and CDC investigated factors that might affect person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons who worked at two poultry processing facilities.? A survey administered to 359 workers identified differences in risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between workers born outside the United States and U.S.-born workers. Compared with U.S.-born workers, foreign-born workers had higher odds of working in fixed locations on the production floor (odds ratio [OR] for cutup and packaging jobs = 4.8), of having shared commutes (OR = 1.9), and of living with other poultry workers (OR = 6.0). They had lower odds of participating in social gatherings (OR for visits to family = 0.2; OR for visits to friends = 0.4), and they visited fewer businesses in the week before the survey than did their U.S.-born coworkers. Some workplace risk factors can be mitigated through engineering and administrative controls focused on the production floor, and this will be of particular benefit to the foreign-born workers concentrated in these areas. Employers and health departments can also partner with local organizations to disseminate culturally and linguistically tailored messages about risk reduction behaviors in community settings, including shared transportation and household members dwelling in close quarters.?.","output":"Factors That Might Affect SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Foreign-Born and U.S.-Born Poultry Facility Workers  Maryland, May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An expert in resiliency psychology discusses stress and resilience in nursing today, including advice on bolstering resilience and recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Resilience in a time of crisis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sejak ditetapkan oleh World Health Organisation (WHO) sebagai pandemic global maka perlu keseriusan dalam penanganan virus COVID-19 ini.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family and act as ligand-activated transcription factors. There are three different isotypes of PPARs: PPAR, PPAR, and PPAR/. PPAR is an established regulator of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that PPAR exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in multiple disease models. PPAR can also modulate the activation and polarization of macrophages, regulate the function of dendritic cells and mediate T cell survival, activation, and differentiation. In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways and biological functions of PPAR and focus on how PPAR and its agonists play protective roles in autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis.","output":"The roles of PPAR and its agonists in autoimmune diseases: A comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the direction of U.S. Northern Command for COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, approximately 500 Navy Reserve medical professionals were deployed to the New York City area from April to June 2020.

METHODS: Uni-list capture-recapture models were applied to the frequency distributions of index cases to inform two questions: (1) the unobserved number of index cases with contacts, and (2) the unobserved number of index cases with secondary cases among their contacts. RESULTS: Generalized linear models (using Poisson and logistic families) did not return any significant predictor (age, sex, nationality, number of contacts per case) on the risk of transmission and hence capture-recapture models did not adjust for observed heterogeneity. Best fitting models, a zero truncated negative binomial for question 1 and zero-truncated Poisson for question 2, returned sensitivity estimates for contact tracing performance of 77.6% (95% CI = 73.75C81.54%) and 67.6% (95% CI = 53.84C81.38%), respectively. A zero-inflated negative binomial model on the distribution of index cases with secondary cases allowed the estimation of the effective reproduction number at 0.14 (95% CI = 0.09C0.22), and the overdispersion parameter at 0.1. CONCLUSION: Completeness of COVID-19 contact tracing in Thailand during the first wave appeared moderate, with around 67% of infectious transmission chains detected.

However, research in such interventions delivered online is scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of a digital multicomponent interventionCOPe-supportin improving carers' mental wellbeing and caregiving-related outcomes. METHODS: In this two-arm, individually randomised, superiority trial, people aged 18 years or older who provided at least weekly support in any format for a relative or close friend affected by psychosis across England were randomly assigned (1:1) to either COPe-support or a passive online information resource using an independent online system. Participants were recruited through 30 mental health UK National Health Service trusts. The study team were masked to allocation and assessment of outcomes as all data collection took place online. Participants had access to either condition for 40 weeks and were advised to spend at least half an hour per week over the initial 20 weeks to go through materials at their own pace and to allow time to integrate knowledge and skills learned into practice. It was not feasible to mask participants or the online facilitator to intervention allocation. COPe-support provided psychoeducation on psychosis-related caregiving strategies and forums with professionals and other carers, and the control intervention comprised a passive online information resource. The primary outcome at 20 weeks was mental wellbeing measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS; minimally clinically important difference [MCID] 3). This trial is registered with ISRCTN, 89563420. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2018, and Feb 14, 2020, 407 participants were randomly assigned, with 204 allocated to COPe-support and 203 allocated to control. The participants (mean age 531 years, SD 132) were mostly female (330 [81%] of 407 participants) and White (359 [88%] of 407 participants). 346 (85%) of 407 participants provided primary endpoint data, 174 (85%) of 204 participants in the COPe-support group and 172 (85%) of 203 participants in the control group. The mean WEMWBS score at 20 weeks was 445 (SD 831) for the COPe-support group and 433 (919) for the control group. We found no evidence of a difference in wellbeing between the two groups (adjusted mean difference 037, 95% CI C114 to 188; p=063). In the COPe-support group, 106 (52%) of 204 participants met the complier definition of a minimum of two logins in separate weeks.

METHODS: Nonambulant patients with DMD (age 8 years) were included. Four-point Dixon MRI scans of the right upper arm were performed at baseline and at the 12-, 18-, or 24-month follow-up. Elbow flexor FFs were determined from 5 central slices. Loss of hand-to-mouth movement was determined at study visits and by phone calls every 4 months. FFs were fitted to a sigmoidal curve by use of a mixed model with random slope to predict individual trajectories. The added predictive value of elbow flexor FF to age at loss of hand-to-mouth movement was calculated from a Cox model with the predicted FF as a time-varying covariate, yielding a hazard ratio. RESULTS: Forty-eight MRIs of 20 patients with DMD were included. The hazard ratio of a percent-point increase in elbow flexor FF for the time to loss of hand-to-mouth movement was 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.04C1.21; p = 0.002). This corresponded to a 3.13-fold increase in the instantaneous risk of loss of hand-to-mouth movement in patients with a 10Cpercent points higher elbow flexor FF at any age.

The primary objective of these documents would be to begin reopening societies, restarting economies and returning to a pre-pandemic normalcy. This article aims to present the start of a conceptual documentary analysis of (proposed and existing) COVID-19 immunity passports in order to more fully center their documentary status within research, considerations and conversations about their potential roles, impacts and implications. Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by Paula A. Treichler's argument for the importance of theoretical thought for untangling the socio-cultural phenomena of epidemics, and drawing upon interdisciplinary theories of documentation, identity and public health, combined with recent news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, this article provides a contemporary overview and conceptual analysis of emerging documentary regimes of COVID-19 immunity verification involving immunity or vaccine passports. Findings: Three major interconnected objectives could be fulfilled by immunity passports. First, they would establish and materialize an official identity of COVID-19 immune for people possessing the formal document. Second, they would serve as material evidence establishing and verifying individuals' immunity, vaccination or risk-free status from the coronavirus that would, in term, determine and regulate their movements and other privileges. Third, they would create tangible links between individuals and governments' official or recognized identity category of COVID-19 immune. Immunity passports would, therefore, help enable and enforce governmental authority and power by situating individuals within documentary regimes of COVID-19 immunity verification. Research limitations/implications: In the expanding interdisciplinary literature on COVID-19 immunity passports, sometimes also called certificates, licenses, or passes, there appears to be only minimal reference to their documentary instantiations, whether physical, digital, and/or hybrid documents. As yet, there is not any specific documentary approach to or analysis of immunity passports as kinds of documentation. A documentary approach helps to illuminate and emphasize the materiality of and ontological considerations concerning the coronavirus pandemic and its associated kinds of immunity or vaccination. Social implications: By beginning an exploration of what makes immunity passports thinkable as a public health response to the coronavirus pandemic, this article illuminates these health and identity documents' material implications for, and effects on, individuals and societies. This article, therefore, helps shed light on what immunity passports reveal about the complicated and contested intersections of identity, documentation, public health and socio-political control and discipline.

Existing projects developing healthcare IT mostly disregard the potential and importance of incorporating user feedback and proper evaluation measures to gain user feedback throughout the development process. We therefore provide methodological guidance for evaluation in a stepwise user-centred design process. METHODS: Based on a literature review we propose adequate methods for data collection in each phase of participatory and user-centred healthcare IT development. In order to provide an orientation within the plethora of development processes used in practice, we consolidate a generic blueprint process from the literature review. The applicability of our methodological guidance is shown in three diverse use cases from the field of integrated care. RESULTS: From 14 literature items, we identified common evaluation methods including, among others, interviews, focus groups, and surveys. These methods can be associated to six typical development phases that could be derived from research: State of the Art Research, Requirement Analysis, Conceptual Prototype, Preliminary Prototype, Full Prototype, Full Application. The use cases demonstrate the value of qualitative methods and mixed methods designs. DISCUSSION: Our methodological guidance has proven applicable for designing healthcare IT solutions from scratch C both for patient and professional settings C and to develop a platform for combining existing component-based solutions. In integrated care settings, where a wide range of stakeholders with multiple needs exist, we thus provide methodological guidance on how to involve users in the development process.

CONCLUSION: To date, there are no African studies reporting on maternal mortality from COVID 19. This study provided valuable insight into maternal deaths due to COVID among South African women. COVID 19 is a novel cause of maternal death that has increased the death rate among South African pregnant women. Hypertensive women are at increased risk of death. They should be routinely tested for COVID. Women are at risk of death during the third trimester of pregnancy. High rate of stillborn is a concern. Decision to deliver earlier should be an option. High HIV rate and LDH count should alert health care workers to perform these tests among all COVID positive mothers.","output":"Maternal mortality from COVID 19 among South African pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the urology providers' (through a range of training levels) experience utilizing telemedicine given the rapid nationwide implementation of telemedicine in urology practices due to COVID-19. Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the Patient Assessment of Communication of Telehealth which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in 2 categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine. Nevertheless, many providers are hesitant to schedule surgery via telemedicine. Providers would benefit from formal training in telemedicine.","output":"Adopting Telehealth During The COVID-19 Era: The Urologist's Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From colored pixels to hyper-realistic 3D landscapes of virtual reality, video games have evolved immensely over the last few decades.

Thus, these changes in living conditions have had deleterious consequences on the behavior of PWD and subsequently on their caregivers' mental health, the two being linked. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to examine changes in behavior among PWD and to look for associations between the evolution of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregivers' mental health in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: The study was conducted among caregivers of PWD living at home in France. Caregivers were interviewed via an anonymous cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown between April 15 and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a relative living at home participated in the study; 43.3%of the PWD presented a worsening of BPSD during the lockdown. With multivariate logistic regressions, a significant association was observed between \\"more BPSD\\" and burden, anxiety and depression, between \\"BPSD equivalent\\" and anxiety and depression, and between \\"emerging BPSD\\" and only depression. CONCLUSION: The lockdown seems to have an impact on behavioral disorders in PWD and these disorders are associated with poorer mental health of caregivers. Our findings suggest attention should be given to caregivers of PWD who have BPSD before lockdown and the need for continued consultations and professional help in case of new lockdowns.","output":"COVID-19: Association Between Increase of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia During Lockdown and Caregivers' Poor Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 outbreak challenged health systems around the world to design and implement cost-effective devices to complement mechanical ventilators that can be produced locally. Masi works as a mechanical ventilator to bring life-support by automating a resucitation bag to closely control ventilatory parameters. Methods This pre-clinical trial was designed to study the physiological responses of healthy swine maintained under volume- or pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation. Thus, physiological parameters were measured in eight sedated animals (t 0 ), prior to inducing deep anesthesia, as well as during the next six hours of mechanical ventilation with Masi (t 1 - 7 ). Hemodynamic conditions were monitored periodically using a gas analyzer machine (i.e. BEecf, HCO 3 , SaO 2 , lactate, pH, PaO 2 , PaCO 2 ) and a capnometer (i.e. ETCO 2 ). Electrocardiogram, echocardiography and lung ultrasonography were performed to detect in vivo alterations in these vital organs and pathological findings from necropsy are reported. Results The mechanical ventilator properly controlled physiological levels of blood biochemistry such as oxygenation parameters (PaO 2 , PaCO 2 , SaO 2 , ETCO 2 ), acid-base equilibrium (pH, HCO 3 ? , BEecf), and perfusion of tissues (lactate levels). In addition, histopathological analysis showed no evidence of acute tissue damage in lung, heart, liver, kidney, or brain. Moreover, all animals were able to breathe spontaneously after undergoing mechanical ventilation controlled by Masi device. The results demonstrate that Masi mechanical ventilator allows the regulation of body gas exchange and maintain the physiological parameters in the normal range for swine. Conclusions These preclinical data, added to the appropriate performance of Masi in engineering laboratory tests, support the biological safety of the medical device to move forward to further evaluation in clinical studies.","output":"Biological evaluation of a mechanical ventilator that operates by controlling an automated manual resuscitator.

To date, few studies have investigated longitudinal changes in immunothrombosis biomarkers in these patients. Furthermore, how these longitudinal changes differ between coronavirus disease 2019 patients and noncoronavirus disease septic patients with pneumonia are unknown. OBJECTIVES: In this pilot observational study, we investigated the utility of immunothrombosis biomarkers for distinguishing between coronavirus disease 2019 patients and noncoronavirus disease septic patients with pneumonia. We also evaluated the utility of the biomarkers for predicting ICU mortality in these patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The participants were ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 14), noncoronavirus disease septic patients with pneumonia (n = 19), and healthy age-matched controls (n = 14). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nine biomarkers were measured from plasma samples (on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and/or 14). Analysis was based on binomial logit models and receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS: Cell-free DNA, d-dimer, soluble endothelial protein C receptor, protein C, soluble thrombomodulin, fibrinogen, citrullinated histones, and thrombin-antithrombin complexes have significant powers for distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 patients from healthy individuals. In comparison, fibrinogen, soluble endothelial protein C receptor, antithrombin, and cell-free DNA have significant powers for distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 from pneumonia patients. The predictors of ICU mortality differ between the two patient groups: soluble thrombomodulin and citrullinated histones for coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and protein C and cell-free DNA or fibrinogen for pneumonia patients. In both patient groups, the most recent biomarker values have stronger prognostic value than their ICU day 1 values. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Fibrinogen, soluble endothelial protein C receptor, antithrombin, and cell-free DNA have utility for distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 patients from noncoronavirus disease septic patients with pneumonia. The most important predictors of ICU mortality are soluble thrombomodulin/citrullinated histones for coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and protein C/cell-free DNA for noncoronavirus disease pneumonia patients. This hypothesis-generating study suggests that the pathophysiology of immunothrombosis differs between the two patient groups.","output":"Immunothrombosis Biomarkers for Distinguishing Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients From Noncoronavirus Disease Septic Patients With Pneumonia and for Predicting ICU Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical procedures that produce aerosolized particles are under great scrutiny due to the recent concerns surrounding the COVID-19 virus and increased risk for nosocomial infections. For example, thoracostomies, tracheotomies and intubations/extubations produce aerosols that can linger in the air. The lingering time is dependent on particle size where, e.g., 500 m (0.5 mm) particles may quickly fall to the floor, while 1 m particles may float for extended lengths of time. Here, a method is presented to characterize the size of <40 m to >600 m particles resulting from surgery in an operating room (OR). The particles are measured in-situ (next to a patient on an operating table) through a 75mm aperture in a a400 mm rectangular enclosure with minimal flow restriction. The particles and gasses exiting a patient are vented through an enclosed laser sheet while a camera captures images of the side-scattered light from the entrained particles. A similar optical configuration was described by Anfinrud et al.; however, we present here an extended method which provides a calibration method for determining particle size. The use of a laser sheet with side-scattered light provides a large FOV and bright image of the particles; however, the particle image dilation caused by scattering does not allow direct measurement of particle size. The calibration routine presented here is accomplished by measuring fixed particle distribution ranges with a calibrated shadow imaging system and mapping these measurements to the in-situ imaging system. The technique used for generating and measuring these particles is described. The result is a three-part process where 1) particles of varying sizes are produced and measured using a calibrated, high-resolution shadow imaging method, 2) the same particle generators are measured with the in-situ imaging system, and 3) a correlation mapping is made between the (dilated) laser image size and the measured particle size. Additionally, experimental and operational details of the imaging system are described such as requirements for the enclosure volume, light management, air filtration and control of various laser reflections. Details related to the OR environment and requirements for achieving close proximity to a patient are discussed as well.","output":"Sizing of airborne particles in an operating room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Cavally virus (CavV) and related viruses in the family Mesoniviridae diverged profoundly from other nidovirus lineages but largely retained the characteristic set of replicative enzymes conserved in the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae. The expression of these enzymes in virus-infected cells requires the extensive proteolytic processing of two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, by the viral 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)). Here, we show that CavV 3CL(pro) autoproteolytic cleavage occurs at two N-terminal (N1 and N2) and one C-terminal (C1) processing site(s). The mature form of 3CL(pro) was revealed to be a 314-residue protein produced by cleavage at FKNK1386|SAAS (N2) and YYNQ1700|SATI (C1). Site-directed mutagenesis data suggest that the mesonivirus 3CL(pro) employs a catalytic Cys-His dyad comprised of CavV pp1a/pp1ab residues Cys-1539 and His-1434. The study further suggests that mesonivirus 3CL(pro) substrate specificities differ from those of related nidovirus proteases. The presence of Gln (or Glu) at the P1 position was not required for cleavage, although residues that control Gln/Glu specificity in related viral proteases are retained in the CavV 3CL(pro) sequence. Asn at the P2 position was identified as a key determinant for mesonivirus 3CL(pro) substrate specificity. Other positions, including P4 and P1', each are occupied by structurally related amino acids, indicating a supportive role in substrate binding. Together, the data identify a new subgroup of nidovirus main proteases and support previous conclusions on phylogenetic relationships between the main nidovirus lineages. IMPORTANCE Mesoniviruses have been suggested to provide an evolutionary link between nidovirus lineages with small (13 to 16 kb) and large (26 to 32 kb) RNA genome sizes, and it has been proposed that a specific set of enzymes, including a proofreading exoribonuclease and other replicase gene-encoded proteins, play a key role in the major genome expansion leading to the currently known lineages of large nidoviruses. Despite their smaller genome size (20 kb), mesoniviruses retained most of the replicative domains conserved in large nidoviruses; thus, they are considered interesting models for studying possible key events in the evolution of RNA genomes of exceptional size and complexity. Our study provides the first characterization of a mesonivirus replicase gene-encoded nonstructural protein. The data confirm and extend previous phylogenetic studies of mesoniviruses and related viruses and pave the way for studies into the formation of the mesonivirus replication complex and functional and structural studies of its functional subunits.","output":"Characterization of an alphamesonivirus 3C-like protease defines a special group of nidovirus main proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We critically evaluate the usefulness of different nanostructures described as labels, nanoscaffolds or separation media in immunoassays and nucleic-acid hybridization assays.

Cre-mediated recombination replaced AcGFP-HA by SF. The AcGFPHAstopSF cassette was added to DLL1 for tests in cultured cells and introduced into endogenous DLL1 in mice by homologous recombination. Tagged DLL1 protein was detected by antibodies against GFP and HA or Flag, respectively, both in CHO cells and embryo lysates. In CHO cells the AcGFP fluorophore fused to DLL1 was functional. In vivo AcGFP expression was below the level of detection by direct fluorescence. However, the SF tag allowed us to specifically purify DLL1 complexes from embryo lysates.

Since outbreak management is essential to disease control, we aimed to examine university students' knowledge of and attitudes toward the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and vaccination and other preventive measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 first year university students at Yeditepe University in Istanbul, Turkey between 1(st )and 30(th )of November 2009. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics of the students, perceptions, level of knowledge and attitudes toward influenza pandemic and prevention measures were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed by the students affiliated with SANITAS, a university club of students in health related sciences. RESULTS: 25.1% (101/402) of the study group perceived their personal risk of influenza as \\"high\\", while 40.5% (163/402) perceived it as \\"moderate\\", 20.6% (107/402) viewed it as \\"low\\" and 7.7% (31/402) indicated that it was \\"unknown\\". The risk perception of males was significantly lower than that of females (p = 0.004) and the risk perception among the students of health sciences was significantly lower than that of students of other sciences (p = 0.037). Within the study group, 72.1% (290/402) indicated that their main information source regarding H1N1 was the mass media. Health sciences students tended to rely more on the internet as an information source than other students (p = 0.015). The vast majority (92.8%; 373/402) of those interviewed indicated that they would not be vaccinated. The major concerns regarding vaccination had to do with the safety and side effects of the vaccine. Most of the participants (343/402, 85.3%) were carrying out one of prevention measures and the vast majority believed that hand washing, face mask and quarantina were effective measures for prevention. CONCLUSION: The participants had enough knowledge about H1N1 pandemic about the disease although there were still gaps and confusions in some areas. In the future, when planning management strategies regarding pandemics or outbreaks in higher education institutions, new strategies should be developed to promote positive health behaviour among university students compatible with the international guidelines.

Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus regarding which are the main mechanisms of ozone virus inactivation. This critical review examined the most relevant information available regarding ozone application in gas-phase for different viruses inactivation (including recent publications dealing with SARS-CoV-2), and pointed towards envelope alteration as the main reaction pathway for enveloped viruses, such as is the case of SARS-CoV-2.

Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its k nearest neighboring cells across a range of k values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before.

For this purpose, direct and indirect influences of job demands (active-aggressive and passive-aggressive abusive supervisions) are examined on the compulsory citizenship behavior. In so doing, the relevance of perceived support of coworkers as a job resource and emotional exhaustion as an underlying mechanism is investigated. Data were collected from 205 managerial level employees working in the insurance sector of a developing economy. Both aspects of abusive supervision have both direct and indirect effects through emotional exhaustion on compulsory citizenship behavior. Active-aggressive abusive supervision, coupled with low perceived support of the coworkers influences emotional exhaustion that culminates in increased compulsory citizenship behavior of employees. Interestingly, when perceived support of coworkers is high, the indirect link between active aggressive abusive supervision and compulsory citizenship behavior through emotional exhaustion decreases. For human resource managers, these findings imply that the proper background checks should be made before the recruitment so that employees with troubled past or tending to exhibit aggression can be screened. For line managers, these findings imply that coworkers can play a major role in curbing the compulsory citizenship behavior. Thus, managers should foster such organizational practices that can develop mutual trust and stronger relationship among coworkers so that coworkers can become the perfect source of psychological support.","output":"Tracing an Unyielding Work Compulsion: A Moderated Mediation Model of Abusive Supervision and Compulsory Citizenship Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global terrorism is a rapidly growing threat to world security, and increases the risk of bioterrorism. In this Review, we discuss the potential threat of bioterrorism, agents that could be exploited, and recent developments in technologies and policy for detecting and controlling epidemics that have been initiated intentionally. The local and international response to infectious disease epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and west African Ebola virus epidemic, revealed serious shortcomings which bioterrorists might exploit when intentionally initiating an epidemic. Development of new vaccines and antimicrobial therapies remains a priority, including the need to expedite clinical trials using new methodologies. Better means to protect health-care workers operating in dangerous environments are also needed, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure. New and improved approaches should be developed for surveillance, early detection, response, effective isolation of patients, control of the movement of potentially infected people, and risk communication. Access to dangerous pathogens should be appropriately regulated, without reducing progress in the development of countermeasures. We conclude that preparedness for intentional outbreaks has the important added value of strengthening preparedness for natural epidemics, and vice versa.","output":"Confronting the threat of bioterrorism: realities, challenges, and defensive strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This living systematic review aims to summarize evidence on the prevalence of oral signs and symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The review was reported per the PRISMA checklist, and the literature search was conducted in 6 databases and in gray literature. Studies published in any language mentioning oral symptoms and signs in patients with COVID-19 were included. The risk of bias was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. The certainty of evidence was evaluated through GRADE assessment. After a 2-step selection, 40 studies were included: 33 cross-sectional and 7 case reports. Overall, 10,228 patients (4,288 males, 5,770 females, and 170 unknown) from 19 countries were assessed. Gustatory impairment was the most common oral manifestation, with a prevalence of 45% (95% CI, 34% to 55%; I2 = 99%). The pooled eligible data for different taste disorders were 38% for dysgeusia and 35% for hypogeusia, while ageusia had a prevalence of 24%.

Oral mucosal lesions presented multiple clinical aspects, including white and erythematous plaques, irregular ulcers, small blisters, petechiae, and desquamative gingivitis. Tongue, palate, lips, gingiva, and buccal mucosa were affected. In mild cases, oral mucosal lesions developed before or at the same time as the initial respiratory symptoms; however, in those who required medication and hospitalization, the lesions developed approximately 7 to 24 d after onset symptoms. Therefore, taste disorders may be common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and should be considered in the scope of the disease's onset and progression.

How this nociception monitor relates to the pain experience is uncertain, and patients with chronic pain may respond differently to acute pain due to alterations in pain processing. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate NOL index variations after a painful physiotherapy exercise in patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome. Baseline NOL indexes were recorded using a finger probe (PMD-200? Monitor, Medasense, Israel) and patient reported baseline pain scores using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients then performed a painful physiotherapy exercise and NOL index and pain scores were again recorded. The same procedure and recordings were repeated after a stellate ganglion block. Data were analyzed using a paired Student T test and a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Twenty patients (12/20 female, 10/20 right-sided) were included in this study. Patients reported moderate baseline pain (4.0  2.7) despite having a low baseline NOL index (7.66  5.76 out of 100). NRS and NOL index scores increased significantly during exercise, both before and after the block. The NOL index increased significantly when patients reported increased pain, indicating that it could eventually be useful in the objective assessment of acute pain in the chronic pain patients.

As a result, obese patients with SRC-1 deficiency are being treated with a Melanocortin 4 receptor agonist in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE Here, our aim was to comprehensively describe and characterise the clinical phenotype of SRC-1 variant carriers to facilitate diagnosis and clinical management. DESIGN In genetic studies of 2,462 people with severe obesity, we identified 23 rare heterozygous variants in SRC-1. We studied 29 adults and 18 children who were SRC-1 variant carriers and performed measurements of metabolic and endocrine function, liver imaging and adipose tissue biopsies. Findings in adult SRC-1 variant carriers were compared to 30 age and BMI-matched controls. RESULTS The clinical spectrum of SRC-1 variant carriers included increased food intake in children, normal basal metabolic rate, multiple fractures with minimal trauma (40%), persistent diarrhea, partial thyroid hormone resistance and menorrhagia. Compared to age, sex and BMI matched controls, adult SRC-1 variant carriers had more severe adipose tissue fibrosis (46.2% v 7.1% respectively, P=0.03) and a suggestion of increased liver fibrosis (5/13 cases versus 2/13 in controls, odds ratio 3.4), although this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS SRC-1 variant carriers exhibit hyperphagia in childhood, severe obesity and clinical features of partial hormone resistance.

Twelve composite raw sewage samples were weekly collected from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and alternately from 17 sewer pipes (SP) from surrounding neighbourhoods and slums throughout 20 weeks (April 15th to August 25th, 2020). Two hundred twenty-three samples were concentrated using the ultracentrifugation-based method and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected and quantified by RT-qPCR using primers and probe targeting the N2 genome. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 84.3% (188/223) of samples with a positive rate ranging from 42% (5/12) in the first week of monitoring to 100% during the peak of epidemic with viral concentration ranging from 3.1 to 7.1 log10 genome copies /100 mL throughout the studied period. Positive rates were higher in WWTPs when compared to SP, being useful tool for monitoring trends in the evolution of the COVID-19 curve, while SP data were more effective when health public interventions were needed. Whole-genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq System confirmed the lineage of three genomes as B.1.1.33 (clade G) containing the nucleotide substitutions observed in strains that circulate in the Rio de Janeiro during the period of this study.

In addition, we consider patients without fever and respiratory symptoms, with both a negative RT nasopharyngeal swab and lung CT, as a \\"Covid-19 negative patient.\\" In this article, we present a so called Covid-19 \\"negative\\" patient, with an unsuspected vascular clinical onset of the viral infection. METHODS An 80 y.o. man, who previously underwent endovascular aortic repair for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, presented to our department with an atypical presentation of an aorto-enteric fistula during the pandemic. While in hospital, weekly nasopharyngeal swab tests were always negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the absence of aortic endograft complications, the gross anatomy of duodenal ischemic injury, and the recent history of the patient who lived the last months in Bergamo, the Italian city with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths, lead the senior Author to suspect an occult SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient underwent to resection of the fourth portion of the duodenum and the first jejunal loop, with subsequent duodenum-jejunal latero-lateral anastomosis and the direct suture of the aortic wall. The intestinal specimen was investigated as suspected SARS-CoV-2 bowel infection by the means of immune-histochemistry (IHC). An ileum sample obtained in the pre-COVID-19 era was used as a control tissue. RESULTS The histological analysis of the bowel revealed sustained wall ischemia and liponecrosis of the duodenal wall, with intramural blood vessels thrombosis. Blood vessel endotheliitis and neo-angiogenesis were also observed. Finally, the IHC was strongly positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and for HLA-G presence, with a particular concentration both in blood vessels and in the intestinal villi.

We investigated the clinical relevance of these patterns. METHODS Patients with a surgical biopsy of lung adenocarcinoma from a metastatic site were included. Slides were reviewed by an anatomical pathologist identifying the histologic patterns of solid with mucin, acinar, micropapillary, papillary, and assigning a major adenocarcinoma subtype according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification. EGFR and KRAS mutation testing were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks. Mutations were detected by high resolution melting assay with high resolution melting-positive samples confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS One-hundred patients were included. The major histologic subtype prevalence was as follows: solid (50), acinar (29), micropapillary (20), and papillary (1). Of 100 patients, 45 received no systemic therapy with no overall survival differences seen by histologic subtype and 55 received systemic therapy (chemoradiotherapy with curative intent or palliative chemotherapy). Worse survival was seen in the major solid histologic subtype compared with major acinar (hazard ratio 0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.15-0.68], p = 0.003) and micropapillary subtypes (hazard ratio 0.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.69], p = 0.003). The major solid histologic subtype was less likely to harbor EGFR mutations (p = 0.006) and was less frequent in never smokers (p = 0.010) compared with other histologic subtypes. CONCLUSION The major solid histologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma at metastatic sites is associated with shorter overall survival on systemic anticancer therapy.

AIM: An online survey investigated whether certainty of being infected with COVID-19, age, sex, cognitive, emotional and personality factors were associated with perceived severity of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=375) filled out an online survey containing 57 questions asking about symptoms resembling COVID-19, certainty of being infected with COVID-19, anxiety, stress and personality dimensions. RESULTS: Certainty of being infected with COVID-19 and anxiety predicted 27% of the variance in reporting of COVID-like symptoms. The mediation analysis showed that both higher certainty of being infected and anxiety independently predicted increased reports of COVID-like symptom. Females had higher anxiety and stress levels, and reported more COVID-like symptoms than males did. Older age was not associated with reporting COVID-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Believing to be infected with COVID-19, along with anxiety, can enhance the severity of COVID-like symptoms.

The replication of MERS-CoV is mediated by ORF 1ab and viral gene activity can be modulated by RNAi approach. The inhibition of virus replication has been documented in cell culture against multiple viruses by RNAi approach. Currently, very few siRNA against MERS-CoV have been computationally designed and published. METHODS In this review, we have discussed the computational designing and delivery of potential siRNAs. Potential siRNA can be designed to silence a desired gene by considering many factors like target site, specificity, length and nucleotide content of siRNA, removal of potential off-target sites, toxicity and immunogenic responses. The efficient delivery of siRNAs into targeted cells faces many challenges like enzymatic degradation and quick clearance through renal system. The siRNA can be delivered using transfection, electroporation and viral gene transfer. Currently, siRNAs delivery has been improved by using advanced nanotechnology like lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles. CONCLUSION The efficacy of siRNA-based therapeutics has been used not only against many viral diseases but also against non-viral diseases, cancer, dominant genetic disorders, and autoimmune disease. This innovative technology has attracted researchers, academia and pharmaceuticals industries towards designing and development of highly effective and targeted disease therapy.

Strikingly, a broad array of evidence shows reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2 in these subjects, suggesting a potential role for CFTR in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 replication in wild-type and CFTR-modified human bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary cells to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Both immortalized and primary human bronchial epithelial cells expressing wt or F508del-CFTR along with CRISPR/Cas9 CFTR-ablated clones were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and samples were harvested before and from 24 to 72 h post-infection. CFTR function was also inhibited in wt-CFTR cells with the CFTR-specific inhibitor IOWH-032 and partially restored in F508del-CFTR cells with a combination of CFTR modulators (VX-661+VX-445). Viral load was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR in both supernatant and cell extracts, and ACE-2 expression was analyzed by both western blotting and flow cytometry. SARS-CoV-2 replication was reduced in CFTR-modified bronchial cells compared with wild-type cell lines. No major difference in ACE-2 expression was detected before infection between wild-type and CFTR-modified cells, while a higher expression in wild-type compared to CFTR-modified cells was detectable at 72 h post-infection. Furthermore, inhibition of CFTR channel function elicited significant inhibition of viral replication in cells with wt-CFTR, and correction of CFTR function in F508del-CFTR cells increased the release of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Our study provides evidence that CFTR expression/function is involved in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 replication, thus providing novel insights into the role of CFTR in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","output":"CFTR Modulation Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the greatest public health emergency and has attracted global attention.

The current study aims to clarify the NA and its influencing factors in elderly patients with SUDs during the pandemic. Methods: Two psychiatrists conducted semi-structured interviews with 77 SUD patients aged above 50 years to collect their demographical information and certain drug use characteristics. Barratt Impulse Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale were used to obtain information about patients' self-reported impulsivity and NA. Results: Univariate linear regression analysis showed that NA was positively correlated with the frequency of drug use, type of SUDs, cravings during COVID-19, and impulsivity. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that being female, higher frequency of drug use, stronger cravings, and greater impulsiveness jointly accounted for the variation of NA in elderly patients with SUDs. Conclusions: This study confirmed that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, gender, frequency of drug use, cravings, and impulsivity were associated with NA in elderly patients with SUDs.

Methods: A randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 4 clinical trial was conducted in Zhejiang Province, east of China. Eligible healthy adults aged 18C59 years underwent randomization at a ratio of 1:1:2 to receive one dose of inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) either simultaneously with the first (SI1 subgroup, Day 0) or the second (SI2 subgroup, Day 28) dose of CoronaVac, or 14 days after the first dose of CoronaVac (SE group). The primary endpoint of the study was the non-inferiority in seroconversion rate of antibody against SARS-Cov-2 between participants who received two vaccines simultaneously and those who followed the separate vaccination schedule (clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT04801888). Findings: Overall, 480 participants were enrolled, with 120, 120, and 240 randomly assigned to the SI1, SI2, and SE groups, respectively. With the noninferiority margin set at 10%, the seroconversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the SI group (93.11% [89.04, 96.01]) was not inferior to that in the SE group (95.15% [91.50, 97.56]) in the per-protocol set. Overall, the geometric mean titer (GMT) in the SE group was higher than that in the SI group with statistical significance (38.06 vs. 27.54, P=0.0001). Within the SI group, the GMT was significantly higher in the SI1 subgroup than that in the SI2 subgroup (32.61 vs 23.26, P=0.0153). The occurrences of vaccine related adverse reactions were comparable among different vaccination groups (16.67% vs. 19.17% and 20.00%, P=0.7568).Interpretation: Simultaneous administration of both SARS-Cov-2 inactivated vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine would be feasible.

Although it is well known that attention can modulate neural responses in many brain areas, the computational principles underlying attentional modulation remain unclear. Contrary to the prevailing view of a high-dimensional, distributed neural representation, here we show a surprisingly simple, biased neural representation for feature-based attention in a large dataset including five human fMRI studies. We found that when human participants (both sexes) selected one feature from a compound stimulus, voxels in many cortical areas responded consistently higher to one attended feature over the other. This univariate bias was consistent across brain areas within individual subjects. Importantly, this univariate bias showed a progressively stronger magnitude along the cortical hierarchy. In frontoparietal areas, the bias was strongest and contributed largely to pattern-based decoding, whereas early visual areas lacked such a bias. These findings suggest a gradual transition from a more analog to a more abstract representation of attentional priority along the cortical hierarchy. Biased neural responses in high-level areas likely reflect a low-dimensional neural code that can facilitate a robust representation and simple readout of cognitive variables.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIt is typically assumed that cognitive variables are represented by distributed population activities. Although this view is rooted in decades of work in the sensory system, it has not been rigorously tested at different levels of cortical hierarchy. Here we show a novel low-dimensional coding scheme that dominated the representation of feature-based attention in frontoparietal areas. The simplicity of such a biased code may confer a robust representation of cognitive variables, such as attentional selection, working memory, and decision-making.","output":"Biased Neural Representation of Feature-Based Attention in the Human Frontoparietal Network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months, the COVID-19 pandemic has been fervently considered from the perspective of various disciplines in the scientific community.

Particularly, the research considers the criticality of the geographical scale of reference in Italy's political actions. COVID-19 induced a need for the government to interact with people locally, especially through small municipalities in geographically central, inner areas, is emphasized. The main aim of this research is to attribute to this specific COVID-19 disaster the instrumental role of turning on the lights on the need to intervene in the inner areas of Italy, often very neglected. So the focus of the work is on inner areas and the probable catalysis of the political management dynamics that concern them, as an effect of the COVID's impacts. The pandemic is, therefore, only the contingent phenomenon which, in this case, can perhaps accelerate political interventions in inner areas. To explain the reason for this, we show how the vulnerability of inner areas, already generally risky, has become one of the weak links in the chain of protection from COVID-19 in terms of a geographical scattering phenomenon.","output":"Geographical scattering in Italian inner areas, politics and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute myocarditis is commonly caused by viral infections resulting from viruses such as adenovirus, enteroviruses, and, rarely, coronavirus.

In this report, we discuss a case of a 41-year-old female who presented with cough and chest pain of two days' duration. The patient had a new-onset atrial flutter. Her chest auscultation revealed bilateral crackles. Laboratory workup revealed elevated troponin levels, and the patient tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 35-40% compared to 55% one year prior, as well as a granular appearance of LV myocardium. The patient's condition subsequently improved clinically and she was discharged home. Due to cardiac involvement and characteristic myocardial appearance on the echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed for further evaluation about two months from the date of admission. CMR showed extensive myocardial inflammation with a typical pattern of sub-epicardial and mid-wall delayed enhancement, confirming the diagnosis of myocarditis.

The inhalation exposure to pathogenic particles was estimated using the derived airborne concentration model, and subsequently incorporated into a dose-response model to assess the infection risk. Using the proposed risk assessment scheme, the influences of resuspension towards indoor infection transmission were examined by two hypothetical case studies.

Data regarding age, sex, cerebrovascular disease, and intracranial pressure were evaluated in combination with CSF profiles defined by cell counts, total protein and glucose levels, concentration of total Tau and neurofilament light chain (NfL) proteins, oligoclonal band patterns, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: CSF of patients with inflammatory neurological diseases was characterized by pleocytosis and elevated total protein and NfL levels. Patients with encephalopathy were mostly older men (mean age of 61.0  17.6 years) with evidence of cerebrovascular disease.

To provide a comprehensive picture of the pandemic's impact, suitable indicators for signalling and tracking these wider effects should be incorporated into monitoring activities. Therefore, WHO/Euro developed a tool to select indicators for this purpose. METHODS: Based on desk research and extensive expert consultation, a framework was developed for the main pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic influences population health. For each pathway in the framework, underlying mechanisms and related indicator areas were defined. In addition, groups that are particularly vulnerable to the wider effects of the pandemic were identified, as these require specific attention in monitoring exercises. RESULTS: The main pathways through which the pandemic impacts general population health as used in the tool are: Fear of getting infected or spreading infection. Impaired healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions. Direct effects of containment measures. Indirect effects of containment measures through risk factors. Indirect effects of containment measures through wider determinants of health. A total of 27 underlying mechanisms and related indicator areas were defined. E.g., one underlying mechanism under the first pathway involves stockpiling disinfectants and cleaners. This results in people being more exposed to dangerous substances and applying disinfectants improperly, which leads to an increase in poisonings. Identified vulnerabilities relate to people's age, gender, socioeconomic status, place of residence/living situation, morbidity/disability status, and refugee or migrant status.

From 10 infected dogs, peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested periodically, phenotyped and analyzed for CDV antigen content and apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide labeling. CDV infection induced a severe CD3(+) T cell and CD21(+) B cell depletion in all animals at 3 days post-infection (d.p.i.). For dogs with severe distemper, developing virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue and central nervous system, this lymphopenia lasted until the end of the experiment. Increased levels of lymphocyte apoptosis were found at 3 d.p.i., and monocyte apoptosis at 6 d.p.i. This was more prominent in the group of animals with severe distemper. At 3 d.p.i. no leukocyte infection was detectable indicating that the early lymphocyte depletion and apoptosis was not a direct consequence of virus infection.

The orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant, which specifically block the endogenous waking system, has been approved as a new drug to treat insomnia. Also, since the sleep disorder narcolepsy-cataplexy is caused by orexin deficiency, orexin receptor agonists are expected to provide mechanistic therapy for narcolepsy; they will likely be also useful for treating excessive sleepiness due to other etiologies.Despite the fact that the executive neurocircuitry and neurochemistry for sleep/wake switching has been increasingly revealed in recent years, the mechanism for homeostatic regulation of sleep, as well as the neural substrate for \\"sleepiness\\" (sleep need), remains unknown. To crack open this black box, we have initiated a large-scale forward genetic screen of sleep/wake phenotype in mice based on true somnographic (EEG/EMG) measurements.

Indeed, through a systematic cross-comparison of the Sleepy mutants and sleep-deprived mice, we have recently found that the cumulative phosphorylation state of a specific set of mostly synaptic proteins may be the molecular substrate of sleep need.","output":"Toward the Mysteries of Sleep."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by protein-rich alveolar edema, reduced lung compliance and severe hypoxemia. Despite some evidence of improvements in mortality over recent decades, ARDS remains a major public health problem with 30% 28-day mortality in recent cohorts. Pulmonary vascular dysfunction is one of the pivot points of the pathophysiology of ARDS, resulting in a certain degree of pulmonary hypertension, higher levels of which are associated with morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension develops as a result of endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary vascular occlusion, increased vascular tone, extrinsic vessel occlusion, and vascular remodeling. This increase in right ventricular (RV) afterload causes uncoupling between the pulmonary circulation and RV function. Without any contractile reserve, the right ventricle has no adaptive reserve mechanism other than dilatation, which is responsible for left ventricular compression, leading to circulatory failure and worsening of oxygen delivery. This state, also called severe acute cor pulmonale (ACP), is responsible for excess mortality. Strategies designed to protect the pulmonary circulation and the right ventricle in ARDS should be the cornerstones of the care and support of patients with the severest disease, in order to improve prognosis, pending stronger evidence. Acute cor pulmonale is associated with higher driving pressure (18 cmH(2)O), hypercapnia (PaCO(2)  48 mmHg), and hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150 mmHg). RV protection should focus on these three preventable factors identified in the last decade. Prone positioning, the setting of positive end-expiratory pressure, and inhaled nitric oxide (INO) can also unload the right ventricle, restore better coupling between the right ventricle and the pulmonary circulation, and correct circulatory failure. When all these strategies are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which improves decarboxylation and oxygenation and enables ultra-protective ventilation by decreasing driving pressure, should be discussed in seeking better control of RV afterload. This review reports the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in ARDS, describes right heart function, and proposes an RV protective approach, ranging from ventilatory settings and prone positioning to INO and selection of patients potentially eligible for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO).","output":"Right Ventricular Function in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Impact on Outcome, Respiratory Strategy and Use of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although conscience, as an ethical concept, has emerged widely in the field of nursing, its functional meaning and its effects on nurses' performance are not clear. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the concept of conscience in the context of Iranian nurses ethical performance. This study used a hybrid model including theoretical, fieldwork, and final analytic stages. In the theoretical phase, English and Persian articles published up to 2020 and indexed by scientific databases were analyzed. In the fieldwork phase, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted on nurse participants. The last two stages were jointly considered to draw the studys conclusions. In the theoretical phase, conscience was considered as a context-dependent concept, an inner voice, and a criterion for distinguishing right from wrong. The fieldwork phase results were categorized into three themes: perception of conscience, commands of conscience, and obedience to conscience. The final definition was reached by merging the theoretical and field stages. This article aimed at investigating the relevance of conscience to ethical practice in the nursing field.

While cases of COVID were rapidly rising, information related to the virus and ways of prevention was also increasing, with much of this information being provided by the media and the general population. In this context, this study had two main objectives: 1) To understand the doubts and concerns of the Portuguese population related to food safety during the first wave of COVID-19 and how they clarified these issues and 2) to analyze the population's opinion on myths and truths related to the transmission of the infection. Methods & Materials A survey including questions about a) concerns and information on food safety during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic; b) myths and truths about COVID-1 and c) respondents profile. The survey was released online between June and October of 2020. Results The main doubt of the respondents was related to the manipulation of food (40,7%) followed by the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 through food (12,6%) and which foods should be avoided due to the pandemic (12,6%). 33,3% of the participants stated that television was the main mean of information accessed to clarify these doubts, followed by a Guideline launched by the Directorate-General of Health (31,8%). However, 50,3% said that they had only found answers to some of their questions. 50% of the respondents with higher level of education and 30% of the respondents with lower level of education had doubts about the possibility of the transmission of COVID-19 through food. Also, most of the survey participants disagreed with the affirmations regarding popular ways of disinfecting food to prevent infection. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic raised several doubts, however when related to food safety, the main doubt was about the manipulation of food due to the concern of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

By occupation type, remote working is more frequent among the self-employed, small companies and skilled occupations. Furthermore, this form of work is still infrequently used in certain sectors of activity which could have been bolstered by new technological developments, such as manufacturing, public administration, transportation and storage, administrative activities, wholesale and retail trade and other service activities. The types of workers, having taken into account the characteristics of their jobs, who work remotely are usually individuals aged between 35 and 65 and those with university studies. An analysis of the intrinsic characteristics of each occupation estimates that about 30% of persons employed could telework, at least occasionally, and, consequently, there is considerable room for improvement in the application of these working arrangements.

The NLRP3 inflammasome agglomerates are consequent to sensing a wide spectrum of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Certain members of the NLR family have been documented to lump into multimolecular conglomerates called inflammasomes, which are inherently linked to stimulation of the cysteine protease caspase-1. Following activation, caspase-1 severs the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 to their biologically active forms, with consequent commencement of caspase-1-associated pyroptosis. This type of cell death by pyroptosis epitomizes a leading pathway of inflammation. Accumulating scientific documentation has recorded overstimulation of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3) inflammasome involvement in a wide array of inflammatory conditions. IL-1 is an archetypic inflammatory cytokine implicated in multiple types of inflammatory maladies. Approaches to impede IL-1¡s actions are possible, and their therapeutic effects have been clinically demonstrated; nevertheless, such strategies are associated with certain constraints. For instance, treatments that focus on systemically negating IL-1 (i.e., anakinra, rilonacept, and canakinumab) have been reported to result in an escalated peril of infections.

This study used CT three-dimensional reconstruction methods to explore the relationship between LAA morphology, LAA orifice area and its mechanical function in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation(NVAF). Methods: A total of 81 consecutive patients with NVAF (36 cases of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 45 cases of persistent atrial fibrillation) who were planned to undergo catheter radiofrequency ablation were enrolled. All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), TEE, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) before surgery. The LAA orifice area was obtained according to the images of CTA. According to the left atrial appendage morphology, it was divided into chicken wing type and non-chicken wing type. At the same time, TEE was performed to determine left atrial appendage flow velocity (LAAFV), and the relationship between the left atrial appendage orifice area and LAAFV was analyzed. Results: The LAAFV in Non-chicken wing group was lower than that in Chicken wing group (36.215.0cm/s vs. 49.122.0 cm/s, P<0.05). In the subgroup analysis, the LAAFV in Non-chicken wing group was lower than that in Chicken wing group in the paroxysmal AF (44.014.3cm/s vs. 60.222.8cm/s, P<0.05);In the persistent AF, similar results were observed (29.712.4 cm/s vs. 40.817.7 cm/s, P<0.05). The LAAFV in persistent AF group was lower than that in paroxysmal AF group (34.615.8 cm/s vs. 49.920.0 cm/s, P<0.001). The LAAFV was negatively correlated with left atrial dimension (R=-0.451, P<0.001) and LAA orifice area (R=-0.438, P<0.001), while it was positively correlated with LVEF (R=0.271, P<0.001).

We compared observed visit rates to expected visit rates for each month of the pandemic period, generating absolute rate differences, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was a visit to a primary care physician or a psychiatrist for any mental disorder. We stratified analyses by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In March 2020, the visit rate was 43.5/1000, with a rate difference of 3.11/1000 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13) compared with the expected rate. In April, the rate difference (10.9/1000, 95% CI 9.14-12.6) and IRR (1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) were higher; this level was generally sustained through November 2020. From April-November, we observed elevated visit rates across provider types and for diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and alcohol or substance use disorders. Observed increases from expected visit rates were greater for people 0-90 days postpartum compared with 91-365 days postpartum; increases were small among people living in low-income neighbourhoods. Public health units in the northern areas of the province did not see sustained elevations in visit rates after July; southern health units had elevated rates through to November.

Although the focus has been initially more on the physical health during the pandemic, mental health concerns linked to the lockdown have quickly risen. This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian womens mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; p < 0.001). Psychological abuse was the most frequent type of violence (96%). Women who had experienced abuse before the lockdown were at an increased risk of violence during lockdown (p < 0.001; OR = 19.34 [8.71C43.00]). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence against women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world.

Among many causative factors, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is one considered an important pathogen in modern pig production. The aim of the study was to verify if PCV2 was responsible for antibiotic non-responsive diarrhoea and wasting in pigs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 13 dead pigs aged between 12 and 15 weeks from three Polish farms with persistent herd symptoms suggestive of PCV2 infection were provided for evaluation. Sections of lymph nodes and intestines were analysed by in situ hybridization (ISH) for PCV2 and histopathological examination. Faeces and intestinal scrapings were tested for Lawsonia intracellularis and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae by real-time PCR and for parasitic infection by flotation and decantation. RESULTS: ISH and histopathological examination showed that all pigs were PCV2 systemic disease negative. Swine dysentery was confirmed by real-time PCR on two farms, and proliferative enteropathy on one farm. In histological examinations, erosions of the caecal and colonic mucosa were found, together with cysts and trophozoites of Balantidium coli. The protozoa were present in the intestinal lumen and mucosa. B. coli cysts were identified in faeces from all examined pigs.

The COVID-19 pandemic crisis required an unexpectedly quick adaptation of social norms and exerted great pressure on healthcare and public health systems. Although implemented strategies and results have varied, Digital Health tools emerged as a fundamental aspect of the pandemic fight across the EU. Methods The objective of this study was to determine and compare Digital Health Strategies and COVID-19 Response in EU MS 43% had no interoperability with other apps. We analyzed the 27 MS of the EU and determined several parameters relevant before and during the pandemic: 1 - Preexisting national digital health strategy in 2019;2 - COVID-19 General Information Website;3 - Real time updated COVID-19 online dashboard;4 - Mobile application for contact tracing;4.1 - Mobile app launch date;4.2 - Interoperability with other mobile apps;5 - Shift to telemedicine;6 - Official public health communication through social media;7 - Dedicated COVID-19 Information System for Public Health Workforce. Information from publicly available sources. Results All EU MS had a preexisting digital health strategy before the pandemic, developed a dedicated COVID-19 General Information Website and a COVID-19 dashboard with real-time updates on relevant statistics. The majority of MS (79%) developed a mobile app for contact tracing (43% had no interoperability with other apps), and of those that had not developed an app as of April 30th 2021, 50% had one under development. Most apps were launched in the first trimester of 2021. Other results were heterogeneous. Conclusions In some aspects, there is a clear convergence between EU MS in the deployment of digital health tools to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS: 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS: The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","output":"Logistical Considerations and Clinical Outcomes Associated with Converting Operating Rooms into an Intensive Care Unit during the Covid-19 Pandemic in a New York City Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emergency involved Italy as the first European country.

Since HIV-1 establishes its early replication in vaginal or rectal mucosal tissues, the induction of sufficient mucosal immunity at the initial site of HIV-1 transmission becomes essential for a protective vaccine. However, despite the fact that current conventional vaccine strategies have remained unsuccessful in preventing HIV-1 infection, sufficient financial support and resources have yet to be given to develop a vaccine able to elicit protective mucosal immunity against sexual transmissions.

Contraceptive-induced menstrual bleeding changes (CIMBCs) are linked to these concerns. Research on women's responses to CIMBCs has not been mapped or summarized in a systematic scoping review. METHODS We conducted a systematic scoping review of data on women's responses to CIMBCs in peer-reviewed, English-language publications in the last 15 years. Investigator dyads abstracted information from relevant studies on pre-specified and emergent themes using a standardized form. We held an expert consultation to obtain critical input. We provide recommendations for researchers, contraceptive counselors, and product developers. RESULTS We identified 100 relevant studies. All world regions were represented (except Antarctica), including Africa (11%), the Americas (32%), Asia (7%), Europe (20%), and Oceania (6%). We summarize findings pertinent to five thematic areas: women's responses to contraceptive-induced non-standard bleeding patterns; CIMBCs influence on non-use, dissatisfaction or discontinuation; conceptual linkages between CIMBCs and health; women's responses to menstrual suppression; and other emergent themes. Women's preferences for non-monthly bleeding patterns ranged widely, though amenorrhea appears most acceptable in the Americas and Europe. Multiple studies reported CIMBCs as top reasons for contraceptive dissatisfaction and discontinuation; others suggested disruption of regular bleeding patterns was associated with non-use. CIMBCs in some contexts were perceived as linked with a wide range of health concerns; e.g., some women perceived amenorrhea to cause a buildup of \\"dirty\\" or \\"blocked\\" blood, in turn perceived as causing blood clots, fibroids, emotional disturbances, weight gain, infertility, or death. Multiple studies addressed how CIMBCs (or menstruation) impacted daily activities, including participation in domestic, work, school, sports, or religious life; sexual or emotional relationships; and other domains. CONCLUSIONS Substantial variability exists around how women respond to CIMBCs; these responses are shaped by individual and social influences. Despite variation in responses across contexts and sub-populations, CIMBCs can impact multiple aspects of women's lives. Women's responses to CIMBCs should be recognized as a key issue in contraceptive research, counseling, and product development, but may be underappreciated, despite likely - and potentially substantial - impacts on contraceptive discontinuation and unmet need for modern contraception.","output":"There might be blood: a scoping review on women's responses to contraceptive-induced menstrual bleeding changes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention of the spread of disease is the most critical effort before the domino effect occurs.

Schools present a valuable opportunity to reach a large section of the country's adolescent population with nutrition-oriented interventions. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the current state of adolescent school nutrition interventions in Dodoma, Tanzania, with emphases on 3 potential school-based nutrition interventions, school vegetable gardens, school meals, and education (on nutrition, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene). METHODS Focus group discussions were conducted with several regional and district-level governmental stakeholders, including health, education, and agricultural officers. Ten public secondary schools were visited, and interviews with school administrators, teachers, students, and parents were conducted. RESULTS All stakeholders interviewed supported interventions to improve school-based nutrition, including school gardens, school feeding, and nutrition education. All 10 schools visited had some experience providing school meals, but parents' contributions were essential for the program's sustainability. Most schools visited had land available for a school garden program, but water availability could be challenging during certain times of the year. The teachers interviewed expressed that the curriculum on nutrition education was highly theoretical and did not allow students to practice the knowledge and skills they learned in the classroom. CONCLUSIONS The current school-based approach to tackling the double burden of adolescent malnutrition in Dodoma is localized and ad hoc. To leverage the potential of schools as a platform for nutrition interventions, integrated and policy-mandated interventions are needed.","output":"School-Based Nutrition Programs for Adolescents in Dodoma, Tanzania: A Situation Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alat Pelindung Diri (APD) menjadi salah satu keharusan yang harusdigunakan perawat dalam melayani pasien selama masa pandemic COVID-19.

Methods We retrospectively studied the real-world data of one comprehensive stroke center in China from January to February, 2020, and compared it with the same period in 2019. We analyzed time from stroke onset to admission, severity, effect after treatment, hospital stays, cost of hospitalization, etc., and correlation among them. Results We observed a great extension of the onset-to-door time of stroke patients during the pandemic. The degree of neurological deficit of the patients was significantly higher, both admission and discharge.

The massive efforts made these past 25 years to increase the immunizing potential of this kind of vaccine are still ongoing. A relatively small number of studies concerning poultry have been published. Even though there is a need for new poultry vaccines, five parameters must nevertheless be taken into account for their development: the vaccine has to be very effective, safe, inexpensive, suitable for mass vaccination and able to induce immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies (when appropriate). DNA vaccination should meet these requirements. This review describes studies in this field performed exclusively on birds (chickens, ducks and turkeys). No evaluations of avian DNA vaccine efficacy performed on mice as preliminary tests have been taken into consideration. The review first describes the state of the art for DNA vaccination in poultry: pathogens targeted, plasmids used and different routes of vaccine administration. Second, it presents strategies designed to improve DNA vaccine efficacy: influence of the route of administration, plasmid dose and age of birds on their first inoculation; increasing plasmid uptake by host cells; addition of immunomodulators; optimization of plasmid backbones and codon usage; association of vaccine antigens and finally, heterologous prime-boost regimens. The final part will indicate additional properties of DNA vaccines in poultry: fate of the plasmids upon inoculation, immunological considerations and the use of DNA vaccines for purposes other than preventing infectious diseases.","output":"DNA vaccination of poultry: The current status in 2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate the effectiveness of the containment on the epidemic spreading of the new Coronavirus disease 2019, we carry on an analysis of the time evolution of the infection in a selected number of different Countries, by considering well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and the logistic law.

However, whether zinc plays a direct antiviral role in viral infections and whether viruses have adopted strategies to modulate zinc homeostasis have not been investigated. Results from clinical trials of zinc supplementation in infections indicate that zinc supplementation may be beneficial in a pathogen- or disease-specific manner, further underscoring the importance of understanding the interaction between zinc homeostasis and virus infections at the molecular level. We investigated the effect of RSV infection on zinc homeostasis and show that RSV infection in lung epithelial cells leads to modulation of zinc homeostasis. The intracellular labile zinc pool increases upon RSV infection in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent fashion. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitous zinc uptake transporter ZIP1 suggests that labile zinc levels are increased due to the increased uptake by RSV-infected cells as an antiviral response. Adding zinc to culture medium after RSV infection led to significant inhibition of RSV titers, whereas depletion of zinc by a zinc chelator, N,N,N,N-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) led to an increase in RSV titers. The inhibitory effect of zinc was specific, as other divalent cations had no effect on RSV titers. Both RSV infection and zinc chelation by TPEN led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, whereas addition of zinc blocked ROS induction. These results suggest a molecular link between RSV infection, zinc homeostasis, and oxidative-stress pathways and provide new insights for developing strategies to counter RSV infection. IMPORTANCE Zinc deficiency rates in developing countries range from 20 to 30%, and zinc supplementation trials have been shown to correct clinical manifestations attributed to zinc deficiency, but the outcomes in the case of respiratory infections have been inconsistent. We aimed at understanding the role of zinc homeostasis in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Infection of lung epithelial cell lines or primary small-airway epithelial cells led to an increase in labile zinc pools, which was due to increased uptake of zinc. Zinc supplementation inhibited RSV replication, whereas zinc chelation had an opposing effect, leading to increases in RSV titers. Increases in labile zinc in RSV-infected cells coincided with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both zinc depletion and addition of exogenous ROS led to enhanced RSV infection, whereas addition of the antioxidant inhibited RSV, suggesting that zinc is part of an interplay between RSV-induced oxidative stress and the host response to maintain redox balance.","output":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Induced Oxidative Stress Leads to an Increase in Labile Zinc Pools in Lung Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aim: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder affecting patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) which adds to their disability.

We aimed to evaluate HRQoL in IBD patient's pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic using the IBD-disk questionnaire and explore associations between socio demographic factors, disease types, severity and impaired HRQoL in patients with IBD. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Saudi Arabia between November 2019 and March 2020 at the outpatient IBD clinics. The HRQoL of patients was assessed using the 10-item IBD-disk questionnaire. Results: A total of 59 IBD patients (40 Crohn's disease, 19 Ulcerative colitis) with a mean disease duration of 3.5 years were included. Most of the patients (77.97%) were on biologics while 35.59% were on immune modulators, 16.94% on 5-ASA, and 3.38% were on corticosteroids.

GBD super regions were defined using World Health Organization classifications. Participants were categorized by impairment on the Duke Activity Status Instrument (DASI: none, some, moderate, severe. Logistic regression models examined risk factors and GBD regions associated with functional impairment. The association between functional impairment and cardiometabolic risk was also explored. RESULTS Of 7736 participants, the majority were from high-income countries (n=4065), were male (65%), and had received ART for  ten years. The median DASI score was 58.2 (IQR 50.2, 58.2); 36% reported at least some impairment. In adjusted analyses, functional impairment was significantly more frequent among participants from Southeast/East Asia. Other factors associated with greater impairment included female sex, Black race, older age, current/former smoking, higher body mass index, use of ART for  ten years, and select ART regimens; differences were seen in risks across GBD regions.

This paper aims to describe the study objectives, design, methods, assessment types, collection schedules and considerations for analyzing the data within the BaSAlt study on facilitators and barriers for PA promotion in nursing homes. METHODS: We designed the BaSAlt study as a participatory intervention study with multiple measurement points in six to eight nursing homes with a total of approx. 200 residents using four main modules: (1) setting-level analysis of physical activity patterns, physical activity-related climate and physical activity-related interaction with significant others, and organizational facilitators and barriers to physical activity, (2) physical-activity related individual-level analysis of objective and self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior, a geriatric assessment with established procedures, assessment of people's activity and health biographies (biographical mapping) as well as their motivational, subjective well-being and distress status, and (3) a counseling module that integrates counseling at the setting level as well as individual physical activity counseling for residents. In module (4) evaluation, the effects of integrated counseling with regard to the implementation of PA promotion strategies are analyzed. DISCUSSION: This study will extend our knowledge of physical activity promotion in German nursing homes.

This paper documents the short-run effects of shutdowns during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which provides a useful counterpoint to choices made in 2020. The 1918 closures were shorter and less sweeping, in part because the US was at war and the Wilson administration was unwilling to let public safety jeopardize the wars prosecution. The result was widespread sickness, which pushed some businesses to shutdown voluntarily;others operated shorthanded. Using hand-coded, high-frequency data (mostly weekly) this study reports three principal results. First, retail sales declined during the three waves of the pandemic;manufacturing activity slowed, but by less than retail. Second, worker absenteeism due to either sickness or fear of contracting the flu reduced output in several key sectors and industries that were not ordered closed by as much as 10 to 20% in weeks of high excess mortality. Output declines were the result of labor-supply rather than demand shocks. And, third, mandated closures are not associated with increases in the number or aggregate dollar value of business failures, but the number and aggregate dollar value of business failures increased modestly in weeks of high excess mortality. The results highlight that the tradeoff between mandated closures and economic activity is not the only relevant tradeoff facing public health authorities.

DESIGN: A qualitative study design was used in addition to administration of standardized depression and mental status screens. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans (n = 18) and caregivers (n = 14) were purposively sampled and recruited from 2 rural CLCs in Upstate New York. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were completed with Veterans in the CLC prior to discharge (to explore experiences during the CLC stay and expectations regarding discharge and returning home) and in the home 2-4 weeks postdischarge (to explore daily routines and perceptions of overall health, mental health, and social functioning). Caregivers participated in 1 interview, completed postdischarge. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Brief Interview for Mental Status were administered postdischarge. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of verbatim transcriptions revealed 3 inter-related themes: (1) Veterans may experience improved social connectedness in CLCs by nature of the unique care environment (predominantly male, shared military experience); (2) Experiences of social engagement and connectedness varied after discharge and could be discordant with Veterans' expectations for recovery prior to discharge; and (3) Veterans may or may not describe themselves as \\"lonely\\" after discharge, when physically isolated.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: As part of its mandate to develop appropriate training materials, the patient-oriented renal research network, Canadians Seeking Solutions and Innovations to Overcome Chronic Kidney Disease (Can-SOLVE CKD), established a training and Mentorship Committee (TMC). METHODS: The committee brings together a unique combination of Indigenous and non-Indigenous patient partners (including caregivers, family members, and living donors), researchers, as well as patient engagement and knowledge translation experts, combining a multitude of perspectives and expertise. Following an assessment of training needs within the network, the TMC undertook the co-development of 5 learning modules to address the identified gaps. Subsequently, the committee divided into working groups tasked with developing content using a consultive and iterative approach informed by the DoTTI framework for building web-based tools for patients. In addition, the TMC embodied the guiding principles of inclusiveness, support, mutual respect, and co-building as set out by the Patient Engagement Framework through the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. KEY FINDINGS: The 5 new modules include: A Patient Engagement Toolkit, Storytelling for Impact, Promoting Kidney Research in Canada (KidneyPRO), Wabishki Bizhiko Skaanj Learning Pathway, and Knowledge Translation. The TMCs approach to developing these modules demonstrates how a diverse group of stakeholders working together can create tools to support high-quality POR. This also provides a roadmap for other health research entities interested in developing similar tools within their unique domains. LIMITATIONS: The landscape of patient engagement in research is constantly evolving. This underscores the need for sustained resources to keep POR tools and training relevant and up-to-date.

When indicated these surgical intervention should ideally be performed in a separate operating theater. All personnel involved should wear personal protective equipment with FFP2 masks, face shields and double gloves. The emergency team in the resuscitation bay should generally wear the same personal protective equipment. Special training is mandatory and the exposure of team members should be minimized.

Currently, there is no literature comparing the sociodemographic conditions of communities where surrendered animals originate and communities where they are adopted. The present study compared the flow of surrendered animals between originating communities (incoming) and communities where they were adopted (outgoing; n = 21,270). To analyze community-level vulnerability, we used the Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation (CIMD), which has four dimensions of social vulnerability. We found that three of the four CIMD dimensions were significantly different between surrendering and adopting communities (Ethnocultural Composition, Situational Vulnerability (SV), Economic Dependency, but not Residential Instability). For further investigation, we also grouped our analysis by intake groups (small animal n = 2,682; puppy n = 973; dog n = 3,446; kitten n = 6,436; cat n= 7,733) and found multiple relationships for which the incoming and outgoing CIMD quintiles were different. For example, for both puppies and kittens, the median outgoing SV quintile ranks were statistically significantly lower (less vulnerable) than incoming quintile ranks, with the effect size being moderate (puppy r = 0.31, kitten r = 0.30; p  0.0025), supporting the concern of the flow of certain animals from more vulnerable to less vulnerable communities.

Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.","output":"Implications of Monsoon Season & UVB Radiation for COVID-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neutralizing-antibody (nAb) is the major focus of most ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials. However, nAb response against SARS-CoV-2, when present, decays rapidly. Given the myriad roles of antibodies in immune responses, it is possible that antibodies could also mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 via effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which we sought to explore here. METHODS: Plasma of 3 uninfected controls and 20 subjects exposed to, or recovering from, SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in the plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing capability of these plasmas was assessed with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. ADCC activity was assessed with a calcein release assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in all COVID-19 subjects studied. All but three COVID-19 subjects contained nAb at high potency (>80% neutralization). Plasma from 19/20 of COVID-19 subjects also demonstrated strong ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including two individuals without nAb against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing COVID-19 plasmas can mediate ADCC. Our findings argue that evaluation of potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should include investigation of the magnitude and durability of ADCC, in addition to nAb.","output":"Presence of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Aerosols and droplets are the main vectors in transmission of highly contagious SARS-Cov-2.

Methods: An online survey, EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered to a cohort of young gynecologic cancer patients. The questionnaire also incorporated questions about their specific diagnoses and current treatment. Inclusion criteria included female patients aged 18-45 who were diagnosed with cancer during the last 5 years. We asked selected patients to fill the survey twice, before and after group psychotherapy sessions. Online group psychotherapy was conducted for 3 consecutive months, three times per week, using the interactive ZOOM platform. Results: Total of 25 patients aged 18-45 were included in the study, 17 patients were breast and 8 were cervical cancer patients. 52% were receiving hormonal therapy, remaining patients were receiving chemotherapy, radiation therapy targeted treatment, or was on follow-up.

One hundred and thirty-nine eligible patients were included between May 2020 and November 2020 (median age of 65 years [IQR = 54, 77]). Our cohort's median plasma zinc concentration was 57 g/dL (interquartile range [IQR] = 45, 67) compared to 74 g/dL (IQR = 64, 84) in the retrospective non-COVID-19 control group (N = 1513; p < 0.001).

To decrease health inequalities and ensure that available solutions are appealing and accessible to people with fewer resources, new approaches should be explored. We developed the app Wakey!, which focused on creating engaging mental health content that is accessible, particularly among lower socioeconomic groups in the United Kingdom. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess engagement with the app, investigate initial effectiveness data for 6 well-being outcomes, and explore participants subjective experiences of using Wakey! METHODS: The app Wakey! was publicly launched on January 20, 2020, and was free to download from Apple Store and Google Play. The app provided its users with entertaining and educational content related to mental well-being. Concurrently, a single-arm mixed methods feasibility trial was carried out from January to April 2020 among people who had downloaded the app and created an account. The primary outcome was engagement, which was collected passively from data logs. Secondary outcome measures were 6 well-being outcomes collected from self-report questionnaires. Individual interviews with 19 app users were carried out in April 2020. RESULTS: In total, 5413 people fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the final sample65.62% (3520/5364) women, 61.07% (3286/5381) aged between 25 and 44 years, 61.61% (2902/4710) in employment, 8.92% (420/4710) belonging to the lower socioeconomic group, and 8.09% (438/5413) were engaged users. There was no evidence of a difference in engagement regarding sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics. There was evidence that users with a higher average daily sleep score, who joined the study more recently, who had higher baseline self-report of sleep quality, and who found episodes more entertaining were more likely to be engaged users. Among 230 users who provided follow-up data, there was evidence of improvements on four of the six well-being outcomes: life satisfaction (P<.001), feeling that life is worthwhile (P=.01), ease of getting up in the morning (P<.001), and self-efficacy (P=.04). The app and its content were well received by those who were interviewed, and several people perceived a positive change in their mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the app Wakey! could potentially be engaging across different socioeconomic groups, and there is an indication that it could positively impact the mental well-being of those engaged with the app. However, this study was a pragmatic trial with a limited sample, and the selection bias was present in the qualitative and quantitative study.

However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions have not yet been established. We investigate a potentially useful relatively non-invasive biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), to predict favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast, common treatment for children with asthma. METHODS: Young children (1 to 6 years old) were enrolled in this randomized, parallel, 2-group, open-label trial. Criteria for eligibility included: 1) being symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) having a serum EDN (sEDN) level  53 ng/mL, with positive specific immunoglobulin E to house dust mite. Eligible patients were randomly placed into 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily; the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily. Ineligible patients were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily (OBS group). Treatment period was 12 weeks. RESULTS: Asthma control days increased significantly in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000) over the 12-week study period.

We compared several school-based influenza monitoring systems with clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, and assessed the variation in illness rates between and within schools. METHODS: During the initial wave of pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) infections from June to Sept 2009 in Singapore, we collected data on nation-wide laboratory confirmed cases (Sch-LCC) and daily temperature monitoring (Sch-DTM), and teacher-led febrile respiratory illness reporting in 6 sentinel schools (Sch-FRI). Comparisons were made against age-stratified clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) data from 23 primary care clinics (GP-ILI) and proportions of ILI testing positive for pdmH1N1 (Lab-ILI) by computing the fraction of cumulative incidence occurring by epidemiological week 30 (when GP-ILI incidence peaked); and cumulative incidence rates between school-based indicators and sero-epidemiological pdmH1N1 incidence (estimated from changes in prevalence of A/California/7/2009 H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition titers  40 between pre-epidemic and post-epidemic sera). Variation in Sch-FRI rates in the 6 schools was also investigated through a Bayesian hierarchical model. RESULTS: By week 30, for primary and secondary school children respectively, 63% and 79% of incidence for Sch-LCC had occurred, compared with 50% and 52% for GP-ILI data, and 48% and 53% for Sch-FRI. There were 1,187 notified cases and 7,588 episodes in the Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM systems; given school enrollment of 485,723 children, this represented 0.24 cases and 1.6 episodes per 100 children respectively. Mean Sch-FRI rate was 28.8 per 100 children (95% CI: 27.7 to 29.9) in the 6 schools. We estimate from serology that 41.8% (95% CI: 30.2% to 55.9%) of primary and 43.2% (95% CI: 28.2% to 60.8%) of secondary school-aged children were infected. Sch-FRI rates were similar across the 6 schools (23 to 34 episodes per 100 children), but there was widespread variation by classrooms; in the hierarchical model, omitting age and school effects was inconsequential but neglecting classroom level effects led to highly significant reductions in goodness of fit. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic curves from Sch-FRI were comparable to GP-ILI data, and Sch-FRI detected substantially more infections than Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM.

The results of this review demonstrate that published studies on the effect of NSAIDs use and risk of pneumonia complications are subject to a number of biases. These results should not be extrapolated as evidence of harm for NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in respiratory ailments but highlight the need for more methodologically robust studies to evaluate this potential relationship.","output":"Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and the Risk of Pneumonia Complications: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of infectious diseases is a major challenge in our contemporary world, especially after the recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19). The quarantine strategy is one of the important intervention measures to control the spread of an epidemic by greatly minimizing the likelihood of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. In this study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic dynamics during the quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission and the Lvy noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under appropriate conditions, some interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely, ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the stochastic noises. Our work improves many existing studies in the field of mathematical epidemiology and provides new techniques to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of epidemics.

Smell and/or taste disorders have emerged as a very frequent symptom as the disease has spread in Europe. Spain is one of the European countries with the highest number of infections. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the clinical progression of smell and taste disorders in Spanish patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of patients who presented sudden smell and/or taste disorders during the 2 months of total lockdown due to COVID-19 in Spain. RESULTS: In our sample, 91.18% of respondents with impaired smell and/or taste and who were able to undergo PCR testing were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anosmia and ageusia presented in isolation in 6.5% of participants. The remaining 93.5% presented other mild symptoms: headache (51.6%), cough (51.6%), myalgia (45.2%), asthaenia (38.7%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea (35.5%), fever (41.9%), low-grade fever (29.0%), odynophagia (25.8%), or diarrhoea (6.5%). The mean duration of anosmia was 8.33 days, with patients subsequently manifesting hyposmia; complete resolution occurred after a mean of 17.79 days. In 22.6% of respondents, olfactory deficits persisted. All participants recovered their sense of taste. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in mild COVID-19. Most patients do not present associated nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea and a small group of patients present these alterations in isolation.","output":"Afectacin del sentido del olfato y el gusto en la enfermedad leve por coronavirus (COVID-19) en pacientes espa?oles./ Afectacin del sentido del olfato y el gusto en la enfermedad leve por coronavirus (COVID-19) en pacientes espa?oles./ Smell and taste disorders in Spanish patients with mild COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Next-generation printing or commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing (3DP), is a fabrication process of construction of a 3D object using a computer-aided design or digital 3D model. The 3D object is created layer by layer by depositing, joining, or solidifying a feedstock material such as thermoplastic polymer under the control of a computer-designed program. It is considered the latest technology that has the potential to address complex medical and pharmaceutical problems, such as prototyping essential medical devices, equipment, and novel drug delivery systems. The ability of 3DP to produce medications with accurate specifications tailored to the needs of individual patients has indicated the possibility of developing personalized medicines. The technology allows dosage forms to be precisely printed in various shapes, sizes, and textures, in a limited time period. In spite of many potential medical and economic benefits of 3DP, some technical and regulatory challenges are associated with the widespread application of 3DPin the pharmaceutical sector;those need to be addressed by proper research so that the benefit of this technology can be utilized fully. Along with 3DP, more advanced and sophisticated printing technologies like 4D/5D printing are also introduced and have already been explored in biomedical applications. However, the utility of these technologies in the pharmaceutical drug manufacturing process is still in the early experimental phase and gradually evolving. This review article illustrates the recent trends, challenges, and future prospects of 3D Pin pharmaceutical applications, along with the highlights of the ongoing transition from 3D to 4D/5D printing.","output":"Pharmaceutical applications of next generation printing technologies: A brief literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The masks have always been mentioned as an effective tool against environmental threats. They are considered as protective equipment to preserve the respiratory system against the non-desirable air droplets and aerosols such as the viral or pollution particles. The aerosols can be pollution existence in the air, or the infectious airborne viruses initiated from the sneezing, coughing of the infected people. The filtration efficiency of the different masks against these aerosols are not the same, as the particles have different sizes, shapes, and properties. Therefore, the challenge is to fabricate the filtration masks with higher efficiency to decrease the penetration percentage at the nastiest conditions. To achieve this concept, knowledge about the mechanisms of the penetration of the aerosols through the masks at different effective environmental conditions is necessary. In this paper, the literature about the different kinds of face masks and respiratory masks, common cases of their application, and the advantages and disadvantages of them in this regard have been reviewed. Moreover, the related mechanisms of the penetration of the aerosols through the masks are discussed. The environmental conditions affecting the penetration as well as the quality of the fabrication are studied.

We analysed two periods of interest: (1) three peak months of the first COVID-19 wave (MarchCMay 2020), and (2) three recovery months thereafter (JuneCAugust 2020), compared to respective periods 4 years prior (2016C2019) using Poisson regression. In the three peak months of the first COVID-19 wave, there was an overall decline in hospital admissions for acute cerebrovascular diseases (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78C0.89, p < 0.001), which was significant for TIA (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52C0.72, p < 0.001) and ICH (0.78, 95% CI 0.67C0.91, p = 0.02), but not for IS (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.85C1, p = 0.08).

There are few cases of COVID-19 related colitis in the current literature. We present a rare case of COVID-19 colitis with the atypical presentation of persistent hiccups. Case Description/Methods: A 57 year old male with a PMHx of HTN, Parkinson's disease, stroke and localized colorectal adenocarcinoma presents to our institution with persistent hiccups and hypotension. The patient was started on chemotherapy (Capecitabine 1 Oxaliplatin) 3 weeks prior. In the last 7 days, he had GERD, nausea, anorexia, mild abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Initial laboratories recorded mild microcytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. He was started on IV hydration. Results were negative for C. difficile toxin, rotavirus, stool fat, stool leukocytes, ova/parasites, and negative growth in cultures. Hypotension resolved after 24 hours. Despite treatment, he continued with hiccups, abdominal pain and PO intolerance. The patient suffered respiratory failure secondary to aspiration due to hiccups;and was placed on MV for 24 hours. At this point, COVID-19 PCR pharyngeal swab returned positive. Abdominopelvic CT scan was performed due to persistent symptoms, demonstrating edematous ascending colon and distal ileum consistent with colitis. Further work-up revealed normal pH and lactic acid levels. He was placed on NPO and IV antibiotics. After 14 days, the patient was discharged. Discussion: Both gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and hiccups have been reported as atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection previously, but not concomitantly and even separately, rarely. Physicians must be suspicious of GI symptoms, with persistent hiccups, in the pandemic in order to diagnose COVID-19 infection and avoid further GI complications including ischemic, ileus and perforation;or the onset of severe respiratory complications..","output":"Persistent hiccups: A rare case of acute colitis related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to spread around the world even one year after the declaration of a global pandemic. Those with weakened immune systems, due to immunosuppressive medications or disease, may be at higher risk of COVID-19. This includes individuals with autoimmune diseases, cancer, transplants, and dialysis patients. Assessing the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 in this population has been challenging. While administrative databases provide data with minimal selection and recall bias, clinical and behavioral data is lacking. To address this, we are collecting self-reported survey data from a randomly selected subsample with and without COVID-19, which will be linked to administrative health data, to better quantify the risk of COVID-19 infection associated with immunosuppression. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using administrative and laboratory data from British Columbia (BC), Canada, we established a population-based case-control study of all individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Each case was matched to 40 randomly selected individuals from two control groups: individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., negative controls) and untested individuals from the general population (i.e., untested controls). We will contact 1000 individuals from each group to complete a survey co-designed with patient partners. A conditional logistic regression model will adjust for potential confounders and effect modifiers. We will examine the odds of COVID-19 infection according to immunosuppressive medication or disease type. To adjust for relevant confounders and effect modifiers not available in administrative data, the survey will include questions on behavioural variables that influence probability of being tested, acquiring COVID-19, and experiencing severe outcomes.

Findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, open access peer-reviewed journals, COVID-19 research repositories and dissemination channels used by our patient partners.","output":"Immunosuppression and COVID-19 infection in British Columbia: Protocol for a linkage study of population-based administrative and self-reported survey data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes direct lung damage, overwhelming endothelial activation, and inflammatory reaction, leading to acute respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating targeted therapies to hinder this exaggerated inflammatory response. Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have shown heterogeneous severity trajectories, suggesting that response to therapies is likely to vary across patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Are critically ill COVID-19 patients biologically and immunologically dissociable based on profiling of currently evaluated therapeutic targets? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We did a single-center, prospective study in an ICU department in France. Ninety-six critically ill adult patients admitted with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. We conducted principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering on a vast array of immunologic variables measured on the day of ICU admission. RESULTS: We found that patients were distributed in three clusters bearing distinct immunologic features and associated with different ICU outcomes. Cluster 1 had a humoral immunodeficiency phenotype with predominant B-lymphocyte defect, relative hypogammaglobulinemia, and moderate inflammation. Cluster 2 had a hyperinflammatory phenotype, with high cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF?]) associated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte defects. Cluster 3 had a complement-dependent phenotype with terminal complement activation markers (elevated C3 and sC5b-9). INTERPRETATION: Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibiting cytokine release marks, complement activation, or B-lymphocyte defects are distinct from each other. Such immunologic variability argues in favor of targeting different mediators in different groups of patients and could serve as a basis for patient identification and clinical trial eligibility.","output":"Identification of Distinct Immunophenotypes in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients with advanced cancers often face significant symptoms from their cancer and adverse effects from cancer-associated therapy. Patient-generated health data (PGHD) are routinely collected information about symptoms and activity levels that patients either directly report or passively record using devices such as wearable accelerometers. The objective of this study was to test the impact of an intervention integrating remote collection of PGHD with clinician and patient nudges to inform communication between patients with advanced cancer and their oncology team regarding symptom burden and functional status. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-centre prospective randomised controlled trial randomises patients with metastatic gastrointestinal or lung cancers into one of three arms: (A) usual care, (B) an intervention that integrates PGHD (including weekly text-based symptom surveys and passively recorded step counts) into a dashboard delivered to oncology clinicians at each visit and (C) the same intervention as arm B but with an additional text-based active choice intervention to patients to encourage discussing their symptoms with their oncology team. The study will enrol approximately 125 participants. The coprimary outcomes are patient perceptions of their oncology teams understanding of their symptoms and their functional status.

Method: This research is a quasi-experiment with a pre-test and post-test design with a control group design. The research sample was 80 adolescents aged 12 and 13 years. Respondents were divided into two groups, namely 40 intervention and control groups based on inclusion criteria. The intervention group was given the MI approach, and the control group was assigned conventional dental health education. The MI group also received follow-up over the phone. Both groups filled out knowledge and attitude questionnaires before being given treatment. Plaque index and tooth brushing practice examinations were performed at baseline and four weeks after intervention. Results: The results showed an increase in the average score of oral health knowledge, attitude, tooth brushing practice in all groups. The plaque index showed a decrease in the average score in all groups. The test of both groups showed that brief MI counseling was more effective than conventional dental health education, oral health knowledge(p=<0.001), attitude((p=<0.001), tooth brushing practice(p = 0.001), plaque index (p = 0.011). Followup MI by telephone in adolescents is beneficial in the research during the covid-19 pandemic as a promotive and preventive effort to improve dental health behaviour. The MI method by telephone is very interesting for adolescents, easily accessible and time-efficient. Conclusion : The MI counselling brief intervention can change dental and oral health behaviour through increasing knowledge, attitudes, tooth brushing practices and reducing the dental and oral hygiene index scores of adolescents.

Data base also included: demographic, clinical, chest X-ray and/or CT scan results, RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 and dexamethasone treatment. A total of 469 patients were evaluated as asymptomatic/mild and moderate/severe/critical cases. RESULTS: The median time since confirmation to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was 15 days [95% CI: 13-18] in asymptomatic/mild cases and 17 days [95% CI: 16-21] in moderate/severe ones. The median time to seroconversion for both IgM and IgG was 13 days [95% CI: 13-14] in asymptomatic/mild cases and 11 days [95% CI: 10-13] in moderate/severe ones.

Changes required of providers were substantial and could lead to increased burnout and, subsequently, increased turnover intentions. This study examined burnout experienced by mental health services providers in the context of COVID-19 and through the lens of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. We examined the effects of work changes on burnout and subsequent turnover intentions, and how job and personal resources may have buffered the extent to which work changes due to COVID-19 impacted burnout. Methods: Service providers (n = 93) from six community mental health centers (CMHCs) in one Midwestern state in the United States completed surveys as part of service contracts to implement evidence-based practices. Path analysis tested the unconditional indirect relations between work changes and turnover intentions through burnout. Moderated mediation determined whether the indirect effect of work changes on turnover intentions via burnout varied in strength by job and personal resources. Results: Work changes had a significant indirect effect on turnover intentions through burnout ( ? ^ = .140, 95% CI = .072, .217). This indirect effect varied as a function of two job resources, organizational trust and perceived organizational support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Burnout was relatively low only when work changes were low and job resources levels high. When work changes were high, burnout was similarly high across levels of job resources. To minimize burnout, organizations should limit task, setting, and team-related work changes to the extent possible.

By contrast, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using cell-based culture likely indicates infectivity, but there are limited data on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five patients with varying severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and critically unwell patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU; n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was observed, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) of the day four PCR (Ct(culture)) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ct(sample)) were compared, and positive cultures were defined where Ct(sample) - Ct(culture) was 3. FINDINGS: Of 234 samples collected, 228 (97%) were from the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 was only successfully isolated from samples with Ct(sample) 32, including in 28/181 (15%), 19/42 (45%) and 9/11 samples (82%) collected from outpatients, inpatients, and ICU patients, respectively.

Methods Preliminary cross-sectional data were analysed from a cohort study (n=4,378). Clinical and non-clinical staff of three London-based NHS Trusts (UK), including acute and mental health Trusts, took part in an online baseline survey. The primary outcome measure used is the presence of probable common mental disorders (CMDs), measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Secondary outcomes are probable anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (PCL-6), suicidal ideation (CIS-R), and alcohol use (AUDIT). Moral injury is measured using the Moray Injury Event Scale (MIES). Results Analyses showed substantial levels of CMDs (58.9%, 95%CI 58.1 to 60.8), and of PTSD (30.2%, 95%CI 28.1 to 32.5) with lower levels of depression (27.3%, 95%CI 25.3 to 29.4), anxiety (23.2%, 95%CI 21.3 to 25.3), and alcohol misuse (10.5%, 95%CI, 9.2 to 11.9). Women, younger staff, and nurses tended to have poorer outcomes than other staff, except for alcohol misuse.

Individuals, however, often misperceive the cooperation levels in a population. In the context of climate action, people underestimate the pro-climate positions of others. Designing incentives to enable cooperation and a sustainable future must thereby consider how social perception biases affect collective action. We propose a theoretical model and investigate the effect of social perception bias in non-linear public goods games. We show that different types of bias play a distinct role in cooperation dynamics. False uniqueness (underestimating own views) and false consensus (overestimating own views) both explain why communities get locked in suboptimal states. Such dynamics also impact the effectiveness of typical monetary incentives, such as fees. Our work contributes to understanding how targeting biases, e.g., by changing the information available to individuals, can comprise a fundamental mechanism to prompt collective action.","output":"Biased perceptions explain collective action deadlocks and suggest new mechanisms to prompt cooperation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interim results of the large, multinational trials on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) using a combination of antiviral drugs appear to have little to no effect on the 28\\\\day mortality or the in\\\\hospital course.

Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex - a homolog of the F1 ATPase motor - within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear. We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the locked ground state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an asymmetric torsional potential, and a free excited state in which FliJ undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity of the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: max  9.0 rps. The motor was then studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its maximal power output: Pmax  42 kBT/s, and the stall torque: Gstall  3 kBT/rad. Two modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which the motor performs useful work either by continuously grinding through the resistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that the function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier and therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them into the transport channel.","output":"FliI6-FliJ molecular motor assists with unfolding in the type III secretion export apparatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery has been used for gynecologic operations in recent years. The aim of the study is to describe our initial experience using vaginal-assisted natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) for apical pelvic organ prolapse repair. METHODS After patients underwent vaginal hysterectomy, vNOTES sacrocolpopexy (n = 4) or vNOTES high uterosacral ligament suspension (n = 7) were performed to treat symptomatic apical pelvic organ prolapse. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification results, and recorded surgical data (eg, duration of surgery, intraoperative complications, additional prolapse and incontinence surgeries) were obtained from patient files and the hospital's database. Information from postoperative follow-up visits, including complications and anatomical results, were also recorded. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 60.7  9.1 years. The mean total operative time was 121.3  22.7 minutes. The mean operative time for vaginal hysterectomy, vNOTES sacrocolpopexy, and vNOTES uterosacral ligament suspension was 46  11.9, 65  38, 25  8.2 minutes, respectively. There were no intraoperative and postoperative complications observed. The mean postoperative 24-hour visual analog scale score was 3.5  1.9 for vNOTES sacrocolpopexy patients and 3.2  0.9 for vNOTES uterosacral ligament suspension patients. Only one patient in the vNOTES sacrocolpopexy group had a recurrence; she experienced stage 2 anterior compartment prolapse 8 months after surgery.

Therefore, we propose building a character-based chatbot named 'Chasey' for COVID-19, to combat the risk of misinformation amplification during the pandemic. Chasey provides users with various COVID-19 information such as tracking the cases per country, giving advice, answering frequently asked questions, and performing symptoms checking. According to the selected chatbot character, users will receive personalized responses to their inquiries from verified sources. Moreover, we investigate how our chatbot implementation overcomes some of the challenges and limitations of healthcare and COVID-19 chatbots. Finally, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the chatbot's usability, as well as, the likability and trustworthiness of the chatbot characters.

The destruction of human capital may leave a longer imprint, but cities have persisted through many plagues over the past millennia. By contrast, economic and political shocks, including deindustrialisation or the loss of capital city status, can enormously harm an urban area. These facts suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will only significantly alter urban fortunes if it is accompanied by a major economic shift, such as widespread adoption of remote work, or political shifts that could lead businesses and the wealthy to leave urban areas.

The increasing number of TB-resistant cases has contributed to this scenario. In light of this, new strategies to control and treat the disease are necessary. Our research group has previously described furoxan derivatives as promising scaffolds to be explored as new antitubercular drugs. RESULTS Two of these furoxan derivatives, (14b) and (14c), demonstrated a high selectivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The compounds (14b) and (14c) were also active against a latent M. tuberculosis strain, with MIC90 values of 6.67 M and 9.84 M, respectively; they were also active against monoresistant strains (MIC90 values ranging from 0.61 to 20.42 M) and clinical MDR strains (MIC90 values ranging from 3.09 to 42.95 M). Time-kill experiments with compound (14c) showed early bactericidal effects that were superior to those of the first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs currently used in therapy. The safety of compounds (14b) and (14c) was demonstrated by the Ames test because these molecules were not mutagenic under the tested conditions. Finally, we confirmed the safety, and high efficacy of compounds (14b) and (14c), which reduced M. tuberculosis to undetectable levels in a mouse aerosol model of infection.

Vpu forms cation-specific ion channels in host cells, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. An understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through Vpu is desirable, but remains limited because of the unavailability of an experimental structure of the channel. Using a structure of the pentameric form of Vpu C modeled and validated based on available experimental data C umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations (cumulative simulation time of more than 0.4 s) were employed to elucidate the energetics and the molecular mechanism of ion transport in Vpu. Free energy profiles corresponding to the permeation of Na(+) and K(+) were found to be similar to each other indicating lack of ion selection, consistent with previous experimental studies. The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments. A two-dimensional free energy landscape has been computed to model multiple ion permeation, based on which a mechanism for ion conduction is proposed. It is shown that only one ion can pass through the channel at a time. This, along with a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, explains the slow kinetics of ion conduction.

To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server.

In order to better understand and diagnose anxiety in PD patients, we investigated the generalizability of the results of a previous factor analysis on anxiety symptoms to a sample of PD patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Methods In this cross-sectional study, anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) in 123 PD patients who were referred for neuropsychiatric diagnostics and treatment. Subscales of anxiety were analyzed through principal component analysis of BAI items. The associations between BAI subscales and symptoms of motor and cognitive function and depression were assessed through regression analyses. Results Similar to the previous factor analysis, we found one psychological (affective) and four somatic subscales of anxiety in the BAI. The affective subscale was the principal component explaining 35.9% of the variance. The scores on the total BAI and the affective subscale were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. In a post-hoc analysis, the affective subscale had equal power as compared to the total BAI in predicting whether or not participants were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder after psychiatric evaluation. Conclusion In this study, we replicated our previous findings of one affective and multiple somatic subscales of the BAI.

METHODS: The paid digital marketing campaign occurred in 3 phases from 2018 to 2020. In each phase, 24 to 36 marketing messages, in English and Spanish, were created and disseminated using Googles Universal App Campaigns and Facebook Ads Manager. Outcomes were measured using impressions, clicks, and install data. Return on investment was measured using click-through rate (CTR), cost per click, and cost per install metrics. RESULTS: The Google-driven marketing messages garnered a total of 4,879,722 impressions (n=1,991,250, 40.81% for English and n=2,888,472, 59.19% for Spanish). The messages resulted in a total of 73,956 clicks (n=44,328, 59.94% for English and n=29,628, 40.06% for Spanish), with a total average CTR of 1.52% (2.22% for English and 1.03% for Spanish). From these clicks, there were 13,707 installs (n=9765, 71.24% for English and n=3942, 28.76% for Spanish) of the CDCs Milestone Tracker app on Google Play Store. The total average cost per install was US $0.93 across all phases. The phase 3 headline Track your childs development generated the highest CTR of 3.23% for both English and Spanish audiences. The Facebook-driven marketing messages garnered 2,434,320 impressions (n=1,612,934, 66.26% for English and n=821,386, 33.74% for Spanish).

Here, we evaluated the microbial survival rate at each layer of commercial of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs) using bacterial bioaerosols. The penetration efficiency of bacterial particles for FFRs was lower than that for SMs; however, the microbial survival rate for all tested masks was >13%, regardless of filtration performance.

It is unknown whether treatment delays for MIBC patients eligible for curative chemoradiation (CRT) compromise long-term outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we used the National Cancer Database to investigate if there is an association between a 90-day delay from TURBT in initiating CRT and overall survival (OS). We included patients with cT2-4N0M0 MIBC from 2004-2015 who underwent TURBT and curative-intent concurrent CRT. Patients were grouped based on timing of CRT: 89 days after TURBT (earlier) vs.  90 & <180 days after TURBT (delayed). RESULTS: 1,387 (87.5%) received earlier CRT (median 45 days post-TURBT, IQR: 34-59 days) and 197 (12.5%) received delayed CRT (median 111 days post-TURBT, IQR: 98-130 days). Median OS was 29.0 months (95% CI, 26.0-32.0) versus 27.0 months (95% CI, 19.75-34.24) for earlier and delayed CRT, respectively (p=0.94). On multivariable analysis, delayed CRT was not associated with an OS difference: hazard ratio, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.87-1.27); p=0.60. CONCLUSION: While these results are limited and require validation, short strategic treatment delays during a pandemic can be considered based on clinician judgement.","output":"Management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer during a pandemic: Impact of treatment delay on survival outcomes for patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Group testing has recently become a matter of vital importance for efficiently and rapidly identifying the spread of Covid-19.

In the region Lombardy the mortality rate was doubled in comparison with the previous years and 50% of the increase was related with not-COVID19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in mortality rates for not-COVID19 related deaths in the region Lombardy was connected to the generalized turmoil in the acute phase of an overwhelming pandemic, including diffuse stress, inadequate communications, reluctance to ask for medical help unless symptoms were severe, unexpected inadequate number of health workers, hospital and ICU beds.

We hypothesized that PSVPro ventilation mode would reduce consumption of anesthetic agents compared with pressure control ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Seventy children between three and eight years of age undergoing elective lower abdominal and urological surgery were randomized into PCV group (n = 35) or PSVPro group (n = 35). General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and a Proseal LMA? was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion to maintain the entropy values between 40 and 60. In the PCV mode, the inspiratory pressure was adjusted to obtain an expiratory tidal volume of 8 mLkg(?1) and a respiratory rate of 12C20/min. In the PSVPRO group, the flow trigger was set at 0.4 Lmin(?1) and pressure support was adjusted to obtain expiratory tidal volume of 8 mLkg(?1). Consumption of anesthetic agent was recorded as the primary outcome. Emergence time and discharge time were recorded as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The PSVPro group showed significant reduction in propofol consumption compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 33.3 g(?1)kg(?1)min(?1); 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2 to 42.2).

This study tested three versions of fake news labels with 541 online participants in a two-wave study. A warning that came before a false headline was initially very effective in both discouraging belief in false headlines generally and eliminating a partisan congruency effect (the tendency to believe politically congenial information more readily than politically uncongenial information).

During the past few years, insights into human CDI epidemiology changed and C. difficile is also considered as an emerging community-acquired pathogen. Certain ribotypes (RT) are possibly associated with zoonotic transmission. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of C. difficile in a population of pets and to characterise the isolates. RESULTS: Faecal samples from a total of 90 diarrhoeic dogs and 24 from exotic animal species (both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic) were analysed. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 6 (6.7%) dogs and one reptile sample (4.2%). Four (66.7%) of the six dog strains were capable of producing toxins. Four known different RTs were detected in dogs (010, 014, 123 and 358) and a new one was found in a faecal sample of an exotic animal. This new RT isolate was negative for all toxin genes tested and belonged to sequence type 347 which has been proposed as a Clade-III member. Importantly, two dog strains showed a stable resistance to metronidazole (initial MIC values: 128 and 48 g/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implementation of antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programs to assess the prevalence of metronidazole resistance in dogs; molecular studies to elucidate C. difficile metronidazole resistance mechanisms are warranted. Based on the similarity between the ribotypes observed in dogs and those described in humans, the zoonotic transmission should be further explored. Furthermore, exotic animals have shown to harbor uncommon C. difficile strains which require further genomic studies.

Inclusion criteria was articles that were reviewed and reported the incidence of neurological outcomes in patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Results The initial search yielded 638 records, from which 7 articles were included. Overall, the incidence of CNS complications was calculated to be 6.27% (95% CI: 3.32 to 9.98). The incidence of the most common CNS complications, encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disease, were 9.14% (95%CI: 2.20 to 19.81) and 2.59% (95% CI: 1.31 to 4.25), respectively. Conclusion CNS complications do exist in COVID-19 patients, encephalopathy being the most concerning one. The heterogeneity in the existing literature causes an uncertainty in reporting the definite prevalence rate for each complication. Thus, further studies are needed for scientists to reach a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of these complications in COVID-19 patients.

The primary barrier to cure HIV infection is the multiple reservoir sites, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, CNS, liver, lung, male and female reproductive system, secondary lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, established one to two weeks after acquisition of HIV. Additional challenges include understanding the mechanism(s) by which HIV is maintained at low or undetectable levels and developing treatments that will eradicate or produce a sustained suppression of virus without ART. To date, the most extensive clinical investigations of cure strategies have been the shock-and-kill approach employing histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to induce reactivation of latent HIV. Despite evidence for HIV latency reversal, HDACi alone have not decreased the size of the latent reservoir. Clinical pharmacologic explanations for these results include a low inhibitory quotient (i.e., low potency) within the reservoir sites and intrinsic (e.g., sex differences, reservoir size) and extrinsic (physiochemical and pharmacokinetic drug characteristics) factors.

The goal was to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in developing acoustics-based COVID-19 POCTs by enabling them to work on the same set of development and test datasets.

SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0% (95% confidence interval - 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019. CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible. Moreover, as shown by this study's results on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases during the second wave of the pandemic, these adverse effects are preventable to a non-negligible extent.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Effects on Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Croatia: A Population- and Registry-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The objective of this randomized, single-blind, split-mouth controlled, clinical trial was to evaluate whether the use of a short-pulsed 9.3-m CO2 laser increases the caries resistance of occlusal pit and fissures in addition to fluoride therapy over 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 60 participants, average age 13.1 years, were enrolled. At baseline, second molars were randomized into test and control, and assessed by ICDAS, SOPROLIFE, and DIAGNOdent. An independent investigator irradiated test molars with a CO2 laser (wavelength 9.3 m, pulse duration 4 s, pulse repetition rate 43 Hz, beam diameter 250 m, average fluence 3.9 J/cm2, 20 laser pulses per spot). Test molars received laser and fluoride treatment, control teeth fluoride alone. Fluoride varnish was applied at baseline and at 6 months. After 6 and 12 months, teeth were again assessed. RESULTS A total of 57 participants completed the 6-month and 51 the 12-month recall. Laser-treated surfaces showed very slight ICDAS improvements over time with ICDAS change - 1 in 11% and 8%, no changes (ICDAS change 0) in 68% and 67%, and slightly worsened (ICDAS change 1) in 19% and 24% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively, and worsened by two scores in 2% at both recall time points. Control teeth showed significantly higher ICDAS increases, with 47% and 25% showing ICDAS change 0, ICDAS change 1 in 49% and 55%, and ICDAS change 2 in 4% and 20% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively.

Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases.

The factors influencing compliance with these regulations may differ from \\"classic\\" predictors for medical compliance. This study attempted to assess the effect of social communication and psychological factors on intention to comply. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on healthy adults living in Israel (n = 697). The survey assessed the intention to comply with the state COVID-19 regulations and explored possible correlations with demographic and psychosocial factors. Data were collected during May 2020 using a Qualtrics online survey. Data were analyzed to find correlations between anxiety, uncertainty, media exposure and other variables and the level of intention to comply as self-reported. Moderation and mediation effects were studied by an integrative model of influencing factors. We found that media exposure change, trust in responsible agencies and anxiety were positively correlated with compliance, while uncertainty was correlated with noncompliance. The effect of media exposure on compliance had two components. First, media exposure was positively correlated with compliance. On the other hand, media exposure was positively correlated with uncertainty, and uncertainty was negatively correlated with compliance. Interestingly, anxiety, which was positively correlated with media exposure, also moderated the negative correlation between uncertainty and compliance. Our results highlight the important role of uncertainty and anxiety as moderators between media exposure and compliance. To increase public compliance with COVID-19 regulations, efforts should be directed at decreasing uncertainty and anxiety.","output":"Keep Calm and Stay Safe: The Relationship between Anxiety and Other Psychological Factors, Media Exposure and Compliance with COVID-19 Regulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout has coincided with the spread of variants of concern.

The WHO has implemented a number of programs to eradicate or eliminate targeted infectious diseases. Polio eradication and elimination of neonatal tetanus are making slow progress, obstacles to the control of these diseases are ongoing armed conflicts in regions with high prevalence and underfinancing of programs.

We conducted an in-depth investigation on the role and mechanism of SPINK2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS The relationship between SPINK2 expression and AML clinicopathologic characteristics was determined using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Concomitantly, we used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate regression analyses to evaluate SPINK2 as a prognostic marker of AML. Additionally, we annotated the enrichment and function of SPINK2 using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Sets Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze the relationship between SPINK2 expression and immune infiltration. RESULTS SPINK2 expression was significantly higher in AML patients compared to healthy individuals (P<0.001). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve in the GSE9476 dataset was 0.660, whereas that in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and TCGA datasets was 0.935. In addition, GSEA also showed that several pathways were enriched in the group with high SPINK2 expression, such as PI3K-AKT signaling, PD-L1 expression, and checkpoint pathways. Analysis of immune infiltration showed that SPINK2 expression was correlated with certain immune infiltrating cells. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that the level of SPINK2 was an independent risk factor for the progression of AML (P<0.001). Moreover, age, M1, M5, M6, and CytoRisk-Poor also affected the progression of AML (P<0.05). The C-index of the nomogram in our internal validation was 0.702. CONCLUSION The high expression of SPINK2 in AML suggests that SPINK2 may play an important role in the immune microenvironment and thus could be a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of AML.","output":"SPINK2 is a prognostic biomarker related to immune infiltration in acute myeloid leukemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Along with the sharp increase of confirmed cases novel coronavirus infection, more critically ill cases require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and prognostication of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in sepsis for patients admitted to ICU. METHODS: Between January and June 2020, we conducted a prospective observational study during the hospitalization of 506 adult patients admitted to the ICU. MDW was evaluated in 2,367 consecutive samples received for routine complete blood counts (CBC) performed once a day and every day during the study. Sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3 criteria and patients enrolled were classified in the following groups: no sepsis, sepsis and septic shock. RESULTS: MDW values were significantly higher in patients with sepsis or septic shock in comparison to those within the no sepsis group [median 26.23 (IQR: 23.48-29.83); 28.97 (IQR: 21.27-37.21); 21.99 (IQR: 19.86-24.36) respectively]. ROC analysis demonstrated that AUC is 0.785 with a sensitivity of 66.88% and specificity of 77.79% at a cut-off point of 24.63.

This single-arm pilot study aimed to evaluate whether a study using a procalcitonin-guided stopping-rule for antibiotics in paediatric FN is possible. METHODS: Daily procalcitonin levels were performed during episodes of FN and clear guidance given for antibiotic discontinuation. Episode data and quantitative feasibility data were collected alongside interviews with professionals and ethnographic observations. Analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: Of 32 patients and families approached, 28 patients consented, and 13 had febrile neutropenia. In total, 16 episodes were included in the study. All relevant FN episodes had data captured, with adequate data collection. There were no significant safety events. In 4/8 (50%) of episodes without clear microbiologically documented or clinical infection, antibiotics were reduced in duration or in spectrum.

During that time we investigated the clinical features, treatment, and nursing care of 36 patients and reported on 12 of these patients' perceptions of their illness experience. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical features, treatment, nursing care and perceptions of the illness experience of patients with SARS in Hong Kong in order to better inform nurses caring for patients with this highly contagious and potentially lethal disease. METHOD: We abstracted data from the medical and nursing records on the clinical features, treatment and nursing care of 36 patients (21 women, 15 men) in whom SARS was diagnosed and who were admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between March 15 and April 15, 2003. A review of the hospital's policy and procedures on infection control was also undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the patients to elicit their perceptions of the illness experience. FINDINGS: The most common symptoms were cough (83%), dyspnea (80.6%), malaise (69.4%) and fever (61%). Less common symptoms included headache (38.9%), diarrhea (38.9%), dizziness (30.6%), myalgia (25%), chills (19.4%), nausea and vomiting (19.4%) and rigor (the occurrence of a sensation of hot-and-cold and shivering in addition to teeth chattering and bed shaking) (8.3%). All 36 patients received a combination of corticosteroids and ribavirin. The patients were at risk of drug-related adverse reactions and deterioration of respiratory function, and nursing vigilance was required. CONCLUSION: Nursing patients with SARS was challenging as the disease was highly contagious and potentially lethal, and not much was known about this disease. In addition to the use of frontline treatment, infection control and sensitivity to individual responses to sudden and catastrophic illness were required to support these patients. From this outbreak of SARS, we have learned the importance of infection control in containing and controlling the disease.

A successful match into an ophthalmology residency was achieved by 144 (83.7%) applicants. Applicants applied to (mean  SD) 79.7  22.8 ophthalmology residency programs, received 13.1  8.9 invitations to interview, and attended 11.1  5.8 interviews. Most applicants (N = 126; 71.2%) and PDs (N = 22; 78.6%) expressed a preference for in-person interviews over virtual interviews. If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers.

METHOD The review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute approach and reported using PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. Online databases were used to identify published literature about off-patent registered prescription medicines used for off-label indications in Australian public hospital, community and primary healthcare settings. In addition, empirical data from the Queensland and the South Australian state-wide medicine formularies were screened for the same medication/off-label indication dyads identified in the literature, and other locally approved uses. RESULTS Overall, fourteen studies were included, conducted in public hospitals (n = 11), palliative care units (n = 2) and the community setting (n = 1). There were 213 reports extracted from the literature describing off-patent registered prescription medicines used for off-label indications, representing 128 unique medication/off-label indication dyads and 32 different medicines. Of these, just five medication/off-label indication dyads were approved for use on both the Queensland and South Australian state-wide medicine formularies, with 12 others only approved for use in Queensland and 16 others only approved for use in South Australia. Further examination of these state-wide formularies demonstrated that the use of off-patent registered prescription medicines beyond registered indications is more extensive than has been reported to date in the literature. There were 28 additional medication/off-label indication dyads approved on the Queensland state-wide medicine formulary and 14 such examples approved for use in South Australia. Of these, just two medication/off-label indication dyads were approved for use on both formularies. CONCLUSION The extent to which off-patent registered prescription medicines have been repurposed in clinical settings for off-label indications in Australia is greater than previously reported in the literature. Usage and funded availability of certain medication/off-label indication dyads, varies across Australia. These results further expose the two tiered system of medicines regulation in Australia, and its impact on equity of access to medicines. Further research is required to support policy change to encourage submission of registration updates for off-patent prescription medicines.","output":"The extent to which off-patent registered prescription medicines are used for off-label indications in Australia: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A pandemic is a particular medical challenge for seafarers traveling without a physician on board.

For infection prevention and management on board, those responsible need a portfolio of protective measures that can be used on ships. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: The overview examines the question of which technical, organizational and personal protective measures can be used on a merchant ship in order to prevent or cope with COVID-19 outbreaks on board. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Guidelines, information and occupational health and safety standards from the maritime setting, but also from many other work areas, were examined in order to facilitate a variable use by those responsible (e.g. according to ship size, equipment, weather, operating status, work requirements, contact with external persons, medical problems). RESULTS: A handout was compiled that contains specific technical, organizational and personal protective measures for crews, explaining their use in a maritime context. Possible safety barriers, options to combine them and an appropriate timing are explained in a target group-oriented manner. CONCLUSION: A great variety of protective measures derived from occupational medical literature and the experience of the port medical service in Hamburg can also be implemented on the high seas. In pandemic times, merchant ships should be equipped with foresight (e.g. with rapid diagnostic tests) and those responsible should be authorized to use effective infection control measures adapted to the situation on board.

The TMPRSS2 gene may be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Basigin (BSG), but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data from 76 human populations demonstrates that a functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in the TMPRSS2 gene is found in many human populations at relatively high frequencies, with region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by rs12329760, which has previously been found to be associated with prostate cancer, ranged between 10% and 63% and was significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared with European populations. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two copy number variants were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. A number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well-studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and curcumin.

The common route of A. phagocytophilum transmission is through a tick bite, the main vector in Europe being Ixodes ricinus. Despite the apparently ubiquitous presence of the pathogen A. phagocytophilum in ticks and various wild and domestic animals from Europe, up to date published clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) remain rare compared to the worldwide status. It is unclear if this reflects the epidemiological dynamics of the human infection in Europe or if the disease is underdiagnosed or underreported. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have suggested an increased occupational risk of infection for forestry workers, hunters, veterinarians, and farmers with a tick-bite history and living in endemic areas. Although the overall genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum in Europe is higher than in the USA, the strains responsible for the human infections are related on both continents. However, the study of the genetic variability and assessment of the difference of pathogenicity and infectivity between strains to various hosts has been insufficiently explored to date. Most of the European HGA cases presented as a mild infection, common clinical signs being pyrexia, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The diagnosis of HGA in the USA was recommended to be based on clinical signs and the patients history and later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, in Europe since the majority of cases are presenting as mild infection, laboratory tests may be performed before the treatment in order to avoid antibiotic overuse.

Exposure: Among 261 health care workers, 130 were in the specialist team and included 33 physicians, 32 of whom (97.0%) of whom were from relevant specialties. Each physician was in charge of 25-27 beds, with a 6-hour shift time. The mixed team included 131 health care workers, with 7 of the 28 physicians (25.0%) from relevant specialties. Each physician managed 12-13 beds, with a 4-hour shift time. Non-specialists received short-term intensive training and then followed strict management protocols. Specialists practiced as normal. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcome was in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Another outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers. Results: A total of 269 patients were included (144 male). In-hospital mortality rate of patients treated by the specialist teams and the mixed teams was 12.6% (20/159) and 12.7% (14/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95% CI -8.2% to 7.9%, p=.97). None of the health care workers were infected.

In spite of these developments, attitudes of sexual and gender minority populations regarding the necessity of seropositive status disclosure remain unexamined. METHODS: The current study analyzed qualitative data regarding the necessity of seropositive status disclosure from 62 sexual minority men as well as transgender and gender non-conforming individuals who have sex with men from 2020 to 2021. RESULTS: The majority of participants believed disclosure to be necessary and invoked several social and structural factors that informed their attitudes. Participants cited HIV criminalization laws, the ethics of non-disclosure, and disclosure as a means of educating sex partners when appraising the necessity of disclosure. Participants also presented concerns regarding U=U efficacy and HIV stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that the disclosure of seropositive status to sex partners is still important to U=U-aware sexual and gender minority individuals. The majority of the study sample, irrespective of HIV status, believed seropositive status disclosure was necessary in advance of sex. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest opportunities for public health messaging to remediate concerns about U=U efficacy, combat misinformation, and clarify out-of-date information on HIV criminalization.","output":"Attitudes Toward HIV-Positive Status Disclosure Among U=U-Aware Sexual and Gender Minority Individuals in the USA: a Consensual Qualitative Research Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recurrent zoonotic spillover of coronaviruses (CoVs) into the human population underscores the need for broadly active countermeasures.

Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a unique angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the receptor binding site. In murine models of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of ADG-2 provided complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology.

However, the information asymmetry between public health service purchasers and public health service undertakers triggers a supervision dilemma. Based on this background, this study uses the evolutionary game theory to analyze the symbiotic evolution between local governments and public health service institutions under different reward and punishment mechanisms, explore game evolution, strategy adjustment, and influencing factors of different game subjects, and analyze the necessity and appropriate intensity of dynamic rewards and punishment mechanisms. The results show that: under the static condition, the penalty can change the strategies of local governments to a certain extent, but it is still difficult to achieve complete self-discipline management of public health service institutions. If local governments implement a dynamic reward or penalty mechanism in the supervision process of public health services for older adults, the equilibrium between them tends to be evolutionary stable. For three dynamic mechanisms, a dynamic reward mechanism is more conducive to adopting a self-discipline behavior of public health service institutions, which is helpful to realize the supervision of public health services for older adults. Also, there is a positive correlation between the proportion of public health service institutions who adopt a self-discipline behavior strategy and the maximum punishment intensity, and a negative correlation with the reward intensity.

In this study, we introduced a secure and high-fidelity live animal model to supplement the in vitro simulators for off-pump CA bypass grafting training. DESIGN The left internal thoracic artery (ITA) of 3 Chinese miniature pigs was grafted to the left anterior descending CA using an end-to-side anastomosis. The free segment of the ITA was fixed on the ventricle surface, making it a simulative CA beating in synchrony with the heart. A total of 6 to 8 training anastomoses were made on each ITA. SETTING Animal Experiment Center in Fuwai Hospital. PARTICIPANTS In total, 19 resident surgeons with at least 3 years of cardiac surgery work experience were trained using the new model. Their performances were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS Simulative coronary arteries were successfully constructed in all 3 animals with no adverse event observed. A total of 19 anastomoses were then completed, 1 pig of 7 anastomoses and the other 2 animals of 6 anastomoses. Time consumption for the anastomosis was 782  107 seconds. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 10/19 procedures. The most frequency site (7/10) was at the toe of the anastomosis. Further, the most common cause was uneven spacing or small margin of the stitches or both. Emergencies occurred during the training process included hypotension (7 procedures), tachyarrhythmia (4 procedures), and low blood oxygen saturation (1 procedure). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of our new live pig model in training resident surgeons.

The esophageal Doppler monitor (EDM) is widely used, but has several limitations. The NICOM, a completely noninvasive cardiac output monitor (Cheetah Medical), may be appropriate for guiding GDFT. No prospective studies have compared the NICOM and the EDM. We hypothesized that the NICOM is not significantly different from the EDM for monitoring during GDFT. METHODS One hundred adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery participated in this study. Patients in phase I (n = 50) had intraoperative GDFT guided by the EDM while the NICOM was connected, and patients in phase II (n = 50) had intraoperative GDFT guided by the NICOM while the EDM was connected. Each patient's stroke volume was optimized using 250-mL colloid boluses. Agreement between the monitors was assessed, and patient outcomes (postoperative pain, nausea, and return of bowel function), complications (renal, pulmonary, infectious, and wound complications), and length of hospital stay (LOS) were compared. RESULTS Using a 10% increase in stroke volume after fluid challenge, agreement between monitors was 60% at 5 minutes, 61% at 10 minutes, and 66% at 15 minutes, with no significant systematic disagreement (McNemar P > 0.05) at any time point. The EDM had significantly more missing data than the NICOM. No clinically significant differences were found in total LOS or other outcomes.

Methods: We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions. Results: The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695.

The study included 72 CD patients on a GFD and 30 healthy controls. The dietary intake of both groups was assessed through a 3-day food diary, while adherence to a GFD in celiac subjects was assessed using Standardized Dietician Evaluation (SDE). Subsequently, all CD patients received detailed education on gluten sources, and 48 of them participated in a one-year follow-up. Results: Comparison with the control group showed that consumption of plant protein in CD patients was significantly lower, whereas fat and calories were higher. At baseline, only 62% of CD patients adhered to a GFD, but the standard dietary education successfully improved it.

ABSTRACT: Assessment of age-dependent cancer risk for carriers of a predicted pathogenic variant (PPV) is often hampered by biases in data collection, with a frequent under-representation of cancer-free PPV carriers. TUMOSPEC was designed to estimate the cumulative risk of cancer for carriers of a PPV in a gene that is usually tested in a hereditary breast and ovarian cancer context. Index cases are enrolled consecutively among patients who undergo genetic testing as part of their care plan in France. First- and second-degree relatives and cousins of PPV carriers are invited to participate whether they are affected by cancer or not, and genotyped for the familial PPV. Clinical, family and epidemiological data are collected, and all data including sequencing data are centralized at the coordinating centre. The three-year feasibility study included 4431 prospective index cases, with 19.1% of them carrying a PPV. When invited by the coordinating centre, 65.3% of the relatives of index cases (5.7 relatives per family, on average) accepted the invitation to participate. The study logistics were well adapted to clinical and laboratory constraints, and collaboration between partners (clinicians, biologists, coordinating centre and participants) was smooth. Hence, TUMOSPEC is being pursued, with the aim of optimizing clinical management guidelines specific to each gene.","output":"TUMOSPEC: A Nation-Wide Study of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Families with a Predicted Pathogenic Variant Identified through Multigene Panel Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Few studies have reported COVID-19 specific tracheotomy outcomes, and the optimal timing and patient selection criteria for tracheotomy remains undetermined. We delineate our outcomes for tracheotomies performed on COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic at a major epicenter in the United States. METHODS This is a retrospective observational cohort study. Mortality, ventilation liberation rate, complication rate, and decannulation rate were analyzed. RESULTS 64 patients with COVID-19 underwent tracheotomy between April 1, 2020 to May 19, 2020 at two tertiary care hospitals in Bronx, New York. The average duration of intubation prior to tracheotomy was 20 days (IQR 16.5-26.0). The mortality rate was 33% (n = 21), the ventilation liberation rate was 47% (n = 30), the decannulation rate was 28% (n = 18), and the complication rate was 19% (n = 12). Tracheotomies performed by Otolaryngology were associated with significantly improved survival (p < 0.05) with 60% of patients alive at the conclusion of the study compared to 9%, 12% and 19% of patients undergoing tracheotomy performed by Critical Care, General Surgery, and Pulmonology, respectively. CONCLUSION To date this is the second largest study describing tracheotomy outcomes in COVID-19 patients in the United States. Our early outcomes demonstrate successful ventilation liberation and decannulation in COVID-19 patients. Further inquiry is necessary to determine the optimal timing and identification of patient risk factors predictive of improved survival in COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy.

We aimed to identify effective interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness that are compatible with COVID-19 shielding and social distancing measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this rapid systematic review, we searched six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and SCOPUS) from inception to April 2020 for systematic reviews appraising interventions for loneliness and/or social isolation. Primary studies from those reviews were eligible if they included: 1) participants in a non-hospital setting; 2) interventions to reduce social isolation and/or loneliness that would be feasible during COVID-19 shielding measures; 3) a relevant control group; and 4) quantitative measures of social isolation, social support or loneliness. At least two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Downs and Black checklist. Study registration: PROSPERO CRD42020178654. We identified 45 RCTs and 13 non-randomised controlled trials; none were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nature, type, and potential effectiveness of interventions varied greatly. Effective interventions for loneliness include psychological therapies such as mindfulness, lessons on friendship, robotic pets, and social facilitation software. Few interventions improved social isolation. Overall, 37 of 58 studies were of Fair quality, as measured by the Downs & Black checklist. The main study limitations identified were the inclusion of studies of variable quality; the applicability of our findings to the entire population; and the current poor understanding of the types of loneliness and isolation experienced by different groups affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Many effective interventions involved cognitive or educational components, or facilitated communication between peers. These interventions may require minor modifications to align with COVID-19 shielding/social distancing measures. Future high-quality randomised controlled trials conducted under shielding/social distancing constraints are urgently needed.","output":"Interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness during COVID-19 physical distancing measures: A rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Capsule endoscopy (CE) emerged out of the pressing clinical need to image the small bowel (SB) in cases of midgut bleeding and provide an overall comfortable and reliable gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis 1 . Since its wider adoption in clinical practice, significant progress has been made in several areas including software development, hardware features and clinical indications, while innovative applications of CE never cease to appear 2 3 . Currently, several manufacturers provide endoscopic capsules with more or less similar technological features 4 . Although there is engaging and continuous academic and industry-fueled R&D, promising furtherment of CE technology 4 5 , the current status of clinical CE remains that of by and large an imaging modality. Clinical relevance of CE images is cornerstone in the decision-making process for medical management. In one of the larger to date SB CE studies, 4,206 abnormal images were detected in 3,280 patients 6 . Thus, CE leads to the identification of a large amount of potential pathology, some of which are pertinent (or relevant) while some (probably the majority) are not. Soon artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to carry out several roles currently performed by humans; in fact, we are witnessing only the first stages of a transition in the clinical adoption of AI-based solutions in several aspects of gastroenterology including CE 7 . Until then though, human-based decision-making profoundly impacts patient care and C although not suggested in the updated European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) European curriculum 8 9 C it should be an integral part of CE training. Frequently, interpretation of CE images by experts or at least experienced readers differs. In a tandem CE reading study, expert review of discordant cases revealed a 50 % (13/25 discordant results) error rate by experienced readers, corresponding (in 5/13 cases) to over-classification of an irrelevant abnormality 10 . Another comparative study showed an over-classification of such irrelevant abnormalities in ~10 % of CE readings 11 . One thing which has been for a while on the table C in relation to optimizing and/or standardizing CE reporting and subsequent decision-making C is the need for reproducible scoring systems and for a reliable common language among clinicians responsible for further patients management. Over the years, several of these scoring systems were developed while others appear in the wake of software and hardware improvements aiming to replace and/or complement their predecessors. This review presents a comprehensive account of the currently available classification/scoring systems in clinical CE spanning from predicting the bleeding potential of identified SB lesions (with emphasis on vascular lesions), and the individual rebleeding risk; scoring systems for the prediction of SB lesions in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGlB), having the potential to improve patient selection and rationalize the use of enteroscopy, with better allocation of resources, optimized diagnostic workflow and tailored treatment. This review also includes scores for reporting the inflammatory burden, the cleansing level that underscores confidence in CE reporting and the mass or bulge question in CE.

The susceptibility and severity of infection vary significantly across nations. The contribution of chronic viral and parasitic infections to immune homeostasis remains a concern. By investigating the role of interferon (IFN)-, we conducted this study to understand the connection between the decrease in numbers and severity of COVID-19 cases within parasitic endemic regions. Our research included 375 patients referred to hospitals for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Patients were subjected to full investigations, in particular severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 nucleic acid and Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibody detection, stool examination, and quantitative IFN- measurement. RESULTS: The majority of the studied cases had chest manifestation either alone (54.7%) or in association with gastrointestinal (GIT) manifestations (19.7%), whereas 25.6% had GIT symptoms. We reported parasitic infections in 72.8% of mild COVID-19 cases and 20.7% of severe cases. Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium, Blastocyst, and Giardia were the most common parasitic infections among the COVID-19 cases studied. CONCLUSION: The remarkable adaptation of human immune response to COVID-19 infection by parasitic infections with high levels of IFN- was observed in moderate cases compared with low levels in extreme cases.

Heavy metal contents in porewater provide vital information about their bioavailability, studies on this aspect are rare until now. In this study, sediment cores were collected from four adjacent cascade reservoirs in the upper Mekong River to study the distribution, potential sources, diffusive fluxes and toxicity of heavy metals in porewater. The findings indicated that the average contents of Mn, Fe, As, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in the sediment porewater were 6442, 644, 11.50, 2.62, 1.23, 3.95, 0.031, and 0.24 g/L, respectively; these contents varied as the sediment depth increased. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were mainly associated with anthropogenic sources, As, Mn and Fe were primarily affected by natural inputs, and Ni was affected by a combination of natural and anthropogenic effects. The diffusive fluxes of Mn, Fe, As, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in the cascade reservoirs of the Lancang River were 919 - 35,022, 2.12 - 2881, 0.17 - 750, 0.71 - 7.70, 2.30 - 31.18, (-3.35) - 6.40, 0.06 - 0.54, and (-0.52) - 4.08 g/(m2 day), respectively. The results of toxic units suggested that the contamination and toxicity of heavy metals in porewater were not serious. Overall, in the cascade reservoirs, the content and toxicity of heavy metals in porewater of the upstream reservoirs were higher than that of the downstream reservoirs. The operation of the cascade reservoirs enabled greater accumulation of contaminants in sediments of the upstream reservoirs.

Three key models of personality are considered: the Five-factor Model, HEXACO model, and Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). In tine with personality research, more generally, most studies focus on the Five-Factor model. Key findings are that neuroticism is most associated with poor mental health, and extraversion is associated with a reluctance to socially isolate. Conscientiousness predicts compliance with safety guidelines but also with fewer prosocial behaviors, particularly stockpiling. Research within the HEXACO framework largely confirms these findings, especially for emotionality and mental health. The additional HEXACO Honesty-Humility factor is found to be associated with prosocial views and abstention from panic buying. Studies based on the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality indicate emotional conflict as people wish to stay safe white maintaining a sense of normality.

Canine distemper virus has affected dog populations for centuries and in the past few decades appears to have jumped species, now causing disease in a number of non-canid species, some of which are been pushed to the brink of extinction by the virus. During the age of vaccination, the introduction and successful application of vaccines against rinderpest and measles has led to the eradication of the former and the greater control of the latter.

A total of 385 pairs of NP and saliva specimens were obtained, the majority from individuals presenting for initial evaluation, and were tested on two high-sensitivity reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Abbott m2000 and Abbott Alinity m (both with limits of detection [LoD] of 100 copies of viral RNA/ml). Concordance between saliva and NP swabs was excellent overall (Cohens  = 0.93) for both initial and follow-up testing, for both platforms, and for specimens treated with guanidinium transport medium as preservative as well as for untreated saliva ( = 0.88 to 0.95). Viral loads were on average 16 higher in NP specimens than saliva specimens, suggesting that only the relatively small fraction of outpatients (8% in this study) who present with very low viral loads (<1,600 copies/ml from NP swabs) would be missed by testing saliva instead of NP swabs when using sensitive testing platforms. Special attention was necessary to ensure leak-resistant specimen collection and transport. The advantages of self-collection of saliva, without behavioral restrictions, will likely outweigh a minor potential decrease in clinical sensitivity in individuals less likely to pose an infectious risk to others for many real-world scenarios, especially for initial testing.

Saliva would be much easier on both fronts, since patients could collect it themselves, and it is after all just spit.

Seasonal HPIV epidemics result in a significant burden of disease in children and account for 40% of pediatric hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) and 75% of croup cases. Parainfluenza viruses are associated with a wide spectrum of illnesses which include otitis media, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, croup, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Uncommon respiratory manifestations include apnea, bradycardia, parotitis, and respiratory distress syndrome and rarely disseminated infection. Immunity resulting from disease in childhood is incomplete and reinfection with HPIV accounts for 15% of respiratory illnesses in adults. Severe disease and fatal pneumonia may occur in elderly and immunocompromised adults. HPIV pneumonia in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with 50% acute mortality and 75% mortality at 6 months. Though sensitive molecular diagnostics are available to rapidly diagnose HPIV infection, effective antiviral therapies are not available. Currently, treatment for HPIV infection is supportive with the exception of croup where the use of corticosteroids has been found to be beneficial.

A good number of people are falling prey to anti-vaccination campaigns, and therefore, some amount of vaccine hesitancy must have developed. The primary objective of the study was to find the level of potential COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Kashmiri population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the valley of Kashmir. A predesigned questionnaire was shared online. The participation of respondents was voluntary. Exclusions were made on account of residence outside Kashmir valley, duplicate forms, and wrong information. The data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2010 and analyzed using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: A total of 487 respondents were included. About 67% of the participants were in the age group of 30 years, 55% female, 54% rural, and 16% had ever been COVID-19 positive. About 14% of the participants were completely hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 40% were unsure if they will accept the vaccination. The main reason for the total nonacceptance of the vaccine was the doubts about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines (67%). Urban people were more likely to be hesitant to the vaccine than rural people (odds ratio [OR] 1.845, confidence interval CI 1.022 to 3.333). Those who were ever COVID-19 positive were 3.3 times more likely to say no to COVID-19 vaccination than those who were never positive.

The patient was initially evaluated at hospital A on February 15; at that time, COVID-19 was not suspected, as the patient denied travel or contact with symptomatic persons. During a 4-day hospitalization, the patient was managed with standard precautions and underwent multiple aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), including nebulizer treatments, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy. Several days after the patient's transfer to hospital B, a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States. Little is known about specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings. To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results. Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient. Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.

Here, we present LineageOT, a unified framework for lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Specifically, we leverage mathematical tools from graphical models and optimal transport to reconstruct developmental trajectories from time courses with snapshots of both cell states and lineages.

Movement-based zoning can be implemented to delineate the boundaries for movement restrictions. Previous studies used network community detection methods, which capture cohesive within-region movements, to delineate containment zones. However, most people usually travel and spend most of their time in several fixed locations, which implies that an infected person could transmit the pathogens to only a specific group of people with whom s/he usually has a contact in frequently-visited locations. Existing network community detection methods cannot reflect the regularity of the flow of people; thus, this study aims to use land-use patterns to reflect trip purposes to measure the regularity of human mobility. We propose a novel network community detection method, the Human Mobility Regularity-based Zoning (HuMoRZ) algorithm, to delineate containment zones incorporating mobility regularity. The Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The spatial diffusion of an emerging respiratory disease, novel influenza A/H1N1, is simulated for comparing three different quarantine zoning systems: (1) a minimum zoning unit, (2) optimal zoning without considering mobility regularity, and (3) optimal zoning considering mobility regularity. Two epidemiological performance indicators are used to compare simulation results: namely, the accumulated infected number (AN) on the 30th day, reflecting the severity of an epidemic, and the critical time (CT), the moment at which half of the population becomes infected, measuring the diffusion speed of an epidemic. To measure the variety of different facility types within a containment zone, we further use Shannon's entropy scores, representing a self-contained zone, and the boxplot of all zones' entropy scores, reflecting geospatial homogeneity of life functions across zones. Our results suggest that containment zones that incorporate mobility regularity could significantly delay the epidemic peak and critical time and decrease the severity of an epidemic. The zoning patterns proposed in our algorithm could also allow for more life functions in a zone and more evenly distributed life resources across zones than those of zones generated by other methods. These findings could provide insightful implications for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Regionalization for infection control: An algorithm for delineating containment zones considering the regularity of human mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Investigation of potential improvements in dynamic CT perfusion measurements by exploitation of improved visualization of contrast agent in virtual monoenergetic reconstructions of images acquired with dual-energy computed tomography (DECT). METHOD: For 17 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, dynamic dual-source DECT acquisitions were performed at 80kVp/Sn140kVp every 1.5 s over 51 s. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) were reconstructed for photon energies between 40 keV and 150 keV (5 keV steps). Using the maximum-slope model, perfusion maps of blood flow were calculated from VMIs and 80kVp images and compared quantitatively with regard to blood flow measured in regions of interest in healthy tissue and carcinoma, standard deviation (SD), and absolute-difference-to-standard-deviation ratio (ADSDR) of measurements. RESULTS: On average, blood flow calculated from VMIs increased with increasing energy levels from 114.3  37.2 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 45.6  25.3 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for 40 keV to 128.6  58.9 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 75.5  49.8 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for 150 keV, compared to 114.2  37.4 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 46.5  26.6 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for polyenergetic 80kVp. Differences in blood flow between tissue types were significant for all energies. Differences between perfusion maps calculated from VMIs and 80kVp images were not significant below 110 keV. SD and ADSDR were significantly better for perfusion maps calculated from VMIs at energies between 40 keV and 55 keV than for those calculated from 80kVp images. Compared to effective dose of dynamic 80kVp acquisitions (4.6  2.2mSv), dose of dynamic DECT/VMI acquisitions (8.0  3.7mSv) was higher.

It has been argued that such clonal interference may have led to the evolution of sex and recombination in well-mixed populations. Here, we study clonal interference, and mechanisms of its mitigation, in an evolutionary model of spatially structured populations with uniform selection pressure. Clonal interference is much more prevalent with spatial structure than without, due to the slow wave-like spread of beneficial mutations through space. We find that the adaptation speed of asexuals saturates when the linear habitat size exceeds a characteristic interference length, which becomes shorter with smaller migration and larger mutation rate. The limiting speed is proportional to (1/2) and (1/3) in linear and planar habitats, respectively, where the mutational supply  is the product of mutation rate and local population density. This scaling and the existence of a speed limit should be amenable to experimental tests as they fall far below predicted adaptation speeds for well-mixed populations (that scale as the logarithm of population size). Finally, we show that not only recombination, but also long-range migration is a highly efficient mechanism of relaxing clonal competition in structured populations.

Quantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in 24 h-composite samples was determined by using the ultrafiltration method followed by nucleic acid extraction and CDC N2 RT-qPCR assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals at each WWTP were compared over time to the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases (14-day case incidence rate) in the sewer network area. Over the 10-month surveillance period with an extensive total number of samples, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW was 79% (including 6% uncertain results, i.e., amplified only in one out of four, two original and two ten-fold diluted replicates), while only 24% of all samples exhibited gene copy numbers above the quantification limit. The range of the SARS-CoV-2 detection rate in WW varied from 33% (including 10% uncertain results) in Pietarsaari to 100% in Espoo. Only six out of 693 WW samples were positive with SARS-COV-2 RNA when the reported COVID-19 case number from the preceding 14 days was zero. Overall, the 14-day COVID-19 incidence was 7.0, 18, and 36 cases per 100 000 persons within the sewer network area when the probability to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was 50%, 75% and 95%, respectively. The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA required significantly more COVID-19 cases: the quantification rate was 50%, 75%, and 95% when the 14-day incidence was 110, 152, and 223 COVID-19 cases, respectively, per 100 000 persons. Multiple linear regression confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 incidence and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantified in WW at 15 out of 28 WWTPs (overall R(2) = 0.36, p < 0.001).

The interactions between the droplets and the suspended particles are considered by taking both hydrophobic and hydrophilic wettability characteristics into account. Our computational results show that the virus-containing droplets partially affect aerosols during the path of their transmission. With the progression of time, the droplet distribution shows an asymmetric pattern. The maximum dispersion of these droplets is found for higher sneezing velocities. The droplets with a diameter of 50 m travel a larger distance than the larger diameter droplets. We have found that an aerosol with hydrophilic wettability undergoes complete wetting by the disease-containing droplets and therefore is conducive to disease propagation. The droplet engagement duration with aerosol decreases with increase in the sneezing velocity. Our study recommends against using physical exercise centers in a closed environment such as gymnasium and indoor games during the COVID pandemic, especially in a polluted environment. The results from our work will help in deciding proper social distancing guidelines based on the local atmospheric pollution level.

For the first time, we report a promising approach for integrating the concepts of a remarkably large Stokes shift and dual-recognition into a single matrix to develop a pathogenic microorganism stimuli-responsive ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe with speed, cost efficiency, stability, ultrahigh specificity, and sensitivity. As a proof-of-concept, we selected the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as the target analyte model, which easily bound to its recognition aptamer and the broad-spectrum glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (Van). To improve the specificity and short sample-to-answer time, we employed classic noncovalent &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions as a driving force to trigger the binding of Van and aptamer dual-functionalized near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent Apt-Van-QDs to the surface of an unreported blue fluorescent &#960;-rich electronic carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), achieving S. aureus stimuli-responsive ratiometric nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs. In the assembly of Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs, the blue CNPs (energy donor) and NIR Apt-Van-QDs (energy acceptor) became close to allow the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, leading to a remarkable blue fluorescence quenching for the CNPs at a465 nm and a clear NIR fluorescence enhancement for Apt-Van-QDs at a725 nm. In the presence of S. aureus, the FRET process from CNPs to Apt-Van-QDs was disrupted, causing the nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs to display a ratiometric fluorescent response to S. aureus, which exhibited a large Stokes shift of a260 nm and rapid sample-to-answer detection time (a30.0 min). As expected, the nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs showed an ultrahigh specificity for ratiometric fluorescence detection of S. aureus with a good detection limit of 1.0 CFU/mL, allowing the assay at single-cell level. Moreover, we also carried out the precise analysis of S. aureus in actual samples with acceptable results. We believe that this work offers new insight into the rational design of efficient ratiometric nanoprobes for rapid on-site accurate screening of pathogenic microorganisms at the single-cell level in the early stages, especially during the worldwide spread of COVID-19 today.","output":"Engineering of a Dual-Recognition Ratiometric Fluorescent Nanosensor with a Remarkably Large Stokes Shift for Accurate Tracking of Pathogenic Bacteria at the Single-Cell Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"dHACM is a source of factors including cytokines that allow anti-inflammatory and proliferative elements to be utilized for wound and ulcer management. We present our experience of using dHACM in a cohort of patients undergoing nerve-sparing (NS) robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Our objective is to investigate the functional and oncological outcomes of NS after placing amniotic or dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) on preserved neurovascular bundles (NVBs). From 2013 to 2019, our institution performed transperitoneal multi-port da Vinci robotic prostatectomy. The NVBs are spared by releasing their fascial planes posteriorly, followed by an anterior release of the plane at a similar level. Once the retrograde release of the NVB is performed then 599 patients underwent placement of dHACM graft (AmnioFix by MiMedx, Marietta, GA, USA). The graft was cut into two 4  1 cm pieces and laid over the NVB as a wrap. In order to inform the urological community of oncological and functional outcomes, we excluded patients with less than 12 months follow up (n = 64), benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 5), and unilateral NS (n = 1). 529 (88%) patients were included in this study who underwent a partial or full bilateral NS with dHACM. 529 patients were followed-up for a median (IQR) of 42 months (25C89). Demographics include median (IQR) age 57 years (52C62), median preoperative SHIM score of 24 (21C15), and AUASS of 5 (2C11). Full NS was performed in 74% (391/529). Pathological staging was pT2 = 399 (75%), pT3a = 107 (20%), pT3b = 19 (4%) and pT4 = 4 (1%) with N1 = 3 (0.6%). The number of patients with PSM was 86 (16%), and the overall BCR in the entire cohort was 10%. Postoperatively, 434 (82%) were sexually active. Median time to potency was 119 (37C420) days and time to continence was 42 (23C91) days. Regarding full vs partial NS: median post op SHIM score 18 (13C20) vs 15 (6C20), median time to potency 92 (35C365) days vs 184 (42C560) days, and median time to continence 42 (23C91) days vs 44 (30C92) days. Age > 55 vs  55 years: median post op SHIM score 18 (12C20) vs 15 (10C20), median time to potency 167 days (42C549) vs 80 (35C288) days, and median time to continence 42 (25C116) days vs 42 (29C76) days. In our series the application of amniotic membrane/dHACM has led to acceptable post RALP outcomes. The BCR rate of 10% in addition to the recovery of potency at a median time of 3 months and continence at 6 weeks is an encouraging result of dHACM. Our findings indicate that dHACM allowed for an even faster period for continence recovery which was independent of grade of NS.

The solvent-partition technique was used to establish the hyperoside-enriched fraction of H. cordata (HcEA). The active compounds identified in the H. cordata extracts were hyperoside, quercitrin, chlorogenic acid, and rutin. With regard to the photoprotective effects of H. cordata on UVB-irradiated dermal fibroblasts, HcEA and hyperoside inhibited intracellular ROS production and inflammatory cytokine secretions (IL-6 and IL-8), while increasing collagen type I synthesis along with downregulating MMP-1 gene and protein expressions.

The survey found that more than one-quarter (28%) of adults had traveled domestically in the prior 30 days, most commonly for vacation (43%), and less than half wore masks (46%) or practiced social distancing (47%) all of the time. Although high-risk adults were significantly less likely to travel than non-high-risk adults (23% vs 31%; P < .001), they were no more likely to take precautions. Many travelers did not wear a mask or practice social distancing because they felt such actions were unnecessary (eg, they were outside or with friends and family). Although a substantial share of travelers (43% to 53%) trusted public health agencies a great deal for information about reducing risks while traveling, more travelers (73%) trusted their own healthcare providers.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically search electronic databases of the medical literature including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Web of Science Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov; databases of philosophical literature including Philosopher's Index, Phil Papers, JSTOR, Periodicals Archive Online, Project MUSE, National Reference Centre for Bioethics; the library catalogue at the University of Ottawa; bibliographies of retrieved papers; and the grey literature. We will also pursue suggestions from experts in the fields of medical ethics, philosophy and clinical trial methodology. Article screening, selection and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers based on prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. A third reviewer will be consulted to resolve any discrepancies. We will then extract the reasons given to justify randomisation using methodology established to extract data in a defensible, systematic manner. We will track the reasons given, their frequency of use and changes over time. Finally, using grounded theory, we will combine the reasons into broader themes. These themes will form the foundation of our subsequent analysis from qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

However, this procedure requires specialized medical personnel, centralized laboratory facilities, and time to provide results (from several hours up to 1 d). In addition, there is a non-negligible risk of viral transmission for the operator who performs the procedure. For these reasons, several studies have suggested the use of other body fluids, including saliva, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen has numerous advantages: it is easily self-collected by the patient with almost no discomfort, it does not require specialized health care personnel for its management, and it reduces the risks for the operator. In the past few months, several scientific papers, media, and companies have announced the development of new salivary tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Posterior oropharyngeal saliva should be distinguished from oral saliva, since the former is a part of respiratory secretions, while the latter is produced by the salivary glands, which are outside the respiratory tract. Saliva can be analyzed through standard (rRT-PCR) or rapid molecular biology tests (direct rRT-PCR without extraction), although, in a hospital setting, these procedures may be performed only in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs to minimize the incidence of false-negative results.

Indeed, these devices can be directly used in workplaces, airports, schools, cinemas, and shopping centers.

IgY technology has been identified as a promising alternative to generating a mass amount of specific antibody for use in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics. The purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody (IgY) to recombinant FanC protein from ETEC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FanC (K99) gene was amplified from ETEC by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction. The gene was cloned and subcloned into pTZ57R/T and pET32a (+) vectors, respectively. Recombinant vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). Protein expression was investigated by 1 mM IPTG induction. Hens were immunized by the purified recombinant FanC protein. The activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were detected by dot-blotting, Western blotting, and indirect ELISA. RESULTS: We obtained FanC specific IgYs by immunizing the hens with the recombinant FanC protein. The anti-FanC IgY showed binding specifically to the FanC protein of ETEC.

METHODS: Cases were collected from three paediatric surgical wards. Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed. RESULTS: All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis. Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation. Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs 11%, P-value .06). CONCLUSION: The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common paediatric medical conditions.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of laboratory tests performed on patients on admission to the hospital between groups of patients requiring and not requiring oxygen supplementation, and to find predictive laboratory indicators for the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNOT)/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the data of consecutive patients hospitalised in the Pulmonology Department of the Temporary COVID Hospital in Poznan from February to May 2021. On admission to the department, the patients had a panel of laboratory blood tests. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 207 patients with a mean age of 59.2  15.0 years of whom 179 (72%) were male. During hospitalisation, oxygen supplementation was required by 87% of patients. Patients requiring oxygen supplementation and/or the use of HFNOT/CPAP/BPAP had lower lymphocyte counts and higher levels of urea, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, troponin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, The parameter that obtained the highest area under curve value in the receiver operator curve analysis for the necessary use of HFNOT/CPAP/BPAP or CPAP/BPAP was LDH activity. CONCLUSIONS: Among the basic parameters assessed on admission to the temporary hospital, LDH activity turned out to be the most useful for assessing the need for CPAP/BPAP active oxygen therapy. Other parameters that may be helpful for predicting the need for HFNOT/CPAP/BPAP are serum levels of urea, D-dimer and troponin.","output":"Clinical significance of basic laboratory parameters in predicting the use of various methods of oxygen supplementation in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumonitis belongs to the fatal toxicities of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Its diagnosis is based on immunotherapeutic histories, clinical symptoms, and the computed tomography (CT) imaging. The radiological features were typically ground-glass opacities, similar to CT presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Thus, clinicians are cautious in differential diagnosis especially in COVID-19 epidemic areas. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a 67-year-old Han Chinese male patient presenting with dyspnea and normal body temperature on the 15th day of close contact with his son, who returned from Wuhan. He was diagnosed as advanced non-small cell lung cancer and developed pneumonitis post Sintilimab injection during COIVD-19 pandemic period. The chest CT indicated peripherally subpleural lattice opacities at the inferior right lung lobe and bilateral thoracic effusion. The swab samples were taken twice within 72 hours and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) results were COVID-19 negative. The patient was thereafter treated with prednisolone and antibiotics for over 2 weeks. The suspicious lesion has almost absorbed according to CT imaging, consistent with prominently falling CRP level. The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis mixed with bacterial infection was clinically diagnosed based on the laboratory and radiological evidences and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia possess similar clinical presentations and CT imaging features. Therefore, differential diagnosis depends on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, RT-PCR tests. The response to glucocorticoid is still controversial but helpful for the diagnosis.","output":"A false alarm of COVID-19 pneumonia in lung cancer with anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis: a case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiology is characterized by constant change and is defined by technological progress.

The knockdown of SIAH1/2 modulated the expression of approximately one third of IL-1-regulated genes. These effects were not due to changes in the NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways and rather employed further processes including those mediated by the coactivator p300.

We sought to evaluate the association of specific symptom/symptom groups and their duration with severity of radiographic edema - a clinical feature that has been independently associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected CXRs, demographic and clinical data from patients with a naso- and/or oropharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR visiting the ED for COVID-19-related symptoms between March and September 2020 in a large, multi-hospital healthcare system. Two independent reviewers quantified radiographic edema using the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring system. We collected symptom duration based on the following groups: overall (total), dyspnea, cough, constitutional (fever, chills, malaise, myalgia), nausea and/or vomiting, and diarrhea. We assessed for correlation between radiographic edema and symptom duration as continuous variables using Pearson's R and based on symptom duration quartiles using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: 433 symptomatic patients with available CXRs were identified (median age 54, 52% female). Inter-rate agreement for RALE score was excellent (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.89, 95% CI 0.87 - 0.92, p &lt; 0.0001).

In the past years there has been disagreement on whether burnout and depression are the same or different constructs, as they appear to share some common features (e.g., loss of interest and impaired concentration). However, the results so far are inconclusive and researchers disagree with regard to the degree to which we should expect such overlap. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between burnout and depression. Additionally, given that burnout is the result of chronic stress and that working environments can often trigger anxious reactions, we also investigated the relationship between burnout and anxiety. Method: We searched the online databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Google Scholar for studies examining the relationship between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, which were published between January 2007 and August 2018. Inclusion criteria were used for all studies and included both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, published and unpublished research articles, full-text articles, articles written in the English language, studies that present the effects sizes of their findings and that used reliable research tools. Results: Our results showed a significant association between burnout and depression (r = 0.520, SE = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.492, 0.547) and burnout and anxiety (r = 0.460, SE = 0.014, 95% CI = 0.421, 0.497). However, moderation analysis for both burnout-depression and burnout-anxiety relationships revealed that the studies in which either the MBI test was used or were rated as having better quality showed lower effect sizes. Conclusions: Our research aims to clarify the relationship between burnout-depression and burnout-anxiety relationships. Our findings revealed no conclusive overlap between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, indicating that they are different and robust constructs.

Lithium is used as a mood stabilizer to treat patients with bipolar disorder. Here, the aim was to investigate the association between lithium use and the risk of respiratory infections in patients with bipolar disorder. To rule out the possibility that a potential association could be due to lithiums effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also studied the effect of valproate, which is an alternative to lithium used to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder. METHOD: We followed 51,509 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the Swedish Patient register 2005C2013. We applied a within-individual design using stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of respiratory infections during treated periods compared with untreated periods. RESULTS: During follow-up, 5,760 respiratory infections were documented in the Swedish Patient Register. The incidence rate was 28% lower during lithium treatment (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61C0.86) and 35% higher during valproate treatment (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06C1.73) compared with periods off treatment.

Antibody titers and potency were assessed using three assays against SARS-CoV-2 proteins that bamlanivimab does not significantly bind to, thereby reflecting the endogenous antibody response. All bamlanivimab and placebo participants mounted a robust immune response to full COVID-19 vaccination, irrespective of age, risk-category and vaccine type, with any observed differences unlikely to be clinically meaningful. These findings are pertinent for informing public health policy with results that suggest a complementary role for COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with COVID-19 vaccines and that the benefit of receiving COVID-19 vaccination at the earliest opportunity outweighs the minimal effect on the endogenous immune response due to prior prophylactic COVID-19 mAb infusion.","output":"The effect of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab, on endogenous immune response to COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent genetic association study1 identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for respiratory failure after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The Competition Authorities have received many complaints in regards to excessive pricing / price gouging and some have already started investigations, others are closely monitoring the developments. Like a mythical giant, dormant but defiant, excessive pricing time and again captures the attention of policymakers, competition law practitioners and scholars, despite its demise being proclaimed as frequently by a certain strand of law and economics. Excessive Pricing and Price Gouging belong to the most written about, and least understood, issues in competition law and economics, with significantly conflicting views depending on the normative departing points regarding theories of harm, scope and object of competition law and legal-philosophical perspectives. Where one side of the axis elevates presumptions of supposed virtues of excessive prices, self-correcting markets and possible chilling effects on costly and risky innovation in face of vigilant enforcement, the other side of the axis point to wealth transfers as being the prima facie competition law concern, the errors in presumptions by the antagonists of enforcement and ultimately forwards the need to pursue competition law alongside fairness and social policy paradigm beyond a \\"purist\\" economic efficiency doctrine.

Within our hospital system, between JanuaryCJune 2019 and JanuaryCJune 2020, we compared the proportion of stroke admissions and door to tPA and MT times. RESULTS: A total of 32,640 stroke admissions from 29 studies were assessed. Compared to prepandemic period, the mean ratio of stroke admissions during the pandemic was 70.78% [95% CI, 65.02%, 76.54%], ICH cases was 83.10% [95% CI, 71.01%, 95.17%], tPA cases was 81.74% [95% CI, 72.33%, 91.16%], and MT cases was 88.63% [95% CI, 74.12%, 103.13%], whereas DTN time was 104.48% [95% CI, 95.52%, 113.44%] and DTG was 104.30% [95% CI, 81.99%, 126.61%].

Health systems have been stressed in trying to provide a response to the increasing demand for hospital beds during the different waves. This paper analyzes the dynamic response of the hospitals of the Community of Madrid (CoM) during the first wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the period between 18 March and 31 May 2020. The aim was to model the response of the CoM's health system in terms of the number of available beds. Methods: A research design based on a case study of the CoM was developed. To model this response, we use two concepts: \\"bed margin\\" (available beds minus occupied beds, expressed as a percentage) and \\"flexibility\\" (which describes the ability to adapt to the growing demand for beds). The Linear Hinges Model allowed a robust estimation of the key performance indicators for capturing the flexibility of the available beds in hospitals. Three new flexibility indicators were defined: the Average Ramp Rate Until the Peak (ARRUP), the Ramp Duration Until the Peak (RDUP), and the Ramp Growth Until the Peak (RGUP). Results: The public and private hospitals of the CoM were able to increase the number of available beds from 18,692 on 18 March 2020 to 23,623 on 2 April 2020. At the peak of the wave, the number of available beds increased by 160 in 48 h, with an occupancy of 90.3%. Within that fifteen-day period, the number of COVID-19 inpatients increased by 200% in non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) wards and by 155% in intensive care unit (ICU) wards. The estimated ARRUP for non-ICU beds in the CoM hospital network during the first pandemic wave was 305.56 beds/day, the RDUP was 15 days, and the RGUP was 4598 beds. For the ICU beds, the ARRUP was 36.73 beds/day, the RDUP was 20 days, and the RGUP was 735 beds. This paper includes a further analysis of the response estimated for each hospital. Conclusions: This research provides insights not only for academia, but also for hospital management and practitioners. The results show that not all of the hospitals dealt with the sudden increase in bed demand in the same way, nor did they provide the same flexibility in order to increase their bed capabilities. The bed margin and the proposed indicators of flexibility summarize the dynamic response and can be included as part of a hospital's management dashboard for monitoring its behavior during pandemic waves or other health crises as a complement to other, more steady-state indicators.","output":"Flexibility and Bed Margins of the Community of Madrid's Hospitals during the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) is a well-established method. The prerequisite is to identify anatomical landmarks of the neck. We introduce a three-dimensional navigation system - SafeTrach. AIMS/OBJECTIVES We present an alternative technique using internal landmarks that can be used in patients with difficult anatomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS The device is a forceps-like instrument with an outer and an inner shank. The later serves as a ventilation lumen and stabilizes the orotracheal tube in the midline of trachea. The outer shank acts as a three-dimensional guide for the puncturing needle. RESULTS Out of 48 patients we have determined the level of puncture in 20 patients by using intraoperative measurements. The distance from the vocal cords to the puncture site was about 50 mm for men and 40 mm for women. In 13 of the patients who had had CT scans, we studied the distance between the vocal cords and the optimal puncture site and found the median distance for men 45 mm and for women 42 mm.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the right eyes of 181 subjects: 89 POAG patients and 92 healthy subjects. Using the Triton SS-OCT device (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), CM length (CML), area (CMA) and thickness measured 1000 m (CMT1), 2000 m (CMT2) and 3000 m (CMT3) from the scleral spur were determined in the temporal and nasal quadrants. POAG patients were subjected to visual field (VF) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment. CM dimensions were then assessed for correlation with VF mean defect (MD), mean RNFL thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Mean CMLs were 4325  340 m and 4195  843 m for the healthy subjects and POAG patients, respectively (p = 0.17).

The lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is critical for B cell recruitment and functional organization of peripheral lymphoid tissues, and CXCL13 levels are often elevated in the inflamed CNS. To more directly investigate the role of CXCL13 in CNS B cell migration, its role in animal models of infectious and inflammatory demyelinating disease was examined. During acute alphavirus encephalitis where viral clearance depends on the local actions of anti-viral antibodies, CXCL13 levels and B cell numbers increased in brain tissue over time. Surprisingly, however, CXCL13-deficient animals showed normal CNS B cell recruitment, unaltered CNS virus replication and clearance, and intact peripheral anti-viral antibody responses. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CNS levels of CXCL13 increased as symptoms emerged and equivalent numbers of B cells were identified among the CNS infiltrates of CXCL13-deficient mice compared to control animals. However, CXCL13-deficient mice did not sustain pathogenic anti-myelin T cell responses, consistent with their known propensity to develop more self-limited EAE. These data show that CXCL13 is dispensable for CNS B cell recruitment in both models. The disease course is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response, while it is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology. Thus, CXCL13 could be a therapeutic target in certain neuroinflammatory diseases, but not by blocking B cell recruitment to the CNS.","output":"The lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is dispensable for the initial recruitment of B cells to the acutely inflamed central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Internet hospitals in China are being rapidly developed as an innovative approach to providing health services.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of China's internet hospitals and assess the health service capacity of these hospitals. METHODS: Data on 711 internet hospitals were collected from official websites, the WeChat (Tencent Inc) platform, smartphone apps, and the Baidu search engine until July 16, 2020. RESULTS: As of July 16, 2020, 711 internet hospitals were developed in mainland China. More than half of these internet hospitals (421/711, 59.2%) were established during 2019 (206/711, 29%) and 2020 (215/711, 30.2%). Furthermore, about one-third (215/711, 30.2%) of internet hospitals were established at the beginning of 2020 as an emergency response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The 711 internet hospitals consisted of the following 3 types of hospitals: government-oriented (42/711, 5.91%), hospital-oriented (143/711, 20.11%), and enterprise-oriented internet hospitals (526/711, 73.98%). The vast majority of internet hospitals were traditional hospitals (526/711, 74%). Nearly 46.1% (221/711) of internet hospitals requested doctors to provide health services at a specific web clinic. Most patients (224/639, 35.1%) accessed outpatient services via WeChat. Internet hospitals' consulting methods included SMS text messaging consultations involving the use of graphics (552/570, 96.8%), video consultations (248/570, 43.5%), and telephone consultations (238/570, 41.8%). The median number of available web-based doctors was 43, and the median consultation fees of fever clinics and other outpatient clinics were 0 (US $0) per consultation and 6 (US $0.93) per consultation, respectively.

Translation initiation was altered by adding TAR in cis or trans of the reporter mRNA. We show that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by TAR and mediated by PKR.

We sought to test if non-frail older adults with low cardiovascular risk had reduced COVID-19, to inform targeted shielding policies. Methods Fried and Rockwood frailty were ascertained at UK Biobank baseline (2006-2010) and electronic frailty index(eFI) in primary care data to 2017*. A cardiovascular disease risk score(CRS) consisting of smoking status, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, fasting glucose and physical activity was estimated at baseline. Frailty (baseline and eFI;eFI alone) and CRS were tested in logistic models against COVID-19 status and COVID-19 mortality to 14th June 2020 adjusted for demographics and technical covariates. Results N=269,164 UKB participants aged 65 at baseline (75years in 2020). 13.9% of COVID-19 positive were non-frail with low baseline CRS versus 41.8% frail with moderate/high CRS.

While legitimate (homologous) recombination occurs between closely related sequences at corresponding positions, illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination could happen at any position among the unrelated RNA molecules. In order to differentiate between the symmetrical and asymmetrical homologous crosses, Lai defined the former as homologous recombination and the latter as aberrant homologous recombination.

The pluripotency marker TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN after a four-day induction. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes with a routine differentiation protocol. The RNA-seq data of iPSC-nCoVN (induction for 30 days) and immunofluorescence assays illustrated that iPSC-nCoVN were turning to fibroblast-like cells. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into other types of cells, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Abolished Pluripotency in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has emerged as an invasive fungal disease, often affecting previously immunocompetent, mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Incidence rates of 3.8%-33.3% have been reported depending on the geographic area, with high (47%) mortality. OBJECTIVES: Here, we describe a single-centre prospective case series with CAPA cases from both the first (March-May, n = 5/33) and second (mid-September through mid-December, n = 8/33) COVID-19 wave at a 500-bed teaching hospital in the Netherlands. PATIENTS/METHODS: In the first COVID-19 wave, a total of 265 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients were admitted to our hospital of whom 33 needed intubation and mechanical ventilation. In the second wave, 508 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients were admitted of whom 33 needed mechanical ventilation. Data were prospectively collected. RESULTS: We found a significant decrease in COVID-19 patients needing mechanical ventilation in the ICU in the second wave (p < .01). From these patients, however, a higher percentage were diagnosed with CAPA (24.2% vs 15.2%), although not significant (p = .36). All CAPA patients encountered in the second wave received dexamethasone. Mortality between both groups was similarly high (40%-50%). Moreover, we found environmental TR34 /L98H azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus isolates in two separate patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, 19.7% (n = 13/66) of mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients were diagnosed with CAPA. In addition, we found a significant reduction in COVID-19 patients needing mechanical ventilation on the ICU in the second wave. Numbers are too small to determine whether there is a true difference in CAPA incidence in mechanically ventilated patients between the two waves, and whether it could be attributed to dexamethasone SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","output":"COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis: a prospective single-center dual case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 was observed as a pandemic and caused many community health problems that resulted in Global issues. It causes death for many individuals including health professionals. This study aimed to determine the occupational health safety of health professionals and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic at North Showa. METHODS: Institutions-based Cross-sectional study was conducted using a simple random sampling technique from May 10 to June 15, 2020. Interviewer-administered questioners were used, and data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS 23 for analysis. Bi-variable logistic regression was carried out to select candidate variables with a cutoff point < 0.2. Finally, multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify significant variables. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI at a 5% level of significance was used to measure the strength of association. P-value <0.05 indicated a significant association between variables. RESULTS: A total of 280 health professionals participated with a 92.72% response rate. Of which 57.9% (n=162) were males while 42.1% (n=118) females. Of total 48.9% (n=137) (95% CI: 43.2, 55.0) health professionals had poor occupational health and safety.

CONCLUSION: The result suggested that occupational health safety was generally low in the study area. Therefore, a preventive measure such as the use of personal protective equipment and adherence to hand hygiene practice and Infection prevention policy could reduce the spread of COVID-19 and further study should be conducted to generate more evidence on determinants of occupational health safety.","output":"Occupational Health Safety of Health Professionals and Associated Factors During COVID-19 Pandemics at North Showa Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Reports on short- and long-term presentations of COVID-19 in CF patients is limited. We aimed to describe clinical features and outcomes of all our CF patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 (ongoing observation). Methods: Retrospective review of clinical data and treatment of CF patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR or serological evidence (n = 11). Results: Mean age at presentation was 32 (23C48) years, 27% (n = 3) were female. Six patients (55%) had a previous lung transplantation (post-Ltx). Two patients were on modulator therapy (Trikafta? and Symdeco?). The most common presenting symptoms were cough (36%), fever (27%), headache (27%) and dyspnea (18%). Nine patients (82%) had mild disease and were treated as outpatients. Two patients (18%) were post-LTx and were hospitalised with severe disease (1 on the normal ward, 1 in the intensive care unit). The most notable laboratory findings were lymphopenia, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein. In the two hospitalised patients, computed tomography of the chest showed ground-glass opacities with consolidations;1 patient additionally had a small pleural effusion.

The study aim was to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NAVA versus pressure support ventilation (PSV) in critically ill adults at risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: An open-label, parallel, feasibility RCT (n = 78) in four ICUs of one university-affiliated hospital. The primary outcome was mode adherence (percentage of time adherent to assigned mode), and protocol compliance (binary 65% mode adherence). Secondary exploratory outcomes included ventilator-free days (VFDs), sedation, and mortality. RESULTS: In the 72 participants who commenced weaning, median (95% CI) mode adherence was 83.1% (64.0C97.1%) and 100% (100C100%), and protocol compliance was 66.7% (50.3C80.0%) and 100% (89.0C100.0%) in the NAVA and PSV groups respectively. Secondary outcomes indicated more VFDs to D28 (median difference 3.0 days, 95% CI 0.0C11.0; p = 0.04) and fewer in-hospital deaths (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.2C0.9; p = 0.032) for NAVA. Although overall sedation was similar, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were closer to zero in NAVA compared to PSV (p = 0.020). No significant differences were observed in duration of MV, ICU or hospital stay, or ICU, D28, and D90 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility trial demonstrated good adherence to assigned ventilation mode and the ability to meet a priori protocol compliance criteria.

The questionnaires are developed to survey the changes in the performance of students before and after the implementation of the teaching design and the satisfaction of all teachers, students, and parents to different teaching methods by comparing the two results and the satisfaction ratings. All objects in this study volunteer to participate in the questionnaire survey. The results suggest the following: (1) the effective return rates of the questionnaires to teachers, students, and parents are 97, 99, and 95%, respectively, before implementation; whereas those after implementation are 98, 99, and 99%, respectively. Comparison of the two return results suggests that there was no significant difference statistically (P > 0.05). (2) Proportion of scoring results before and after implementation is given as follows: the proportions of levels A, B, C, and D are 35, 40, 15, and 10% before implementation, respectively; while those after implementation are 47, 36, 12, and 5%, respectively. After the implementation, the proportion of level A is obviously higher than that before the implementation, and the proportions of other levels decreased in contrast to those before the implementation, showing statistically obvious differences (P < 0.05).

Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission. Methods In this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection. Findings We investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%). Interpretation Infection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines.","output":"Viral sequencing reveals US healthcare personnel rarely become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through patient contact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an enforced 8-week induction period (18 May to 12 July 2020) for all new interns in Ireland. These unprecedented circumstances presented a unique opportunity to assess this induction period. AIM: To assess the impact of a prolonged induction period on the technical abilities of interns embarking on their clinical careers. METHOD: We distributed a 12-item questionnaire to new interns at our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 1 of the questionnaire was designed to assess the rate of self-reported improvement in the successful and independent execution of practical intern tasks. Section 2 of the questionnaire captured the subjective experience of interns during this time in relation to the effectiveness of an 8-week induction period with senior intern support available. Statistical analysis of categorical predictor and ordinal outcome variables was performed using the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the proficiency at first attempt phlebotomy in week 8 compared with week 1 (p < 0.0001). There was a significant improvement in placing first-attempt peripheral IV lines in week 8 compared with week 1 (p < 0.001). Regarding the need for senior assistance, we demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in week 8 compared with week 1 (p = 0.046).

Single cases and small series were reported from 13 countries, the majority from Europe (79.4%) and especially from Italy (30.9%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated by nasopharyngeal swab (85.7%) and serology (14.3%). Median time between COVID-19 and GBS onset in 36 patients was 11.5 days (IQR: 7.7-16). The most common clinical features were: limb weakness (76.2%), hypoareflexia (80.9 %), sensory disturbances (66.7 %) and facial palsy (38.1%). Dysautonomia occurred in 19%, respiratory failure in 33.3% and 40.5% of patients were admitted in intensive care unit. Most patients (71.4%) had the classical clinical presentation but virtually all GBS variants and subtypes were reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albumin-cytological dissociation was found in 28/36 (77.8%) and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in 25/25 patients. Electrodiagnosis was demyelinating in 80.5% and levels 1 and 2 of Brighton criteria of diagnostic certainty, when applicable, were fulfilled in 94.5% patients.

However, the prediction of DTIs using wet-lab experimental methods is generally expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, different machine learning-based methods have been developed for this purpose, but there are still substantial unknown interactions needed to discover. Furthermore, data imbalance and feature dimensionality problems are a critical challenge in drug-target datasets, which can decrease the classifier performances that have not been significantly addressed yet. This paper proposed a novel drug-target interaction prediction method called PreDTIs. First, the feature vectors of the protein sequence are extracted by the pseudo-position-specific scoring matrix (PsePSSM), dipeptide composition (DC) and pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC); and the drug is encoded with MACCS substructure fingerings. Besides, we propose a FastUS algorithm to handle the class imbalance problem and also develop a MoIFS algorithm to remove the irrelevant and redundant features for getting the best optimal features. Finally, balanced and optimal features are provided to the LightGBM Classifier to identify DTIs, and the 5-fold CV validation test method was applied to evaluate the prediction ability of the proposed method. Prediction results indicate that the proposed model PreDTIs is significantly superior to other existing methods in predicting DTIs, and our model could be used to discover new drugs for unknown disorders or infections, such as for the coronavirus disease 2019 using existing drugs compounds and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protein sequences.","output":"PreDTIs: prediction of drug-target interactions based on multiple feature information using gradient boosting framework with data balancing and feature selection techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus causes severe illness, including pneumonia, which leads to hospitalization and even death.

This has contributed to a higher rate of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst unvaccinated individuals as compared to vaccinated individuals. It is important to understand how low vaccination rates directly impact deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infections in unvaccinated populations across the United States. Objective: To estimate a lower bound on the number of vaccine-preventable deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections under various scenarios of vaccine completion, for every state of the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This counterfactual simulation study varies the rates of complete vaccination coverage under the scenarios of 100%, 90% and 85% coverage of the adult (18+) population of the United States. For each scenario, we use U.S. state-level demographic information in conjunction with county-level vaccination statistics to compute a lower bound on the number of vaccine-preventable deaths for each state. Exposures: COVID-19 vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 infection Main Outcomes and Measures: Death from SARS-CoV-2 infection Results: Between January 1st, 2021 and April 30th, 2022, there were 641,305 deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States. Assuming each state continued peak vaccination capacity after initially achieving its peak vaccination rate, a vaccination rate of 100% would have led to 322,324 deaths nationally, that of 90% would have led to 415,878 deaths, and that of 85% would have led to 463,305 deaths. As a comparison, using the state with the highest peak vaccination rate (per million population each week) for all the states, a vaccination rate of 100% would have led to 302,344 deaths nationally, that of 90% would have led to 398,289 deaths, and that of 85% would have led to 446,449 deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Once COVID-19 vaccine supplies peaked across the United States, if there had been 100% COVID-19 vaccination coverage of the over 18+ population, a conservative estimate of 318,981 deaths could have been potentially avoided through vaccination. For a 90% vaccination coverage, we estimate at least 225,427 deaths averted through vaccination, and at least 178,000 lives saved through vaccination for an 85% vaccination coverage.","output":"Estimating Vaccine-Preventable COVID-19 Deaths Under Counterfactual Vaccination Scenarios in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the driving forces behind COVID-19 vaccination in German counties using a cross-sectional and a panel approach.

An understanding of the progression and pathophysiology of Leptospira infection is important to determine the early changes that could be potentially used to predict the severe occurrence of leptospirosis. This study aimed to understand the kinetics pathogenesis of Leptospira interrogans strain HP358 in the hamster model and identify the early parameters that could be used as biomarkers to predict severe leptospirosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Male Syrian hamsters were infected with Leptospira interrogans strain HP358 and euthanized after 24 hours, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days post-infection. Blood, lungs, liver and kidneys were collected for leptospiral detection, haematology, serum biochemistry and differential expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. Macroscopic and microscopic organ damages were investigated. Leptospira interrogans strain HP358 was highly pathogenic and killed hamsters within 6C7 days post-infection. Pulmonary haemorrhage and blood vessel congestion in organs were noticed as the earliest pathological changes. The damages in organs and changes in biochemistry value were preceded by changes in haematology and immune gene expression. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study deciphered haemorrhage as the earliest manifestation of severe leptospirosis and high levels of IL-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-, neutrophils and low levels of lymphocytes and platelets serve as a cumulative panel of biomarkers in severe leptospirosis.","output":"Pulmonary haemorrhage as the earliest sign of severe leptospirosis in hamster model challenged with Leptospira interrogans strain HP358"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We modeled the viral dynamics of 13 untreated patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to infer viral growth parameters and predict the effects of antiviral treatments.

METHODS: After 5 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown, 220 patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) and 124 with congestive heart failure (CHF) answered a phone questionnaire. RESULTS: Among these 344 patients, 43 (12.5%) were current smokers, and none had quit during the lockdown. When compared with non-smokers, smokers were 15 years younger, more often diabetic, more likely to live in an urban than a rural lockdown location, and more often in the CCS cohort (p = 0.011). Smokers described greater psychological impairment, but their rates of decrease in physical activity and of increase in screen time were similar to non-smokers. More than one-third (13/43) increased their tobacco consumption, which was mainly related to stress or boredom, but not driven by media messages on a protective effect of nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, we found a decrease in favorable lifestyle behaviors among patients with CVD. Strikingly, one-third of smokers with CCS or CHF increased their tobacco consumption.

Management of chronic wounds becomes especially challenging in the setting of systemic comorbidities and patient nonadherence. OBJECTIVE: Authors evaluated the performance of a proprietary adaptive self-assembling barrier scaffold (aSABS) in the management and healing of complex chronic wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients with anatomically and etiologically diverse chronic wounds were considered for treatment with aSABS, which is for prescription use under the supervision of a licensed health care professional. The wounds had been unresponsive to various treatment regimens for 8 weeks to more than 20 years. The adaptive self-assembling barrier scaffold was applied in the clinic weekly, with the exception of 1 case in which it was applied every 2 weeks. Institutional Review Board approval was not required because use of aSABS was in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration-cleared indications for use. RESULTS: After only 3 to 6 applications of aSABS, these wounds showed notable improvement in healing, accompanied by suppression of both inflammation and infection, granulation tissue formation, and reepithelialization. The adaptive self-assembling barrier scaffold also facilitated aggressive debridement to remove inflamed, infected, and necrotic tissues, providing effective wound management and bleeding control while functioning as a protective barrier. Furthermore, use of aSABS reduced the at-home burden of wound care for patients and caretakers. Additionally, use of this aSABS may offer clinicians an alternative to high acuity operating rooms by facilitating debridement and management of some complex wounds in a low acuity outpatient clinic setting-a particularly crucial product attribute during the COVID-19 pandemic that helped ensure timely and effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, aSABS demonstrated clinical benefit in a short period of time in patients with significant comorbidities and nonhealing wounds. Use of aSABS may offer clinicians an alternative to high-acuity operating rooms by facilitating debridement and management of some complex wounds in a low-acuity outpatient clinic setting. These outcomes can be used to make a compelling argument for use of aSABS as a central aspect of treatment at the onset of wound care and as a rescue product for wounds for which prior standard and advanced treatment protocols were unsuccessful.","output":"Early clinical performance of an adaptive self-assembling barrier scaffold in nonhealing chronic wounds: a review of six cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big challenge to the healthcare systems in the world.

In a nationally representative survey administered April 24 to May 11, 2020, we identified psychological predictors of three preventive behaviors: social distancing, practicing respiratory hygiene (such as hand washing and coughing into a tissue), and mask wearing. All three behaviors were strongly predicted by their perceived effectiveness and were moderately predicted by anxiety about COVID-19 and by perceived behavioral norms. The perceived effectiveness of social distancing also predicted the self-reported number of exposures to people outside the household, and this relationship was mediated by social distancing behavior. In other words, greater perceived effectiveness of social distancing predicted greater compliance with distancing recommendations, which in turn was linked to lower exposure. On the basis of our findings, we suggest some actions that might promote long-term adherence to preventive behaviors even if rapidly shifting beliefs about the risks posed by the virus diminish the publics susceptibility to intervention. ? 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

Extensive capture of wild shrimp larvae is environmentally harmful but constitutes an important livelihood. Semi-intensive aquaculture of exotic shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) has much higher unit-area profitability than other types but involves greater financial risk. Profitability is the main driver for the transition from agriculture, but environmental factors such as lowered crop yields and cyclone impacts also contributed.

A holistic approach is required, but research in the field of surgical instrument tables, standardized instrument setups and involved personnel, such as nurses, is sparse in general. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether there is an existing standard within clinics for an instrument table setup. We also evaluate to which extent it is known to the personnel and whether it is accepted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study makes use of the Nosco Trainer, a scrub nurse training and simulation system developed to analyze various aspects of the workplace of scrub nurses. The system contains a virtual instrument table, which is used to perform and record instrument table setups. We introduce a metric which delivers a measurable score for the similarity of surgical instrument table setups. The study is complemented with a questionnaire covering related aspects. RESULTS: Fifteen scrub nurses of the Otolaryngology departments at three clinics in Germany and Switzerland performed a table setup for a Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery intervention and completed the questionnaire. The analysis of the developed metric with a leave one out cross-validation correctly allocated 14 of the 15 participants to their clinic. DISCUSSION: In contrast to the identified similarities of table setups within clinics with the collected data, only a third of the participants confirmed in the questionnaire that there is an existing table setup standard for Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery interventions in their facility, but almost three quarters would support a written standard and acknowledge its possible benefits for trainees and new entrants in the operating room.

The insights can contribute to patient safety by improving the workflow between surgeon and scrub nurse and also open the way for goal-oriented standardization.","output":"Measuring and evaluating standardization of scrub nurse instrument table setups: a multi-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in the worldwide disruption of everyday life but the impact and response to the pandemic have not been uniform. Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the COVID-19;others did not. Whilst social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus, it is also important to examine unintended psychiatric consequences of social isolation. We examined psychological distress in four countries with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental illness. From March to July June 2020, an online survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and increased loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome, although the magnitudes of the effects were not uniform among the four countries. We also observed notable differences in psychological distress;Hong Kong, with the strictest lockdown mandate, suffered the most drastic worsening of mental health outcome. To explain differential exacerbations of psychological distress around the globe during the pandemic, contributions of social unrest, economic uncertainty, and disruption to regular routine should be considered.","output":"Cross-Cultural comparisons of psychosocial distress in the USA, South Korea, France, and Hong Kong during the initial phase of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective is to measure the relationship of several healthy characteristics of the Mormon lifestyle to mortality. METHOD We examined 9815 religiously active California Mormon adults followed for mortality during 1980-2004 and 15,832 representative U.S. white adults enrolled in the 1987 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and followed for mortality during 1988-1997. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated relative to U.S. whites defined to have a SMR of 1.00. RESULTS Active California Mormons practice a healthy lifestyle advocated by their religion, which emphasizes a strong family life, education and abstention from tobacco and alcohol. Unusually low SMRs occurred among married never smokers who attended church weekly and had at least 12 years of education. For those aged 25-99 years at entry, the SMR for all causes of death was 0.45 (0.42-0.48) for males and 0.55 (0.51-0.59) for females. For those aged 25-64 years at entry, the SMR for all causes of death was 0.36 (0.32-0.41) for males and 0.46 (0.40-0.53) for females. Life expectancy from age 25 was 84 years for males and 86 years for females. These SMRs were largely replicated among similarly defined persons of all religions within the NHIS cohort.

It also covers remote access functionality is also shown using cloud services. Divided into two parts, this paper gives design examples for both an elevator controller and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system design. Focus was on the Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) 6 based kit, PSoC Creator software, and Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) as rapid prototyping and learning platforms for digital and analog system designs. The Universal Digital Block (UDB) editor in PSoC Creator software was used to configure PSoC chip digital blocks and design a Finite State Machine (FSM) based elevator controller, which acquired digital signals and gave corresponding output. LabVIEW was used as a signal analysis tool and was also used to send results for online access and display. The PSoC and LabVIEW ecosystems are utilized here to bring an innovative paradigm into the embedded system design. These two platforms, especially combined with the virtual instrumentation concept, offer configurability and monetary value.

Complying with GMO requirements is complex, varies significantly across EU Member States and is leading to delays to clinical trials with ATMPs (see Supplemental materials). Such delays and varying implementation of the GMO legislation makes the EU less attractive as a region to conduct clinical trials with investigational gene therapies. This is detrimental to EU patients, since their timely access to these transformative, potentially curative medicines is delayed. Despite recent initiatives coordinated by the European Commission (EC) to facilitate and reduce discrepancies across the EU regarding the application of the GMO requirements, it remains particularly difficult to conduct multi-centre clinical trials with ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs involving several EU Member States. The recent decision for the EC to temporarily derogate potential COVID-19 treatments and vaccines from some provisions of the GMO requirements was made on the basis of a clear recognition of such complexities and resulting delays to clinical development. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and the European Association for Bioindustries (EuropaBio), call upon the EC, together with national competent authorities, to exempt ATMPs containing or consisting of GMOs from the GMO legislation. Such a simplification will eliminate the delays currently reported to occur when submitting environmental risk assessments and GMO applications to the national competent authorities. An exemption from GMO requirements will make the EU a more attractive region for clinical development of gene therapies and could accelerate European patients' access to these potentially life-saving medicines. Maintaining a system for GMO assessment that is different across countries may also prevent ATMPS from realising the full benefits of a harmonised clinical trial approval process under the Clinical Trials Regulation. The undersigned organisations to this publication urge the EC to use its right of initiative to put forward a legislative proposal to exempt ATMPs in clinical development from the EU GMO legislation, within the timeframe proposed in the 2020 EU Pharmaceutical Strategy (by 2022). 1 Implementation of a GMO exemption scheme before the end of the transition period for the Clinical Trial Regulation (the end of 2023) is important to avoid new CTA submissions for ATMPs under the Clinical Trial Regulation having to conduct the whole GMO assessment process in parallel. It is considered that ATMPs such as human somatic cells modified ex vivo, recombinant virus-based vectors, including those containing genome editing nucleic acid sequences, pose negligible risk to the environment. Outside of controlled storage conditions, gene therapies cannot survive for any appreciable length of time. Upon clinical administration, any recombinant gene therapy viral vector particles that do not enter host cells are diluted within the body and if excreted are in such low multiplicity to no longer be viable or considered infectious to persons, animals or living organisms within the environment. Any nucleic acids released into the environment are rapidly degraded.","output":"Call for More Effective Regulation of Clinical Trials with Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Consisting of or Containing Genetically Modified Organisms in the European Union."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionIn the first months of 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic spread in Italy, and the Italian government implemented a general lockdown.

Even with a limited protective effect, face masks can reduce total infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. However, random distribution of masks is generally suboptimal; prioritized coverage of the elderly improves outcomes, while retaining resources for detected cases provides further mitigation under a range of scenarios.

In mice infected with gliatropic demyelinating coronavirus, B7-H1 expression on oligodendroglia delays virus control, but also dampens clinical disease. To define the mechanisms by which B7-H1 alters pathogenic outcome, virus-infected B7-H1-deficient (B7-H1(-/-)) mice were analyzed for altered peripheral and CNS immune responses. B7-H1 deficiency did not affect peripheral T or B cell activation or alter the magnitude or composition of CNS-infiltrating cells. However, higher levels of IFN- mRNA in CNS-infiltrating virus-specific CD8 T cells as well as CD4 T cells contributed to elevated IFN- protein in the B7-H1(-/-) CNS. Increased effector function at the single-cell level was also evident by elevated granzyme B expression specifically in virus-specific CNS CD8 T cells. Although enhanced T cell activity accelerated virus control, 50% of mice succumbed to infection. Despite enhanced clinical recovery, surviving B7-H1(-/-) mice still harbored persisting viral mRNA, albeit at reduced levels compared with wild-type mice. B7-H1(-/-) mice exhibited extensive loss of axonal integrity, although demyelination, a hallmark of virus-induced tissue damage, was not increased. The results suggest that B7-H1 hinders viral control in B7-H1 expressing glia cells, but does not mediate resistance to CD8 T cell-mediated cytolysis. These data are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that B7-H1-mediated protection from viral-induced immune pathology associated with encephalomyelitis resides in limiting T cell-mediated axonal bystander damage rather than direct elimination of infected myelinating cells.","output":"Enhanced antiviral T cell function in the absence of B7-H1 is insufficient to prevent persistence but exacerbates axonal bystander damage during viral encephalomyelitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This mini-review represents a brief, disorder-centric consideration of the interplay between order and disorder in proteins.

However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control, it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are significantly increased if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. With all related control measures maintained at their baseline levels, this study shows that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods (mention what happens if lockdown measures were extended by two weeks). We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the community lockdown measures were lifted at the mild lifting level (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the levels of these activities allowed during the corresponding lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. It is further shown that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","output":"Could masks curtail the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19 in the US?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This reflection looks at pedagogic strategies employed in General Chemistry classes for English Language learners (ELLs) in a rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic The approaches included the use of small group systems thinking (ST) activities and a variety of formative assessments geared toward maintaining and enhancing students' language competencies, engagement, and motivation while studying in an online environment The activities also allowed for prompt instructor feedback Although the development of these activities proved to be time-consuming, they provided students with an opportunity to reinforce their scientific knowledge construct due to increased participation, time spent on tasks, and communication among peers","output":"Balancing the Disruptions to the Teaching and Learning Equilibrium-Responsive Pedagogic Approaches to Teaching Online During the Covid-19 Pandemic in General Chemistry Classes at an Arabian Gulf University"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ŀ нԮ͹״׻ʿ֧״,  һʾ(CD-RISC-10)֧(PSSS),301Ԯ͹״׻ʿе  ԮʿܷΪ(28 896 06),֧ܷΪ(68 4110 42);֮عϵ(P&lt;0 001);Իعʾ,ޡְơǷԮ¼֧ǽԮ͹״׻ʿԵĶӰ(P&lt;0 05)  ԮʿԼֵ֧÷ֽ,ʾҽԺ߿ͨ㷺֧ϵͳ,չԮʿԵ帨רѵ,ﵽ⸺¼ԻʿӰ,Ԯ","output":"Investigation and Analysis of Factors Related to Resilience and Perceived Social Support of Nurses Who are Engaged in Assisting to Combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biopharmaceutical production is currently a multibillion-dollar industry with high growth perspectives The research and development of biologically sourced pharmaceuticals are extremely important and a reality in our current healthcare system Interferon alpha consensus (cIFN) is a non-natural synthetic antiviral molecule that comprises all the most prevalent amino acids of IFN- into one consensus protein sequence For clinical use, cIFN is produced in E coli in the form of inclusion bodies Here, we describe the use of two solubility tags (Fh8 and DsbC) to improve soluble cIFN production Furthermore, we analyzed cIFN production in different culture media and temperatures in order to improve biopharmaceutical production Our results demonstrate that Fh8-cIFN yield was improved when bacteria were cultivated in autoinduction culture medium at 30 C After hydrolysis, the recovery of soluble untagged cIFN was 58% from purified Fh8-cIFN molecule, fourfold higher when compared to cIFN recovered from the DsbC-cIFN, which achieved 14% recovery The biological activity of cIFN was tested on in vitro model of antiviral effect against Zika, Mayaro, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in susceptible VERO cells We show, for the first time, that cIFN has a potent activity against these viruses, being very low amounts of the molecule sufficient to inhibit virus multiplication Thus, this molecule could be used in a clinical approach to treat Arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2","output":"Strategies for the Production of Soluble Interferon-Alpha Consensus and Potential Application in Arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has been struck by multiple crises that crippled the socio-economy of nations in the past.

The positive impact exercise can have on overall health is irrefutable. While it is the responsibility of health care providers to assess and counsel for exercise, there are logistical, structural, and educational barriers preventing this counseling. A physical activity consultation clinic led by primary care sports medicine physicians would allow for focused exercise counseling by appropriately trained providers to motivated patients. While previously there have been many institutional and logistical barriers to establishing such a clinic, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a window of opportunity for doing so within a large academic medical center. This article reviews the importance of exercise on overall health, outlines the barriers for establishing a clinical experience dedicated to counseling for physical activity, and details how overcoming those barriers was facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Implementing a Physical Activity Consultation Clinic during a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD8+ T cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity, however, understanding T cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","output":"The presentation of SARS-CoV-2 peptides by the common HLA-A*02:01 molecule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the presence and diversity of Bartonella spp. in bats of 13 insectivorous and frugivorous species collected from various locations across Kenya.

The brain mediates this entire cluster of symptoms, even though most major infections occur outside the brain. The true importance of sickness behaviors is not the numerous discoveries of symptoms that affect all of us when we get sick.

In the present study, we retrospectively evaluated and integrated laboratory parameters/variables of 45 elderly subjects from a long-term care facility with Sars-CoV-2 outbreak and spread, to identify potential common patterns of systemic response able to better stratify patients clinical course and outcome. Methods: Baseline white blood cells, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets counts, hemoglobin, total iron, ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration were used to generate a principal component analysis (PCA). Statistical analysis was performed by using R statistical package version 4.0. Results: Of the 45 patients, 19 were male and 26 were female, with a median age of 81 years. The overall mortality rate was 26.67%. By PCA and clustering approach we identified 3 laboratory patterns of response, renamed as low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk, strongly associated with patients survival (p<0.01). D-dimer, iron status, lymphocyte/monocyte count represented the main markers discriminating high- and low-risk groups.

The demands of the COVID-19 pandemic have challenged the healthcare system increasing the risk of job burnout among healthcare professionals. The studies conducted so far have mainly focused on the effects of job burnout on executive functions. Visuospatial functions are a cognitive domain which plays an important role in healthcare workers' optimal performance. Healthcare workers are constantly relying on their visuospatial abilities in order to care for their patients as they are required to use techniques that involve manipulation of medical instruments, they need to have excellent hand-eye coordination and great perception of spatial anatomy, factors that can affect healthcare workers' performance is of significance and can put patient safety at risk. However, our understanding of how visuospatial functions are being affected in job burnout is limited. The scope of this mini-review is to examine the evidence concerning the relationship of job burnout with visuospatial functions. The sparsity of the relevant empirical evidence does not allow for definite conclusions. However, given the implications of diminished visuospatial abilities in patient safety we highlight the need for studies exploring the effects of job burnout on visuospatial functions.

This study was thus conducted to determine the incidence and presence of a relationship between the predictors of BMI or CRP and duration of MV in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS This prospective observational study included 72 critically ill trauma patients. Admitted patients were categorized by duration of MV to Group A (< or =7 days) and Group B (>7 days). The biological status of patients was assessed by the serial measurement of CRP on admission to the ICU (T1), at 48 and 72 hours after admission, and on the day of beginning (T2) or discontinuation (T3) of MV. Data on BMI, serum albumin, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were also collected at T2 or T3. RESULTS At T3, the SOFA score, BMI, albumin, and CRP were significantly higher in patients in Group B compared with Group A (p<0.01). The incidence of low BMI (< or =20 kg/m2) or high CRP (>10 mg/L) in patients in Group B was significantly higher at T2 or T3 compared with Group A (p<0.05). At T3, CRP was determined as the most powerful predictor of >7 days of MV followed by BMI.

Our major aim was to identify common baseline clinical features that could help recognise adult patients at high risk of having COVID-19. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of all the evidence available at LitCovid, until 23 March 2020. SETTING: Studies conducted in any setting and any country were included. PARTICIPANTS: Studies had to report the prevalence of sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms and comorbidities specifically in adults with a diagnosis of infection by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 1572 publications were published on LitCovid. We have included 56 articles in our analysis, with 89% conducted in China and 75% containing inpatients. Three studies were conducted in North America and one in Europe. Participants' age ranged from 28 to 70 years, with balanced gender distribution. The proportion of asymptomatic cases were from 2% to 79%. The most common reported symptoms were fever (4%-99%), cough (4%-92%), dyspnoea/shortness of breath (1%-90%), fatigue (4%-89%), myalgia (3%-65%) and pharyngalgia (2%-61%), while regarding comorbidities, we found cardiovascular disease (1%-40%), hypertension (0%-40%) and cerebrovascular disease (1%-40%). Such heterogeneity impaired the conduction of meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The infection by COVID-19 seems to affect people in a very diverse manner and with different characteristics.

SARS-CoV-2 infections initiate in the bronchi of the upper respiratory tract and are able to disseminate to the lower respiratory tract eventually causing acute severe respiratory syndrome with a high degree of mortality in the elderly. Here we use reconstituted primary bronchial epithelia from adult and children donors to follow the infection dynamic following infection with SARS-CoV-2. We show that in bronchial epithelia derived from adult donors, infections initiate in multi-ciliated cells. Then, infection rapidly spread within 24-48h throughout the whole epithelia. Within 3-4 days, large apical syncytia form between multi-ciliated cells and basal cells, which dissipate into the apical lumen. We show that these syncytia are a significant source of the released infectious dose. In stark contrast to these findings, bronchial epithelia reconstituted from children donors are intrinsically more resistant to virus infection and show active restriction of virus spread. This restriction is paired with accelerated release of IFN compared to adult donors. Taken together our findings reveal apical syncytia formation as an underappreciated source of infectious virus for either local dissemination or release into the environment. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that children bronchial epithelia are more resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 providing experimental support for epidemiological observations that SARS-CoV-2 cases fatality is linked to age. Significance Statement Bronchial epithelia are the primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our work uses reconstituted bronchial epithelia from adults and children. We show that infection of adult epithelia with SARS-CoV-2 is rapid and results in the synchronized release of large clusters of infected cells and syncytia into the apical lumen contributing to the released infectious virus dose. Infection of children derived bronchial epithelia revealed an intrinsic resistance to infection and virus spread, probably as a result of a faster onset of interferon secretion. Thus, our data provide direct evidence for the epidemiological observation that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission via apical syncytia release from primary bronchial epithelia and infectivity restriction in children epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ba?ka insanlarla kurdu?u sosyal etkile?im ile kendi benli?inin fark?na varan insanl?k, 21. yzy?lda sosyalle?me ihtiyac?n? gidermenin ve di?er insanlarla ileti?im temelli etkile?im kurman?n yeni yollar?n? ke?fetmektedir.

Starting from available virus samples, the technique explores the space of all possible subsequences of viral RNA, evaluating them as candidate primers. The criteria used to establish the suitability of a sequence as primer includes its frequency of appearance in samples labeled as Omicron, its absence from samples labeled as other variants, a specific range of melting temperature, and its CG content.

We investigated the association between the psychological stress of FHW and gut microbiota. METHODS: We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the longitudinal changes in gut microbiota and investigated the impact of microbial changes on FHWs' mental status. RESULTS: Stressful events induced significant depression, anxiety, and stress in FHWs and disrupted the gut microbiome; gut dysbiosis persisted for at least half a year. Different microbes followed discrete trajectories during the half-year of follow-up. Microbes associated with mental health were mainly Faecalibacterium spp. and [Eubacterium] eligens group spp. with anti-inflammatory effects. Of note, the prediction model indicated that low abundance of [Eubacterium] hallii group uncultured bacterium and high abundance of Bacteroides eggerthii at Day 0 (immediately after the two-month frontline work) were significant determinants of the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms in FHWs.

The major population had low virus titers and developed partial villous atrophy, whereas the minor population had marked villous atrophy and virus titers comparable to those of the newborn pigs. These observations support the hyposthesis that the accelerated replacement of villous epithelium in the small intestine of pigs during the first 3 weeks contributes to the innate age-dependent resistance to transmissible gastroenteritis. The accelerated replacement of villous epithelial cells in older pigs contributes to resistance in two ways. The increased proliferative capacity of crypt epithelium results in a more rapid regeneration of atrophic villi; and the comparatively young villous absorptive cells resulting from accelerated replacement produce less virus per cell than the older ones of the newborn pig.","output":"Age-dependent resistance to transmissible gastroenteritis of swine.

Once an immunological complication like cytokine storm occurs, anti-viral based monotherapy alone is not enough. Additional anti-inflammatory treatment is recommended. It must be noted that anti-inflammatory drugs such as JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, TNF- inhibitors, colchicine, etc., have been either suggested or are under trials for managing cytokine storm in COVID-19 infections. Natural astaxanthin (ASX) has a clinically proven safety profile and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. There is evidence from preclinical studies that supports its preventive actions against ALI/ARDS. Moreover, ASX has a potent PPARs activity. Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that ASX could be considered as a potential adjunctive supplement. Here, we summarize the mounting evidence where ASX is shown to exert protective effect by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-. We present reports where ASX is shown to prevent against oxidative damage and attenuate exacerbation of the inflammatory responses by regulating signaling pathways like NF-?B, NLRP3 and JAK/STAT.

METHODS: From March 20 to April 8, 319 patients (mean age 62.3 years old) consecutive patients with an intermediate clinical probability of COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a chest CT scan. Two independent chest radiologists blinded to clinical information and RT-PCR results retrospectively reviewed and classified images on a 1C5 confidence level scale for COVID-19 pneumonia. Agreements between radiologists were assessed with kappa statistics. Diagnostic accuracy of chest CT compared with RT-PCR assay and patient outcomes was measured using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19 pneumonia were calculated. RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement for highly probable (kappa: 0.83 [p < .001]) and highly probable or probable (kappa: 0.82 [p < .001]) diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was very good. RT-PCR tests performed in 307 patients were positive in 174 and negative in 133. The areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.94 and 0.92 respectively. With a disease prevalence of 61.2%, PPV were 95.9% and 94.3%, and NPV 84.4% and 77.1%. CONCLUSION: During acute COVID-19 outbreak, chest CT scan may be used for triage of patients with intermediate clinical probability with very good inter-observer agreements and diagnostic accuracy. KEY POINTS: ? Concordances between two chest radiologists to diagnose or exclude a COVID-19 pneumonia in 319 consecutive patients with intermediate clinical probability were very good (kappa: 0.82; p < .001). ? When compared with RT-PCR results and patient outcomes, the diagnostic accuracy of CT to identify COVID-19 pneumonia was high for both radiologists (AUC: 0.94 and 0.92). ?

HIE and MOD monitoring were performed for three days. HIE severity was graded according to reported scores including amplitude integrated EEG. Multiple organ dysfunction was also assessed. The correlation between neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and multiple organ dysfunction was analyzed. RESULTS Children with HIE were divided into three grades: mild, moderate and severe. There were statistically significant differences among the three groups in emergency caesarean section, Apgar 5 minutes, systemic hypothermia and neonatal mortality. Differences in MOD scores were found in three HIE stages per day from Day 1 to Day 3. Among children with mild HIE grading, the most common mildly affected organ systems are pH, electrolyte imbalance and liver system, and the least affected organs are kidney and blood systems. Among children with HIE grade of mild and severe, there was no significant difference in moderate-severe organ involvement, and the number of severely affected children was small.

We designed and implemented a quality improvement perioperative program for minimally invasive gynecologic oncology surgery (MIGOS). Our aim was to improve SDD rate from 30% to 75% over the study period, while maintaining acceptable 30-day perioperative outcomes and patient experience. Consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy at a single cancer centre were included during the 9-month project period and a historical cohort of 100 consecutive patients was identified for comparison. A team of gynecologic oncologists, anesthesiologists, and nurses developed a comprehensive perioperative care program and met bi-weekly to revise interventions through plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Patients were followed for 30 days after discharge. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of pre-MIGOS and MIGOS patient cohorts using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Fisher exact tests. We used a run chart to monitor effects of interventions on outcomes and a pre-post analysis to evaluate for statistical significance of change in SDD and perioperative outcomes. We assessed 100 consecutive pre-MIGOS and 79 consecutive MIGOS patients. Overall SDD rates increased from 31% (31/100) to 71% (56/79) after implementation (p<0.001) (Figure 1). There was a consistent increase in SDD rate after implementation, although more pronounced following the start of the COVID pandemic. The MIGOS cohort was significantly younger (59 vs. 65;p=0.04) and had shorter operative times (168 vs. 202 minutes;p<0.001) but the two groups were not different with respect to BMI, comorbidity, stage distribution, type of procedure performed, and intraoperative blood loss. We found no difference in 30-day perioperative complication rates, readmission, reoperation, clinic visits, emergency department visits, mortality or morbidity. The most common reason for overnight admission was nausea and vomiting (35%), complications related to pre-existing comorbidities (15%) and urinary retention (10%). Overall, 89% of MIGOS patients rated their experience as 'very good' or 'excellent', and 87% felt that their post-operative length of stay was adequate.

I combine the European Unions Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) with the Stay-at-Home Restriction Index (SHRI) from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset for JanuaryCMay 2020. The results of a series of difference-in-difference regression models reveal that the severity of stay-at-home restrictions increased overall food prices by 1% in March 2020, compared to January and February 2020. The price level for food continued to rise in the high stay-at-home restriction countries relative to thier counterpart in April but stabilised in May. The food categories that witnessed the most significant surges in prices were meat, fish & seafood, and vegetables. The prices of bread & cereals, fruits, milk, cheese & eggs and oils & fats were not significantly affected. The correlations between food prices and stay-at-home restrictions were significant after controlling for cross-country variations in COVID-19 affectedness and other mitigation and adaptation measures, such as international travel controls, road closures and the size of the economic stimulus packages.

A questionnaire was used to measure confidence in, acceptance of and WTP for COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariable (ordered) logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with acceptance and WTP of COVID-19 vaccine.Findings: Most (89.1%) migrants stated that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination. Over 90.0% migrants perceived COVID-19 vaccine as important, while only 75.0% and 77.7% perceived vaccines safe and effective. Socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, but confidence in the importance, safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine was significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. The top reasons for vaccine hesitancy were lack of vaccine information and confidence. Proportion of those definitely willing to get COVID-19 vaccine was 20% lower if paid by themselves than free vaccination. Migrants were willing to pay a median amount of US$ 46 for COVID-19 vaccine.Interpretation: A high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine was universal among migrants in Shanghai, China.

METHODS: This study used a mixed-method approach. The first phase implemented a survey that targeted both academic staff and students to evaluate their experiences with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a focus group discussion was conducted to explore, in-depth, their experience. The survey consisted of five domains as follows: readiness for the shift to distance education during the full and partial lockdown, perception towards distance education, barriers against distance education, and the acquisitions due to distance education. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess participants' responses to the different domains (mean score  standard deviation). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the academic staff and 65% of the students responded to the survey. Participants' views were positive for readiness for the shift to distance education during the full lockdown (3.890.42 for academic staff and 3.820.50 for students) with almost similar evaluation for the readiness during the blended learning period (3.910.44 for staff and 3.830.59 for students). The findings showed a generally positive perception towards distance education (3.59 0.67 for academic staff and 3.470.64 for students). The acquisitions due to distance education were also positive (3.950.72 for academic staff and 3.780.77 for students). Nonetheless, some barriers that affected distance education were raised with an overall neutral view from both academic staff (3.310.72) and students (3.310.64), with different responses for the individual items.

However, they are associated with gastrointestinal side effects including acid reflux, mucosal erosion, and oesophageal stricture. We present a rare case of alendronate causing perforated gastric volvulus in a patient with giant hiatus hernia. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 82-year-old woman presented to our hospital with central chest pain, palpitations and new onset atrial fibrillation on the background of 2 weeks of vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a perforated, mixed type organoaxial/mesoenteroaxial gastric volvulus within a giant hiatus hernia, with partial gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent laparoscopic reduction of hiatus hernia and gastric volvulus, conversion to laparotomy, and distal gastrectomy with Bilroth II reconstruction. An alendronate tablet was found in the right mediastinum. The patient had a prolonged post-operative course and was discharged home after completing extensive physical rehabilitation. DISCUSSION Bisphosphonates are widely used to treat metabolic bone disease, however can have devastating adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract. There are a number of mechanisms postulated for how these medications cause injury to the gastric and oesophageal mucosa. CONCLUSION This case illustrates the importance of considering the gastrointestinal effects associated with bisphosphonates when prescribing them to patients, especially those with functional or anatomical disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

This \\"incomplete sleeve\\" avoids gastric resection or band placement. In this paper, we report our experience of the laparoscopic approach of the technique in a selected obese population excluding prominent grazer and/or sweet eaters. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred patients (39 males, 61 females) underwent the procedure in a prospective trial. Mean age was 40 years (range 18-68). Mean preoperative BMI was 43.2 kg/m(2) (range 35-62). RESULTS The procedure was performed by laparoscopy starting with the creation of a circular opening at the junction of antrum and corpus followed by a vertical stapling to the angle of Hiss. Mean duration of the procedure was 67 (range 40-122) min. No intraoperative complication occurred. Mean hospital stay (SD) was 2.5 (0.9) days. The single postoperative complication consisted in a mild stenosis that responded to endoscopic dilatation. After a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 9-24), mean percentage of excess body weight loss (SD) was 48(14), 59(18) and 68(24)%, respectively at 3, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life appeared satisfactory with a low incidence of gastroesophageal reflux. The procedure was associated with improvement or resolution of diabetes, arterial hypertension, and dyslipemia at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrated that the M&M procedure could be performed safely laparoscopically.

Unfortunately, neither an anti-HFMD drug nor a vaccine is currently available. Rupintrivir in phase II clinical trial candidate for rhinovirus showed highly potent antiviral activities against enteroviruses as an inhibitor for 3C protease (3Cpro). In the present study, we focused on designing 50 novel rupintrivir analogs against CV-A16 and EV-A71 3Cpro using computational tools. From their predicted binding affinities, the five compounds with functional group modifications at P1', P2, P3, and P4 sites, namely P1'-1, P2-m3, P3-4, P4-5, and P4-19, could bind with both CV-A16 and EV-A71 3Cpro better than rupintrivir. Subsequently, these five analogs were studied by 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Among them, P2-m3, the derivative with meta-aminomethyl-benzyl group at the P2 site, showed the greatest potential to interact with the 3Cpro target by delivering the highest number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and contact atoms. It formed the hydrogen bonds with L127 and K130 residues at the P2 site stronger than rupintrivir, supported by significantly lower MM/PB(GB)SA binding free energies.

To learn about the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 in LA County, we sequenced 142 viral genomes from unique patients seeking care at UCLA Health System. 86 of these genomes are from samples collected before April 19, 2020. We found that the early outbreak in LA, as in other international air travel hubs, was seeded by multiple introductions of strains from Asia and Europe. We identified a US-specific strain, B.1.43, which has been found predominantly in California and Washington State. While samples from LA County carry the ancestral B.1.43 genome, viral genomes from neighbouring counties in California and from counties in Washington State carry additional mutations, suggesting a potential origin of B.1.43 in Southern California. We quantified the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time, and found evidence that the public health measures put in place in LA County to control the virus were effective at preventing transmission, but may have been undermined by the many introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the region.

Nevertheless, they are an important class of antibiotics and are frequently used in clinical practice for treating a variety of infections. This study sought to utilize pharmacoepidemiology methods and pharmacology principles to estimate the risk of macrolide treatment failure and quantify the influence of their pharmacokinetics on the risk of treatment failure, using clinically reported drugCdrug interaction data. Using a large, commercial claims database (2006C2015), inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to create a cohort of patients who received a macrolide for three common acute infections. Furthermore, an additional analysis examining only bacterial pneumonia events treated with macrolides was conducted. These criteria were formulated specifically to ensure treatment failure would not be expected nor influenced by intrinsic or extrinsic factors. Treatment failure rates were 6% within the common acute infections and 8% in the bacterial pneumonia populations. Regression results indicated that macrolide AUC changes greater than 50% had a significant effect on treatment failure risk, particularly for azithromycin. In fact, our results show that decreased or increased exposure change can influence failure risk, by 35% or 12%, respectively, for the acute infection scenarios. The bacterial pneumonia results were less significant with respect to the regression analyses.

This survey was, however, fielded before booster vaccination was recommended to the general adult population in Denmark, which may have resulted in an underestimation of booster vaccine willingness. Therefore, we conducted a follow-up survey targeting the same individuals. METHODS: The follow-up survey wave was fielded in December 2021 using the same methods as in the September 2021 wave. Using data from participants responding to both survey waves, we compared COVID-19 booster vaccine willingness between the waves by means of paired t-test. RESULTS: A total of 1,429 invitees (58%) responded to the follow-up survey. Among those, 1,324 (93%) had also responded to the initial survey on COVID-19 booster vaccine willingness. At follow-up, among the 95% reporting to be vaccinated or that COVID-19 vaccination was scheduled, a weighted proportion of 95% indicated that they were willing to receive the booster vaccine once offered. Booster vaccine willingness at follow-up (December 2021) had statistically significantly increased (p less-than 0.001) compared with the initial survey (September 2021).

We investigated the epidemiology of sHCoV infection during the first year of life, including risk factors and association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of infants enrolled in a birth cohort near Cape Town, South Africa, from 2012 to 2015. LRTI surveillance was implemented, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected fortnightly over infancy. Quantitative PCR detected respiratory pathogens, including coronaviruses-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1. Swabs were tested from infants at the time of LRTI and from the 90 days prior as well as from age-matched control infants from the cohort over the equivalent period. RESULTS: In total, 885 infants were included, among whom 464 LRTI events occurred. Of the 4751 samples tested for sHCoV, 9% tested positive, with HCoV-NL63 the most common. Seasonal HCoV detection was associated with LRTI; this association was strongest for coronavirus-OC43, which was also found in all sHCoV-associated hospitalizations. Birth in winter was associated with sHCoV-LRTI, but there were no clear seasonal differences in detection. Co-detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae was weakly associated with sHCoV-LRTI (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 0.9-3.6); detection of other respiratory viruses or bacteria was not associated with sHCoV status.

In this framework, mortality amongst those infected for the first time is mostly amongst the old but survivors acquire fatal infection immunity (FII). Subjects with FII can subsequently be infected and infect others without suffering significant mortality. Under these conditions, coronaviruses induce endemic infections that elicit FII in individuals during childhood when the risk of mortality is low and maintain it throughout their lifetime, thereby protecting the population against the worst effects of infection. A multi-compartment ODE model was constructed to explore the implications of this proposal on the evolution of a zoonosis sharing properties of both SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses. The results show that mortality has two components, the first incurred during transition to endemicity and the other is exacted on a continuing basis. The relative contribution of each depends on the longevity of the FII state. In particular, a one-time vaccination of the older subpopulation is sufficient to reduce total mortality if FII is long-lived. The effect of a regular vaccination was also examined when FII was shorter lived. Herd immunity was not achieved. The validity of this proposal with regard to Covid-19 depends on whether reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 behaves in the manner expected of FII. If it does, then certain considerations apply to how Covid-19 is to be managed and how vaccine choice could influence that.","output":"A model of endemic coronavirus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has changed the life of people in many facets, economic, social, and psychological.

In the first phase, surveys were administered to 5 second-year child and adolescent psychiatry fellows and will be administered to 7 more fellows next week. Results: Eighty percent of child and adolescent psychiatry fellows responded. Fifty percent were never aware of the PechaKucha style of presentation;however, after the survey, 75% were comfortable to present in the PechaKucha style after the presentation. Fifty percent were neutral in response to be more empathetic toward patients or colleagues postpresentation;however, all agreed that this presentation style made them more empathetic toward themselves. There was no change in the feeling of isolation or awareness of the meaning of the illness. Three fellows felt that this style increases the bond with colleagues and helps foster creativity. All fellows agreed that this is more fun than traditional didactics. In the open-ended response, all participants endorsed a significantly positive experience. Conclusions: In the pilot survey, the results from the PechaKucha presentation style are encouraging and can potentially be a good alternative to a traditional PowerPoint presentation. The completion of this survey on a larger group of child and adolescent psychiatry fellows will provide us better understanding of their knowledge and experience. The future plan is to hold a national PechaKucha event.

Under traditional monetary policy strategies, the ELB imparts a persistent downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations; to offset this, new strategies are needed which will at times deliver inflation above 2%. The new framework addresses this issue and seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time. It also emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal, and that the FOMC should seek to eliminate shortfallsrather than symmetric deviationsfrom maximum employment. The FOMCs September policy statement provided forward guidance that is fully consistent with the new strategy. Historical retrospection of the 2015C2018 liftoff period suggests that, if it were in place over that time, the new framework and forward guidance likely would have forestalled rate increases and potentially delivered better macroeconomic outcomes. More, generally, to reduce employment shortfalls and average 2% inflation over time, the FOMC needs to have an in it to win it attitude toward our inflation objective. The September FOMC statements forward guidance that inflation should be at 2% and confidently on track for overshooting before we liftoff from the ELB is an important step in that direction.","output":"What does the new long-run monetary policy framework imply for the path ahead?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a general growth model based on nonextensive statistical physics We show that the most common unidimensional growth laws such as power law, exponential, logistic, Richards, Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz can be obtained This model belongs to a particular case reported in (Physica A 369, 645 (2006)) The new evolution equation resembles the \\"universality\\"revealed by West for ontogenetic growth (Nature 413, 628 (2001)) We show that for early times the model follows a power law growth as N(t)  tD, where the exponent D 1 1-q classifies different types of growth Several examples are given and discussed ? 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company","output":"A generalized q growth model based on nonadditive entropy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has forced countries to introduce severe restrictive measures to contain its spread. In particular, physical distancing and restriction of movement have had important consequences on human behaviour and potentially also on illicit drug use and supply. These changes can be associated with additional risks for users, in particular due to reduced access to prevention and harm reduction activities. Furthermore, there have been limitations in the amount of data about drug use which can be collected due to restrictions. To goal of this study was to obtain information about potential changes in illicit drug use impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Wastewater samples were collected in seven cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy at the beginning of lockdowns (March-May 2020). Using previously established and validated methods, levels of amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), MDMA, benzoylecgonine (BE, the main metabolite of cocaine) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-&#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH, main metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) were measured and compared with findings from previous years. Important differences in levels of consumed drugs were observed across the considered countries. Whilst for some substances and locations, marked decreases in consumption could be observed (e.g., 50% decrease in MDMA levels compared to previous years). In some cases, similar or even higher levels compared to previous years could be found. Changes in weekly patterns were also observed, however these were not clearly defined for all locations and/or substances. Findings confirm that the current situation is highly heterogeneous and that it remains very difficult to explain and/or predict the effect that the present pandemic has on illicit drug use and availability.

Dysregulation of this response can result in uncontrolled infection, inflammation, and autoimmune disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms shaping the strength of type I interferon signaling may provide critical insights into infection control strategies and autoimmune disease therapies. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that acts as both a bacterial sensor protein and a mediator of antiviral responses. Antibacterial functions of NOD2 are enhanced by treatment with the small molecule inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), though how this might function in the host antiviral response remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the ability of PALA to enhance NOD2-dependent antiviral responses. Alone, PALA treatment of macrophages was not sufficient to induce interferon  (IFN) production or ISG expression. Instead, PALA synergized with IFN stimulation to enhance expression and activation of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and induce the upregulation of a subset of ISGs in co-treated cells. Furthermore, PALA treatment of epithelial cells resulted in impaired viral replication of the herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus. Induction of the PALA-enhanced antiviral response required activation of non-canonical NOD2 signaling mediated by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and interferon response factor 1 (IRF1), rather than the classical receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIP2) pathway or other IRFs previously reported to mediate NOD2 antiviral responses. These findings highlight pyrimidine metabolism enzymes as controllers of antimicrobial responses and suggest novel mechanisms for the modulation of type I interferon responses and antiviral activity. Significance Statement Understanding the molecular mechanisms shaping the strength of type I interferon signaling may provide critical insights to improve infection control strategies and autoimmune disease therapies. This work demonstrates that the pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate synergizes with type I interferon to enhance antiviral responses through activation of a non-canonical NOD2 signaling pathway. These findings highlight pyrimidine metabolism enzymes as controllers of antimicrobial responses and suggest novel mechanisms for the modulation of type I interferon responses.","output":"N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate enhances type I interferon anti-viral responses through activation of non-canonical NOD2 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of viral restriction factors that inhibit the entry processes of several pathogenic viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), in vitro.

We further observed that the phenotype of Ifitm3-specific knockout mice was indistinguishable from that of mice lacking the entire Ifitm locus. Ifitm3 was expressed by IAV target cells including alveolar type II pneumocytes and tracheal/bronchial respiratory epithelial cells. Robust Ifitm3 expression was also observed in several tissues in the absence of infection. Among murine Ifitm promoters, only that of Ifitm3 could be induced by type I and II interferons. Ifitm3 could also be upregulated by the gp130 cytokines IL-6 and oncostatin M on cells expressing appropriate receptors, suggesting that multiple cytokine signals could contribute to Ifitm3 expression in a cell or tissue-specific manner.

This approach is based on the POZE paradigm, which posits that change starts inside and is nurtured from the outside in C both for individuals and for durable social change. Such a holistic perspective is crucial to build society as it emerges from the Pandemic. COVID-19 is a reminder that humans around the World are fundamentally all the same; the result of 4 dimensions C soul, heart, mind and body, which find their expression in aspirations, emotions, thoughts and sensations. These 4 dimensions constantly interact and influence each other in ways that reflect the 4-dimensional dynamic that shapes our collective existence. Individuals are the micro dimension that stands at the center of everything else. Forming part of various institutions, from families to parties, individuals are constitutive components of the meso dimension. Individuals and institutions form countries and economies, the macro-dimension. These dimensions in addition to nature and supra-national institutions form the meta-dimension. A constant interplay connects and determines what happens in each dimension and what derives from it. To thrive in the post-pandemic world, we must understand and optimize this interplay. This is the point of departure for the argumentation laid out in this article. The prevailing systemic imbalance in which many lack the means to cover their basic needs can only be addressed by planting the C-Core (completion, compassion, creativity, cooperation) at the center of human interactions. When we bring risks, responsibility and real opportunities together in one coherent framework whilst applying the proposed twice 4-dimensional paradigm-shift a set of concrete recommendations appears. Looking at individuals, and institutions, the article concludes with suggestions to seize this moment and shape not merely a response to the crises, but to lay the ground for a new social contract.

Here, we present a novel approach to increase the availability of repetitive and routine Covid-19 testing that may ultimately reduce the overall viral burden in the community. We describe implementation of a testing program that included students, faculty and staff from K-12 schools and universities participating in the SalivaClear pooled surveillance method (Mirimus Clinical Labs, Brooklyn, NY). Over 400,000 saliva specimens were self-collected from students, faculty and staff from 93 K-12 schools and 18 universities and tested in pools of up to 24 samples over a 20-week period during this pandemic. Peaks of positive cases were seen in the days following the Halloween, Thanksgiving and New Year holidays. Pooled testing did not significantly alter the sensitivity of the molecular assay in terms of both qualitative (100% detection rate on both pooled and individual samples) and quantitative (comparable cycle threshold (CT) values between pooled and individual samples) measures. Pooling samples substantially reduced the costs associated with PCR testing and allowed schools to rapidly assess transmission and adjust prevention protocols as necessary. By establishing low-cost, weekly testing of students and faculty, pooled saliva analysis enabled schools to determine whether transmission had occurred, make data-driven decisions, and adjust safety protocols.

Epidemiological data show that blast-related casualties result in significantly higher susceptibility to wound infections, suggesting long-lasting immune modulatory effects from blast exposure. The mechanisms involved in BW-induced immune changes are poorly understood. We evaluated the effects of BW on the immune system using an established murine model. Animals were exposed to BWs (using an Advanced Blast Simulator), followed by longitudinally sampling for 14 days. Blood, bone marrow, and spleen were analyzed for changes in the 1) complete blood count (CBC), and 2) composition of bone marrow cells (BMC) and splenocytes, and 3) concentrations of systemic cytokines/chemokines. Our data demonstrate that BW results in transient bone marrow failure and long-term changes in the frequency and profile of progenitor cell populations. Viability progressively decreased in hematopoietic stem cells and pluripotent progenitor cells. Significant decrease of CD4+ T cells in the spleen indicates reduced functionality of adaptive immune system.

Unfortunately, no clear treatment guidelines exist to guide immunosuppressive therapy in this condition. Case: A 76-year-old male with a past medical history significant for polymyalgia rheumatica on 7.5mg of prednisone and a recent hip replacement 2 month prior was initially admitted for 1 week to an outside hospital, where he was diagnosed and treated for a small right hilar pulmonary embolism. Although he had multiple negative SARS-COV2 PCR, he was empirically treated with remdesivir and decadron given patchy ground glass opacities noted on CT scan. He was then discharged to home with oxygen and prior regimen of 7.5 mg prednisone. Unfortunately, his symptoms acutely worsened and he presented to our institution with severe hypoxia. Interval CT scan showed worsened bilateral ground glass infiltrates, basilar predominance. Bronchoscopy with (BAL) showed neutrophil predominance. Comprehensive infectious disease work up from BAL was unrevealing. Transbronchial biopsy was aborted given the patient's worsening hypoxemia. He required high flow nasal cannula despite receiving 1mg/kg dosing of the methylprednisolone. His comprehensive autoimmune work up including ANCA, Scl-70, CCP, RNP, Jo-1, smith, C3, C4, HIV, SARS-COV-2 antibody were all unrevealing. Patient denied any environmental exposures or inhalants. Patient was started on pulse-dose steroids with 1000mg x 3 days. He was also empirically treated for pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP) given chronic steroid use. Despite these interventions, his oxygenation was slow to improve. Decision was made to start him 500mg BID dosing of mycophenolate. Over the course of the next 4 weeks in the hospital, he was eventually able to be weaned to 5 L nasal cannula and was then discharged home. Follow up HRCT 1 month later in the clinic showed major improvement in bilateral infiltrates. Discussion: AIP is often characterized by rapidly progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure that is refractory to standard treatment. This case presented with clinical course and imaging findings that were consistent with diagnosis of AIP. Surgical biopsy was deemed unsafe given respiratory failure.

The integrated study concerning environment impact on the emerging disease is rarely reported. Therefore, based on the two-stage modeling study, we investigate the effect of both natural and human environment on COVID-19 incidence at a city level. Besides, the interactive effect of different factors on COVID-19 incidence is analyzed using Geodetector; the impact of effective factors and interaction terms on COVID-19 is simulated with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The results find that mean temperature (MeanT), Destination proportion in population flow from Wuhan (WH), Migration scale (MS), and WH*MeanT, are generally promoting for COVID-19 incidence before Wuhans shutdown (T1); the WH and MeanT play a determinant role in the disease spread in T1. The effect of environment on COVID-19 incidence after Wuhans shutdown (T2) includes more factors (including relative humidity, precipitation, travel intensity within a city (TC), and their interactive terms) than T1, and their effect shows distinct spatial heterogeneity. Interestingly, the dividing line of positive-negative effect of MeanT and Pre on COVID-19 incidence is 8.5C and 1mm, respectively. In T2, WH has weak impact, but the MS has the strongest effect. The COVID-19 incidence in T2 without quarantine is also modeled using the developed GWR model, and the modeled incidence shows an obvious increase for 75.6% cities compared with reported incidence in T2 especially for some mega cities. This evidences national quarantine and traffic control take determinant role in controlling the disease spread. The study indicates that both natural environment and human factors integratedly affect the spread pattern of COVID-19 in China.","output":"Natural and human environment interactively drive spread pattern of COVID-19: a city-level modeling study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extreme weather events present significant global threats to health.

Political influences on outbreak preparedness, response and reporting may also adversely affect control of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Syria reported its first case on 22 March 2020; however, concerns were raised that this was delayed and that underreporting continues. DISCUSSION: Syria's conflict has displaced more than half of its pre-war population, leaving 6.7 million people internally displaced. The consequent overcrowding - with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare (including laboratory capacity) - could lead to conditions that are ideal for spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria's borders, each with its own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation, with little interaction between them, could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity), leading to high deaths across the population, particularly for the most vulnerable such as detainees. CONCLUSIONS: Locally implementable interventions that rapidly build WASH and health system capacity are required across Syria to ensure early detection and management of COVID-19 cases.","output":"Coronavirus 2019 and health systems affected by protracted conflict: The case of Syria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to its geographical condition and geophysical location Bangladesh is one of the worlds most vulnerable country, which will become more vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

Bleeding complications remain feared and frequent, with high morbidity and increased mortality. Yet, data about trends, and in-hospital outcomes, have been poorly investigated.Methods: The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry database was explored for patients who received veno-venous (V-V) and veno-arterial (V-A) ECLS between the years 2000 and 2020. Trends in bleeding complications and mortality were analyzed. Bleeding complications were classified according to site (gastro-intestinal, cannulation site, surgical site, pulmonary, tamponade and central nervous system) and analyzed separately. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk factors for bleeding complications.Results: ELSO database analysis included 53.644 patients with single ECLS runs, mean age 51.4 15.9 years, 33.859 (64.5%) male. Study cohort included 19.748 patients cannulated for V-V ECLS and 30.696 patients for V-A ECLS. Bleeding complications were reported in 14.786 patients (27.6%) and occurred more often in V-A-modalities compared to V-V modalities (30.0% versus 21.9%, p<0.001). Patients with a bleeding complication had a lower hospital survival in the V-V ECLS (49.6% versus 66.6%, p<0.001) and V-A ECLS subgroup (33.9 versus 44.9%, p<0.001). Bleeding complications in V-V ECLS and V-A ECLS have been decreasing over the past two decades with coefficient of -1.124;P<0.001 and -1.661;P<0.001, respectively. Cannulation site bleeding and surgical site bleeding rates showed the highest negative trend in both V-V and V-A ECLS patients. No change in mortality rates over time in V-V or V-A ECLS patients (coef.: -0.147;P=0.442 and coef.: -0.195;P=0.139) was observed. For V-V ECLS supported patients, multivariate regression revealed the following independent association with bleeding: advanced age, ECLS duration, surgical cannulation, pre-ECLS support with cardiopulmonary bypass, renal replacement therapy, prone positioning, vasodilatory and anti-hypotensive agents. For V-A ECLS supported patients, predictors for bleeding included: female gender, ECLS duration, pre-ECLS arrest or bridge to transplant, therapeutic hypothermia, surgical cannulation and pre-ECLS support with cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular assist devices, cardiac pacemakers, vasodilatory and anti-hypotensive agents.Conclusions: The steady decrease in particular cannulation and surgical site related bleeding complications over the past 20 years suggests advances in equipment development (membrane and tubes surfaces) as well as better understanding of anticoagulation management. However, the high incidence of bleeding and association with hospital mortality reinforces the need for studies to understand bleeding complications more thoroughly during ECLS.Funding Information: No funding.Declaration of Interests: Prof. Dr. Lorusso is a consultant for Medtronic, Getinge and LivaNova and medical advisory board member for EUROSETS, all unrelated to this work;all honoraria to the university for research funding.

METHODS: Prospective nationwide study including a consecutive cohort of liver transplant patients with Covid-19 recruited during the Spanish outbreak from February 28th to April 7th, 2020. The primary outcome was severe Covid-19, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and/or death. Age- and gender-standardized incidence and mortality ratios (SIR and SMR) were calculated using data from the Ministry of Health and the Spanish liver transplant registry. Independent predictors of severe Covid-19 among hospitalized patients were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 111 liver transplant patients were diagnosed with Covid-19 (SIR=191.2 [95%CI 190.3-192.2]). The epidemiological curve and geographic distribution overlapped widely between liver transplant and general populations. After a median follow-up of 23 days, 96 patients (86.5%) were admitted to hospital and 22 patients (19.8%) required respiratory support. Twelve patients were admitted to the ICU (10.8%). The mortality rate was 18%, being lower compared to the matched general population (SMR=95.5 [95%CI 94.2-96.8]). Thirty-five patients (31.5%) met criteria of severe Covid-19. Baseline immunosuppression containing mycophenolate was an independent predictor of severe Covid-19 (RR=3.94; 95%CI 1.59-9.74; p=0.003), particularly at doses higher than 1,000 mg/day (p=0.003). This deleterious effect was not observed with calcineurin inhibitors or everolimus and complete immunosuppression withdrawal showed no benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Being chronically immunosuppressed, liver transplant patients have an increased risk of acquiring Covid-19 but their mortality rates are lower than matched general population. Upon hospital admission, mycophenolate dose reduction or withdrawal could help in preventing severe Covid-19. However, complete immunosuppression withdrawal should be discouraged.","output":"Epidemiological pattern, incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in liver transplant patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case of a pregnant woman suffering from COVID\\\\19 is presented, who developed coagulopathy in the absence of severe clinical symptoms.

The existing literature is limited. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. METHODS: Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray, and procedures were performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson's correlation for comparison of analytic methods. RESULTS: All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m and 1,695 at 4 m.

METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, cohort study was conducted in Luoyang, Henan province, China from January 2018 to January 2020. Children (<18 years) with influenza-associated neurological disease were enrolled in the study. Children with indications for CBP and parental consent received CBP (Continuous Blood purification), while others received maximal intensive care treatment because of the absence of parental consent. The outcomes of the CBP and non-CBP groups were compared. Categorical variables were presented as percentage and compared by Chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile ranges) and compared with non-parametric independent sample test. Statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS (version 26.0) and p < 0.05 (2 tailed) was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: 30 children with influenza-associated neurological disease were recruited to the study. 18 received CBP and the other 12 received maximal intensive care. There were no differences between CBP and non-CBP children in age, sex, body weight, type of influenza virus, neurological complications, Glasgow score, PIM-2 score and PCIS at admission (p > 0.05). The inflammatory factors (CRP, PCT and IL-6) of 30 cases were tested at admission and after 3 days of admission. In the CBP group, there was a significant decrease in IL-6 levels at 3 days of admission (p = 0.003) and a decrease in CRP and PCT levels, but no significant difference (p > 0.05).

Because the role of APA and AS in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains unknown, we performed de novo identification of dynamic APA sites using a public dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA-Seq data in COVID-19 patients. We found that genes with APA were enriched in innate immunity -related gene ontology categories such as neutrophil activation, regulation of the MAPK cascade and cytokine production, response to interferon-gamma and the innate immune response. We also reported genome-wide AS events and enriched viral transcription-related categories upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

STI-9167 has potent, broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against the current SARS-COV-2 variants of concern and retained activity against the Omicron and Omicron + R346K variants in both pseudotype and live virus neutralization assays. Furthermore, STI-9167 nAb administered intranasally or intravenously provided protection against weight loss and reduced virus lung titers to levels below the limit of quantitation in Omicron-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. With this established activity profile, a cGMP cell line has been developed and used to produce cGMP drug product intended for use in human clinical trials.","output":"Discovery of a SARS-CoV-2 Broadly-Acting Neutralizing Antibody with Activity against Omicron and Omicron + R346K Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. It appears that development of cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia precipitates progression to ARDS. However, severity scores on admission do not predict severity or mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Our objective was to determine whether patients with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS are clinically distinct, therefore requiring alternative management strategies, compared with other patients with ARDS. We report a single-centre retrospective study comparing the characteristics and outcomes of patients with ARDS with and without SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Two intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts of patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham were analysed: SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted between 11 March and 21 April 2020 and all patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from bacterial or viral infection who developed ARDS between 1 January 2017 and 1 November 2019. All data were routinely collected on the hospitals electronic patient records. RESULTS: A greater proportion of SARS-CoV-2 patients were from an Asian ethnic group (p=0.002). SARS-CoV-2 patients had lower circulating leucocytes, neutrophils and monocytes (p<0.0001), but higher CRP (p=0.016) on ICU admission. SARS-CoV-2 patients required a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (p=0.01), but had lower vasopressor requirements (p=0.016). DISCUSSION: The clinical syndromes and respiratory mechanics of SARS-CoV-2 and CAP-ARDS are broadly similar. However, SARS-CoV-2 patients initially have a lower requirement for vasopressor support, fewer circulating leukocytes and require prolonged ventilation support. Further studies are required to determine whether the dysregulated inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS may contribute to the increased duration of respiratory failure.","output":"Characterisation and outcomes of ARDS secondary to pneumonia in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2: a single-centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing is an efficient public health practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, more than seventeen million confirmed cases and more than half a million died worldwide from COVID-19. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to contracting this disease and presenting more complications. We did a literature search on the association of cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 in databases such as Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. The purpose of this review is to provide updated information for health professionals who care for patients with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease, given that they have a high risk of complications and mortality. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers is controversial, and there is no evidence not to use these medications in patients with COVID-19. Regarding treatment with hydroxychloroquine associated or not with azithromycin, there is evidence of a higher risk with its use than clinical benefit and decreased mortality. Likewise, patients with heart failure are an important risk group due to their condition per se. Patients with heart failure and COVID-19 are a diagnostic dilemma because the signs of acute heart failure could be masked. On the other hand, in patients with acute coronary syndrome, the initial therapeutic approach could change in the context of the pandemic, although only based on expert opinions.

Their primary structure is characterised by an N-terminal, triple-helical collagenous region made up of Gly-X-Y repeats, an a-helical coiled-coil trimerising neck region, and a C-terminal C-type lectin or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Further oligomerisation of this primary structure can give rise to more complex and multimeric structures that can be seen under electron microscope. Collectins can be found in serum as well as in a range of tissues at the mucosal surfaces. Mannanbinding lectin can activate the complement system while other members of the collectin family are extremely versatile in recognising a diverse range of pathogens via their CRDs and bring about effector functions designed at the clearance of invading pathogens. These mechanisms include opsonisation, enhancement of phagocytosis, triggering superoxidative burst and nitric oxide production. Collectins can also potentiate the adaptive immune response via antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells through modulation of cytokines and chemokines, thus they can act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity.

Our results showed that extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli accounted for 47% of the cases, while 62% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. ESBL-producing and MDR isolates showed high incidences of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, but they displayed susceptibility to carbapenems, -lactamase inhibitors, and aminoglycosides.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA LS has generally been associated with lower rates of postoperative complications than OS. However, evidence mainly comes from small studies that failed to adjust for the confounding effects of the underlying indication or clinical condition that may have favored the use of one technique over the other. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing splenectomy in 2008 and 2009 using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (n = 1781). Retrieved data included 30-day mortality and morbidity (cardiac, respiratory, central nervous system, renal, wound, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding outcomes), demographics, indication, and preoperative risk factors. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the adjusted effect of the splenectomy technique on outcomes. RESULTS A total of 874 (49.1%) cases had LS and 907 (50.9%) had OS. After adjusting for all potential confounders including the indication and preoperative risk factors, LS was associated with decreased 30-day mortality [OR (odds ratio): 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18-0.84] and postoperative respiratory occurrences (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.76), wound occurrences (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.11-0.79), and sepsis (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.26-0.89) when compared with OS. Patients who underwent LS also had a significantly shorter total length of hospital stay and were less likely to receive intraoperative transfusions compared with patients who underwent OS.

We initiated the boarding restriction protocol that limits ED length of stay (LOS) for patients awaiting hospitalization to 24 hours from arrival. This study aimed to determine the effect of the protocol on ED crowding. Method This was a pre-post comparative study to compare ED crowding before and after protocol implementation. The primary outcome was the red stage fraction with more than 71 occupying patients in the ED (severe crowding level). LOS in the ED, treatment time and boarding time were compared. Additionally, the pattern of boarding patients staying in the ED according to the day of the week was confirmed. Results Analysis of the number of occupying patients in the ED, measured at 10-minute intervals, indicated a decrease from 65.0 (51.0-79.0) to 55.0 (43.0-65.0) in the pre- and post-periods, respectively (p<0.0001). The red stage fraction decreased from 38.9% to 15.1% of the pre- and post-periods, respectively (p<0.0001). The proportion beyond the goal of this protocol of 24 hours decreased from 7.6% to 4.0% (p<0.0001). The ED LOS of all patients was similar: 238.2 (134.0-465.2) and 238.3 (136.9-451.2) minutes in the pre- and post-periods, respectively. In admitted patients, ED LOS decreased from 770.7 (421.4-1587.1) to 630.2 (398.0-1156.8) minutes (p<0.0001); treatment time increased from 319.6 (198.5-482.8) to 344.7 (213.4-519.5) minutes (p<0.0001); and boarding time decreased from 298.9 (109.5-1149.0) to 204.1 (98.7-545.7) minutes (p<0.0001). In the pre-period, boarding patients accumulated in the ED on weekdays, with the accumulation resolved on Fridays; this pattern was alleviated in the post-period. Conclusions The protocol effectively resolved excessive ED crowding by alleviating the accumulation of boarding patients in the ED on weekdays.

In the case of visual occlusion, whether the loss of information in images could be recovered and thus perceptually closed affects object recognition. In particular, many elderly subjects have defects in object recognition ability, which may be closely related to the abnormalities of perceptual functions. This phenomenon even can be observed in the early stage of dementia. Therefore, studying the neural mechanism of perceptual closure and its relationship with sensory and cognitive processing is important for understanding how the human brain recognizes objects, inspiring the development of neuromorphic intelligent algorithms of object recognition. In this study, a new experiment was designed to explore the realistic process of perceptual closure under occlusion and intact conditions of faces and building. The analysis of the differences in ERP components P1, N1, and Ncl indicated that the subjective awareness of perceptual closure mainly occurs in Ncl, but incomplete information has been processed and showed different manners compared to complete stimuli in N170 for facial materials. Although occluded, faces, but not buildings, still maintain the specificity of perceptual processing. The Ncl by faces and buildings did not show significant differences in both amplitude and latency, suggesting a completing process regardless of categorical features.","output":"The Time Course of Perceptual Closure of Incomplete Visual Objects: An Event-Related Potential Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to prospectively assess the lung fibrotic-like changes, as well as to explore their predictive factors, in the patients who survived Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In this prospective cross-sectional study, we recruited patients who had been treated for moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia as inpatients and discharged from Rohani hospital in Babol, northern Iran, during March 2020. The clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was classified as per the definition by World Health Organization. We also calculated the CT severity score (CSS) for all patients at admission. Within the 3 months of follow-up, the next chest CT scan was performed. As the secondary outcome, the patients with fibrotic abnormalities in their second CT scan were followed up in the next 3 months. RESULTS: Totally, 173 COVID-19 patients were finally included in the study, of whom 57 (32.9%) were male and others were female. The mean age was 53.62  13.67 years old. At 3-month CT follow-up, evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was observed in 90 patients (52.0%). Consolidation (odds ratio [OR] = 2.84), severe disease (OR 2.40), and a higher CSS (OR 1.10) at admission were associated with increased risk of fibrotic abnormalities found at 3-month CT follow-up. Of 62 patients who underwent chest CT scan again at 6 months of follow-up, 41 patients (66.1%) showed no considerable changes in the fibrotic findings, while the rest of 21 patients (33.9%) showed relatively diminished lung fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Post-COVID-19 lung fibrosis was observed in about half of the survivors. Also, patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were at a higher risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, consolidation, as well as a higher CSS, in the initial chest CT scan, was associated with increased risk of post-COVID-19 lung fibrosis.

However, the adverse event (AE) profiles of oral glucocorticoids, which result largely from the systemic absorption of those agents, have engendered concerns about the safety of INSs. These concerns persist for INSs despite significant or marked clinical differences between them and systemic corticosteroids in systemic absorption and among the INSs in bioavailability, mechanism of action, and lipophilicity, which may contribute to differences in AEs. For example, the systemic bioavailability of the INSs as a percentage of the administered drug is less than 0.1% for mometasone furoate, less than 1% for fluticasone propionate, 46% for triamcinolone acetonide, and 44% for beclomethasone dipropionate. A review of the safety profiles of INSs, as reported in clinical trials in acute and chronic RS and allergic rhinitis, shows primarily local AEs (eg, epistaxis and headache) that are generally classified as mild to moderate, with occurrence rates that are similar to those with placebo. Studies of the safety of mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide did not identify any evidence of systemic AEs, such as growth retardation in children due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone mineral density loss, or cataracts, which suggests that INSs can be safely administered in patients with acute RS without concern for systemic AEs.","output":"Safety of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The currently-used modes of administration of immunotherapeutic agents result in their limited delivery to the lymph nodes and/or require repetitive ultrasound-guided nodal injections or microsurgical lymphatic injections, limiting their feasibility. Here, we report on the feasibility and safety of a new method of long-term repetitive intralymphatic (IL) infusion of immune cells, using implantable delivery ports. METHODS Nine patients with stage IV recurrent colorectal cancer underwent complete resection and received autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with killed autologous tumor cells, KLH and PADRE, for up to four monthly cycles. Leg lymphatic vessels were cannulated, connected to 6.6Fr low-profile implantable subcutaneous delivery ports, and used to infuse 12 doses of DC over each 72 h-long cycle (every 6 h), followed by heparin flushes of the cannula-port system (one 72 h-long cycle per month). The patients who opted for alternative route of vaccine administration (2 patients) or whose ports became non-functional between cycles, continued treatment via intranodal (one injection/cycle) or intradermal (four injections/cycle) routes. RESULTS A total of nine lymphatic cannulations and implantations of subcutaneous delivery ports were attempted in seven patients, with a success rate of eight out of nine (89 %). The average patency of the IL delivery system was 7.5 (3.2) weeks. All six patients with IL ports successfully completed at least one complete 72 h-long DC infusion cycle (12 injections). Five patients (56 %) completed two full IL cycles (24 IL injections). No patients received more than two IL cycles without replacement of the IL port, due to catheter occlusion and/or local side effects: cellulitis and hematoma. Intranodal and intradermal backup options were used in, respectively, one and two patients. Overall cohort survival was >28 (25) months. One patient with aggressive recurrent carcinomatosis, who received DC vaccines by intranodal route is alive at > 90 months, without evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that an intermediate-duration IL delivery of multiple doses of immunotherapeutic factors using implantable delivery ports is feasible, highly-tolerable and can be reproducibly performed in cancer patients to administer immune cells, or potentially, other immune factors. However, long-term IL port placement (>7.5 weeks), is not a currently-feasible option.

This review describes the history, mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic applications, and safety profile of hydroxychloroquine as an immunomodulatory and antiviral agent. It also summarizes the major studies that launched and assessed the use of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: More recent literature calls into question the long-held dogma that endolysosomal alkalinization is the primary mode of action of hydroxychloroquine. Ongoing uncertainty about the multiple potential mechanisms contributing to the therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatic and viral disease led to a natural avenue for exploration in the treatment of COVID-19. Taken as a whole, the literature does not support utilizing hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is, at least in part, due to the wide variability in hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics between patients and difficulty achieving adequate target tissue concentrations of hydroxychloroquine without encountering unacceptable toxicities. Hydroxychloroquine continues to be a routinely prescribed, well-tolerated, effective, and low-cost treatment for rheumatic disease. Its therapeutic versatility has led to frequent repurposing for other conditions, most recently as an investigative treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

PATIENTS We performed the SPA-LAVH in 24 patients from May 6, 2008, through October 8, 2008. INTERVENTIONS All cases of SPA-LAVH were performed by a single surgeon (T. J. K.). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We analyzed the data to determine the outcome of SPA-LAVH and compared the initial 10 cases (group A) and the latter 14 cases (group B) to consider the learning curve. Median and range are used to describe non-normal data. A total of 24 consecutive patients have undergone SPA-LAVH, for benign gynecologic conditions, including 16 uterine myomas and 8 cases of adenomyosis, regardless of body mass index or previous abdominal or pelvic surgery. All cases but 3 were performed exclusively through a single port. The median operative time, weight of the uterus, and estimated blood loss were 119 minutes (range 90 to 255 minutes), 347 g (range 225 to 732 g), and 400 mL (range 100 to 1000 mL), respectively. The decline in hemoglobin from before surgery to postoperative day 1 was from 0.7 to 4.3 g/dL, with a median of 2.05 g/dL. The median hospital stay (postoperative day) was 3 days (range 3 to 7).

Therefore, little is known about its possible causes, presentation and management. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature in MEDLINE, PubMed Central and EMBASE databases between 1990 and 2020 was carried out to identify all cases of BEF. The initial database search identified 19,452 articles, of which 183 (251 individual patient cases) were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Main causes of BEF were congenital malformations (97/251, 38.7%) and infections (82/251, 32.7%), while 33/251 (13.1%) fistulae were regarded as idiopathic and 39/251 (15.5%) attributed to other causes. Esophagograpy was the most sensitive method of diagnosis (97.4%) compared with esophagoscopy (78.9%), computed tomography (49.6%) and bronchoscopy (46.0%). Definitive treatment was surgical for 176 patients (70%), endoscopic for 25 (10%) and medical for 37 (14.7%). Compared with congenital BEFs, infective BEFs had shorter median symptom duration and were distributed more proximally over the bronchial tree. Definitive treatment was almost only surgical for congenital BEFs, while infective BEFs were treated also endoscopically (12%) and by medical therapy (38%). Morbidity, treatment failure and recurrence rates were higher for infective BEFs. CONCLUSIONS: BEFs are rare. Symptoms are non-specific and a high index of suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Patients with infective BEF tend to have a more severe clinical picture than those with congenital BEF. Surgery is the main treatment for patients affected by congenital BEF, while infective BEFs may heal conservatively.","output":"Adult Benign, Non-Iatrogenic Bronchoesophageal Fistulae: Systematic Review and Descriptive Analysis of Individual Patient Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 poses unique challenges to family caregivers. This study explores how family caregivers for older adults with cognitive impairments experience and make decisions about caregiving during a global pandemic. Using purposive sampling, 63 family caregivers across eight states participated in open-ended qualitative interviews (2019-2020), until thematic saturation was reached. Questions broadly examined caregivers experiences and decisions, focusing on decisions made around type of care setting. Questions about responses to the Pandemic were added as events unfolded. States were selected to represent variation in Home and Community Based Service (HCBS) expenditures as a percentage of total Medicaid long-term services and supports expenditures. Family caregivers experienced significant concern about COVID-19 itself, and about the indirect consequences of caregiving caused by the pandemic. Caregivers also displayed flexibility and adaptability in ceasing selected services, contingently continuing services, and utilizing telemedicine and other remote healthcare interventions to protect their loved ones. Many family caregivers utilized remote health care tools such telemedicine, no-contact prescription and grocery delivery. Such measures improved service access and reduced caregiver workload. Given the persistent challenges posed by COVID-19, long-term service organizations have an opportunity to enhance their policies to meet the needs of caregivers and those they care for. There is a need to expand telemedicine and other remote healthcare tools, while adapting these technologies to the needs of families. Also, procedures are needed for safe pathways to utilize HCBS and nursing care during a pandemic including communication supports, sufficient PPE, increased staffing, and utilization of evidence-based protocols.","output":"Caregiving During COVID-19: A Multi-State Qualitative Study of Family Caregiver Experiences and Decision Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much has been written about matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in health and disease conditions, but their roles in the setting of COVID-19 and associated illnesses remain understudied [...].","output":"Matrix Metalloproteinases in Health and Disease in the Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Closed incision negative pressure wound therapy (ciNPWT) may reduce surgical site complications following total joint arthroplasty. Although unlikely necessary for all patients, the criteria for utilizing ciNPWT in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain poorly defined. This study's purpose was to compare the incidence of incisional wound complications, non-incisional complications (ie, dressing reactions), reoperations, and periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) among a group of high-risk primary TKA patients treated with ciNPWT vs an occlusive silver impregnated dressing. METHODS One hundred thirty high-risk primary TKA patients treated with ciNPWT were 1:1 propensity matched and compared to a historical control group treated with an occlusive silver impregnated dressing. High-risk criteria included the following: active tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, body mass index >35 kg/m2, autoimmune disease, chronic kidney disease, Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization, and non-aspirin anticoagulation. RESULTS Age, gender, and risk factor profile were comparable between cohorts. The ciNPWT cohort had significantly fewer incisional wound complications (6.9% vs 16.2%; P = .031) and significantly more non-incisional complications (16.9% vs 1.5%; P < .001). No dressing reactions required clinical intervention. There were no differences in reoperations or periprosthetic joint infections (P = 1.000). In multivariate analysis, occlusive silver impregnated dressings (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3-6.8, P = .012) and non-aspirin anticoagulation (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6, P = .028) were associated with the development of incisional wound complications. CONCLUSION Among high-risk patients undergoing primary TKA, ciNPWT decreased incisional wound complications when compared to occlusive silver impregnated dressings, particularly among those receiving non-aspirin anticoagulation.

Advances in photoplethysmography (PPG) and rPPG methods have enabled the development of contact and noncontact approaches for continuous monitoring and collection of patient health data. The contagious nature of viruses such as COVID-19 warrants noncontact methods for physiological signal estimation. However, these approaches are subject to estimation biases due to variations in environmental conditions and subject demographics. The performance of contact-based wearable sensors has been evaluated, using off-the-shelf devices across demographics. However, the measurement uncertainty of rPPG methods that estimate pulse rate has not been sufficiently tested across diverse demographic populations or environments. Quantifying the efficacy of rPPG methods in real-world conditions is critical in determining their potential viability as health monitoring solutions. Currently, publicly available face datasets accompanied by physiological measurements are typically captured in controlled laboratory settings, lacking diversity in subject skin tones, age, and cultural artifacts (e.g, bindi worn by Indian women). In this study, we collect pulse rate and facial video data from human subjects in India and Sierra Leone, in order to quantify the uncertainty in noncontact pulse rate estimation methods. The video data are used to estimate pulse rate using state-of-the-art rPPG camera-based methods, and compared against ground truth measurements captured using an FDA-approved contact-based pulse rate measurement device. Our study reveals that rPPG methods exhibit similar biases when compared with a contact-based device across demographic groups and environmental conditions. The mean difference between pulse rates measured by rPPG methods and the ground truth is found to be ~2% (1 beats per minute (b.p.m.)), signifying agreement of rPPG methods with the ground truth. We also find that rPPG methods show pulse rate variability of ~15% (11 b.p.m.), as compared to the ground truth. We investigate factors impacting rPPG methods and discuss solutions aimed at mitigating variance.","output":"Evaluation of biases in remote photoplethysmography methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There have been several reports of secondary anemia associated with Graves disease. There are no reports of secondary anemia resulting from thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis (silent thyroiditis). We report the case of a patient with pancreatic diabetes who developed anemia caused by thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 37-year-old man who visited the hospital complaining of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea. His hemoglobin was 110 g/l (reference range, 135C176), and mean corpuscular volume was 81.5 fl (81.7C101.6). His free thyroxine (FT4) was high, at 100.4 pmol/l (11.6C21.9); the free triiodothyronine (FT3) was high, at 27.49 pmol/l (3.53C6.14); TSH was low, at < 0.01 mIU/l (0.50C5.00); and TSH receptor antibody was negative. Soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was high, at 1340 U/ml (122C496); C-reactive protein (CRP) was high, at 6900 g/l (< 3000); and reticulocytes was high, at 108 10(9) /l (30C100).

We investigated the impact of COVID-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, their families, caregivers, and medical experts. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide ALS webinar about COVID-19 in May 2020 and sent a questionnaire to those enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 135 participants (31 ALS patients; 23 families and caregivers of ALS patients; 81 medical experts) responded to this cross-sectional self-report questionnaire. The results showed that tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) was used in 22.6% of ALS patients, whereas 77.4% of ALS patients were not under TIV. Among non-TIV patients (n=24), 79.2% did not want TIV in the future. However, 47.4% of non-TIV patients not wanting a tracheostomy in advanced stages replied that they would want an emergency tracheostomy if they developed COVID-19-related pneumonia. These results suggest that ALS patients may be receptive to emergency treatments for reasons other than ALS. In addition, approximately half of the ALS patients agreed with the policy of not ventilating the elderly or ALS patients in case of a ventilator shortage. Furthermore, compared with medical experts, few ALS patients reported that the chance for ALS patients to obtain work was higher due to the increasing availability of remote work. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with increased distress about access to care and work, inducing contradictory responses and potential hopelessness among ALS patients.","output":"Contradictory Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients and Their Families and Caregivers in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated public health measures that have impacted the provision of care for people living with dementia and their families.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-) is an important component of this response, and we show that SINV-infected differentiated neurons respond to IFN- in vitro by induction of antiviral genes and suppression of virus replication. To determine the in vivo effects of IFN- on SINV clearance and T cell responses, C57BL/6 mice lacking IFN- or IFN- receptor-1 were compared to wild-type (WT) mice after intracranial SINV infection. In WT mice, IFN- was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Mice with impaired IFN- signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8(+) T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8(+) tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN- suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8(+) T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8(+) T(RM) cell establishment.","output":"Interferon-Gamma Modulation of the Local T Cell Response to Alphavirus Encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome-wide association studies have recently identified 3p21.31, with lead variant pointing to the CXCR6 gene, as the strongest thus far reported susceptibility risk locus for severe manifestation of COVID-19.

Initial Ct values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR tests were recorded. 22.9 was the 50th percentile Ct value of the study population. The study population was divided into two groups based on their Ct values: (1) Cases with Higher Ct values (Ct > 22.9)(n = 50) and (2) Cases with lower Ct values (Ct &#8804; 22.9)(n = 55). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, disease progression, laboratory test results and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the performance of Ct values in predicting obstetric complications. RESULTS: Obstetric complication rate was significantly higher in cases with lower Ct values (p < .001). A significantly lower lymphocyte count together with higher ESR, procalcitonin and IL-6 values were observed in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). Additionally, a significantly higher NICU admission rate and longer hospital stays were present in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). The value in ROC curves with the best balance of sensitivity/specificity was 22.5 (85.7% sensitivity, 63.6% specificity).

METHODS: Anonymous online survey study. RESULTS: 192 junior doctors were invited to participate in the study. Fifty-four responded, and only those who had worked whilst unwell with an acute respiratory illness were included, providing a total number of fifty responses. Of these, 72% believed they were infectious at the time they worked whilst unwell. 86% of respondents did not feel supported by the workplace to take sick leave when they were unwell, and 96% identified concerns about burdening colleagues with extra workload and lack of available cover as the main deterrents to accessing sick leave. CONCLUSION: Junior doctors at our health service, pre-COVID-19, do not widely feel empowered to take sick leave when they have an acute respiratory illness. Junior doctors are primarily concerned about burdening their colleagues with extra workloads in an environment where they perceive there to be a lack of available cover.

This narrative review intends to offer a new and organic perspective over clinical aspects of TOLAC and VBAC risk management.","output":"Risk management of vaginal birth after cesarean section (Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has heavily impacted not only the health sector, but also the economic sector in general. Many countries have projected a negative economic impact, and the effect on micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) is predicted to be significantly large. This study estimated the regional resistance of MSME sales revenues and identified the regional economic factors that affect resistance by analyzing South Korea, a country with one of the lowest economic impact projections from COVID-19. Resistance was estimated by comparing sales revenues and changes in resistance observed during the early COVID-19 period to those recorded in the same weeks (weeks 6 to 9) of 2019. The factors that affect regional resistance were determined by conducting robust regression and spatial regression analyses. The results show that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, a direct risk factor, is negatively related to regional resilience, while diversity is positively related to regional resistance. To improve the regional resistance against uncertain events, this study recommends increased diversity among regional industrial structures to reduce the duration of the early shock of an unexpected adverse event.","output":"A Regional Economys Resistance to the COVID-19 Shock: Sales Revenues of Micro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized Enterprises in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The masked palm civet is distributed through south\\\\east Asia, China and the Himalayas. Because of its potential role in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, it has become important to gather information on this species, and notably to provide a tool to determine the origin of farm and market animals. For this purpose, we studied the genetic variability and the phylogeographic pattern of the masked palm civet Paguma larvata. First, two portions of mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and the control region, were sequenced for a total of 76 individuals sampled from China, the Indochinese region and the Sundaic region. Results indicated a low genetic variability and suggested a lack of a phylogeographic structure in this species, which do not allow inferring the geographic origin of samples of unknown origin, although it is possible to distinguish individuals from China and the Sundaic region. This low variation is in contrast to the well\\\\marked morphological differentiation between the populations in the Sundaic and ChineseCIndochinese regions. We also used five microsatellite loci to genotype 149 samples from two wild and four farmed populations in China, where the masked palm civet is farmed and where the SARS coronavirus was isolated.

Circulating biomarkers that can evaluate inflammation and immune status are potentially useful in diagnosing and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Even more so when they are a part of the routine evaluation, chest CT could have even higher diagnostic accuracy than RT-PCT alone in a suggestive clinical context. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), and eosinophils with the severity of CT lesions in patients with COVID-19. The second objective was to seek a statically significant cut-off value for NLR and PLR that could suggest COVID-19. Correlation of both NLR and PLR with already established inflammatory markers such as CRP, ESR, and those specific for COVID-19 (ferritin, D-dimers, and eosinophils) were also evaluated. One hundred forty-nine patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and 149 age-matched control were evaluated through blood tests, and COVID-19 patients had thorax CT performed. Both NLR and PLR correlated positive chest CT scan severity. Both NLR and PLR correlated positive chest CT scan severity. When NLR value is below 5.04, CT score is lower than 3 with a probability of 94%, while when NLR is higher than 5.04, the probability of severe CT changes is only 50%. For eosinophils, a value of 0.35% corresponds to chest CT severity of 2 (Se = 0.88, Sp = 0.43, AUC = 0.661, 95% CI (0.544; 0.779), p = 0.021. NLR and PLR had significantly higher values in COVID-19 patients. In our study a NLR = 2.90 and PLR = 186 have a good specificity (0.89, p = 0.001, respectively 0.92, p<0.001). Higher levels in NLR, PLR should prompt the clinician to prescribe a thorax CT as it could reveal important lesions that could influence the patient's future management.","output":"Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelets-to-lymphocyte ratio, and eosinophils correlation with high-resolution computer tomography severity score in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that dispense methadone got a fast and clear reprieve from federal authorities last week in the face of COVID\\\\19.

In this study, we demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein is an important immunogenic site in patients with SARS and rabbits immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Serum samples from convalescent SARS patients and immunized rabbits had potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein. Depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by immunoadsorption significantly reduced serum-mediated neutralizing activity, while affinity-purified anti-RBD antibodies had relatively higher potency neutralizing infectivity of SARS pseudovirus, indicating that the RBD of S protein is a critical neutralization determinant of SARS-CoV during viral infection and immunization. Two monoclonal antibodies (1A5 and 2C5) targeting at the RBD of S protein were isolated from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Both 1A5 and 2C5 possessed potent neutralizing activities, although they directed against distinct conformation-dependant epitopes as shown by ELISA and binding competition assay. We further demonstrated that 2C5, but not 1A5, was able to block binding of the RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor on targeted cells.

The potential for disasters to act as \\"focusing events\\" for policy change, including adaptation to climate change risk, is well known. Moreover, local action is an important element of climate change adaptation and related risk management efforts. As such, there is a good reason to expect local communities to mobilize in response to disaster events, both with immediate response and recovery-focused activities, as well as longer-term preparedness and adaptation-focused public policy changes. However, scholars also note that the experience of disaster does not always yield policy change; indeed, disasters can also result in policy inertia and failure, perhaps as often or more often than major policy change. This study poses two key research questions. First, we ask to what degree policy change occurs in communities impacted by an extreme weather event. Second, we seek to understand the conditions that lead to adaptation-oriented policy adoption in response to an extreme weather event. Our results suggest two main recipes for future-oriented policy adoption in the wake of an extreme weather event. For both recipes, a high-impact event is a necessary condition for future-oriented policy adoption. In the first recipe for change, policy adoption occurs in Democratic communities with highly focused media attention. The second, less expected recipe for change involves Republican communities that have experienced other uncommon weather events in the recent past. We use a comparative case approach with 15 cases and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis methods. Our approach adds to the existing literature on policy change and local adaptation by selecting a mid-N range of cases where extreme weather events have the potential to act as focusing events, thereby sidestepping selection on the dependent variable.

METHODS: In this review we searched databases including Medline and google scholar for research articles published between January 2020 and January 2022. We included case reports, case series, cross sectional, cohort, and randomized control trials that reported the duration of shedding of viable SARS-CoV-2 virus. After evaluating the criteria for inclusion, 32 articles (2721 patients) were included. RESULT: This review showed that the median for the last day of successful viral isolation was 11 (8.5C14.5 95% CI) , 20 (9.0C57.5 95 %CI), 20 (9.0C103 95 %CI) for the general population, critical patients and immunocompromised individuals, respectively, with significant association between prolonged viral shedding, disease severity (P-Value 0.024) and immunosuppressive status (P-Value 0.023). The corresponding higher cutoff of CTv to culturable virus ranged between 26.25 and 34.00 (95% confidence interval) with median of 30.5, and higher values were observed when critical (25.0C37.37 95 %CI) and immunocompromised patients (20.0C37.82 95 %CI) have been excluded, this deviation did not represent a statistical significance (P-Value 0.997 and 0.888) respectively.

Our finding in the review also opposes the most recent CDC Guidance on shortening isolation duration in term of the last days of viable transmissible virus, therefore caution should be considered when revising such protocols.","output":"Duration of viable SARS-CoV-2 shedding from respiratory tract in different human hosts and its impact on isolation discontinuation polices revision; a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Zinc is an essential trace element that has been implicated in numerous biological functions, including immunity, energy metabolism and antioxidative processes. Recent evaluations of the literature have provided evidence of significant acute changes in zinc metabolism following a bout of aerobic exercise. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the zinc status of trained athletes compared with control populations, as described in cross-sectional studies. DESIGN We conducted a systematic literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Library electronic databases from inception to 28 January 2016 to identify cross-sectional studies that determined the zinc status of athletes compared with a control population. Meta-analysis of the differences in serum zinc concentration and dietary zinc intake between groups were conducted. RESULTS Twelve studies were included in the systematic review. Of the included studies, nine and eight studies provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis of serum zinc concentration and dietary zinc intake, respectively. Serum zinc concentration was significantly lower in athletes [- 0.93 mol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.62 to - 0.23] despite significantly higher dietary zinc intake compared with the control population (2.57 mg/day, 95% CI 0.97-4.16). Data on erythrocyte and urinary zinc from the included studies were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Despite higher total dietary zinc intake, athletes generally have lower serum zinc concentration, which suggests that athletes have higher requirement of zinc than those who are physically inactive.

Among these, miR-192 levels in serum EVs increase with aging, in an IL-6-dependent manner, reducing excessive IL-6 expression in aged mice, creating a negative feedback loop. Excessive IL-6 expression reduces vaccination efficacy in aged mice, while EV miR-192 improves efficacy in these aged mice as well, making this miRNA an interesting focus of study. miR-21 levels in serum EVs also increase with aging, and regulates the expression of IL-12 required for Th1 responses; therefore, EV miR-21 is expected to regulate vaccine efficacy. miR-451a, another important miRNA, is abundant in serum EVs and controls the expression of cytokines, such as type I interferon and IL-6.

RIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full cohort, cumulative incidence analyses, matched for days of care, and matched for family history analyses were conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family history, gender block, age block, and false discovery risk. Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care (e.g., anemia (6.334), asthma (3.496), allergic rhinitis (6.479), and sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test). Developmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence in the practice, potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and family history of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to 0.063% of the (partially and fully) vaccinated. The implications of these results for the net public health effects of whole-population vaccination and with respect for informed consent on human health are compelling. Our results give agency to calls for research conducted by individuals who are independent of any funding sources related to the vaccine industry. While the low rates of developmental disorders prevented sufficiently powered hypothesis testing, it is notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum disorder (0.84%) in the cohort is half that of the US national rate (1.69%). The practice-wide rate of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate.

To this end, within a longitudinal cohort study, healthy and mildly asthmatic volunteers were experimentally inoculated with rhinovirus-16 and time series of these parameters/biomarkers were systematically recorded and compared between the pre- and post-infection phases of the study, which lasted 2 and 1 month/s, respectively. We found that the parameters'/biomarkers' ability to discriminate between the infected and the uninfected state varied over the observation time period. Consistently over time, the concentration of cytokines in nasal lavage fluid showed moderate to very good discrimination performance, thereby qualifying for disease progression monitoring. On the other hand, lung function and FeNO, while quickly and non-invasively measurable using cheap portable devices (e.g., at airports), performed poorly.","output":"Can measurements of inflammatory biomarkers be used to spot viral infections?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 crisis has clarified the demand for an ultra-brief single-session, online, theory-led, empirically supported, psychological intervention for managing stress and improving well-being, especially for people within organizational settings.

In essence, the aim is to reduce distress and restore wellbeing, both in the present moment through current actions (distract or dilute), and through expressing longer-term goal conflicts (e.g., through talking, writing, and drawing) to discover new perspectives that arise spontaneously after sufficient time and consideration. The intervention is user-led in that it draws on users own idiosyncratic and pre-existing experiences, knowledge, skills and resources to help them apply an approach, or combination of approaches, that are proportionate and timed to the nature and context of the stress they are experiencing.

Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808. RESULTS The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care. CONCLUSIONS There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.","output":"Participants' accrual and delivery of HIV prevention interventions among men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease of unknown origin, has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Individuals with mental disorders may have a higher risk of infection and worse clinical outcomes because of a variety of factors such as poorer general resilience and lower immune function. However, there have been no studies to date specifically investigating the risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality in these patients. This was addressed in the present study by analyzing the data of 473,958 subjects included in the UK Biobank, 14,877 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 infection. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between mental disorders and risks of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. The results showed that subjects who were diagnosed with a mental disorder had a significantly higher risk of developing COVID-19 and a worse outcome as evidenced by higher rates of COVID-19-related mortality, with the strongest effects observed for dementia. Among dementia subtypes, Alzheimer disease patients had the highest risks of COVID-19 infection (7.39-fold increase) and associated mortality (2.13-fold increase). Late-life anxiety only increased the risk of developing COVID-19 while late-life depression not only was associated with a higher risk of infection but also a worse outcome.

Questions related to determinants of implementation (for therapists) and acceptability (for clients) of online EMDR. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of therapist respondents to provide a deeper understanding of survey responses. Survey responses were received from therapists (n = 562) from five continents, and their clients (n = 148). 88% of clients responded as being extremely or very comfortable receiving EMDR therapy online. At the initial point of social distancing, 54% of therapists indicated strong or partial reluctance to deliver online EMDR therapy compared to 11% just over one year later. Four fifths of therapists intended to continue offering online therapy after restrictions were lifted. Free-text responses and interview data showed that deprivation and clinical severity could lead to exclusion from online EMDR. Internet connectivity could disrupt sessions, lead to cancellations, or affect the therapy process. Therapists benefited from training in online working. Online EMDR is generally acceptable to therapists and clients, with reservations about digital exclusion, case severity, poor internet connectivity and the need for training.

Surveillance also provides for the preparation against potential influenza pandemics with the identification of the genetic properties of viruses and the mutant strains that could pose a threat. In this study, data in the scope of national influenza surveillance carried out by National Influenza Center, Turkey for five consecutive influenza seasons between 2010-2015, following the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic, have been presented and evaluated. A total of 15.149 respiratory samples, including 8.894 sentinel and 6.255 non-sentinel specimens, during 2010-2015 influenza seasons, within the periods between September and May, were evaluated in our center. All samples were tested using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) for the presence of influenza virus types and subtypes. Within the sentinel influenza surveillance, the samples that were detected negative for influenza viruses, have also been tested for the other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses) using the same technique. Further analysis, including virus isolation by cell culture inoculation and antigenic characterization by hemagglutination inhibiton test were performed for the samples found positive for influenza A and B viruses. Selected representative virus isolates have been sent to WHO reference laboratory for the sequence analysis. In the study, influenza virus positivity rates detected for all of the samples (sentinel+non-sentinel) were as follows; 34% (779/2316) in 2010-11 season; 25% (388/1554) in 2011-12; 20% (696/3541) in 2012-13; 23% (615/2678) in 2013-14; and 26% (1332/5060) in 2014-15. When all the samples were considered for influenza A and B viruses, the positivity rates for the seasons of 2010-11; 2011-12; 2012-13; 2013-14; 2014-15 were determined as follows; 49.9% and 50.1%, 71.6% and 28.4%; 98.3% and 1.7%; 73.6% and 26.4%; 48.1% and 51.9%, respectively. The frequency of respiratory viruses detected only in sentinel samples other than influenza, were found as follows; 10% (148/1435) in 2010-11; 18% (175/963) in 2011-12; 23% (415/1768) in 2012-13; 22% (468/2108) in 2013-14; and 21% (546/2620) in 2014-15 seasons. When the distribution of influenza virus subtypes were considered, the detection rates of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in all of the samples were 55% and 45%; 0% and 100%; 95% and 5%; 2% and 98%; and 79% and 21% in the seasons of 2010-11; 2011-12; 2012-13; 2013-14; and 2014-15, respectively. For B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, those rates in the same order of seasons were found as 15% and 85%; 98% and 2%; 0% and 100%; 16% and 84%; and 2% and 98%, respectively. When the data were evaluated, for 2010-2011 and 2014-2015 seasons, cocirculation of influenza A and B were observed within the same periods and similar proportions, but the peak activity occurred 7-8 weeks later for 2014-2015 season. For both seasons, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant for non-sentinel, while A(H3N2) viruses were predominant for sentinel detections. During 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 seasons, influenza activity presented similar profile; predominance of A(H3N2) and B viruses observed while A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections remained low. In contrast, for the 2012-2013 season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant and the detection of A(H3N2) and B viruses remained low. For the seasons in which A(H3N2) was predominant, the peak activity seen earlier than the other seasons. For all seasons, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in circulation were antigenically compatible with the vaccine virus, while A(H3N2) viruses were compatible for three seasons (2010-11, 2012-13, 2013-14) and incompatible in two seasons (2011-12, 2014-15). Influenza B viruses were determined as antigenically compatible with the vaccine viruses in all except 2010-2011 season. Predominance of B/Victoria lineage were observed during 2011-2012 season while the rest of the majority were B/Yamagata. The positivity rates of other respiratory viruses which were also analyzed in the scope of sentinel influenza surveillance were similar to influenza positivity for all seasons except 2010-2011. This fact has emphasized that, those viruses were also responsible for influenza-like illness especially during the early and late phases of the season. In conclusion, monitoring of the antigenic and genetic characteristics of influenza viruses by surveillance studies is essential for the early detection of potential pandemic variants as well as to ensure similarities among the circulating strains and the corresponding vaccine strains.","output":"[Influenza surveillance in five consecutive seasons during post pandemic period: results from National Influenza Center, Turkey]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein glycosylation is one of the most common and diverse modifications.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important complication of obesity. With the soaring morbidity of obesity, the prevalence of OSA has markedly increased. However, the underlying mechanism of the high relevance between obesity and OSA has not been elucidated. This study investigated the effects of obesity on the structure and function of the genioglossus to explore the possible mechanisms involved in OSA combined with obesity. METHODS: Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diet (HFD, 60% energy) or normal diet (Control, 10% energy) for 16 weeks. The muscle fibre structure and electromyography (EMG) activity of genioglossus were measured. The ultrastructure and function of mitochondrial, oxidative damage and apoptosis in genioglossus were detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), qPCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining. We further studied the influence of palmitic acid (PA) on the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, as well as mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in C2C12 myotubes. RESULTS: Compared with the control, the number of muscle fibres was decreased, the fibre type was remarkably changed, and the EMG activity had declined in genioglossus. In addition, a HFD also reduced mitochondria quantity and function, induced excessive oxidative stress and increased apoptosis in genioglossus. In vitro, PA treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, PA decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and activated the mitochondrial-related apoptotic pathway in myotubes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a HFD caused genioglossus injury in obese mice. The mitochondrial dysfunction and the accompanying oxidative stress were involved in the genioglossus injury, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for OSA with obesity.","output":"High-Fat Diet-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction Promotes Genioglossus Injury C A Potential Mechanism for Obstructive Sleep Apnea with Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic ovariectomy has been advocated as the preferred sterilization method for dogs for some time.

Given current concerns regarding research standards, we were interested in how Spanish scholars perceived COVID-19 research and the extent to which questionable research practices and potentially problematic academic incentives are commonplace. We asked researchers to evaluate the expected quality of their COVID-19 projects and other peers research and compared these assessments with those from scholars not involved in COVID-19 research. We investigated self-admitting and estimated rates of questionable research practices and attitudes towards current research status. Responses from 131 researchers suggested that COVID-19 evaluations followed partisan lines, with scholars being more pessimistic about others colleagues research than their own. Additionally,researchers not involved in COVID-19 projects were more negative than their participating peers. These differences were particularly notable for areas such as the expected theoretical foundations or overall quality of the research, among others. Most Spanish scholars expected questionable research practices and inadequate incentives to be widespread. In these two aspects, researchers tended to agree regardless of their involvement in COVID-19 research. We provide specific recommendations for improving future meta-science studies, such as redefining QRPs as inadequate research practices (IRP). This change could help avoid key controversies regarding QRPs definition while highlighting their detrimental impact.

Methods: : This study was performed qualitatively using the content analysis method. The population of this consisted of 37 Iranians active Instagram users. They participated in the research via calls. The researchers selected the samples purposively so that they could call the users on Instagram to participate after stating the objectives of the research. Purposeful sampling continued until the saturation point was reached. To collect data, a semi-structured interview was conducted with 12 participants via video calls, while 25 were interviewed personally. In doing so, the researchers re-interviewed 4 people personally to make them understand the issue more clearly. The interview process was repeated for some of the subjects. Finally, a total of 41 interviews were conducted with a duration between 17 and 48 minutes. Open and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect the data and analyzed it through the content analysis method. Results: : The researchers extracted 2 main categories related to the barriers and facilitators of perceived social support and 12 subcategories by analyzing the data. Barriers to perceived social support were categorized into 6 main categories;economic factors, familial factors, socio-cultural factors, individual and psychological factors, inefficient quarantine policies, weak management. The facilitators of social support were classified into 6 main categories;familial factors, individual factors, government's supportive policies, and improvement of occupational, social, spiritual, and emotional status. Conclusion: The results indicated that a set of environmental and social factors could control the COVID-19 disease and play a deterring or facilitating role in the controlling process. Understanding these factors, as they were tailored with the social context and individuals' real-time experiences while being exposed to the outbreak, necessary measures can be effectively applied in designing training programs.

However, whether and how the underlying mechanism of regulation or the transcriptional target landscape differ amongst coronaviruses remains mostly uncharacterized. In this study we use comparative transcriptomics to investigate the diversity of transcriptional targets between four different coronavirus nsp1 proteins (from MERS, SARS1, SARS2 and 229E). In parallel, we performed Affinity Purification followed by Mass-Spectrometry to identify common and divergent interactors between these different nsp1. For all four nsp1 tested, we detected widespread RNA destabilization, confirming that both - and -Coronavirus nsp1 broadly affect the host transcriptome. Surprisingly, we observed that even closely related nsp1 showed little similarities in the clustering of genes targeted. Additionally, we show that the RNA targeted by nsp1 from the -CoV 229E partially overlapped with MERS nsp1 targets. Given MERS nsp1 preferential targeting of nuclear transcripts, these results may indicate that these nsp1 proteins share a similar targeting mechanism. Finally, we show that the interactome of these nsp1 proteins differ widely. Intriguingly, our data indicate that the 229E nsp1, which is the smallest of the nsp1 proteins tested here, interacts with the most host proteins, while MERS nsp1 only engaged with a few host proteins. Collectively, our work highlights that while nsp1 is a rather well-conserved protein with conserved functions across different coronaviruses, its precise effects on the host cell is virus specific. Significance Coronaviruses extensively co-opt their host gene expression machinery in order to quicky benefit from the host resources. The viral protein nsp1 plays a major role in this takeover as nsp1 is known to induce a widespread shutdown of the host gene expression, both at the RNA and the translational level. Previous work characterized the molecular basis for nsp1-mediated host shutdown. However, this was mostly conducted in the context of -coronaviruses and in particular SARS-CoV1, CoV2 and MERS due to the important public health burden that these viruses represent. Here instead, we explored the impact of nsp1 on the host using a comparative approach, defining the influence of 4 nsp1 protein from - and -coronaviruses. We delineated the impact of these 4 nsp1 on the host transcriptome and mapped their interactome. We revealed that host target range and interactomes vary widely among different nsp1, suggesting a viral-specific targeting. Understanding how these differences shape infection will be important to better inform antiviral drug development.","output":"Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) widespread RNA decay phenotype varies among Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we critically review the work \\"Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality\\" (Ogen, 2020), stressing the fact that we think there are flaws in the published methodology.

LOCAL PROBLEM: A southeastern academic medical center pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) needed to augment family-centered medical rounds when parents could not be at the bedside. No alternative to physical presence for daily medical rounds existed in the PCICU. METHODS: A virtual rounding (VR) program was implemented allowing parents of patients admitted to PCICU to join medical rounds remotely through teleconferencing. Preintervention and postintervention rounding times, staff perceptions of the program, and parental satisfaction scores using the Pediatric Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (pFS-ICU) tool were measured. INTERVENTIONS: This quality improvement project implemented a VR program offered to all families of patients in the PCICU. RESULTS: VR did not increase rounding times after implementation (p = .673). Staff satisfaction surveys revealed that staff felt the VR program did not prolong rounding times (p &#8804; 0.001), workload impact perceptions improved after intervention (p = <0.001), and staff felt VR should be offered to families in PCICU (p &#8804; 0.001).

Neurological events have been associated with ZIKV-infected individuals, such as Guillain-Barr syndrome, an autoimmune acute neuropathy that causes nerve demyelination and can induce paralysis. With the increase of ZIKV infection incidence in 2015, malformation and microcephaly cases in newborns have grown considerably, which suggested congenital transmission. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine against ZIKV became an urgent need. Live attenuated vaccines present some theoretical risks for administration in pregnant women. Thus, we developed an in silico multiepitope vaccine against ZIKV. All structural and non-structural proteins were investigated using immunoinformatics tools designed for the prediction of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes. We selected 13 CD8 + and 12 CD4 + T cell epitopes considering parameters such as binding affinity to HLA class I and II molecules, promiscuity based on the number of different HLA alleles that bind to the epitopes, and immunogenicity. ZIKV Envelope protein domain III (EDIII) was added to the vaccine construct, creating a hybrid protein domain-multiepitope vaccine. Three high scoring continuous and two discontinuous B cell epitopes were found in EDIII. Aiming to increase the candidate vaccine antigenicity even further, we tested secondary and tertiary structures and physicochemical parameters of the vaccine conjugated to four different protein adjuvants: flagellin, 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12, heparin-binding hemagglutinin, or RS09 synthetic peptide. The addition of the flagellin adjuvant increased the vaccine's predicted antigenicity. In silico predictions revealed that the protein is a probable antigen, non-allergenic and predicted to be stable. The vaccines average population coverage is estimated to be 87.86%, which indicates it can be administered worldwide. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) of individuals with previous ZIKV infection were tested for cytokine production in response to the pool of CD4 and CD8 ZIKV peptide selected. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells showed significant production of IFN- upon stimulation and IL-2 production was also detected by CD8 + T cells, which indicated the potential of our peptides to be recognized by specific T cells and induce immune response. In conclusion, we developed an in silico universal vaccine predicted to induce broad and high-coverage cellular and humoral immune responses against ZIKV, which can be a good candidate for posterior in vivo validation.","output":"In silico construction of a multiepitope Zika virus vaccine using immunoinformatics tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world.

Here we used a simple adapted N95 mask sampling method to demonstrate the impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on 92 COVID-19 patients to expel virus into the air translating to a transmission risk. Between July and September 2021, when the Delta was the dominant circulating strain in Mumbai, we noted a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus (95%), about an eighty-fold increase in median viral load and a three-fold increase in high emitter type (41%; people expelling >1000 viral copy numbers in 30 minutes) compared to initial strains of 2020. Eight percent of these patients continued to be high emitters even after eight days of symptom onset, suggesting a probable increased transmission risk for Delta strain even at this stage. There was no significant difference in expelling pattern between partial, full and un-vaccinated individuals suggesting similar transmission risk. We noted significantly more infections among vaccinated study patients and their household members than unvaccinated, probably due to increased duration from vaccination and/or increased risk behaviour upon vaccination due to lower perceived threat. This study provides biological evidence for possible continued transmission of the Delta strain even with vaccination, emphasizing the need to continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The study also indicates that the mask method may be useful for screening future vaccine candidates, therapeutics or interventions for their ability to block transmission.","output":"Impact of Delta and Vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk: Lessons for Emerging Breakthrough infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Justice-involved veteran research remains largely limited to men and those using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services. Research inclusive of women and those not using VHA care is critical to understanding mental health and suicide risk among justice-involved veterans. This study examined whether lifetime justice involvement was associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, recent suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempt. METHOD We conducted a secondary analysis of 812 post-9/11 male and female veterans. The sample included veterans eligible and not eligible for VHA care. Participants were administered the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Additional questions assessed justice involvement, military characteristics, demographics, and recent use of VHA mental health care. RESULTS History of justice involvement was associated with more severe PTSD and depression symptoms as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Associations were maintained after adjusting for sex, combat exposure, service branch, recent use of VHA mental health care, and education. Sex-stratified exploratory analyses revealed consistent findings among males; justice involvement was associated with suicide attempt among females. Current probation or parole was particularly related to depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS Justice-involved veterans appear to be a vulnerable population experiencing heightened psychiatric symptoms and increased risk for recent suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempt. Programs within VHA and the community are important for connecting justice-involved veterans to mental health services and mitigating suicide risk.

The coronavirus 2019 omicron variant has surged rapidly and raises concerns about immune evasion because it harbors mutations even in individuals with complete vaccination. Here, we examine the capability of the booster vaccination to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and T-cell responses. Methods. A total of 167 participants primed with heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 were enrolled to receive AZD1222, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 as a booster dose. Reactogenicity was recorded. Binding antibody, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers against omicron BA.1 and BA.2, and total interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) post-booster responses were measured. Results. A substantial loss in neutralizing potency to omicron variant was found at 4 to 5 months after receiving the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222. Following booster vaccination, a significant increase in binding antibodies and neutralizing activities toward delta and omicron variants was observed. Neutralization to omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable, showing the highest titers after boosted mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222.

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from their inception to October 3, 2020. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to evaluate the results. Subgroup analyses were used to assess heterogeneity. A funnel plot was used to explore publication bias. STATA was applied for all analyses. RESULTS: A total of nine studies consisted of four nested caseCcontrol, two caseCcohort and three cohort studies were included. The results showed that antimalarials might reduce the risk of cancer in SLE (RR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.55C0.85). In the subgroup analysis of four nested caseCcontrol and two caseCcohort studies, the pooled RR was estimated as 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60C0.80). In four studies about hydroxychloroquine, the pooled RR was estimated as 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53C0.93). Antimalarials might reduce the risk of cancer in SLE among the Asian population (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49C0.88) (I(2) = 43.1%, p = .173). And the consistent result was also found in SLE from multiple centres (RR = 0.72; 95%CI: 0.60C0.87) (I(2) = 0%, p = .671).

A 46-year-old gentleman presented to us with complaints of intermittent fever for the past 2 weeks associated with fatigue along with oral ulcers and skin rashes which resolved spontaneously. These symptoms started after he received the second dose of the BBIP-CorV COVID-19 vaccine. His complete blood picture showed pancytopenia. A detailed infectious disease workup was unrevealing; however, his bone marrow biopsy revealed increased histiocyte activity, with some showing hemophagocytosis and dysplasia. Immunohistochemistry profile demonstrated strong CD 68 positivity. Further investigations showed raised serum ferritin and fasting triglyceride levels. He was immediately started on dexamethasone acetate at a dose of 10 mg/m(2), after which his clinical symptoms, as well as his blood parameters, improved remarkably. This is the first documented case in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The data from clinical trials support the general safety profile of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. We endorse its mass implementation. However, we believe that robust data need to be generated to evidence any adverse events, especially those with serious outcomes. Physicians should be aware of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine as a possible trigger for HLH and start prompt treatment, resulting in favorable outcomes. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: The presentation of HLH may vary and can present in an immunocompetent patient with no underlying risk factor. HLH should be kept in differentials when a patient presents with pancytopenia with a recent history of receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Steroids play a major role in the treatment of HLH, and definitive diagnosis and early treatment improve clinical outcomes.","output":"Inactivated COVID-19 vaccine triggering hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in an immunocompetent adult - A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BNT162b2 is a highly efficacious mRNA vaccine approved to prevent COVID-19.

But although fish catches are usually considered the primary ecosystem service that benefits fishers, little is known about how subjective well-being is influenced by the fishing activity itself. Here, we applied the experience sampling method in two small-scale fisheries in Bangladesh to assess the effects of fishing on fishers occurrence of positive and negative affect, two measures of subjective well-being. We found that fishing activities were not directly associated with increased momentary affect and that the frequency of positive affect actually decreased as the fishing trip progressed. Furthermore, although very low catches were associated with less positive affect, the highest frequency of positive affect was achieved with relatively small catches. Our results imply that the benefits provided by small-scale fisheries to the momentary subjective well-being of fishers are not strongly related to the actual catching of fish.

Hepatic toxicity was the primary dose-limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models. However, nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity. Therefore, we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function. Seventeen patients were treated at our institution, providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus. No changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of Onyx-015 among these patients. Transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment. These changes occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. In addition, viremia was observed starting 3C5 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient, but was not associated with hepatic toxicity. To further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors, we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver. We found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes. In addition, we found that CAR is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow. CAR is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells. Spatial restriction of CAR to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with Onyx-015.","output":"Minimal hepatic toxicity of Onyx-015: spatial restriction of coxsackie-adenoviral receptor in normal liver"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new variant of concern (VOC), B.1.1.7, has a distinct set of mutations in nucleotides encoding the spike (S) protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 previously accumulated mutations at a much slower rate, of 1-2 per month; the sudden appearance of a large cluster of mutations was thought to be unusual. We now suspect that VOC may have arisen from immunosuppressed individuals who shed virus for longer periods. Epidemiological analyses estimate VOC to be more infectious; this is of most concern because these estimates were calculated during periods where many regions of the UK were in high social distancing restrictions. Therefore, the previous 'tiered' system implemented in the UK was ineffective at containing VOC. The most likely reason for this is that previous restrictions, no matter how strict, still allowed for gatherings in certain places. VOC also has implications for the national vaccination programme - a higher proportion of people will need to be vaccinated with a more infectious virus. Prolongation of the second dose of vaccines to increase vaccine uptake has understandably caused concern, but is based on sound immunological principles.

Optimal treatment for severe COVID-19 pneumonia is extremely urgent. We conducted this study to evaluate the safety, feasibility and effect of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) intervention in the treatment of patients with severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: In this retrospective study, 43 patients with severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included and divided into conserved intervention group (C-I group) and advanced intervention group (A-I group) according to the initiation time of PR intervention. The PR intervention includes education, respiratory rehabilitation, physical training, psychological counseling and nutrition management. Oxygenation Index (OI), blood d-dimer level, lymphocyte count and other laboratory findings were recorded. Results: The median age was 54 years (range 21 to 75 years);11 (25.6%) were 65 or older. 24 (55.8%) were male. All patients safely finished a certain course of pulmonary rehabilitation. The OI could increase to moderate level (&gt;300mmHg) during ICU treatment, and the A-I group showed a faster trend. The time of OI increased to moderate level was significantly shorter than that in C-I group (p=0.02). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 35 patients. The time of lymphocytopenia recovery was shorter in A-I group than that in C-I group. 25 patients had elevated blood d-dimer level during ICU stay. Only one DVT case was found in C-I group, no significant differences were found. Discussion: Despite most of the patients with COVID-19 were thought to have a favorable prognosis, older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may quickly develop severe pneumonia and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi-organ failure. An optimal treatment for severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia is in urgent need. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that adopts the PR intervention into the treatment of severe or critically severe COVID-19 pneumonia. With good safety and feasibility, pulmonary rehabilitation intervention can bring benefits in the treatment. The novel pandemic brought the dilemma that most of the countries are facing now. The high contagiousness of COVID-19, extreme shortage of medical staffs and dangerous lack of medical equipment together brought great challenge to the medical system.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted on all students studying at Phenikaa University, Hanoi, using a self-developed questionnaire consisted of 42 questions regarding KAP towards face mask use as well as reuse of cloth mask, and COVID-19 knowledge. Among 728 participants, 40.9% (298/728) were male, 63.2% (460/728) were from health-related faculties, 46% (335/728) lived in urban areas, and 51.9% (378) had good levels of COVID-19 knowledge. Regarding face mask, most (89.7%, 653/728) participants had good knowledge scores, 72.8% (530/728) had positive attitudes, and 76.5% (557/728) had good practice scores. The most common types of masks used were surgical mask (57.6%, 419/728), followed by non-antibacterial cloth mask (23.1%, 168/728). Among 168 participants using non-antibacterial cloth mask, 43.5% reused masks (73/168), of whom 6.8% (5/73) did not wash their masks at least daily.

In the last two decades, a number of medical pandemics have yielded insights on the mental health impact of these events. Based on these experiences and given the magnitude of the current pandemic, rates of mental health disorders are expected to increase. Mental health interventions are urgently needed to minimize the psychological sequelae and provide timely care to affected individuals. METHOD: We conducted a rapid systematic review of mental health interventions during a medical pandemic, using three electronic databases. Of the 2404 articles identified, 21 primary research studies are included in this review. RESULT: We categorized the findings from the research studies using the following questions: What kind of emotional reactions do medical pandemics trigger? Who is most at risk of experiencing mental health sequelae? What works to treat mental health sequelae (psychosocial interventions and implementation of existing or new training programs)? What do we need to consider when designing and implementing mental health interventions (cultural adaptations and mental health workforce)? What still needs to be known? CONCLUSION: Various mental health interventions have been developed for medical pandemics, and research on their effectiveness is growing.

Objective: To determine whether oral azithromycin in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial of azithromycin vs matching placebo conducted from May 2020 through March 2021. Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not hospitalized at the time of enrollment. Among 604 individuals screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263 were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment randomization. Interventions: Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of azithromycin (n = 171) or matching placebo (n = 92). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23 secondary clinical end points, including all-cause hospitalization at day 21. Results: Among 263 participants who were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66%] women; 57% non-Hispanic White and 29% Latinx/Hispanic), 76% completed the trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50%; placebo: 50%; prevalence difference, 0%; 95% CI, -14% to 15%; P > .99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18 showed no significant difference.

Recent work has implicated the viral ovarian tumor domain (vOTU) as a possible nairovirus virulence factor due to its ability to edit ubiquitin (Ub) bound to cellular proteins and, at least in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), to cleave the Ub-like protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), a protein involved in the regulation of host immunity. The prospective roles of vOTUs in immune evasion have generated several questions concerning whether vOTUs act through a preserved specificity for Ub- and ISG15-conjugated proteins and where that specificity may originate. To gain insight into the substrate specificity of vOTUs, enzymological studies were conducted on vOTUs from Dugbe, CCHFV, and Erve nairoviruses. These studies revealed that vOTUs originating from different nairoviruses display a significant divergence in their preference toward Ub and ISG15. In addition, a recently identified vOTU from turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus was evaluated to elucidate any possible similarities between vOTUs originating from different viral families. Although possessing a similar preference for certain polymeric Ub moieties, its activity toward Ub in general was significantly less then those of nairoviruses. Lastly, the X-ray crystallographic structure of the vOTU from the Dugbe nairovirus was obtained in complex with Ub to reveal structural commonalities of vOTUs originating from nairoviruses. The structure suggests that divergences between nairovirus vOTUs specificity originate at the primary structural level. Comparison of this structure to that originating from CCHFV identified key residues that infer the substrate specificity of vOTUs.","output":"Diversity of ubiquitin and ISG15 specificity among nairoviruses' viral ovarian tumor domain proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure is a procedure widely used to prevent recurrence of cryptogenic stroke. Since December 2019, the Amplatzer PFO occluder device has been available in Japan through medical insurance. However, data on the clinical experience with this device are lacking, as it has been approved for use in only a limited number of institutions. This study assessed the clinical data of Japanese patients who underwent PFO closure using the Amplatzer PFO occluder. METHODS: Between February and October 2020, 14 patients at our institution underwent percutaneous PFO closure using the Amplatzer PFO occluder. The procedural characteristics, safety, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 52.413.3 years old, and 57.1% were women. Deep vein thrombosis was revealed in 2 patients, and the risk of paradoxical embolism score was 6.61.2 points. The PFO height and tunnel length were 2.31.4 mm and 11.54.1 mm. All patients had a PFO during the bubble study of grade >3 at the Valsalva maneuver on transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography. The average diameter of the PFO measured using a stiff guidewire and sizing balloon was 5.11.3 and 7.92.3 mm, respectively.

On-site source data verification (SDV) in the multicenter clinical trial became difficult due to travel ban and social distancing. For multicenter clinical trials, centralized data monitoring is an efficient and cost-effective method of data monitoring. Centralized data monitoring reduces the risk of COVID-19 infections and provides additional capabilities compared to on-site monitoring. The key steps for on-site monitoring include identifying key risk factors and thresholds for the risk factors, developing a monitoring plan, following up the risk factors, and providing a management plan to mitigate the risk. METHODS: For analysis purposes, we simulated data similar to our clinical trial data. We classified the data monitoring process into two groups, such as the Supervised analysis process, to follow each patient remotely by creating a dashboard and an Unsupervised analysis process to identify data discrepancy, data error, or data fraud. We conducted several risk-based statistical analysis techniques to avoid on-site source data verification to reduce time and cost, followed up with each patient remotely to maintain social distancing, and created a centralized data monitoring dashboard to ensure patient safety and maintain the data quality. CONCLUSION: Data monitoring in clinical trials is a mandatory process. A risk-based centralized data review process is cost-effective and helpful to ignore on-site data monitoring at the time of the pandemic.

Methods Parallel, web-based, anonymous surveys of PrEP-users and HCPs were developed using validated questions wherever possible. The PrEP-user survey was offered to people who had a tele-PrEP appointment between 13.11.2020-17.12.2020 and consented to participate. All HCPs conducting tele-PrEP appointments were invited to participate. Basic demographic data was captured. Data were analysed in Excel using descriptive statistics. Free text responses were thematically categorised using the Framework for a Systems Approach to Healthcare Delivery. Results Sixty-two PrEP-users and 8 HCPs completed the surveys (response rate 55% and 89% respectively).

Tele-PrEP was rated 'excellent' or 'good' by 61/62 PrEP-users, and 59/62 would recommend it to friends. PrEP-users identified convenience as a key benefit along with access to PrEP with reduced potential for COVID-19 exposure. Drawbacks were largely technological, including poor connection or issues with online booking. All HCPs felt that tele-PrEP allowed them to assess patients safely and confidently. HCPs also rated its convenience highly and felt it enabled better use of limited face-to-face clinic capacity. However, HCPs thought that tele-PrEP might create barriers for vulnerable patients, particularly those with low digital, health and/or English-language literacy. One HCP and 10/62 PrEP-users expressed a personal preference for face-toface appointments. Conclusion Tele-PrEP is feasible and acceptable. While most respondents rated the service highly, others identified a need/ preference for face-to-face appointments.

METHODS: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework with mixed methods was used to evaluate the implementation of the two iterations of the program delivered by a nonprofit organization during the pandemic. RESULTS: REACH: Seventeen people were screened, 13 people were eligible, and 11 consented to participate in the study. EFFECTIVENESS: Between baseline and post-test, participants with stroke demonstrated significant improvement in upper extremity function (Arm Capacity and Movement Test) and self-perceived UE function (Stroke Impact Scale). ADOPTION: Factors that facilitate program uptake by the staff were well-planned implementation, appropriate screening procedure, and helpful feedback from the audits. All staff felt comfortable using videoconferencing technology to deliver the program despite some technical difficulties. Factors contributing to ongoing participation included that the participants liked the group, they perceived improvements, and the instructor was encouraging. Only one participant with stroke was not comfortable using videoconferencing technology. IMPLEMENTAION: The program was implemented as intended as evaluated by a fidelity checklist. Participants adherence was high, as verified by the average attendance and practice time. MAINTENANCE: The organization continued to offer the program. CONCLUSION: The virtual GRASP program was successfully implemented. Although the program was effective in improving both measured and perceived UE function in a small sample of individuals with stroke, caution should be taken in generalizing the results.

This cross-sectional study examined the stress experience and coping strategies during home isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and analyzed differences regarding psychological burden. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 infected respondents were recruited by telephone and completed an online survey during their home isolation. This questionnaire assessed sociodemographic aspects, somatic factors, psychological burden (depressive symptoms, anxiety, and somatic symptom disorder), perceived stress and coping behavior during the home isolation. Results: Out of 838 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals during the study period, 648 were contacted and 224 home-isolated respondents were included in the study. Disgrace, social restrictions, job fear, health concerns, and infectiousness could be explored as stressors during the home isolation. Fifty-four percent experienced psychological burden. SARS-CoV-2 infected and home-isolated individuals with psychological burden perceived significant stressors more strongly (p < 0.001, r = 0.5) and coped significantly less (p < 0.001, r = 0.3) with their infection and home isolation compared to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals without psychological burden. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with psychological burden experienced higher stressors and were unable to cope adaptively with home isolation. Therefore, a general and standardized screening procedure for psychological burden should be established. SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with psychological burden should receive targeted support with professional help in the areas of stress experience and coping skills during their home isolation and beyond to avoid long-term consequences.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Positive and Isolated at Home: Stress and Coping Depending on Psychological Burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and its determinants among children aged 6-59 months in Zanzibar, Tanzania, from 2005 to 2015. We used secondary data from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys from three different periods: 2005, 2010, and 2015. A sample of 3502 child-mother pairs from three survey datasets was used to analyze the overall prevalence of anemia and reveal its determinants. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to demonstrate the prevalence odds ratio of factors, both from the mothers and children, for anemia prevalence. The study indicated a significant decrease in anemia prevalence from 76.1% in 2005 to 65.4% in 2015 (p < 0.001). Hierarchical logistic regression between variables and anemia showed a significant association (p = 0.02) with households that improperly disposed of stool, children with minimum dietary diversity (p = 0.041), children in low age quartiles (p = < 0.001), and underweight children (p = 0.025).

The ability of newer imaging modalities such as 3D rotational angiography (3DRA) or phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (PC-MRA) to measure PA diameters has not been compared to established angiography techniques. Measurements of PA diameters (including PA stenosis and PA stents) from 3DRA and non-contrast-enhanced PC-MRA were compared to 2D catheter angiography (CA) and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) in a swine CHD model (n = 18). For all PA segments 3DRA had excellent agreement with CA and MSCT (ICC = 0.94[0.91C0.95] and 0.92[0.89C0.94]). 3DRA PA stenosis measures were similar to CA and MSCT and 3DRA was on average within 5% of 10.8  1.3 mm PA stent diameters from CA and MSCT. For compliant PA segments, 3DRA was on average 3C12% less than CA (p < 0.05) and MSCT (p < 0.01) for 6C14 mm vessels. PC-MRA could not reliably visualize stents and distal PA vessels and only identified 34% of all assigned measurement sites. For measured PA segments, PC-MRA had good agreement to CA and MSCT (ICC = 0.87[0.77C0.92] and 0.83[0.72C0.90]) but PC-MRA overestimated stenosis diameters and underestimated compliant PA diameters. Excellent CA-MSCT PA diameter agreement (ICC = 0.95[0.93C0.96]) confirmed previous data in CHD patients.

One approach to ensure relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria underpinning the decision is a broad societal discourse and participatory decision-making process. However, this often was not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, evidence-to-decision frameworks can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered, even if not all voices of affected stakeholders could be heard in the process. Objective: The objective of this research project was to develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges decision-makers face when deliberating on national and sub-national level on non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to address the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In phase I, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies. In phase II, we used the best-fit framework synthesis technique with the output of phase I serving as a priori framework. We conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide the policy makers on the phasing out of the lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous versions into the WHO-INTEGRATE COVID framework (WICID framework) Version 1.0. Results: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, which are expanded on through 49 aspects contained within them, and the metacriterion quality of evidence. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental rights, acceptability considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations.

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 3147 eyes undergoing therapeutic keratoplasty between Jan 2016 and Dec 2020 (5 years period) as cases. The demographic data, clinical profile and microbiological analysis were collected using an electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Of a total of 13,625 eyes with microbial keratitis(non-viral), 3147 (23.1%) underwent therapeutic keratoplasty during the study duration. Majority of patients were males (68.35%), from a rural geography (49.89%) and in 51C60 years age bracket (23.74%). The mean age of the patients was 50.54  15.83 years. Two-thirds of patients were from lower socio-economic strata (66.63%) with an agrarian background (36.51%). Of the 3,147 eyes, fungus (51.8%) was the most common indication of therapeutic keratoplasty followed by bacteria (16.87%) and parasite (1.27%). No organisms could be identified in about a third (29.33%) of the cases.

However, observing generation times-the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair-requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals-the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period-the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual-distributions. These two approaches make different-and not always explicitly stated-assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis.

METHODS: 60 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring 4 or more liters of oxygen to maintain a saturation of 92% were recruited in this study. Thirty patients each were randomized to either standard care or awake prone group. Patients randomized to the prone group were encouraged to self-prone for at least 6 hours a day. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adhering to the protocol in each group. RESULTS: In the prone group, 43% (13 out of 30) of patients were able to self-prone for 6 or more hours a day.

Prehospital systems tend to be underdeveloped or non-existent in these areas, with less than 1% of low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) populations served by an organised prehospital system. Mobile health apps for activation of Emergency Medical System (EMS) have been shown to decrease mortality, but there has yet to be a systematic review and meta-analysis performed to clarify the role that these apps play in reducing mortality in LMICs. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile health apps for EMS activation versus traditional EMS dispatches in survival and transport time in patients with emergency medical conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The proposed systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs) will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and EBSCO will be searched from January 2005 to March 2021. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. Primary outcomes will include mortality and transport time. Critical appraisal will be assessed using the JBI SUMARI Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs, and Risk-of-Bias In Non-Randomised Studies tool for NRCTs. A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. If sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. I(2) statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity and identify their potential sources. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval will be required, as this review is based on already published data and does not involve interaction with human subjects.

To assess whether self-reported perceptions of COVID-19 and personal characteristics are associated with protective behaviors among general adults and to compare patterns in six different countries. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses the secondary data collected through an online survey between 15 and 23 April 2020 across six countries (China, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the USA). A total of 5945 adults aged 18 years or older were eligible for our analysis. A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of three recommended behaviors (wearing a mask, handwashing, and avoiding social gatherings). RESULTS: In most countries except for China, the participants who perceived wearing a mask as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to wear a mask (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 4.14, 2.08-8.02; Japan: 3.59, 1.75-7.30; Korea: 7.89, 1.91-31.63: UK: 9.23, 5.14-17.31; USA: 4.81, 2.61-8.92). Those who perceived that handwashing was extremely effective had higher ORs of this preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 16.39, 3.56-70.18; Japan: 12.24, 4.03-37.35; Korea: 12.41, 2.02-76.39; UK: 18.04, 2.60-152.78; USA: 10.56, 2.21-44.32). The participants who perceived avoiding social gathering as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to take this type of preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: China: 3.79, 1.28-10.23; Korea: 6.18, 1.77-20.60; UK: 4.45, 1.63-11.63; USA: 4.34, 1.84-9.95). The associations between personal characteristics, living environment, psychological status, and preventive behaviors varied across different countries. Individuals who changed their behavior because of recommendations from doctors/public health officials were more likely to take preventive behaviors in many countries. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher perceived effectiveness may be a common factor to encourage preventive behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results may provide a better understanding of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of factors related to preventive behaviors and improve public health policies in various countries and groups.","output":"Public perceptions, individual characteristics, and preventive behaviors for COVID-19 in six countries: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the interactions between viruses and surfaces or interfaces is important, as they provide the principles underpinning the cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. Yet, the physics of such interactions is currently poorly understood. For instance, there are longstanding experimental observations suggesting that the presence of air-water interfaces can generically inactivate and kill viruses, yet the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Here we use theory and simulations to show that electrostatics may provide one such mechanism, and that this is very general. Thus, we predict that the electrostatic free energy of an RNA virus should increase by several thousands of k(B)T as the virion breaches an air-water interface. We also show that the fate of a virus approaching a generic liquid-liquid interface depends strongly on the detailed balance between interfacial and electrostatic forces, which can be tuned, for instance, by choosing different media to contact a virus-laden respiratory droplet. Tunability arises because both the electrostatic and interfacial forces scale similarly with viral size. We propose that these results can be used to design effective strategies for surface disinfection.","output":"Mechanisms for destabilisation of RNA viruses at air-water and liquid-liquid interfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence-based resources have been sought to support decision-making and strategically inform hospitals' policies, procedures, and practices. While greatly emphasizing protection, most guiding documents have neglected to support and protect the psychosocial needs of frontline health care workers and patients and their families during provision of palliative and end-of-life care. Consequently, the stage has been set for increased anxiety, moral distress, and moral injury and extreme moral hazard. A family-centered approach to care has been unilaterally relinquished to a secondary and nonessential role during the current crisis. This phenomenon violates a foundational public health principle, namely, to apply the least restrictive means to achieve good for the many. Instead, there has been widespread adoption of utilitarian and paternalistic approaches. In many cases the foundational principles of palliative care have also been neglected. No circumstance, even a global public health emergency, should ever cause health care providers to deny their ethical obligations and human commitment to compassion. The lack of responsive protocols for family visitation, particularly at the end of life, is an important gap in the current recommendations for pandemic triage and contingency planning. A stepwise approach to hospital visitation using a tiered, standardized process for responding to emerging clinical circumstances and individual patients' needs should be considered, following the principle of proportionality. A contingency plan, based on epidemiological data, is the best strategy to refocus health care ethics in practice now and for the future.","output":"A Practical Approach to Hospital Visitation During a Pandemic: Responding With Compassion to Unjustified Restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: First cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019 With more than 100 million confirmed cases 14 months later, the disease has become the worst public-health dilemma of the century The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in an international health emergency, threatening to overwhelm health care systems in many parts of the world, especially poor resource countries Evidence Acquisition: Influenza and COVID-19 have similar clinical symptoms, and both cause a respiratory illness that may vary from mild to severe Both diseases have the same mode of transmission and require similar public health guidelines to prevent their spread, but their treatment strategies are different In this study, an algorithmic method is proposed for managing patients according to their symptoms for each of these infections Results: In fall and winter, infections with seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses become common As influenza also causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially at the two extremes of age and in those with compromised immunity, it is of major importance to know the similarities and dissimilarities between COVID-19 and seasonal influenza and plan appropriate public health measures to deal with each of these illnesses Conclusions: Will there be a devastating combined epidemic of COVID-19 and influenza (COV-Flu) during the 2020 - 2021 season?

Here, we aim to clarify the epidemiologic and influencing factors of asymptomatic carriers in the general population. METHODS: In our hospital, all hospital staff have received throat swab RT-PCR test, plasma COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies test and chest CT examination. We analyzed the correlation between infection rates and gender, age, job position, work place and COVID-19 knowledge training of the staff. After that, all asymptomatic staff were re-examined weekly for 3 weeks. FINDINGS: A total of 3764 hospital staff were included in this single-center cross-sectional study. Among them, 126 hospital staff had abnormal findings, and the proportion of asymptomatic infection accounted for 0.76% (28/3674). There were 26 staff with IgM+, 73 with IgG+, and 40 with ground glass shadow of chest CT. Of all staff with abnormal findings, the older they are, the more likely they are to be the staff with abnormal results, regardless of their gender. Of 3674 hospital staff, the positive rate of labor staff is obviously higher than that of health care workers (HCWs) and administrative staff (P<0.05). In the course of participating in the treatment of COVID-19, there was no statistically significant difference in positive rates between high-risk departments and low-risk departments (P>0.05). The positive rate of HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 knowledge training was lower than those did not participate in early training (P <0.01). Importantly, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the titers of IgM antibody of asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with COVID-19 in recovery period (P>0.05). During 3 weeks follow-up, all asymptomatic patients did not present the development of clinical symptoms or radiographic abnormalities after active intervention in isolation point. INTERPRETATION: To ensure the safety of resumption of work, institutions should conduct COVID-19 prevention training for staff and screening for asymptomatic patients, and take quarantine measures as soon as possible in areas with high density of population.

Results: The positive percent agreement (PPA) of assays for a COVID-19 diagnosis ranged from 84.0% to 98.5% for all samples (>14 days after symptom onset), with IgM or IgA assays showing higher PPAs. Seroconversion responses varied across the assay type and disease severity. Assays targeting the spike or receptor-binding domain protein showed a tendency for early seroconversion detection and higher index values in patients with severe disease. Index values from SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody assays (three automated assays, one LFIA, and three EIAs) showed moderate to strong correlations with the neutralizing antibody percentage (r=0.517-0.874), and stronger correlations in patients with severe disease and in assays targeting spike protein.

Initially these telehealth consultations were required to be bulk billed (doctors could only charge fees equivalent to the national Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)). The potential impact of this policy on general practices ? and particularly rural general practices - has been difficult to assess because there is limited published data about which practices are less likely to bulk bill and therefore more impacted by mandatory bulk billing policies. There was concern that bulk billing only policies could have a broader impact on rural practices, which may rely on mixed or private billing for viability in small communities where complex care is often needed. This study aimed to understand the patterns of bulk billing nationally and explore the characteristics of practices more or less likely to bulk bill patients, to identify the potential impact of a rapid shift to bulk billing only policies. METHODS: General practice bulk billing patterns were described using aggregate statistics from Australian Department of Health public MBS datasets. Bulk billing rates were explored over time by rurality, and state or territory. Next, questions about bulk billing were included in a cross-sectional survey of practices conducted in 2019 by General Practice Supervisors Australia (GPSA). Practice bulk billing patterns were explored by rurality, state or territory and practice size at univariate level before a multivariate logistic regression model was done, including the statistically significant variables. RESULTS: Nationally, bulk billing rates for general practice non-referred attendances increased over 2012-2019 from 82% to 86% but declined slightly in Modified Monash Model (MMM)2?7 (rural areas) at the end of this period. Further, bulk billing rates varied by rurality, and were highest in very remote (MMM7) (89-91%) and metropolitan areas (MMM1) (83-87%) and lowest in regional centres (MMM2) (76-82%) over this period. The results from the GPSA survey concurred with national data, showing that the proportion of practices bulk billing all patients was highest in metropolitan locations (28%) and lowest in regional centres and large rural towns (MMM2?3) (16%). Smaller practices (five or fewer general practitioners) were more likely to bulk bill all patients than were larger ones (six or more general practitioners). Multivariate modelling showed that bulk billing all patients was statistically significantly (p<0.05) less likely for larger practices compared with smaller ones, and for rural practices (MMM2?7) compared with those in metropolitan areas. CONCLUSION: Mandatory bulk billing policies should accommodate the fact that bulk billing varies by context, including rurality and the size of a practice, and has been decreasing in rural areas over recent years. Rapidly pivoting to bulk billing only service models may put pressure on rural and large practices unless they have time to adjust their business models and have ways to offset the loss of billings. Policies that allow for a range of billing arrangements may be important for practices to fit billings to their local context of care, including in rural settings, thereby supporting business viability and the availability of sustainable primary care services.","output":"Mandatory bulk billing policies may have differential rural effects: an exploration of Australian data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During COVID-19, government measures to prevent disease spread included advice to work from home. In addition to occupational risk factors, the increased use of telecommunication and changed work environment may contribute to voice and vocal tract discomfort (VTD). This study established the prevalence, incidence, characteristics and impact of self-perceived dysphonia and VTD in those working from home during COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study using an online survey recruited 1575 participants. It captured information about dysphonia and VTD presence, onset, and severity. Those with dysphonia completed the voice-related quality of life to measure impact. Regression analyses identified risk factors for voice and vocal tract problems. RESULTS: Dysphonia and VTD prevalence rates were 33% and 68%, respectively, incidences were 28% and 50%. Perceived dysphonia severity was mild in 72% of cases. Dry throat was the most common VTD symptom at 66%. Mean voice-related quality of life score was 82.4 (standard deviation  13.2). Raising or straining the voice while working predicted new onset dysphonia and VTD. Increasing telecommunication use was associated with worse dysphonia and VTD onset. CONCLUSION: Those working from home have seen a rise in dysphonia and VTD, which were associated with communication modality and change in environment.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to produce the classification probabilities for predicting NPC stages III and IVa. The preprocessing of MR images enhance the quality of images for further analysis. In stage one transfer learning is used to improve the classification effectiveness and the efficiency of CNN models training with limited images. Then in stage two the output of these models are aggregates using soft voting to boost the final prediction. The experimental results show the preprocessing is quite effective, the performance of transfer learning models perform better than the basic CNN model, and our ensemble model outperforms the single model as well as traditional methods, including the TNM staging system and the Radiomics method. Finally, the prediction accuracy boosted by the framework is, respectively, 0.81, indicating that our method achieves the SOTA effectiveness for LA-NPC stage prediction. In addition, the heatmaps generated with Class Activation Map technique illustrate the interpretability of the CNN models, and show their capability of assisting clinicians in medical diagnosis and follow-up treatment by producing discriminative regions related to NPC in the MR images.

HLH therapy includes dexamethasone and etoposide. However, therapy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been reported to treat macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), rheumatic sHLH. We report our experience with anakinra to treat patients with nonrheumatic secondary HLH (sHLH). PROCEDURE: Six children were diagnosed with HLH from December 2014 to August 2016 and were treated with subcutaneous anakinra (6-10 mg/kg/day divided over four doses) with or without dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 /day). Therapy was either escalated or weaned based on clinical and laboratory response. RESULTS: Five of six patients were treated with anakinra and dexamethasone, and one with anakinra alone due to active cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. The median age of diagnosis was 1.8 years (range 0.8-14.9 years). No pathogenic mutations associated with HLH were identified, but three of six possessed genetic variants of unknown significance. Infectious triggers were identified for four patients and two patients had malignancies. The average treatment duration was 8 weeks with 3.5-5.5 years of follow up. No patient needed escalation of therapy to include etoposide. All patients achieved remission. Anakinra was well tolerated without significant adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Initial treatment with anakinra (with or without dexamethasone) is a feasible treatment alternative for patients with secondary HLH and may allow for avoidance of etoposide.

We determined reference intervals in 120 previously confiscated, clinically healthy subadult radiated tortoises living under human care within their native habitat at the Tortoise Conservation Center (TCC). Specific analytes measured were manual packed cell volume, total solids, white blood cell (WBC) count and differentials, and biochemistry analytes using a point of care system. To evaluate the effects of different commonly used techniques on these analytes, we compared results between two venipuncture sites (subcarapacial sinus and brachial vein) and three different WBC quantification methods (Natt and Herrick, Leukopet, and slide estimate). Reference intervals were narrower for most analytes, and sodium and potassium were qualitatively higher in the TCC population compared to previously published values from radiated tortoises housed in North American institutions. Creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose and inorganic phosphorus were all significantly greater in brachial samples than in subcarapacial samples. There was poor agreement and evidence of constant and/or proportional bias between all WBC quantification methods.

This study identified genetic networks containing major immune-checkpoint inhibitors CD27, PD1, and PDL1, and their associated prognostic genes and proliferation genes in lung cancer tumors. A 5-gene prognostic model was developed and validated in extensive cohorts to select patients at a high risk for developing metastasis. CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference screening data were used in the selection of proliferation genes. These genes were associated with chemoresponse and radiotherapy response in lung cancer cell lines and patient tumors. This immune-omics network led to the discovery of repositioning drugs for improving lung cancer treatment. ABSTRACT: To date, there are no prognostic/predictive biomarkers to select chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy in individual non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Major immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have more DNA copy number variations (CNV) than mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) NSCLC tumors. Nevertheless, CNV-mediated dysregulated gene expression in NSCLC is not well understood. Integrated CNV and transcriptional profiles in NSCLC tumors (n = 371) were analyzed using Boolean implication networks for the identification of a multi-omics CD27, PD1, and PDL1 network, containing novel prognostic genes and proliferation genes. A 5-gene (EIF2AK3, F2RL3, FOSL1, SLC25A26, and SPP1) prognostic model was developed and validated for patient stratification (p < 0.02, KaplanCMeier analyses) in NSCLC tumors (n = 1163). A total of 13 genes (COPA, CSE1L, EIF2B3, LSM3, MCM5, PMPCB, POLR1B, POLR2F, PSMC3, PSMD11, RPL32, RPS18, and SNRPE) had a significant impact on proliferation in 100% of the NSCLC cell lines in both CRISPR-Cas9 (n = 78) and RNA interference (RNAi) assays (n = 92). Multiple identified genes were associated with chemoresponse and radiotherapy response in NSCLC cell lines (n = 117) and patient tumors (n = 966). Repurposing drugs were discovered based on this immune-omics network to improve NSCLC treatment.","output":"Immune-Omics Networks of CD27, PD1, and PDL1 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has highly impacted the education system and has created trends in online classes.

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission presents diversity of human host and increased disease risk with advancing age, highlighting the importance of in depth understanding of its biological properties. Structural analyses have elucidated hot spots in viral binding domains, mutations and specific proteins in the host such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to be implicated in cell entry and viral infectivity. Furthermore, epigenetic changes that regulate chromatin structure have shown a major impact in genome stabilization and maintenance of cellular homeostasis and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the virus infection. Epigenetic research has revealed that global DNA methylation along with ACE2 gene methylation and post-translational histone modifications may drive differences in host tissue-, biological age- and sex-biased patterns of viral infection. Moreover, modulation of the host cells epigenetic landscape following infection represents a molecular tool used by viruses to antagonize cellular signaling as well as sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs in order to enhance viral replication and infection efficiency. In this review, we provide an update of the main research findings at the interface of epigenetics and coronavirus infection.

RESULTS: We received a total of 269 responses to the survey (from May to June 2020). Before the pandemic, nearly all the respondents reported performing very frequently their visits face-to-face (n=251, 93.3%) while, during the pandemic, the telephone visits were the most frequent visits performed (n=138, 51,3%). Regarding communication difficulties, 157 (58.4%) respondents reported the impossibility of performing a proper examination as the most relevant issue. Also, 114 (42.4%) respondents considered remote visits more time-consuming than face-to-face visits. Most gastroenterologists (n=188, 83.2%) considered patients with active perianal disease in special need of face-to-face consultation and more than half of the surgeons (n=35, 50.7%) reported having performed an immediate postoperative follow-up remotely.

We aimed to determine the prevalence and the causes of shock with no diagnosis 24 hours after its onset, and to compare the outcomes of patients with early-confirmed septic shock to those of others. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter observational cohort study in ten intensive care units (ICU) in France. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with suspected septic shock defined by clinical suspicion of infection leading to antibiotic prescription plus acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressor support. RESULTS: A total of 508 patients were admitted with suspected septic shock. Among them, 374 (74 %) had early-confirmed septic shock, while the 134 others (26 %) had no source of infection identified nor microbiological documentation retrieved 24 hours after shock onset. Among these, 37/134 (28 %) had late-confirmed septic shock diagnosed after 24 hours, 59/134 (44 %) had a condition mimicking septic (septic shock mimicker, mainly related to adverse drug reactions, acute mesenteric ischemia and malignancies) and 38/134 (28 %) had shock of unknown origin by the end of the ICU stay. There were no differences between patients with early-confirmed septic shock and the remainder in ICU mortality and the median duration of ICU stay, of tracheal intubation and of vasopressor support. The multivariable Cox model showed that the risk of day-60 mortality did not differ between patients with or without early-confirmed septic shock. A sensitivity analysis was performed in the subgroup (n = 369/508) of patients meeting the Sepsis-3 definition criteria and displayed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients admitted in the ICU with suspected septic shock had no infection identified 24 hours after its onset and almost half of them were eventually diagnosed with a septic shock mimicker. Outcome did not differ between patients with early-confirmed septic shock and other patients.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of emergency care consultations, attendances and admissions; clinical severity scores on presentation to PICU; rates and causes of childhood death. For all data sets, rates during the lockdown period were compared with mean or aggregated rates for the equivalent dates in 2016-2019. RESULTS: The rates of emergency presentations to primary and secondary care fell during lockdown in comparison to previous years. Emergency PICU admissions for children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation also fell as a proportion of cases for the entire population, with an OR of 0.52 for likelihood of admission during lockdown (95% CI 0.37 to 0.73), compared with the equivalent period in previous years. Clinical severity scores did not suggest children were presenting with more advanced disease. The greatest reduction in PICU admissions was for diseases of the respiratory system; those for injury, poisoning or other external causes were equivalent to previous years.

A shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) has been implicated as premature discharge, that may in turn lead to adverse consequences. We tested the hypothesis that a short LOS might be associated with increased risk of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge and also post-discharge mortality. METHODS: We conducted a single-centred study of 32 270 (46.1% men) consecutive alive-discharge episodes (mean age = 64.0 years, standard deviation = 20.5, range = 18C107 years), collected between 01/04/2017 and 31/03/2019. Associations of LOS tertiles (middle tertile as a reference) with readmissions and mortality were assessed using observed/expected ratios, and logistic and Cox regressions to estimate odds (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) (adjusted for age, sex, patients severity of underlying health status and index admissions), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The observed numbers of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge or post-discharge mortality were lower than expected (observed: expected ratio < 1) in patients in the bottom tertile (<1.2 days) and middle tertile (1.2C4.3 days) of LOS, whilst higher than expected (observed: expected ratio > 1) in patients in the top tertile (>4.3 days), amongst all ages. Patients in the top tertile of LOS had increased risks for one readmission: OR = 2.32 (95% CI = 1.86C2.88) or 2 readmissions: OR = 6.17 (95% CI = 5.11C7.45), death within 30 days: OR = 2.87 (95% CI = 2.34C3.51), and within six months of discharge: OR = 2.52 (95% CI = 2.23C2.85), and death over a two-year period: HR = 2.25 (95% CI = 2.05C2.47). The LOS explained 7.4% and 15.9% of the total variance (r(2)) in one readmission and 2 readmissions, and 9.1% and 10.0% of the total variance in mortality with 30 days and within six months of hospital discharge, respectively.

The majority of vaccines used contained two influenza A strains and only one influenza B strain (trivalent vaccine). AIM: The aim of the study was to compare laboratory confirmed influenza B cases during three consecutive years with respect to vaccination history, clinical symptoms and molecular virology. METHODS: Partial HA gene sequences were analyzed for lineage determination and complete HA sequence in cases with reported vaccination and in fatal cases. Clinical data were retrieved from patient charts. FINDINGS: During the 2015/16 season, 75 influenza B cases were retrieved; 11 in 2016/17, and 274 in 2017/18. The frequency of Yamagata-lineage strains increased from 7.6% to 100%. No difference was detected in the relative frequency of co-morbidities in season 2017/18. 37.7% of the adult patients and 4.5% of pediatric patients were vaccinated against influenza.

We previously found that a combination of the farnesoid X receptor agonist cilofexor (CILO) and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor firsocostat (FIR) improved liver histology and biomarkers in NASH with advanced fibrosis but was associated with hypertriglyceridemia. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of icosapent ethyl (Vascepa?) and fenofibrate to mitigate triglyceride elevations in NASH patients treated with CILO and FIR. METHODS NASH patients with elevated triglycerides (150 and <500 mg/dL) were randomized to Vascepa 2 g twice daily (n=33) or fenofibrate 145 mg daily (n=33) for 2 weeks, followed by the addition of CILO 30 mg and FIR 20 mg daily for 6 weeks. Safety, lipids, and liver biochemistry were monitored. RESULTS All treatments were well tolerated; most treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were Grade 1-2 severity and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. At baseline (BL), median (Q1, Q3) triglycerides were similar in the Vascepa and fenofibrate groups (177 [154, 205] vs 190 [144, 258] mg/dL, respectively). Median changes from baseline in triglycerides for Vascepa vs fenofibrate after two weeks of pretreatment were -12 mg/dL (-33, 7; P=0.09) vs -32 mg/dL (-76, 6; P=0.010) and at 6 weeks were +41 mg/dL (16, 103; P <0.001) vs -2 mg/dL (-42, 54; P=0.92).

Although blocking plant virus transmission would allow for crop protection, virus receptors in insect vectors are unknown. Here we identify membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) coat protein (CP) in the gut of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a far-Western blot method. Pulldown and immunofluorescence binding assays and surface plasmon resonance were used to confirm and characterize CP-APN interaction. PEMV virions and a peptide comprised of PEMV CP fused to a proline-rich hinge (-P-) and green fluorescent protein (CP-P-GFP) specifically bound to APN. Recombinant APN expressed in Sf9 cells resulted in internalization of CP-P-GFP, which was visualized by confocal microscopy; such internalization is an expected hallmark of a functional gut receptor. Finally, in assays with aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles, binding of CP-P-GFP competed with binding of GBP3.1, a peptide previously demonstrated to bind to APN in the aphid gut and to impede PEMV uptake into the hemocoel; this finding supports the hypothesis that GBP3.1 and PEMV bind to and compete for the same APN receptor. These in vitro data combined with previously published in vivo experiments (S. Liu, S. Sivakumar, W. O. Sparks, W. A. Miller, and B. C. Bonning, Virology 401:107-116, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.009) support the identification of APN as the first receptor in a plant virus vector. Knowledge of this receptor will provide for technologies based on PEMV-APN interaction designed to block plant virus transmission and to suppress aphid populations. IMPORTANCE A significant proportion of global food production is lost to insect pests. Aphids, in addition to weakening plants by feeding on their sap, are responsible for transmitting about half of the plant viruses vectored by insects. Growers rely heavily on the application of chemical insecticides to manage both aphids and aphid-vectored plant viral disease. To increase our understanding of plant virus-aphid vector interaction, we provide in vitro evidence supporting earlier in vivo work for identification of a receptor protein in the aphid gut called aminopeptidase N, which is responsible for entry of the plant virus pea enation mosaic virus into the pea aphid vector. Enrichment of proteins found on the surface of the aphid gut epithelium resulted in identification of this first aphid gut receptor for a plant virus. This discovery is particularly important since the disruption of plant virus binding to such a receptor may enable the development of a nonchemical strategy for controlling aphid-vectored plant viruses to maximize food production.","output":"In Vitro Evidence Supports Membrane Alanyl Aminopeptidase N as a Receptor for a Plant Virus in the Pea Aphid Vector."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Burnout is a costly problem, and it appears to be getting worse due to COVID-related stressors. It is thus important for organizations to find better tools to prevent and mitigate worker burnout. METHODS: Conditional PROCESS path analysis was used to assess the relation of hardiness to burnout in a representative sample of U.S. workers, with sex and age as potential moderators. RESULTS: Hardiness is associated with reduced burnout symptoms. Sex did not moderate this relation. A moderating effect for age was observed, with more burnout appearing in younger, less hardy workers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest hardiness operates similarly for men and women as a buffer against burnout, and that older workers are less vulnerable to burnout. Training programs to increase stress appraisals and coping skills used by more experienced, hardy workers may be beneficial in reducing burnout.","output":"Hardiness and Burnout in Adult U.S. Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine storm can result from cancer immunotherapy or certain infections, including COVID-19. Though short-term immune-related adverse events are routinely described, longer-term immune consequences and sequential immune monitoring are not as well defined. In 2006, six healthy volunteers received TGN1412, a CD28 superagonist antibody, in a first-in-man clinical trial and suffered from cytokine storm. After the initial cytokine release, antibody effect-specific immune monitoring started on Day + 10 and consisted mainly of evaluation of dendritic cell and T-cell subsets and 15 serum cytokines at 21 time-points over 2 years. All patients developed problems with concentration and memory; three patients were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Mild neutropenia and autoantibody production was observed intermittently. One patient suffered from peripheral dry gangrene, required amputations, and had persistent Raynauds phenomenon. Gastrointestinal irritability was noted in three patients and coincided with elevated æT-cells. One had pruritus associated with elevated IgE levels, also found in three other asymptomatic patients. Dendritic cells, initially undetectable, rose to normal within a month. Na?ve CD8(+) T-cells were maintained at high levels, whereas na?ve CD4(+) and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells started high but declined over 2 years. T-regulatory cells cycled circannually and were normal in number. Cytokine dysregulation was especially noted in one patient with systemic symptoms. Over a 2-year follow-up, cognitive deficits were observed in all patients following TGN1412 infusion. Some also had signs or symptoms of psychological, mucosal or immune dysregulation. These observations may discern immunopathology, treatment targets, and long-term monitoring strategies for other patients undergoing immunotherapy or with cytokine storm.

The study also aimed to analyse the changes in chest X-ray (CXR) with disease progression. METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted between the period of 15 March 2020 and 1 July 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. CXR images were assessed and reported as Normal or Abnormal. A severity score was calculated using Warren et al.s Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema scoring. Correlations of the severity score thus calculated were sought with age, sex, clinical manifestations and presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: Five hundred patients (342 males, 158 females) were enrolled, median age being 35 years. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms but significant correlation of an abnormal CXR was found with dyspnoea. CXRs were normal in 67% and abnormal in 33% patients. The commonest comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease including hypertension, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. Predominant pattern was ground glass opacities, reticular alteration and consolidation peaking in the second week from symptom onset. The most frequent distribution was bilateral, peripheral with middle/lower predominance. Increasing age, male sex, presence of dyspnoea and comorbidities correlated with abnormal findings on CXR. Critical illness and mortality correlated strongly with increasing age, male sex and presence of dyspnoea, less so with presence of comorbidities.

Their trust in the information, understanding, feelings of effectiveness of eye protection, and the likelihood of them adopting it were measured. Findings: Compared to those given no quality cues, participants who were told the quality of the evidence on eye protection was \\"low\\", rated the evidence less trustworthy (p=.001), and rated it as subjectively less effective (p=.020). The same effects emerged compared to those who were told the quality of the evidence was \\"high\\", and in one of the two studies, those shown \\"low\\" quality of evidence said they were less likely to use eye protection (p=.005). Participants who were told the quality of the evidence was \\"high\\" showed no significant differences on these measures compared to those given no information about evidence quality. Interpretation: Without quality of evidence cues, participants responded to the evidence about the public health intervention as if it was high quality and this affected their subjective perceptions of its efficacy and trust in the provided information.

These long-term projections are based on extrapolations of long-term trends. In cases of strong, potentially temporal, fluctuations it is informative to analyse the short-to medium -term dynamics of mobility, using data of monthly frequency. OBJECTIVE We develop two univariate models to forecast short-to medium-term mobility in the Netherlands. We apply a recent turning point in the time series of mobility to demonstrate how short-to medium-term forecasts can provide early warning signals about possible changes in the annual trend. METHODS The models we apply are Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs) which belong to the state space family of models. The two models developed in the paper incorporate trend, sea-sonal and autoregressive components but differ in the representation of the long-term trend. Posterior sampling allows for calculation of consistent prediction intervals for both monthly and annual data. CONCLUSION Forecast accuracy is evaluated using time series cross-validation. Point forecast errors and calibration of prediction intervals are compared to those of several other popular univariate forecasting models. One of our DLM models is more accurate than the models included as comparison.

Thanks to the development of manufacturing technology, electronic information technology, artificial intelligence technology, and biological information technology in recent years, the development of the POCNAT device has led to significant advancement. Instead of the normal nucleic acid detection methods used in the laboratory, some novel experimental carriers have been applied, such as chips, cartridges and papers. The application of these experimental carriers has realized the automation and integration of nucleic acid detection. The entire process of nucleic acid detection is normally divided into three steps (nucleic acid extraction, target amplification and signal detection). All of the reagents required by the process can be pre-stored on these experimental carriers, without unnecessary manual operation. Furthermore, all of the processes are carried out in this experimental carrier, with the assistance of a specific control device. Although they are complicated to manufacture and precise in design, their application provides a significant step forwards in nucleic acid detection and realizes the integration of nucleic acid detection.

METHODS: The systematic review herein (PROSPERO CRD42020200647) evaluated to what extent differences in government-imposed stringency and timeliness of response to COVID-19 moderate the prevalence of depressive symptoms across 33 countries (k=114, N=640,037). We included data from six lower-middle-income countries, nine upper-middle-income countries, and 18 higher-income countries.

RESULTS: The overall proportion of study participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms was 21.39% (95% CI 19.37-23.47). The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was significantly lower in countries wherein governments implemented stringent policies promptly. The moderating effect of government response remained significant after including the national frequency of COVID cases at the time of study commencement, Healthcare Access and Quality index, and the inclusion of COVID patients in the study.

The aim of this feasibility study was to inform the design of a larger effectiveness study on the use of Playlist for Life in the hospice setting. METHOD: This study was a mixed-methods feasibility study involving adults at the end of life, family members and hospice staff from one in-patient hospice in Scotland. Eligible patient/family member dyads were approached by hospice staff and if interested, recruited by the researcher. All included participants received the intervention, which involved the provision of an MP3 player and assistance to set up a playlist. Participants were asked to listen to the playlist daily during the intervention period (7 days). Data were collected through patient reported outcome measures and on days 1, 3 and 7 of the intervention period and through participant observation session. Patient/family member dyads and hospice staff also took part in qualitative interviews (Appendix 1) post-intervention, which were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Semi-structured interviews at the end of the intervention period were used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability.

The group met weekly to discuss concerns and issues relevant to all parties in order to respond to the needs of care home staff.One main concern raised was the emotional impact the pandemic was having on care home staff. Many homes lost multiple residents in a short space of time. Often they had known their residents for many years and described their bereavement as the same as losing a family member. They were unable to acknowledge the death in the usual way and therefore were left coping with the ongoing stress of caring for their residents, whilst unable to access their usual support networks and process their bereavement.

Predicting the outcomes of such events in relation to possible interventions is crucial for societal and healthcare planning and forecasting of resource needs. Deterministic and mechanistic models can capture the main known phenomena of epidemics while also allowing for a meaningful interpretation of results. In this work a deterministic mechanistic population balance model was developed. The model describes individuals in a population by infection stage and age group. The population is treated as in a close well mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The present model provides a steppingstone to build upon and its current low complexity retains accessibility to non experts and policy makers to comprehend the variables and phenomena at play. The impact of specific interventions on the outbreak time course, number of cases and outcome of fatalities were evaluated including that of available critical care. Data available from the COVID19 outbreak as of early April 2020 was used. Key findings in our results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures appear effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the elderly (at higher fatality risk) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage; (iii) an increase in the number of critical care beds could save up to eight lives per extra bed in a million population with the current parameters used; (iv) the use of protective equipment (PPE) appears effective to dramatically reduce total fatalities when implemented extensively and in a high degree; (v) infection recognition through random testing of the population, accompanied by subsequent (self) isolation of infected aware individuals, can dramatically reduce the total fatalities but only if conducted extensively to almost the entire population and sustained over time; (vi) ending isolation measures while R0 values remain above 1.0 (with a safety factor) renders the isolation measures useless and total fatality numbers return to values as if nothing was ever done; (vii) ending the isolation measures for only the population under 60 y/o at R0 values still above 1.0 increases total fatalities but only around half as much as if isolation ends for everyone; (viii) a threshold value, equivalent to that for R0, appears to exist for the daily fatality rate at which to end isolation measures, this is significant as the fatality rate is (unlike R0) very accurately known. Any interpretation of these results for the COVID19 outbreak predictions and interventions should be considered only qualitatively at this stage due to the low confidence (lack of complete and valid data) on the parameter values available at the time of writing.

Technologies based on reverse transcription isothermal loop amplification (RT-LAMP) can be used as an alternative to RT-PCR for diagnostic purposes. In this study, we compared the RTLAMP and RT-PCR methods in order to analyze both the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. MATERIAL AND METHODS For the study, we used reagent kits based on RT-PCR and RT-LAMP. The biological material obtained by taking swabs from the mucous membrane of the oropharynx and nasopharynx in patients with symptoms of a new coronavirus infection was used. RESULTS We tested 381 RNA samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Coronaviridae: Coronavirinae: Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus) from various patients. The obtained values of the threshold cycle (Ct) for RT-PCR averaged 20.0  3.7 s (1530  300 s), and for RT-LAMP 12.8  3.7 s (550  160 s). Proceeding from the theoretical assumptions, a linear relationship between values obtained in two kits was proposed as a hypothesis; the correlation coefficient was approximately 0.827. At the same time, for samples with a low viral load (VL), the higher Ct values in RT-LAMP did not always correlated with those obtained in RT-PCR. DISCUSSION We noted a significant gain in time for analysis using RT-LAMP compared to RT-PCR, which can be important in the context of testing a large number of samples. Being easy to use and boasting short turnaround time, RT-LAMP-based test systems can be used for mass screening in order to identify persons with medium and high VLs who pose the greatest threat of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while RT-PCR-based diagnostic methods are also suitable for estimation of VL and its dynamics in patients with COVID-19.","output":"[Molecular methods for diagnosing novel coronavirus infection: comparison of loop-mediated isothermal amplification and polymerase chain reaction]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of myocardial injury (MI) in patients with COVID-19 in Brazil and the prognostic impact of MI have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of MI in patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to identify variables associated with its occurrence. The secondary objective was to assess high-sensitivity troponin I as a predictor of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational study conducted between March and April 2020 with cases of confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Numerical variables were compared by using Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed with variables associated with MI and p<0.2 to determine predictors of MI. The ROC curve was used to determine the troponin value capable of predicting higher in-hospital mortality. Survival functions were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method from the cut-off point indicated in the ROC curve. RESULTS: This study assessed 61 patients (63.9% of the male sex, mean age of 66.115.5 years). Myocardial injury was present in 36% of the patients.

METHODS: A retrospective observational case series was performed identifying all patients with COVID-19 complicated by cerebral microhaemorrhage on MRI. The distribution and number of microhaemorrhages were recorded using the microbleed anatomical scale, and patients' baseline characteristics and salient test results were also recorded. RESULTS: Cerebral microhaemorrhages were noted to have a predilection for the corpus callosum, the juxtacortical white matter and brainstem. All patients had a preceding period of critical illness with respiratory failure and severe hypoxia necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a pattern of cerebral microhaemorrhage that is similar to the pattern reported in patients with non-COVID-19 related critical illness and other causes of severe hypoxia. This raises questions regarding whether microhaemorrhage occurs from endothelial dysfunction due the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection or from the secondary effects of critical illness and hypoxia.","output":"Cerebral microhaemorrhage in COVID-19: a critical illness related phenomenon?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Enterocutaneous fistulas often are associated with large abdominal wall wounds. Successful skin grafting of these sites is difficult, as the bed is constantly bathed by enteric contents. A method to graft these sites successfully would provide an important advance in their treatment. METHODS The medical records of patients undergoing skin grafting of a site around an enterocutaneous fistula were reviewed. The amount of fistula output at the time of grafting was recorded. The method of grafting, as well as the means of protecting the graft from enteric exposure, were noted. Skin grafts were evaluated for the extent of \\"take.\\" RESULTS Seven patients met the inclusion criteria. After 1-2 weeks, the graft take was 90% in three patients, 80% in two patients, and 50% in two patients. After 1 month, there was complete epithelialization in 85% of patients, and the remaining patient had most of the site epithelialized. This healing allowed placement of an ostomy appliance in all patients. The fistula output was >400 mL per day in 70% of the patients. Multiple techniques were used to divert enteric flow away from the graft, but the most common was placement of a negative pressure dressing that concomitantly secured the graft and allowed enteric diversion. CONCLUSION The presence of a high-output enterocutaneous fistula does not preclude successful skin grafting. Such grafting can accelerate wound healing as well as improve skin and site hygiene by allowing the placement of an ostomy device.","output":"A novel technique to skin graft abdominal wall wounds surrounding enterocutaneous fistulas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In low- and middle-income nations, acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. According to some studies, Ethiopia has a higher prevalence of childhood acute respiratory infection, ranging from 16 to 33.5%. The goal of this study was to determine the risk factors for acute respiratory infection in children under the age of five in rural Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 7911 children under the age of five from rural Ethiopia was carried out from January 18 to June 27, 2016. A two stage cluster sampling technique was used recruit study subjects and SPSS version 20 was used to extract and analyze data. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with a childhood acute respiratory infection. The multivariable logistic regression analysis includes variables with a p-value less than 0.2 during the bivariate logistic regression analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were used as measures of effect with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered as significantly associated with an acute respiratory infection. RESULTS: The total ARI prevalence rate among 7911 under-five children from rural Ethiopia was 7.8%, according to the findings of the study. The highest prevalence of ARI was found in Oromia (12.8%), followed by Tigray (12.7%), with the lowest frequency found in Benishangul Gumuz (2.4%). A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that child from Poor household (AOR = 2.170, 95% CI: 1.631C2.887), mothers no education (AOR = 2.050,95% CI: 1.017C4.133), mothers Primary education (AOR = 2.387, 95% CI:1.176C4.845), child had not received vitamin A (AOR = 1.926, 95% CI:1.578C2.351), child had no diarrhea (AOR = 0.257, 95% CI: 0.210C0.314), mothers not working (AOR = 0.773, 95% CI:0.630C0.948), not stunted (AOR = 0.663, 95% CI: 0.552C0.796), and not improved water source (AOR = 1.715, 95% CI: 1.395C2.109). Similarly, among under-five children, the age of the child, the month of data collection, anemia status, and the province were all substantially linked to ARI. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood ARI morbidity is a serious health challenge in rural Ethiopia, according to this study, with demographic, socioeconomic, nutritional, health, and environmental factors all having a role. As a result, regional governments, healthcare staff, and concerned groups should place a priority on reducing ARI, and attempts to solve the issue should take these variables into account.","output":"Determinants of acute respiratory infection among under-five children in rural Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: COVID-19 has affected the lives of every medical professional including oncologists. The goal of this survey was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the work routine, psychological state and radiotherapy practice of radiation oncologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 23 questions regarding the lives of radiation oncologists during the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed online via social media from July 14 to July 21, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 18.0 software and basic descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: A total of 82 radiation oncologists responded to the survey. The majority were professors (28/82; 34.1%) and residents (28/82; 34.1%) and <50 years old (70/82; 85.4%).

There are complex challenges to embedding telerehabilitation into stroke services and generating transferable knowledge about scaling up and routinising this service model. This review aimed to explore factors influencing the delivery of stroke telerehabilitation interventions, including platforms, technical requirements, training, support, access, cost, usability and acceptability. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane Library and Central Registry of Clinical Trials were searched to identify full-text articles of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and protocols for RCTs published since a Cochrane review on stroke telerehabilitation services. A narrative synthesis was conducted, providing a comprehensive description of the factors influencing stroke telerehabilitation intervention delivery. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies and ten protocols of ongoing studies were included. Interventions were categorised as synchronous telerehabilitation (n = 9), asynchronous telerehabilitation (n = 11) and tele-support (n = 11). Telephone and videoconference were the most frequently used modes of delivery. Usability and acceptability with telerehabilitation were high across all platforms, although access issues and technical challenges may be potential barriers to the use of telerehabilitation in service delivery. Costs of intervention delivery and training requirements were poorly reported. CONCLUSIONS: This review synthesises the evidence relating to factors that may influence stroke telerehabilitation intervention delivery at a crucial timepoint given the rapid deployment of telerehabilitation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It recommends strategies, such as ensuring adequate training and technical infrastructure, shared learning and consistent reporting of cost and usability and acceptability outcomes, to overcome challenges in embedding and routinising this service model and priorities for research in this area.","output":"Factors influencing the delivery of telerehabilitation for stroke: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the first part of this dual commentary, perspectives are gathered from students at New York University.

Little is known about long-term consequences of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life and functional status in older people, and the impact of age in this context. We aimed to study age-related change in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), functional decline and mortality among older patients six months following hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Methods This was a cohort study including patients aged 60 years and older admitted to four general hospitals in South-Eastern Norway due to COVID-19, from March 1 up until July 1, 2020. Patients who were still alive were invited to attend a six-month follow-up. Change in HR-QoL and functional status compared to before the COVID-19 hospitalisation were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensional-5 levels questionnaire (EQ 5D-5L). A change in visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 7 or more was considered clinically relevant. Results Out of 216 patients aged 60 years and older that were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 during the study period, 171 were still alive 180 days after hospital admission, and 106 patients (62%) attended the six-month follow-up. Mean age was 74.3 years, 27 patients (26%) had experienced severe COVID-19. 57 participants (54%) reported a decrease in the EQ5D-5L VAS score after six months, with no significant difference between persons aged 75 years and older compared to younger. 70 participants (66%) reported a negative change in any of the dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L, with impaired ability to perform activities of daily life (35%), reduced mobility (33%) and having more pain or discomfort (33%) being the most commonly reported changes. 46 participants (43%) reported a negative change in cognitive function compared to before the COVID-19 hospitalisation. Six-month mortality was 21%, and increased with increasing age. Conclusions More than half of the patients reported a negative change in HR-QoL six months following hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and one out of three experienced a persistently impaired mobility and ability to carry out activities of daily living.

In the liver, insulin controls lipid homeostasis by increasing triglyceride (TAG) synthesis, suppressing fatty acid oxidation, and enhancing TAG export via very low-density lipoproteins. Downstream of insulin signaling, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. Here, we define the role of hepatic mTORC1 activity in mouse models of NASH and investigate the mTORC1-dependent mechanisms responsible for protection against liver damage in NASH. METHODS: Utilizing 2 rodent NASH-promoting diets, we demonstrate that hepatic mTORC1 activity was reduced in mice with NASH, whereas under conditions of insulin resistance and benign fatty liver, mTORC1 activity was elevated. To test the beneficial effects of hepatic mTORC1 activation in mouse models of NASH, we employed an acute, liver-specific knockout model of TSC1 (L-TSC-KO), a negative regulator of mTORC1. RESULTS: L-TSC-KO mice are protected from and have improved markers of NASH including reduced steatosis, decreased circulating transaminases, and reduced expression of inflammation and fibrosis genes. Mechanistically, protection from hepatic inflammation and fibrosis by constitutive mTORC1 activity occurred via promotion of the phosphatidylcholine synthesizing enzyme, CCT, and enhanced very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride export. Additionally, activation of mTORC1 protected from hepatic steatosis via negative feedback of the mTORC2-AKT-FOXO-SREBP1c lipogenesis axis.

Although some evidence suggests that gossip is also ubiquitous in children's lives, whether children understand its effect has not been investigated. In this study, we examined how children aged 6-10 years understand the effect of gossip on friendship formation between two individuals. They heard six vignettes where a protagonist heard a piece of gossip about a target from a gossip spreader and answered whether the protagonist wanted to be friends with the spreader. In these vignettes, we manipulated the valence of gossip (positive/negative) and the shared mindset between the protagonist and the gossip spreader (having the same/opposite/no opinion about the gossip target). We found that the children thought that the protagonist wanted to form a friendship with the person who spread positive gossip, but the extent of the protagonist's desire to befriend the gossip spreader depended on their shared mindset. On the other hand, the children thought that the protagonist wanted to befriend the person who spread negative gossip when the protagonist had the same opinion about the target. These findings suggest that the children's inference of friendship formation caused by gossip depended on the valence of gossip and whether a shared mindset existed between the two individuals. This is the first evidence that reveals how children understand the social consequences of gossiping.","output":"Children's understanding of friendship formation caused by gossip"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The experiences of COVID\\\\19 differ at both micro and macro levels.

A vast body of scientific literature has attempted to answer this question using trade-off theory, which posits that host mortality persists due to its cost being balanced by benefits of other traits that correlate with host mortality. The most commonly invoked trade-off is the mortality-transmission trade-off, where increasingly harmful pathogens are assumed to transmit at higher rates from hosts while the hosts are alive, but the pathogens truncate their infectious period by killing their hosts. Here I show that costs of mortality are too small to plausibly constrain the evolution of disease severity except in systems where survival is rare. I alternatively propose that disease severity can be much more readily constrained by a cost of behavioral change due to the detection of infection, whereby increasingly harmful pathogens have increasing likelihood of detection and behavioral change following detection, thereby limiting opportunities for transmission. Using a mathematical model, I show the conditions under which detection can limit disease severity. Ultimately, this argument may explain why empirical support for trade-off theory has been limited and mixed.","output":"Detection, not mortality, constrains the evolution of virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This manuscript is a synopsis of a book created for the 50th Anniversary meeting of the Western Trauma Association in February 2020.

This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the &#967;2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results: Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications. Conclusions: The frequency of positivity in the test was 15% (infants and adolescents represented 64% of the confirmed cases), and the associated factors identified were contact with a confirmed case, sudden onset of symptoms, and chest pain.","output":"Clinical risk profile associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications in the emergency area of a pediatric COVID-19 center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computing relies on architecture specifications to decouple hardware and software development. Historically these have been prose documents, with all the problems that entails, but research over the last ten years has developed rigorous and executable-as-test-oracle specifications of mainstream architecture instruction sets and user-mode concurrency, clarifying architectures and bringing them into the scope of programming-language semantics and verification. However, the system semantics, of instruction-fetch and cache maintenance, exceptions and interrupts, and address translation, remains obscure, leaving us without a solid foundation for verification of security-critical systems software. In this paper we establish a robust model for one aspect of system semantics: instruction fetch and cache maintenance for ARMv8-A. Systems code relies on executing instructions that were written by data writes, e.g. in program loading, dynamic linking, JIT compilation, debugging, and OS configuration, but hardware implementations are often highly optimised, e.g. with instruction caches, linefill buffers, out-of-order fetching, branch prediction, and instruction prefetching, which can affect programmer-observable behaviour. It is essential, both for programming and verification, to abstract from such microarchitectural details as much as possible, but no more. We explore the key architecture design questions with a series of examples, discussed in detail with senior Arm staff; capture the architectural intent in operational and axiomatic semantic models, extending previous work on user-mode concurrency; make these models executable as test oracles for small examples; and experimentally validate them against hardware behaviour (finding a bug in one hardware device). We thereby bring these subtle issues into the mathematical domain, clarifying the architecture and enabling future work on system software verification.","output":"ARMv8-A System Semantics: Instruction Fetch in Relaxed Architectures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has become increasingly appreciated that autoimmune responses against neuronal components play an important role in type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis. In fact, a large proportion of islet-infiltrating B lymphocytes in the NOD mouse model of T1D produce Abs directed against the neuronal type III intermediate filament protein peripherin. NOD-PerIg mice are a previously developed BCR-transgenic model in which virtually all B lymphocytes express the H and L chain Ig molecules from the intra-islet-derived anti-peripherin-reactive hybridoma H280. NOD-PerIg mice have accelerated T1D development, and PerIg B lymphocytes actively proliferate within islets and expand cognitively interactive pathogenic T cells from a pool of naive precursors. We now report adoptively transferred T cells or whole splenocytes from NOD-PerIg mice expectedly induce T1D in NOD.scid recipients but, depending on the kinetics of disease development, can also elicit a peripheral neuritis (with secondary myositis). This neuritis was predominantly composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Ab depletion studies showed neuritis still developed in the absence of NOD-PerIg CD8+ T cells but required CD4+ T cells. Surprisingly, sciatic nerve-infiltrating CD4+ cells had an expansion of IFN-?3- and TNF-&#945;- double-negative cells compared with those within both islets and spleen. Nerve and islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells also differed by expression patterns of CD95, PD-1, and Tim-3. Further studies found transitory early B lymphocyte depletion delayed T1D onset in a portion of NOD-PerIg mice, allowing them to survive long enough to develop neuritis outside of the transfer setting.

The ASH-ASTCT COVID-19 vaccine guidelines indicate that certain immunocompromised patient populations could have an attenuated response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, most SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials required pts to be off immune suppression to be eligible and therefore excluded most pts with hematologic malignancies. Little is known about the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pts with hematologic malignancies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the serological response of Pfizer and Moderna vaccination after two doses given in pts with hematologic malignancies with a focus on pts with myeloid malignancies. Methods: Patients with a history of hematologic malignancies treated at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and received two doses of vaccination with quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Spike antibody to assess vaccination response were included in this study. Baseline patient and disease characteristics including disease status and therapy given at the time of vaccination were collected. Time to vaccine response was defined as having a positive quantifiable spike IgG antibody titer per the lab reference range. The development of COVID-19 infection as well as antibody titer levels were collected. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and student t-test and ANOVA test were used to compare continuous variables. Results: A total of 61 pts with hematologic malignancies had spike IgG antibody testing after receiving 2 doses of the vaccine were included in this study. The median age at the time of vaccination was 72 (22-85) and 46% of pts were female. Eighty five percent of pts were Caucasian. The majority of pts (67.3%) had a myeloid malignancy (MDS/CMML 29.5%, AML 14.8%, myelofibrosis 16.4%, CML 6.6%), followed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (16.4%), and others (6.6%). The median time from hematologic malignancy diagnosis to the first vaccine dose was 51 months (0.4-337 months). At the time of vaccine administration, 46 (75%) of pts were on active therapy and 39 (64%) of pts had active disease. Median time from the second vaccine dose to IgG spike antibody testing was 64 days (26-268 days). Most pts (75%) mounted a serological response with quantifiable COVID-IgG spike antibodies, 85% and 56% in myeloid and lymphoid malignancy, respectively. All pts with MDS/CMML/CCUS and CML mounted an immune response (100%), followed by acute myeloid leukemia (n: 7/9, 78%) and myelofibrosis (n: 6/10, 60%). Eight (13%) of pts were receiving hypomethylating agent therapy at the time of vaccination and all (100%) had a positive IgG response. Only one patient developed COVID-19 infection post vaccination with a documented IgG response and 2 pts had COVID-19 infection prior to the first dose of vaccination, both of these pts had IgG titers >10,000. Sixty percent of pts (9/15) with negative IgG response received treatment with either CD20 monoclonal antibodies or BTK inhibitors within 12 months of the first vaccine dose. Two out of three pts (67%) receiving Ruxolitinib had negative serology. Seven pts were on treatment with hydroxyurea, interestingly, all but the 2 pts with polycythemia vera had a negative antibody titer while on treatment with hydroxyurea. There was a strong positive correlation between vaccine titer and absolute lymphocyte count (r 2=0.27, p<0.001) (Figure). Conclusions: In this retrospective study, we demonstrate a higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in pts with myeloid malignancy with varying responses per treatment and disease subtype compared to pts with B-cell malignancy with variable anti-CD20 or BTK inhibitor therapy. Pts with myelodysplastic syndromes, overlap syndromes of clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance all developed spike antibodies irrespective of hypomethylating therapy or Hydrea as did pts with chronic myeloid leukemia. However, pts with polycythemia vera and those on treatment with Ruxolitinib had an attenuated response to the vaccine. Albeit this single center study, pts with myelodysplastic syndromes should be offered COVID vaccines irrespective of their blood counts or ongoing treatment. Our findings should be validated in a larger group of patients.

The H120 and Ma5 are the only viral strains approved by the Brazilian government as the constituent of vaccines. Despite the systematic vaccination in Brazil, IBV has not yet been controlled and diseases associated with this virus have been reported in vaccinated chickens. Here, we investigated the genetic variability of H120 and Ma5 strains present in the IBV vaccines from different Brazilian manufacturers. We performed DNA sequencing analyses of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene to investigate its genetic variability and the presence of viral subpopulations among vaccines, between batches, and also in each vaccine after a single passage was performed in chicken embryonated eggs. Our results revealed up to 13 amino acid substitutions among vaccines and some of them were localized in regions of the S1 glycoprotein that play a role in virusChost interaction. Secondary nucleotide peaks identified in the chromatogram for the S1 gene sequence revealed that all original vaccines (H120 and Ma5) were composed by different subpopulations of IBV. Moreover, new viral subpopulations were also found in vaccines after a single passage in chicken embryonated eggs. These findings indicate that H120 and Ma5 viral strains used in vaccines market in Brazil can still mutate very rapidly during replication, leading to amino acid substitutions in proteins involved in the stimulation of the immune response, such as the S1 glycoprotein.

The characterization of these structures confirmed their nature as aggresomes.

Eight (11%) reported having no emergency medicine RTPs and 30 (48%) had <100. Fifty\\\\seven (90%) had an emergency medical services (EMS) system, and 52 (83%) had an emergency access number. Higher country income was associated with a higher number of emergency medicine RTPs per capita (P = 0.02). Only 6 countries (8%) had >5 emergency medicine RTPs per 100,000 population, all high income. All 5 low\\\\income countries in the sample had <2 emergency medicine RTPs per 100,000 population. Challenges in emergency medicine development included lack of resources (38%), burnout and poor working conditions (31%), and low salaries (23%). CONCLUSIONS: Most surveyed countries recognized emergency medicine as a specialty. However, numbers of emergency medicine RTPs were small, particularly in lower income countries. Most surveyed countries reported an EMS system and emergency access number.

This is especially true for products of early region three (E3), which have provided the foundation for understanding many new mechanisms regulating intracellular trafficking of host cell proteins involved in the host immune response. Cholesterol homeostasis is vital for proper cellular physiology, and disturbances in cholesterol balance are increasingly recognized as important factors in human disease. Despite its central role in numerous aspects of cellular functions, the mechanisms responsible for delivery of dietary cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum, where the lipid metabolic and regulatory machinery reside, remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe a novel intracellular pathway for cholesterol trafficking that has been co-opted by an adenovirus E3 gene product. We describe what is known about the molecular regulation of this pathway, how it might benefit viral replication, and its potential involvement in normal cell physiology. Finally, we make a case that adenovirus has co-opted a cellular pathway that may be dysregulated in various human diseases.","output":"Adenovirus Reveals New Pathway for Cholesterol Egress from the Endolysosomal System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantum magnets with pure Kitaev spin exchange interactions can host a gapped quantum spin liquid with a single Majorana edge mode propagating in the counterclockwise direction when a small positive magnetic field is applied.

Nodding syndrome is a progressive degenerative neuropathy of unknown cause affecting thousands of individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa. The index case was previously healthy until she developed head-nodding seizures four months prior to presentation. Virus discovery by VIDISCA-NGS on the patients plasma detected multiple sequence reads belonging to a divergent rhabdovirus. The viral load was 3.85  10(3) copies/mL in the patients plasma and undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid. Further genome walking allowed for the characterization of full coding sequences of all the viral proteins (N, P, M, U1, U2, G, U3, and L). We tentatively named the virus Mundri virus (MUNV) and classified it as a novel virus species based on the high divergence from other known viruses (all proteins had less than 43% amino acid identity). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MUNV forms a monophyletic clade with several human-infecting tibroviruses prevalent in Central Africa. A bioinformatic machine-learning algorithm predicted MUNV to be an arbovirus (bagged prediction strength (BPS) of 0.9) transmitted by midges (BPS 0.4) with an artiodactyl host reservoir (BPS 0.9). An association between MUNV infection and Nodding syndrome was evaluated in a caseCcontrol study of 72 patients with Nodding syndrome (including the index case) matched to 65 healthy households and 48 community controls. No subject, besides the index case, was positive for MUNV RNA in their plasma. A serological assay detecting MUNV anti-nucleocapsid found, respectively, in 28%, 22%, and 16% of cases, household controls and community controls to be seropositive with no significant differences between cases and either control group.

With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the whole COVID-19 recovery period. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around two months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and/or verbal harassment/insult, by family/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases in the long-term.","output":"Joint Investigation of Two-Month Post-Diagnosis IgG Antibody Levels and Psychological Measures for Assessing Longer Term Multi-Faceted Recovery among COVID-19 Cases in Northern Cyprus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O manejo de dispositivos cardacos eletr?nicos implantveis de pacientes que evoluem a bito tem sido motivo de controvrsia.

Body mass index (BMI, from measured height and weight) was used as an indicator of overall obesity, and waist-hip ratio for central obesity. Main outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Around 0.2% (n = 640) of the sample were hospitalized for COVID-19. There was an upward linear trend in the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization with increasing BMI, that was evident in the overweight (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.71; crude incidence 19.1 per 10,000) and obese stage I (1.70;1.34 to 2.16; 23.3 per 10,000) and stage II (3.38; 2.60 to 4.40; 42.7 per 10,000) compared to normal weight (12.5 per 10,000). This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates; however, controlling for biomarkers, particularly high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin, led to a greater degree of attenuation. A similar pattern of association emerged for waist-hip ratio. In summary, overall and central obesity are risk factors for COVID-19 hospital admission. Elevated risk was apparent even at modest weight gain.

METHODS: All patients undergoing potential management for esophago-gastric cancer from 12 March to 22 May 2020 had their outcomes reviewed. Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) decisions, volume of cases, and outcomes following resection were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall 191 patients were discussed by the MDT, with a 12% fall from the same period in 2019, including a fall in new referrals from 120 to 83 (P = 0.0322). The majority of patients (80%) had no deviation from the pre-COVID-19 pathway. Sixteen patients had reduced staging investigations, 4 had potential changes to their treatment only, and 10 had a deviation from both investigation and potential treatment. Only one patient had palliation rather than potentially curative treatment. Overall 19 patients underwent surgical resection.

Here we demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted metabolomics and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is required for tumor cell immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells (NSCs) giving rise to tumors. Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD+ sensor, we show that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis through impaired NAD+ regeneration.

Piece of literature depicted that predictors of vaccine acceptance are complex, multiple, and vary depending on the type of vaccine involved. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed at assessing the COVID-19 acceptance and its predictors among college students in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2021. METHODS: A multi-center-institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 407 participants from three institutions in Addis Ababa selected based on a simple random sampling method from May 01 to July 30, 2021. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used for the collection of data, after which informed consent was obtained from all the included study participants. Descriptive statistics was used for the summarization of the data. Binary (bivariate and multivariate) logistic regression was applied for the identification predictors of vaccine acceptance with their respective 95% confidence interval and less than 5% p-value for the ascertainment of presence of association. RESULTS: The level of vaccine acceptance was 39.8% (95% CI: 35.0C44.7%).

Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein with the host cell receptor is recognized as the first step of infection and is the main determinant of virus tropism. The mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies inhibit PEDV have not been defined. Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies are crucial to identifying the receptor-binding domains of the viral spike and elucidating the mechanism of protection against PEDV infection. METHODS: B cell hybridoma technique was used to generate hybridoma cells that secrete specific antibodies. E.coli prokaryotic expression system and Bac-to-Bac expression system were used to identify the target protein of each monoclonal antibody. qPCR was performed to analyze PEDV binding to Vero E6 cells with neutralizing antibody. RESULTS: We identified 10 monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. Remarkably, 4 mAbs (designed 2G8, 2B11, 3D9, 1E3) neutralized virus infection potently, of which 2B11 and 1E3 targeted the conformational epitope of the PEDV S protein. qPCR results showed that both 2B11 and 2G8 blocked virus entry into Vero cells. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that PEDV neutralizing antibody inhibited virus infection by binding to infectious virions, which could work as a tool to find the receptor-binding domains.

Terrific efforts are generous by the researchers to search for a drug to control SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Here, a series of arsenical derivatives were optimized and analyzed with in silico study to search the inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the major replication factor of SARS-CoV-2. All the optimized derivatives were blindly docked with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 using iGEMDOCK v2.1. RESULTS Based on the lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp, darinaparsin (-82.52 kcal/mol) revealed most effective among them. Darinaparsin strongly binds with both Nsp9 replicase protein (-8.77 kcal/mol) and Nsp15 endoribonuclease (-8.3 kcal/mol) of SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed from the AutoDock analysis. During infection, the ssRNA of SARS-CoV2 is translated into large polyproteins forming viral replication complex by specific proteases like 3CL protease and papain protease. This is also another target to control the virus infection where darinaparsin also perform the inhibitory role to proteases of 3CL protease (-7.69 kcal/mol) and papain protease (-8.43 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION In host cell, the furin protease serves as a gateway to the viral entry and darinaparsin docked with furin protease which revealed a strong binding affinity.

RESULTS: Totally, 36 clinical indicators significantly associated with severe/critical symptom were identified. The clinical indicators are mainly thyroxine, immune related cells and products. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and optimized combination of age, GSH, CD3 ratio and total protein has a good performance in discriminating the mild and severe/critical cases. The area under receiving operating curve (AUROC) reached 0.9996 and 0.9757 in the training and testing dataset, respectively. When the using cut-off value as 0.0667, the recall rate was 93.33 % and 100 % in the training and testing datasets, separately. Cox multivariate regression and survival analyses revealed that the model significantly discriminated the severe/critical cases and used the information of the selected clinical indicators.

The disease is caused by mutations in DMD (encoding dystrophin) that abolish the production of dystrophin in muscle. Muscles without dystrophin are more sensitive to damage, resulting in progressive loss of muscle tissue and function, in addition to cardiomyopathy. Recent studies have greatly deepened our understanding of the primary and secondary pathogenetic mechanisms. Guidelines for the multidisciplinary care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that address obtaining a genetic diagnosis and managing the various aspects of the disease have been established.

PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING Inpatient mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) facilities, nonhospital SUD withdrawal management and rehabilitation facilities. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE The authors identified 3,950 Medicaid-enrolled individuals who received the intervention from licensed clinical staff of a behavioral health managed care organization; 2,182 individuals were eligible but did not receive the intervention, for treatment as usual (TAU). We used logistic regression to examine factors associated with readmission. Determinants of readmission were summarized through descriptive tests. RESULTS The intervention was associated with lower readmissions to SUD facilities compared with TAU (6.0% vs. 8.6%, p = .0002) and better follow-up to aftercare. Controlling for clinical differences between groups, regression results found increased odds of readmission for male gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.52, p < .0001) and dual MH and SUD diagnoses (OR: 1.52; CI: 1.29-1.79, p < .0001). Prior inpatient and case management services were also associated with increased odds for readmission. In the regression model, the intervention was not associated with decreased odds for readmission. Individuals with readmission (n = 796) were more likely to report being prescribed psychotropic medication and having housing difficulties and less likely to report having a recovery plan than those without readmission.

So, the goal of the present study is to learn from the pathophysiology of COVID-19 clinical features, laboratory results, and high-resolution CT manifestations in different stages of disease severity to provide significant reference values for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. METHODS: This was a multicentered study that included 128 patients. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, in addition to chest HRCT findings, were evaluated. According to chest HRCT features, radiologic scoring were grade 1 and 2 for mild grades of the disease, 3 and 4 for moderate grades of the disease, and 5 and 6 for severe grades of the disease. RESULTS: Patient clinical symptoms ranged between fever, dry cough, muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue, dyspnea, hyposomia, sore throat, and diarrhea.

Without adequate access to healthy foods, weight maintenance can be hindered. OBJECTIVE Examine influence degree of food access has on Appalachian bariatric surgery patient weight loss outcomes. SETTING Appalachian University hospital, United States. METHODS A retrospective chart review was used to examine the influence of food accessibility on weight loss outcomes in an Appalachian bariatric surgery patient population at a large tertiary hospital in West Virginia between 2013 and 2017. Demographic characteristics, health and family history, and 1-year surgery outcomes were collected. A state-specific food accessibility score was calculated for each patient address using the geographic information system. Patients were assigned a food access ranking score (FARS) between 0 (low food access) and 4 (high food access) based on criteria of quantity, quality, income, and vehicle access. RESULTS Patients (n = 369) were predominately married (60.5%), white (92.4%), female (77.8%), and underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (75.9%), with a mean age of 45 years. Most patients had low FARS (M = 1.67  .73; 72.6%). Nonwhite patients (P = .03) with a preoperative diagnosis of depression (P = .02) or without a family history of obesity (P = .01) were found to be in the lower FARS categories. FARS was not indicative of weight loss post surgery (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS Food accessibility in West Virginia was not associated with bariatric surgery weight outcomes at 1-year post operation.

The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, and skin findings due to COVID-19 treatment agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In PubMed, Google Scholar databases, skin lesions related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections and skin findings due to COVID-19 treatment agents subjects are searched in detail. RESULTS: Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itching, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of preexisting skin diseases, and new skin lesion occurrence/new skin disease occurrence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could include itching, dryness, and contact dermatitis. Skin findings may also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The incidence of skin lesions due to COVID-19 was reported to be between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions including maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain-like, thrombotic/ischemic, etc. are observed in COVID-19 patients. Some authors have stated that there is an absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection-specific skin findings.

Employing pre- and post- self-perception surveys coupled with tasking students to apply their scientific literacy skills in an assessment scenario demonstrated that students self-perception of their scientific literacy improved 30% (p < 0.05) with approximately 80% of students accurately applying their literacy skills. The citizen science study on excretory behavior was modeled on previously published findings thereby providing an opportunity to validate the published work which had indicated that dogs align their bodies in a North-South axis during excretion.

CD147 is a glycoprotein that is responsible for the cytokine storm in the lungs through the mediation of viral invasion. Melatonin use previously was shown to reduce cardiac damage by blocking the CD147 activity. Hence, melatonin, a safe drug, may prevent severe symptoms, reduce symptom severity and the adverse effects of the other antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the use of melatonin, which is reduced in the elderly and immune-compromised patients, should be considered as an adjuvant through its CD147 suppressor and immunomodulatory effect.","output":"Role of melatonin in the treatment of COVID-19; as an adjuvant through cluster differentiation 147 (CD147)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine the attitudes and expectations of persons with hemophilia of Generation Y (PwH-Y) toward hemophilia and its treatment comparatively with the opinions of their non-hemophiliac relatives.

The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between eating/swallowing function and COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Subjects were 44 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection being treated for schizophrenia in a psychiatric ward. Eating function was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) before and after infection. We also evaluated age, comorbidities, COVID-19 hospital stay, obesity index, weight loss rate, and chlorpromazine equivalent. RESULTS: Subjects had a mean age of 68.86 years. Pre-infection, 20 subjects had a FILS score of 7-9 (presence of eating/swallowing disorder) and 24 subjects had a score of 10 (normal). Eating function after infection resolution showed decreasing FILS score compared to that before infection in 14 subjects (74.14 years). Six subjects (79.3 years) transitioned from oral feeding to parenteral feeding. A &#8805; 10% weight loss during infection treatment was significantly associated with decreased eating function and a transition to parenteral feeding.

This review outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is most highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract and most SARS-CoV-2 shedding occurs from the upper respiratory tract. Viral shedding peaks early during infection around the onset of symptoms, before dropping rapidly in most individuals within 7adays of symptom onset, suggesting mucosal inhibition of viral infection. Serum and mucosal immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses were found to be strongly correlated in infected patients, whereas correlations were much weaker for immunoglobulin A (IgA). Mucosal IgA responses have been detected in infected cases in the absence of serum antibody responses, with mucosal antibody levels correlating strongly with virus neutralization. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COVID-19 patients revealed the induction of mucosal chemokine and cytokine genes, complement pathways, Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription signaling and cytotoxic T cells. SUMMARY: Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Further studies are needed to understand how the systemic immunological endpoints measured in vaccination studies translate to mucosal protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Mucosal immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on health systems and the global economy.

Here, we investigated the potential drivers of the surge by genomic analysis 1,056 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected in Seychelles between 14th March 2020 and 31st December 2021. The Seychelles genomes were classified into 32 Pango lineages, 1,042 of which fell within four variants of concern i.e., Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron. Sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Seychelles in 2020 were mainly of lineage B.1 (European origin) but this lineage was rapidly replaced by Beta variant starting January 2021, and which was also subsequently replaced by the Delta variant in May 2021 that dominated till November 2021 when Omicron cases were identified.

Methods: We distributed the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and seven-item General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) online to ICU healthcare workers in China. Respondents were divided into frontline and second-line according to whether they have contact with COVID-19 patients. Depressive and anxiety symptoms of all respondents were evaluated based on their questionnaire scores. Results: There were 731 ICU healthcare workers finally enrolled in our study, including 303 (41.5%) male, 383 (52.4%) doctors, and 617 (84.4%) aged 26-45 years. All in all, 482 (65.9%) ICU healthcare workers reported symptoms of depression, while 429 (58.7%) reported anxiety.

This study aimed to evaluate the pandemic's impact on psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS The multicenter study was conducted in 14 tertiary dermatology centers. Demographic data, treatment status, disease course, and cases of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with psoriasis using the immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS Of 1827 patients included, the drug adherence rate was 68.2%. Those receiving anti-interleukin (anti-IL) drugs were more likely to continue treatment than patients receiving conventional drugs (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.181-1.895, p = .001). Disease worsening rate was 24.2% and drug dose reduction increased this rate 3.26 and drug withdrawal 8.71 times. Receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL drugs was associated with less disease worsening compared to conventional drugs (p = .038, p = .032; respectively). Drug withdrawal causes were 'unable to come' (39.6%), 'COVID concern' (25.3%), and 'physician's and patient's co-decision' (17.4%). Four patients had COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms. The incidence was 0.0022% while it was 0.0025% in the general population. CONCLUSION Our study shows that psoriasis patients using systemic immunosuppressive do not have a higher, but even lower COVID-19 risk than the general population, and treatment compliance with biological drugs is higher.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psoriasis patients, and their immunosuppressive treatment: a cross-sectional multicenter study from Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, who suddenly presented with a clinical picture of emotional lability, disorientation, complex visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions.

Data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persistence remain sparse, especially from infected individuals with few to no symptoms. The objective of the study was to quantify the sensitivity for detecting historic SARS-COV-2 infections as a function of time since infection for 3 commercially-available SARS-COV-2 immunoassays and to explore the implications of decaying immunoassay sensitivity in estimating seroprevalence. METHODS: We followed a cohort of mostly mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (n=354) through 9 months after their presumed infection date and tested their serum for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with three commercially available assays; Roche-N, Roche-RBD and EuroImmun S1. We developed a latent-class statistical model to infer the specificity and time-varying sensitivity of each assay and show through simulations how inappropriately accounting for test performance can lead to biased serosurvey estimates. RESULTS: Antibodies persisted at follow-up in 74% to 100% of participants, depending on immunoassays. Model estimates indicate that both Roche assays maintain high sensitivity with the EuroImmun assay missing 40% of infections after 9 months. Simulations reveal that without appropriate adjustment for time-varying assay sensitivity, seroprevalence surveys may underestimate infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies persist after 9 months in a cohort of mildly infected individuals with detection depending on assay choice. Appropriate assay-performance-adjustment are important for the interpretation of serologic studies in the case of decaying sensitivity after infection.","output":"Persistence of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies: immunoassay heterogeneity and implications for serosurveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficient synthesis of a new series of acyclonucleotide analogues with a 1,2,3-triazole linker is described starting from diethyl azidomethyl-, 2-azidoethyl-, 3-azidopropyl-, 4-azidobutyl-, 2-azido-1-hydroxyethyl-, 3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl- and 3-azido-1-hydroxypropylphosphonates and selected alkynes under microwave irradiation.

However, without in situ structures of these trimeric spikes, a full understanding of this dynamic and essential process of viral infections is not possible. Here we present four in situ and one isolated cryoEM structures of the trimeric spike of the cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus, a member of the non-enveloped Reoviridae family and a virus historically used as a model in the discoveries of RNA transcription and capping. These structures adopt two drastically different conformations, closed spike and opened spike, which respectively represent the penetration-inactive and penetration-active states. Each spike monomer has four domains: N-terminal, body, claw, and C-terminal. From closed to opened state, the RGD motif-containing C-terminal domain is freed to bind integrins, and the claw domain rotates to expose and project its membrane insertion loops into the cellular membrane. Comparison between turret vertices before and after detachment of the trimeric spike shows that the trimeric spike anchors its N-terminal domain in the iris of the pentameric RNA-capping turret. Sensing of cytosolic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the turret triggers a cascade of events: opening of the iris, detachment of the spike, and initiation of endogenous transcription.","output":"Multiple conformations of trimeric spikes visualized on a non-enveloped virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the rapid immunochromatographic test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection using 16 saliva specimens collected from 6 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and detected N-antigen in 4 of 7 RT-PCR positive specimens.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS All full-length peer-reviewed publications of original data that use auditory electrophysiological assessments in AD and its preclinical stages (subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) will be considered in this review. The search will be performed on major electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL Plus) using keywords alone or in combination with Medical Subject Headings divided into two domains; (i) auditory tests and (ii) AD. The database search will be conducted on the 7th of May 2019. Data analysis will be completed and reported in the full review. A random effects meta-analysis will also be conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, V.3.

The aim of this work is to relax this hypothesis and to consider that the environment can have a local character even if conditioned through externalities by the choices made at the global level. In this article, we adapt the classical framework introduced in John and Pecchenino (Econ J 104(427):1393C1410, 1994) to analyze the dynamic relationship between environment and economic process, and we propose an OLG agent-based model where each agent perceives her own level of environmental quality determined by her own decisions, and by the decisions of those living around her. Despite the attention devoted to local environmental aspects, network externalities (determined through the scheme of Moore neighborhoods) play a fundamental role in defining environmental dynamics and they may induce the emergence of cyclical dynamics. The occurrence of oscillations in the local environmental quality is partially mitigated by the presence of heterogeneity in individuals preferences. Finally, when a centralized planner is introduced, the dynamics converge to stationary values regardless of the assumption on heterogeneity of agents.","output":"Local environmental quality and heterogeneity in an OLG agent-based model with spatial externalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through two studies conducted with cross-cultural samples (the United States and China), this research examines the psychological mechanism of consumer hoarding during COVID-19.

For China, while social media information seeking has a negative downstream relationship to hoarding, legacy media information seeking has a positive relationship with hoarding. In the United States, only social media information seeking has a positive relationship with hoarding. Further, these effects are significant when consumers attribute the scarcity responsibility to insufficient supply but not high demand. Study 2 shows that when the cause of scarcity is stated directly, perceived scarcity increases hoarding intention for Chinese consumers when the scarcity cause is due to supply but not demand, whereas U.S. consumers hoarding intention does not vary with the scarcity cause. The findings underscore cross-cultural differences in how legacy and social media information seeking influence consumer hoarding and highlight implications for situations in which hoarding is likely.","output":"The Roles of Legacy Versus Social Media Information Seeking in American and Chinese Consumers Hoarding During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vulvar aphthous ulcers have been associated with various prodromal viral illnesses.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3C10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6 hours to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics.

Exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), dyspnoea (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ)-Dyspnoea), health-related quality of life (CRQ), frailty (Short Physical Performance Battery), muscle strength (isometric quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction), patient satisfaction (Global Rating of Change Questionnaire), health economic as well as safety and trial process data will be measured. The primary outcome is change in exercise capacity between visit 1 and visit 2. Two sample t-tests on an intention to treat basis will be used to estimate the difference in mean primary and secondary outcomes between patients randomised to PR-gym and PR-min. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: London-Camden and Kings Cross Research Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority have approved the study (18/LO/0315). Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, presented at international conferences, disseminated through social media, patient and public routes and directly shared with stakeholders.

These compounds are known as natural by-products or secondary metabolites of plants, which are present in the daily diet and provide important benefits to the human body such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-allergic, antihypertensive and antiviral properties, among others. Plentiful evidence has been provided on the great potential of polyphenols against different viruses that cause widespread health problems. As a result, this review focuses on the potential antiviral properties of some polyphenols and their action mechanism against various types of viruses such as coronaviruses, influenza, herpes simplex, dengue fever, and rotavirus, among others. Also, it is important to highlight the relationship between antiviral and antioxidant activity that can contribute to the protection of cells and tissues of the human body. The wide variety of action mechanisms of antiviral agents such as polyphenols against viral infections could be applied as a treatment or prevention strategy, because at the same time, antiviral polyphenols can be used to produce natural antiviral natural drugs. A recent example of an antiviral polyphenol application deals with the use of hesperidin extracted from Citrus sinensis. The action mechanism of hesperidin relies on its binding to the key entry or spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the extraction, purification and recovery of polyphenols with potential antiviral activity, which are essential for virus replication and infection without side-effects, have been critically reviewed.","output":"Polyphenols and their potential role to fight viral diseases: An overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple safe and effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have been approved or authorized for use against the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The effectiveness of these and other intervention measures is threat-ened by the emergence of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We present a model for studying the transmission dynamics of two of these variants (Delta and Omicron) in the presence of vaccination, treatment of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease and the use of face masks in the community. The model was fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States corresponding to the period starting from when Omicron first emerged (end of November 2021) to date. It is shown, based on simulating the model with the current COVID-19 data, that the reproduction number of the Delta variant (denoted by [R]vd) is much smaller than one ([R]vd = 0.28), while that of Omicron (denoted by [R]vo) is approximately equal to unity ([R]vo = 0.96). This shows that the Delta variant has essentially died out, and that Omicron is currently the predominant variant of concern in the United States. Furthermore, if the current baseline levels of the control measures being implemented in the United States are maintained, the Omicron variant will also be on a rapid decline (towards elimination). The analysis and simulations of the calibrated model show that vaccine-derived immunity can be achieved in the United States if at least 68% of the population is fully-vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. It is shown that the COVID-19 pandemic can be eliminated in the United States by June of 2022 if the current baseline level of the proportion of individuals that is fully-vaccinated is increased by about 20%. The threshold vaccination coverage needed to achieve the vaccine-derived herd immunity decreases if the vaccination program is combined with a face mask use strategy, particularly one that emphasizes the use of moderate to high quality masks (e.g., surgical or N95 masks). Greater reduction in disease burden (in comparison to the baseline scenario) are recorded if the very high quality N95 masks are prioritized in the community, followed by the moderately-effective surgical masks and then the lowly-effective cloth masks. We also showed that having high percentage of the populace wearing the moderately-effective surgical mask is more beneficial to the community than having low percentage of the populace wearing the highly-effective N95 masks (this result does not hold for the case when cloth masks compliance is compared with that of N95 masks). However, if a certain (fixed) percentage is to give up masking, our study showed that it is more beneficial if they give up wearing surgical masks and not N95 masks (in other words, in a head-to-head comparison, N95 is always superior than surgical mask). This study showed that waning natural and vaccine-derived immunity (if considered individually) offer marginal impact on disease burden, except for the case when they wane at a much faster rate (e.g., within three months), in comparison to the baseline (estimated to be within 9 months to a year). Greater reduction or increase in disease burden is recorded if both the vaccine-derived and natural immunity wane at the same time (rather than the case when we considered only one of them varying, while the other is at baseline). For instance, if both vaccine-derived and natural immunity wane within three months, a 14% increase in the peak daily cases will be recorded, in comparison to the baseline. For this case, where immunity wanes within three months, our study predicts another (but milder) Omicron wave in the United States that peaks around July 2022 (with the peak 72% lower than the original Omicron peak). Under this (fast waning) scenario, our study suggests that a fourth dose of the two mRNA vaccines would need to be approved in the United States to aid and accelerate the prospect of SARS-CoV-2 elimination in 2022. It is shown that while the treatment of symptomatic individuals has marginal effect in reducing daily cases of SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the baseline, it has significant impact in reducing daily hospitalizations. It is further shown that, while treatment significantly reduces hospitalization, the prospects of COVID-19 elimination in the United States is more significantly enhanced if investments in control resources are focused on mask usage and vaccination rather than on treatment.","output":"Dynamics of the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States: the battle of supremacy in the presence of vaccination, mask usage and antiviral treatment"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/67.md","filePath":"drive/67.md"}'),R={name:"drive/67.md"},N=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,N as default};
